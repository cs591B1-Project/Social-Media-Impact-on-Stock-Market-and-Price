      "text": "By Gregory Wakeman 2 hours ago \nFed up of only being able to watch Netflix when you've got a good Wifi connection? Well the streaming website has decided to cut out the middle-man, because you're now able to download their content and then watch them when you're offline, and it doesn't cost you any extra, too. \nThis now means that you're able to keep on Netflixing on your computer, phones, and tablets while you're on a plane or during class. Actually, you definitely shouldn't do it during the latter, but you get what I mean. All you need to do to download these films is click a designated button on the details page for a film, which will then allow you to view it later at your own convenience, and without the internet. Game changer! \nThankfully Netflix has got a rather impressive selection of films that will now be just the click of a button away from you. To help you out, we here at CinemaBlend have compiled a terrific, eclectic list of 50 movies currently available on Netflix to get you started. These are not all the movies you can download right now, just a selection of 50 to get your started. You can peruse them below, and start downloading ASAP: \n13 Going On Thirty",

      "text": "By MICHAEL LIEDTKE\nAP Technology Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\n ",

      "text": "The Canadian Press - Nov 30, 2016 / 1:08 pm | Story: 182358 Photo: The Canadian Press \nNetflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favourite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\"''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when travelling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.",

Loading Slideshow... \nNetflix deployed the feature for its iOS and Android apps today , meaning that once you update your phone or tablet, you can start downloading episodes of The Crown and Narcos to get you through your next flight or trip anywhere with spotty wifi. \nWhile not everything that's streaming is available for download (non-Netflix productions require download rights from networks and studios), there seems to be a hefty selection that's collected in a separate menu on the app. A quick scroll reveals that The Office, Parks & Recreation, Freaks & Geeks, Pulp Fiction, Breaking Bad, Good Will Hunting, and The Twilight Zone are just some of the titles available for download. Things you download will also live in a list in the menu for reference. \nWhat are you downloading first?",

For example, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today.\" \nThe new feature is included in all Netflix plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. \nEarly reports suggested that Netflix would commit to an offline mode in order to compete with Amazon Prime Video, despite previously labelling it a \"short term fix for a bigger problem\" and saying it is \"never going to happen\". \nNetflix users have craved an offline mode for some time, which will enable them to watch more easily in areas with bad signal or during commutes. \nIt is thought that Netflix's decision to cave ties in with its expansion into territories with less stable internet signal. \nThe feature is already available to users - you just need to update your Netflix app to the most recent version. editors picks",

Netflix hide caption \ntoggle caption Netflix At no extra cost to the user, Netflix subscribers are now able to save select content to their iOS or Android devices.\nNetflix In the race for video streaming domination, Netflix surges forward. On Wednesday, Netflix announced and implemented in its latest update, the ability to download TV and movie titles on mobile devices.\nAt no extra cost to the user, Netflix subscribers will now be able to save select content to their iOS or Android devices, then watch on the go without the need for an Internet connection. Say goodbye to lackluster in-flight movies, Netflix is now airplane-mode compatible.\nAll Tech Considered What's Hot On Netflix? A Startup Aims To Track Ratings In The Streaming Age The move places Netflix in direct competition with iTunes and other services that offer video rentals and purchases for download.\nNetflix is not the first streaming service to offer offline viewing. Last year, Amazon Prime Video extended its download service to iPhones, iPads, and Android devices after offering it exclusively for the Amazon Fire Tablet.\nThe rise of Netflix, and its over 86 million subscribers , has been a force to compete with. Content providers are scrambling to stay relevant in its wake. In 2015, HBO and Showtime introduced standalone streaming services, offering cord-cutters access to premium content without a cable package.\nHowever, what makes Netflix so attractive is the amount of content for the dollar spent. HBO Now begins at $14.99 a month. Showtime can be an add-on to a Hulu or Amazon subscription or at a standalone monthly price of $10.99. While Netflix's basic monthly package begins at $7.99, and the premium version is $11.99.\nArticle continues after sponsorship Television In The New 'Gilmore Girls,' Rory Gilmore Turns Out To Be A Bad Journalist Cable providers are trying to evolve as well. Also Wednesday, AT&T launched DirecTV Now , an Internet streaming service available on phones, tablets, computers, and streaming devices. In February 2015, Dish introduced Sling TV , which streams cable channels through the Internet.\nThe convenience of streaming TV and movies has led many people to cut the cord. Hulu subscribers are willing to pay for the most up-to-date episodes and movies, and sit through 90-second adds every few minutes. While there is a premium Hulu service which does not include commercial breaks, the \"No Commercial Plan\" does not apply to popular shows such as Scandal , Grey's Anatomy , and How to Get Away With Murder .\nAs Netflix paves the way for online streaming, you have to wonder what former Blockbuster executives are thinking now. It was 16 years ago that Blockbuster passed on purchasing the then DVD mailing service for only $50 million . Netflix is worth $50 billion. Blockbuster has just a handful of stores left .\nLaura Roman is the social media intern at NPR.",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access Associated Press Wednesday, November 30, 2016 Credit: The Associated Press In this Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, file photo, a person displays Netflix on a tablet in North Andover, Mass. Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) comments SAN FRANCISCO — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.",

      "text": " Whether you are on your morning commute or taking a flight across the country, many of your favorite TV shows and movies from <a href=\"/tag/netflix\"><strong>Netflix</strong></a> are now watchable without burning through your mobile data or high-priced WiFi access fees, thanks to the addition of offline playback. Just like YouTube and Google Play Movies, Netflix users can now cache titles they want to watch to their mobile device’s storage, then playback whenever is best for them. <span id=\"more-194216\"></span>\nAccording to Netflix, not all titles are available for this, but plenty are. For example, The Crown, Orange is the New Black, and Narcos are available, and plenty more are on the way. Additionally, this feature is available to all Netflix users, regardless of which package you are on.\nTo get started, grab the latest version of the Netflix app for Android or iOS.\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient\" target=\"_blank\">Play Link</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pasted-image-0.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-194219\" src=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pasted-image-0.png\" alt=\"pasted-image-0\" width=\"407\" height=\"723\" srcset=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pasted-image-0.png 507w, http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pasted-image-0-246x438.png 246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px\" /></a>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: right;\">Via: <a href=\"https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/downloads-make-it-even-easier-to-watch-netflix-on-the-go\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a></h6> </div>",

      "text": "Courtesy Netflix Stay on target You Can Finally Watch (Some) Netflix Videos Offline The First Full A Series of Unfortunate Events Trailer “I don’t think I’m ready to go down this rabbit hole,” said Tory Belleci in the first trailer for White Rabbit Project , a show that I hope features at least one Alice in Wonderland reference per episode.\nThe trailer, which was released Monday, shows Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara teaming up once again for the new Netflix series, which works as an extension of their work on Mythbusters .\nThe synopsis says the team will be ranking “history’s greatest inventions, heists and more.” From the trailer, we can see that the trio will be touching upon at least one prison escape, an airplane heist (most likely the D.B Cooper hijacking), and a lot of drinking.\nOther things to look out for: explosions, ridiculous weapons, crazy costumes, and even more explosions. It’s like Mythbusters never left.\nThe final season of Mythbusters was sad for a number of reasons, including the fact it had been on for over a decade by that point, but it was also missing the Build Team. Byron, Belleci, and Imahara were let go by the network in 2014 due to money disputes and as a way to keep the show fresh after ratings were dropping .\nEven as the team was on the way out, hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman wished them the best.\n“It has been a total pleasure not only to work with you but to call you our friends,” Savage said, “We wish you the very best of luck and thank you.”\nSavage sent his regards to the team on Twitter following the trailer announcement.\nI can't wait to check White Rabbit Project out. Congrats to @KariByron @ToryBelleci and @grantimahara ! @netflix https://t.co/6BvOHmrjkP\n— Adam Savage (@donttrythis) November 28, 2016\nWhite Rabbit Project will premiere on Netflix on Dec. 9. As is Netflix tradition, all episodes of the first season will be available.",

      "text": "Stay on target The First 'White Rabbit Project' Trailer Drops The First Full A Series of Unfortunate Events Trailer Considering how much battery watching Netflix on your smartphone or tablet consumes, I often see people catching up on shows on the subway–until we go underground and they have to turn it off.\nA Netflix offline downloads feature has been requested by subscribers for years (both Amazon Prime and YouTube Red have offline modes), and now it’s finally happening thanks to a new free update.\nThe feature is easy to use. When online, you can hit a new download button next to, for example, an episode of a show you’re watching so you can watch it later without an internet connection.\nYou don’t need an extra plan to use it. Offline downloads will be available to all plans and on Android and iOS devices. Customers can update their app now and as long as they’re on iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later, they can begin downloading.\nEddy Wu, Director of Product Innovation, wrote in a company blog post that a few titles are already available for download, including Netflix originals Orange is the New Black , Narcos , and The Crown , and popular series like Supernatural and The Flash , and more will be on the way soon. The app update includes a new menu that shows what’s available for download.\nBasically, Netflix has made it super easy to continue binge watching whatever the latest trending show is even when you’re, for example, on a plane for six hours and don’t want to pay for pricey WiFi.\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Wong wrote.\nWatch the official announcement video below.\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8\n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016",

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "title": "Netflix's offline viewing mode was inevitable",
      "text": "The ability to finally download Netflix videos came as a surprise this morning. After all, it's the same company that just a few years ago said that offline support was \" never going to happen .\" But recently, Netflix's tone started changing. Back in April, CEO Reed Hastings said it would \"keep an open mind\" about the feature. And earlier this month, chief content office Ted Sarandos noted that it might be necessary for international markets . And if you really think about it, there are plenty of reasons why Netflix couldn't avoid offline viewing any longer.\nUsers genuinely need it There's a reason Netflix subscribers have been demanding offline support. It's becoming all but a necessity, and that's largely Netflix's fault. It's turned on-demand video into a drug, and now we need our fix wherever possible, be it on the subway or a plane. Offline support will also be useful for people who don't have lots of mobile data to waste on streaming video.\nIn a strange way, it also seems like a fitting feature to debut after the \"Netflix Vista\" spoof ad, a Black Mirror tie-in which showed people ignoring the beauty of the world around them in favor of watching Netflix directly in their eyes. That ad tries to push people to get out and live their lives, but in reality Netflix is making it easier than ever to ignore everything so you can catch up on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (which you should totally watch).\nAmazon has been doing it for years If you're not a media addict, you probably didn't know that Amazon has been letting its Prime customers download streaming videos for years. At first, offline viewing was exclusive to Fire tablet owners, but last year Amazon opened it up to iOS and Android devices as well. Amazon has, for some reason, done a poor job of marketing the feature (so much so that a few of our editors didn't even know it existed). It's also annoying to set up if you're on Android, since it involves downloading Amazon's app store just to grab the Prime Video app.\nIf you haven't used it, Amazon's offline mode works a lot like Netflix's version: There's a choice selection of shows and films you can download, and there's also a time limit for how long you can keep content (there still has to be a reason for you to buy them, after all). It's a particularly great way to catch up on Amazon's original series (check out Transparent , Bosch and Mozart in the Jungle ), but you can also download some shows and films from other studios as well.\nAmazon is usually tight-lipped about metrics, but analysts estimate that there are currently between 54 and 69 million Prime members in the US. They also estimate around 60 percent of those subscribers actually watch Prime Video content at least once a week. Netflix, in comparison, has 47 million members in the US and 86 million globally. With more original content and better licensing deals heading to Amazon (it's scored plenty of new films and TV deals), Netflix can't afford to sit back and let a major competitor outdo it feature wise, as well. It's hard to say if Amazon's offline support directly influenced Netflix's decision, but I'd wager it had some weight.\nIt's an easy way to entice new subscribers and boost viewership Netflix has done a remarkable (one could describe it as frightening) job of filling up our free time at home. It helped make \"binge-watching\" a reality, and at this point Netflix streaming accounts for more than a third of US internet traffic during prime time. But where does it go from here? So far, its price hikes haven't affected subscriber growth , but who knows how long that'll last. It's also spending even more money on original content , and subscribers continue to criticize its inadequate film library.\nBy offering offline support at no extra cost, Netflix has an easy way to convince even more people to sign up. And, perhaps even more importantly, it could serve as a way to keep current subscribers onboard. And depending on how much people actually use the feature, it could also lead to significant viewership growth for all of its content. That could end up being useful when it needs to woo investors or potential content partners.\nAnd yes, it's necessary for international expansion Netflix has already made this point pretty clear, but it's one worth considering further. It's true, that as the company expands to areas where internet access is spotty, it'll need some way to ensure people can actually watch videos without interruption. Netflix will also be competing against other services in those markets that might offer downloads and cheap bootlegs. And, as usual, Netflix will have to deal with the omnipresent specter of piracy. If it doesn't offer its own legal downloads, the pirates win.",

      "text": "When Is Netflix's Offline Mode Available? Netflix Just Vastly Improved Your Holiday Travel With Offline Streaming — Available Now! November 30, 2016 by Kelsey Garcia 17 Shares \nAfter recently revealing its plans for an offline streaming mode , Netflix has officially made it possible for users to download content and view it at a later time when WiFi is unavailable. Though Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos had originally said the option wouldn't be available in the United States for some time, Netflix just confirmed that it is now available. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nAs the above tweet suggests, offline playback is perfect for traveling or commuting. To access it, simply download the latest updated version on your Android or iOS device, select the program you want to save for later, and hit the download button located next to the play button. According to Netflix, you can download either a standard or higher-quality version, which differ in download time and storage size. \nAt the moment, the feature's one caveat is that only certain shows and films are available to download. Said programs include classic movies like Pulp Fiction , shows such as Mad Men , and original Netflix shows like Stranger Things and The Crown , for example. Related:",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires Internet access 11/30/2016 - 5:31 PM EST \nSAN FRANCISCO >> Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service.   \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" \"House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. \\",

The comedy-drama has been picked up for Seasons 5, 6 and 7. (File photo) \nVideo streaming pioneer Netflix Inc. said its subscribers would now be able to download popular shows such as \"Orange is the New Black\" and \"Narcos\" on their mobile devices at no extra cost. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post. \nNetflix, whose other popular original shows include \"House of Cards\" and \"The Crown,\" has expanded into almost all countries, with China being a notable exception. \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS platforms, the company said. \nMore content will be available for offline viewing later, Netflix said. \nThe company's shares rose 2 percent to $119.97 in early trading on the Nasdaq.

ADVERTISEMENT Netflix unveils download feature for offline binge-watching Lucas Shaw Bloomberg Richmond Times-Dispatch \nNetflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers. \nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world's largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as \"The Crown\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" at first, according to a statement Wednesday. \nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com . Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa. \nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, in a web post. \nnetflix ",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access Posted: Updated: PHOTO COURTESY: MGN ONLINE \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. The long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. Netflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. The new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. Netflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. Not all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. Downloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. The Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. Earlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. The change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. Netflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. The offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. Netflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. ",

For example, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today.\" Everything you need to know about Netflix's download-and-go content \nSadly, you won't be able to download Netflix's entire content library, just specific TV shows and movies. There is a huge selection of content for download, though, with major networks taking part. \nShows like Trailer Park Boys, Twilight Zone, Black Mirror, That 70's Show, Bojack Horseman, Stranger Things, Quantum Leap, House, House of Cards, Nurse Jackie, Dexter, Breaking Bad and many, many more are available to download. \nOnce you download the offline content, it's grouped into a handy section so you can easily find it. Interestingly enough, the Play Store says that the download feature \"is not available on all devices,\" so be sure to check before you update. \nCellular Data has to be turned off on the device and downloading is only available through Wi-Fi by default, but you can change this in the App Settings section. \nAs for the quality of the downloads, don't expect HD. I downloaded Black Mirror Season 3 Episode 2 - Playtest on my Nexus 6, which is 57 minutes, and it only racked up to 266 MB. Obviously the quality wasn't too amazing. \nYou can select two different quality types in the \"App Settings\" section of the Netflix App-- Standard Quality, which downloads faster and uses less storage but is also lower quality, and High Quality, which uses more storage, takes longer, but looks better. \nEven the High Quality downloads won't be in full HD, but this is actually a good thing, especially if you want to save data and need your content quick.",

      "text": "Last updated: 05:00 PM ET, Wed November 30 2016 Netflix Finally Answers Flyers' Prayers Doomed Brazilian Soccer Team Flight Reportedly Ran Out... Impacting Travel \nInflight Wi-fi has been with us for over a decade now, and since 2007, when Netflix began offering streaming movies and shows, passengers have longed for the day when we would be able to have our favorite shows on demand at all times. Well today, Netflix has finally given us that ability, and it’s completely independent of Wi-Fi availability on your flight. \nNetflix has announced that they have begun offering downloadable content to your portable devices, which means you can take your favorite shows or movies with you and not have to worry about whether your flight will have Wi-Fi that’s robust enough to make it work. This is truly huge news for travelers. \nOver the years, the biggest hurdle for Wi-Fi companies like Gogo and ViaSat has been getting enough bandwidth to the aircraft in order to offer streaming services. Video streaming is very bandwidth intensive, and can degrade the experience for other passengers who are just trying to upload or download documents or update their social media apps during the flight. Though both companies finally offer the capability of streaming Netflix on flights, there are currently less than 100 planes among the combined U.S. airline fleets that are equipped for that functionality. \nREAD MORE: 13 Netflix Options Perfect For The Traveler In Us All \nThough not as popular, Amazon Prime Video has been offering downloadable content for a while now, and I have put it to extensive use during my travels with great success. If I know I’ll be on a three-hour flight, I’ll download three hours’ worth of shows, or a movie that I haven’t seen before. Once you begin watching the show, you have 24 hours to finish it. I expect that Netflix will have a similar restriction in place. \nAirlines should also be jumping for joy at this news. Lackluster Wi-Fi has been among the biggest gripes from airline passengers, and in passenger surveys, many respondents have said they have switched airline allegiances based solely on Wi-Fi. Again, much of this frustration links back to the desire for streaming content. \nFor the low-cost airlines who offer no Wi-Fi or seat back entertainment system, it would be smart to coach passengers to download content before their flights. Several airlines do offer movies you can watch for a fee — but why pay an extra fee if you can bring shows with you that you’ve already paid for? \nThis is also good news if your flight is delayed, and you’re stuck in the terminal without any other entertainment. At most airports, the only thing on TV is CNN on a continuous loop. Netflix downloads will let you start your show while you’re waiting to board, and then finish it during your flight. \nThis is a blessing for parents as well. You can download a few episodes of your kids’ favorite shows to watch during the flight, or even later at the hotel, because the free Wi-Fi at hotels is often pretty lousy. There are so many possibilities! Netflix doesn't have their whole library available for download just yet, but this is only day one, and the options are very impressive. Go check it out and see for yourselves. All you need to do is make sure you have downloaded and installed the latest Netflix app for your device.",

      "text": "By Nick Venable 4 hours ago \nNetflix doesn't have to do much to get people around the world excited, as the streaming service provides more round-the-clock viewing entertainment than most other companies. It used to matter very much where consumers were located in order for 24/7 binge sessions to even be attempted, but now the game has been completely changed, and absolutely for the better. Netflix has finally announced it has started to allow its millions of subscribers to download content for offline viewing. I'm totally going watch Gilmore Girls ' \"Winter\" episode in Antarctica now, because I can. \nThankfully, the only waiting you'll be doing before downloading your first TV show (or movie) from Netflix will come as you're opening the app, since the big announcement coincided with millions of mobile devices updating to incorporate the app's new \"download\" option for each show and its episodes. (I won't get mad if you try it out, and you'll be welcomed with a new message if your device did indeed recently update.) Now, since this is just being rolled out today, it should be stated right away that you won't initially find the entirety of Netflix's TV and movies catalog available for download, though there are indeed many comedy specials and films already set, as well as original favorites like Narcos , Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black . This news got me feeling some kinda Pennsatucky way. \nOffline viewing is the rare area of the streaming world where Netflix was playing catch up, as streaming rival Amazon has allowed its Prime users to download TV series and movies for quite a while now. What's more, the streaming giant has actually been vocally against implementing offline viewing in the past, though there were signs earlier this year that things were possibly headed in this promised land of a direction. (This subscriber-drawing change was possibly used in justifying all the gigantic bags of money being dropped on projects like Dave Chappelle's new comedy specials.) Regardless of how the decision came to be, I'm happier than a Bluth in...well, the Bluths aren't very happy all that often. \nThere are a ton of great shows that have recently premiered on Netflix, not to mention everything showing up in the future, that audiences will love to save on their devices for a rainy, Internet-destroying day. For instance, the British royalty drama The Crown debuted earlier this month, as did the Brazilian thriller 3% . And we'll soon get to see the Mythbusters spiritual successor White Rabbit Project , the talk show Bill Nye Saves the World , the Green Gables-y drama Anne , the reboot for Lost in Space and much, much more. Before diving into the downloading, though, make sure you don't have any frivolous files taking up excess space on your mobile devices, like family pictures and songs you love. \nNow that you'll be able to basically secure access to just about anything in Netflix's library , you'll soon have no excuse for not having caught up with House of Cards or BoJack Horseman . To see what you'll be busy downloading next year, check out our 2017 schedule for the streaming service.

Meanwhile, there's news to share about this CNET show. by Bridget Carey Your video, \"Download Netflix shows to watch offline\"will   Download Netflix shows to watch offline: CNET Update About Video CNET Update: Download Netflix shows to watch offline 3:00 / November 30, 2016 \nNo Internet needed to binge your favorite Netflix shows. Meanwhile, there's news to share about this CNET show. Share (0) linkedin Transcript Netflix binge watchers, your biggest wish is finally coming true. You can now watch shows offline. Netflix's mobile app added an option for users to download films and TV shows in advance to be able to watch it later without an internet connection. That means if you're about to go on a trip or travel by plane, you can just predownload shows to watch anytime without worrying about data. But there's a catch. Not every show and movie can be viewed offline, but Netflix says many are included, such as its original series Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black and House of Cards. But just because it's a Netflix original doesn't mean it will work. The film The Little Prince can't be downloaded, at least not yet. And neither can some licensed shows and movies. Such as the BBC Sherlock. To tell if a show can be download in advance first, you have to update the app, it's available for iOs and Android. And then, look for an arrow symbol next to a title, that indicates it can be downloaded. There's also a new category on the Netflix app menu, called available for download, which lists all shows that can be viewed offline. And speaking of shows, I have some big news about this show. After five years this will be the final episode of CNET Update. But dear fans, don't be distraught. You'll still find me everyday on CNET dishing out tech news. I'm just no longer confined to this little spacey, future world backdrop, even though I shall miss it It's pointy edges and colors. Several of us on the CNet team will be giving you daily breaking news reports, and it also gives me the ability to do some bigger reporting projects for CNet, so stay tuned to see what's in store. And a big thank you also, goes out to our awesome update fans. To give this a proper sendoff, we of course, have to play a mashup of some of the best moments throughout the years.

      "text": "\nYour prayers to the Netflix Gods have been answered – starting today, the online streamer is rolling out the option to download videos to watch offline across Android and iOS devices.\nArguably one of the most-requested features from users, a post from Netflix’s Director of Product Innovation, Eddy Wu, reveals that subscribers will be able to download “many” TV shows and movies, including some of the company’s high-profile originals: House of Cards , Stranger Things , Orange is The New Black , Narcos , and lavish period drama The Crown . The ability to watch content offline will come at no additional cost, and will be available on all monthly content plans worldwide from today. It’s currently limited to compatible smartphones and tablets, though we’ll keep you posted should the streaming giant expand offline viewing to laptops and other devices.\nPer Netflix: “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.”\nWith an estimated $6 billion worth of original content planned for 2017, the ability to view Netflix content offline couldn’t have arrived at a better time, and brings the company in line with streaming rival Amazon, which introduced offline viewing via the Amazon Instant Video app some time ago. Couple this with the increased competition from traditional broadcasters and their “over the top” streaming services and it’s small wonder why Netflix has been quick to introduce such a popular feature to stay ahead of the curve. And though it’s a welcome addition for subscribers across the board, it’ll be interesting to gauge whether the ability to download content will have much of a bearing on Netflix ‘s overseas user base, particularly those with no access to consistent, reliable Internet.\n",

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nNetflix subscribers can now stream without the hindrance that a poor internet connection -- and its mocking spinning red wheel -- brings.\nThe streaming entertainment giant (NFLX) said Wednesday it's rolling out a new feature allowing customers to download content, but then watch select films and series offline, meaning not limited to a cellular or internet connection for viewing.\nDon't miss:5 horrible money lessons from 'Gilmore Girls' (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-horrible-money-lessons-from-gilmore-girls-2016-11-25)\n(https://twitter.com/netflix/status/803962377997688832)\nAlso read:Netflix CEO wants to take over the world (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/can-netflix-achieve-its-goal-of-world-domination-2015-07-30)\nIncreasingly, consumers want the freedom to watch content on the go where cellular data and wireless internet connections can be spotty, at best. On the latest version of the Netflix app, for both Android and iOS devices, subscribers worldwide can download certain series and films with no added cost. The download feature is available across all of Netflix's plans starting Wednesday.\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" wrote Eddy Wu, Netflix's product innovation director, in a blog post.\nIt's not clear exactly which series and films are currently available, but Wu made sure to point out a few of Netflix's originals that are, including \"Orange is The New Black,\" \"Narcos\" and \"The Crown.\" More are on the way, he added.\nCheck out:Netflix's new show 'The Crown' ushers in a new era of content spending (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-is-pouring-money-into-some-of-tvs-most-expensive-shows-2016-09-28)\nNetflix says downloading content and streaming it consumes similar amounts of data, but it still suggests a data-saving Wi-Fi connection when downloading. Subscribers have the option to download in standard video quality, which takes up less storage space and time, or higher quality, which takes more space and time.\nThe stock fell 0.4% Wednesday. It has edged up 2.3% year to date, while the S&P 500 index has gained 7.6%.\n-Trey Williams; 1726ET\n ",

      "text": "Netflix Inc. will now allow users to download shows and movies to their smartphones and tablets to watch when they’re offline, the company said Wednesday.\nThe Los Gatos, Calif., video streaming firm said the download function is available for both iOS and Android operating systems, for a mix of original and licensed content.\nNetflix said many popular movies and series are already available for download, including its original shows “Orange is the New Black” and “The Crown.”\nUsers have long clamored for a download option that would allow them to watch Netflix content in areas with poor or costly connectivity — aboard an airplane in flight, for instance. But with increased competition from Amazon Prime Video, which unveiled a download button last year, Netflix may have decided that now was the time, said Paul Verna, senior analyst at EMarketer.\n“Amazon is definitely encroaching on Netflix’s turf,” he said. “It doesn’t seem like something that requires a tremendous investment on their part to enable, so I guess at a certain point they decided, ‘Why not.’”\nBesides garnering some amount of goodwill from customers, Netflix may also benefit from the data it can gather from users of the new feature.\n“I’m sure they’ve analyzed the implications of what it means for one of their customers to download a show versus stream it,” Verna said. “Whatever those implications are, it must be valuable data to them.”\nShares of Netflix were up $1.51, or 1.2%, to $119.02 in Wednesday morning trading.\nCaption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Donald Trump has made a number of key cabinet decisions , Nancy Paulikas went into a bathroom at LACMA on Oct. 15, then she vanished , President-elect Donald Trump pledged to protect Medicare, but his choice for health secretary has other ideas , and Regina Bejarano was looking to leave San Bernardino, but tragedy struck.\nDonald Trump has made a number of key cabinet decisions , Nancy Paulikas went into a bathroom at LACMA on Oct. 15, then she vanished , President-elect Donald Trump pledged to protect Medicare, but his choice for health secretary has other ideas , and Regina Bejarano was looking to leave San Bernardino, but tragedy struck.\nCaption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Donald Trump has made a number of key cabinet decisions , Nancy Paulikas went into a bathroom at LACMA on Oct. 15, then she vanished , President-elect Donald Trump pledged to protect Medicare, but his choice for health secretary has other ideas , and Regina Bejarano was looking to leave San Bernardino, but tragedy struck.\nDonald Trump has made a number of key cabinet decisions , Nancy Paulikas went into a bathroom at LACMA on Oct. 15, then she vanished , President-elect Donald Trump pledged to protect Medicare, but his choice for health secretary has other ideas , and Regina Bejarano was looking to leave San Bernardino, but tragedy struck.\nCaption Curiosity Correspondent: What does it take to be a zookeeper?

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.",

      "title": "Netflix (NFLX) finally allows downloads with its rollout of offline viewing — Quartz",
      "text": "Glass November 30, 2016 \nNetflix will finally allow users to download shows for offline viewing, the company announced in a tweet and blog post today. \nLong averse to offline viewing, Netflix started coming around to the idea earlier this year. In November, chief content officer Ted Sarandos acknowledged that the feature would benefit subscribers in developing countries with lower rates of broadband-internet penetration. “In those countries, they have adapted their behaviors to be much more of a downloading culture,” he told CNBC. \nNetflix competitor Amazon Video has allowed subscribers to download content since last year , and as Netflix expands into nearly every country on Earth , offline viewing has become necessary to stay competitive in emerging markets. It’s quite a shift in strategy from just two years ago, when the company said offline viewing was “ never going to happen .” \nThe new feature will apply to all global subscribers, not just those in new markets. There are two caveats, however. Downloading is, for now, restricted to iOS and Android devices . And only a select number of shows and films will be available for offline viewing. After you update to the latest version of the Netflix app, click “Available for Download” in the drop-down menu to see the list of shows that you can watch offline. \nFrequent fliers and subway commuters around the world will surely appreciate the ability to binge-watch without an internet connection. Just remember to download everything before your trip. Read full story ",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) – Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,” ”House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage – access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\n \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.\n",

This opportune product placement, which appeared in the first episode of the \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" Netflix revival, might explain why. A screenshot of a still frame in Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" A Tim Hortons original blend ground coffee bag is circled in red next to a box of Lipton tea. \nYes, that's a one pound bag of Western New Yorkers' favorite coffee brand in Luke's Diner at Stars Hollow. This scene appears about 20 minutes into the first episode. \nIn the fourth episode, \"Fall,\" Luke (played by Scott Patterson) can be seen brewing Tim Hortons coffee. A screenshot of a still on Netflix which shows Luke (Scott Patterson) brewing Tim Hortons coffee. \nRelated: ",

However, the company previously stated mobile companies would \"advance to the point that you'd have no disconnected moments.\" Netflix are announcing downloads for offline viewing. GLOBALLY. — Scott Bryan (@scottygb) November 30, 2016 \nWhile Netflix continues to change the way their users stream entertainment, they also continue to compete with rival Amazon Prime, who's video service has already offered offline viewing. \nNetflix has said more downloadable shows and movies are on the way.Netflix says all material available for download will have a white download arrow next to the title. #NetflixOffline IS HAPPENING, EVERYBODY. Finally, 2016 did something good for human beings. THANK YOU @Netflix . https://t.co/7cq9ZSdr9L — Adam MS (@Muh_Sadam) November 30, 2016 Most Popular Stories Most Popular Stories More>>",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access Michael Liedtke, Ap Technology Writer Updated 5:51 pm, Wednesday, November 30, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. The long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. Netflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. The new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Netflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. Not all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. Downloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. The Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. FILE - In this Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, file photo, a person displays... Netflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. Earlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. The change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. Netflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. The offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. Netflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. Latest News",

      "text": "Photo: Saeed Adyani / Courtesy of Netflix \nMANY SPOILERS AHEAD. \nBefore we really get into this, let me be crystal clear. This is not a full-throated, no-holds-barred defense of Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life , Amy Sherman-Palladino’s behemoth four-part Netflix reboot of her beloved early-aughts TV show. This is an attempt to try to understand the method behind the (mystifying, yet often delightful) madness. \nMy colleagues were not wrong to suggest that certain elements of the new miniseries made absolutely no sense , nor to acknowledge that the years have not been kind to Rory Gilmore, who left us in 2007 a starry-eyed Yale grad with a promising future as a political reporter, and who returns in 2016 a wayward, insolvent, burgeoning alcoholic trading on the glory of a single New Yorker Talk of the Town byline. \nNeither of my colleagues even went so far as to point out what I see as some of the biggest problems with the reboot: the terrible production values, the jarring transitions between plot lines, the fact that each of these episodes could have used a 30-minute haircut. \nSpeaking of hair: What is perched on top of Luke Danes’s head? A toupee? Hair plugs? A small mammal? How is it plausible that he has more going on up top now than he did nine years ago? \nThat follicular debacle is one of many loose ends never addressed by the Gilmore Girls reboot. But now that I’ve mentioned it, permit me to torture Luke’s hairpiece as a metaphor. Like our hero’s once receding hairline, now bolstered by an oddly perky tuft, the slender, dainty original episodes of Gilmore Girls have taken on some extra and rather ungainly baggage. The four ninety-minute chapters (some longer) that comprise A Year in the Life feel like four self-contained seasons of television, played in fast-forward by actors who popped a healthy quantity of uppers prior to filming. There’s something of the uncanny valley about the new show: The faces are (kind of) the same, and the relationships mostly are too. But the characters are all making bad decisions, and they’re doing so at turbo speed. The jokes are swifter, the references denser, the pace even more frenetic. This is Gilmore Girls in the age of anxiety. \nRory doesn’t just have boy problems; she’s got so many that there’s a running gag about Paul, the boyfriend she keeps forgetting she has. Lorelai’s midlife crises come fast and furious: No sooner is she consulting Paris Geller, now the “Pablo Escobar of the fertility world,” about hiring a surrogate to carry a Luke/Lorelai love child than she’s shipping off to California to hike part of the Pacific Crest Trail à la Cheryl Strayed. Down one Richard (RIP Edward Herrmann, who passed away in 2014), Emily, repressed as ever, is channeling her feelings into redecorating. The challenges are manifold: how to hang the newly commissioned, larger-than-life portrait of her late husband; where to put the new gigantic flat screen; or should she just Kondo her Hartford mansion and start anew? \nThe iconic Gilmore Girls image is the snow globe that appears in the reboot’s opening credits: A Year in the Life is sort of like if someone gave the snow globe a vigorous shake, and now its inhabitants can’t quite figure out which way is up. But even upended, even on speed, the new Gilmore Girls feels true to the spirit of the old Gilmore Girls. (In other words: What lies beneath Luke’s bad rug is still the same old stringy hair . . . okay, sorry Luke. You can sit down now.) And if you’ve forgotten, if time has recalibrated your memory of the off-kilter world of Stars Hollow, let me remind you: The spirit of Gilmore Girls has always been pretty weird. \nGilmore Girls , from the outset, presented something of a category challenge. It aired on The WB network (later The CW)—“niche broadcaster to horny mall rats,” a San Francisco Chronicle critic once quipped —home in the early aughts to anodyne tweeny offerings like One Tree Hill , Dawson’s Creek , and 7th Heaven . The soap opera of Rory’s tumultuous but wholesome love life fit right in. But the cozy, quirky insularity of small town Stars Hollow also made Gilmore Girls the Thirtysomething , the Friends , the Cheers of its generation. \nStill, at its core, Gilmore Girls was always far stranger than any of the shows I just mentioned. If I had to identify the series it most resembles, I’d say David Lynch and Mark Frost’s Twin Peaks . Sure, they seem like opposites: Twin Peaks is a gender-neutral cult-favorite, and Gilmore Girls a girly guilty pleasure (though this perception has always irked me as more than a little sexist). Other key differences: Twin Peaks centers on a grisly murder investigation and Gilmore Girls on an unusually warm mother/daughter relationship; Twin Peaks is based in the spooky Pacific Northwest, and Gilmore Girls i n the quaint Northeast. \nBut ( as this writer would agree ), the two have much in common: an obsession with good coffee; a number of cast members (the actresses who played Shelly Johnson and Audrey Horne both had arcs in the original Gilmore Girls ); an endless array of nonsensical subplots about charmingly idiosyncratic townspeople. Kirk and Babette and Gypsy and Taylor are only marginally more normal, after all, than the Log Lady, Nadine Hurley, and Pete Martell. Perhaps most important: Like Twin Peaks , Amy Sherman-Palladino’s universe has always operated according to its own logic. \nI saw even more Lynchian influence in this new edition of the show. When Emily Gilmore finds a post-Richard love interest, who is it but Ray Wise, the actor who played grieving father/possessed mad man Leland Palmer. When the town gathers for a film screening, they’re in for an old favorite: David Lynch’s Eraserhead , presented by Kirk in full Eraserhead costume. (“We’ve already seen it dozens of times,” grumble several members of the audience). \nOther connections are more abstract. When Rory stumbles upon a trio of Logan’s friends inexplicably dressed as Edwardian gorillas (this is by far the most poorly conceived fiasco in the six-plus-hour extravaganza), the spooky background beat recalls the music to which The Man From Another Place dances in Dale Cooper’s dreams. Emily’s new maid Berta speaks an incomprehensible Spanish-adjacent language: Could it, on second listen, be Twin Peaks’s reverse speech? \nI suspect that these Easter Eggs aren’t randomly planted. I think they’re there to mirror the central preoccupation of Gilmore Girls , the question of influence: Emily and Richard’s over Lorelai; Lorelai’s over Rory; Lorelai’s fears about her parents’ influence over her daughter; and the threat the influence of the outside world poses to the self-contained snow globe of a life that Lorelai built for her daughter and herself. \nIt’s also a show about inheritance and self determination: Are we fundamentally a product of our parents, doomed to become them in time? Or can we actually remake ourselves from whole cloth, as Lorelai attempted to do when she ditched Emily and Richard’s moneyed world in favor of teen motherhood and a job as a hotel maid? \nThese questions were the premise on which Gilmore Girls was built; The reboot perseverates about them in overdrive, refracting them through pop culture. The anxiety of influence is everywhere, though never more evident than when Lorelai makes the mystifying choice to go “do Wild ”—hike part of the Pacific Crest Trail—only to encounter a sea of women just like her, identically outfitted in Danner hiking boots, all, lemming-like, following someone else’s path to self-discovery (Best line: “I almost did Eat, Pray, Love , but my airline miles were blacked out”). Expand Stars Hollow: The Musical Photo: Saeed Adyani / Courtesy of Netflix \nIt’s elsewhere too. When Taylor writes a rap scene into Stars Hollow: The Musical , Lorelai is unusually offended. “Isn’t it way too Hamilton ,” she protests. “Doesn’t that make what we’re doing derivative?” Should Rory take on an assignment from GQ to write a think piece about the psychology of waiting in line? “David Wallace”—as in Foster Wallace—“would have nailed it, but so far we haven’t” warns a character meant to be real GQ editor Jim Nelson. In pursuit of that story, Rory goes with Lorelai to wait in line for the Crodocake, the next Cronut. “How does the old Cronut feel about that?” Lorelai asks. “Threatened,” Rory answers. \nAs this Year in the Life passes, real concerns rise more and more to the surface. Will Rory use the story of Gilmore Girls , her mother’s story, as the subject of her first book, making her future possibly at the expense of her past? (In case the stakes are not clear: “How does the old Cronut feel about that? Threatened”). Will Rory forge her own path—in Queens? In London? On the Internet?—or will she give up and settle into life as her mother’s daughter? \nSpoiler alert: By the end of the miniseries, our girl is reluctantly living at home in Stars Hollow, reluctantly running a local small business ( The Stars Hollow Gazette ), taking a.m. shots of whiskey with Jess (team Jess all the way, for the record), and, by the very end, pregnant and seemingly contemplating single motherhood. \nTo quote Lorelai: “Doesn’t that make what we’re doing derivative?” We’ll have to wait for Gilmore Girls: Another Year in the Life to find out. \nIn the meantime, in the now immortal words of fictional Jim Nelson, the same guy whose ill-begotten lines idea launched Rory on a collision course with a horny Wookiee who may or may not be the father of her unborn child: “Noodle it around a little bit.”",

      "text": "it's happening netflix downloads streaming streaming video offline viewing \nIt’s been whispered and buzzed about for a long time now, but it’s happening at last: Netflix says it will allow users to download select TV shows and movies to their mobile devices so they can watch them even when they’re not online. \nAlthough there were recent rumors that offline viewing might not come to U.S. subscribers , Netflix announced this morning that members worldwide will be able to download some content at no cost. \nTitles that are available for downloading will feature a download button on the details page. There are some streaming series and movies already available for offline viewing, including Netflix originals like Orange is The New Blac k, Narcos , and The Crown , “with more on the way,” Netflix says. \nThe new feature is available on all plans as well as any phones or tablets running on Android and iOS — you’ll just have to update your Netflix app to the most recent version. Thus far, the download option doesn’t seem to include downloads to a desktop computer or laptop. ",

      "text": "Email \nIt just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. \nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary , calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix ‘s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once.

      "text": "You are at: Home » Netflix » Now download and watch your favourite movies and shows offline on Netflix Now download and watch your favourite movies and shows offline on Netflix Netflix , Technology Netflix launches offline viewing for smartphones and tablets \nFinally, the wait for Netflix members is over! Netflix on Wednesday announced that select movies and shows are now available for download any time at no extra cost. The streaming media company confirmed in a tweet that members can now download their favourite programs instead of streaming through a broadband connection. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \n“Netflix members worldwide can now download in addition to stream great series and films at no extra cost,” Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, said in an announcement. “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nWhile Netflix did not provide information on how much content would be available offline, but it said that it was in discussion with copyright owners. \n“Netflix is working with lots of partners globally to get downloading rights for the bulk of the content on our service,” a statement emailed to CNNMoney said. \n“This is an ongoing effort as we know consumers want this capability and we are working to provide it.” \nCurrently, Originals Orange is The New Black, Narcos, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and The Crown, as well as popular shows like Bates Motel, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Suits, are available for offline playback via download. There are also plenty of popular non-Netflix shows like Parks and Recreation, The Office and Star Trek: The Next Generation. However, you cannot download everything. Shows like the new season of Friends, Gilmore Girls, and New Girl are restricted for now. \nThis is why Netflix now has an entire “Available for Download” section on its app so you can specifically browse content that can be watched without an Internet connection. The company plans to add more to the catalogue of available titles in the future. \n“Many of your favourite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you’re offline,” Wu added. \nThe new added feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. However, the feature is available only on Android and iOS smartphones and tablets, provided they are running iOS 8.0 or Android 4.4.2 or later as well as the latest update of Netflix’s app. \nFor more than a year now, Amazon Prime Video has been offering offline viewing to members on iOS and Android apps, while YouTube Red subscribers also have access to videos in offline mode. \nHere’s what you need to do watch show or movie offline on Netflix: \n• Select the show or movie you want to download on the Netflix app. • Scroll down and look for the “download” icon, an arrow pointed down. For a TV show, it will be placed next to the specific episode. For a movie, it will be located right under the plot description and cast. • Tap the download button. On the bottom of the screen, a progress bar will pop up that will inform you when the download is complete. • Now, just return to the app while you are offline and watch that movie or show without an Internet connection. Ensure that you have everything loaded up on your phone before you lose your connection.",

      "text": "As if Netflix weren’t already beasting the online video content game with its stellar original series and large catalog of movie selections, the entertainment company has raised the bar once again on Wednesday by introducing video downloads at no extra cost to its customer base. \nIn a statement on its website , the company said, “ While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nThe downloads feature is available on iOS and Android, and is included in all Netflix subscription plans. The company said that many of its streaming series and movie titles are already available for download, and more are on the way. \nStreaming services have allowed many people to cut the cord and get rid of their cable television subscriptions. Where Netflix come out ahead in that game is in the cost of its service. Plans range from $7.99 for the most basic service to $11.99 for service that includes HD and Ultra HD. Compare that to the pricing for the HBO Now standalone app which runs $14.99 per month. \nNetflix is not the first streaming service to offer offline video, but the move does make the service more competitive with iTunes, Google Play, and Amazon Prime, all of which offer video rentals and purchases for download. \nIn order to use the new service, Netflix users should make sure they have the most current version of the app on their device. \nRead more on the Netflix blog . \n",

      "text": "Home News Netflix Adds Offline Viewing For Its App On Android And iOS Netflix Adds Offline Viewing For Its App On Android And iOS Reported by Zara Ali Apps , Mobiles & Tablets , News Last Updated: December 1, 2016 at 12:49 am 0 \nNetflix has finally rolled out the much-awaited “offline viewing” feature for its iOS and Android app. The company has announced a list of movies and TV shows that will be up for offline download within the app. We can compare it to YouTube’s offline viewing that allows select videos to be downloaded for later viewing. \nEven though many movies and shows are not included for offline viewing, but Netflix promises to add more to the list. A new update for Netflix app on iOS and Android brings the Offline feature aboard. Users will be able to find the new “Available for Download” within the app’s menu. Once your download is complete, you can locate the file in the “My Downloads.” section in the app. \nThe easiest way to search if your show is covered under the offline viewing feature – just tap on the menu option in the app and then select “Available for Download”. You will then see a list of movies and shows that are compatible for offline viewing. Or you can just type the name of your favourite show or movie in the search bar, and if you see a downward arrow icon next to it, then it can be downloaded for offline viewing or vice versa. \nThe reason why Netflix couldn’t add everything is that the licensing restriction protects most of the shows and movies. It means that Netflix’s original movies and shows are most likely to make it to the list. \nWhat’s your take on Netflix’s much-awaited offline viewing feature?

      "text": "Netflix is finally letting users download videos for offline viewing Wednesday , November 30, 2016 - 2:16 PM Brian Fung, Washington Post \nNetflix will allow customers to download some shows and movies to their devices for offline viewing, fulfilling a long-standing request from users for easier access to their favorite video content. \nThe streaming-video provider said Wednesday that hit shows such as “Orange Is the New Black,”“Narcos” and “The Crown” will be among the first series that customers can download. The feature is available now as an update to the Netflix app on phones and tablets powered by Android and iOS, the company said. \nOnly some types of content will support downloads at first, but more will be added in the future. And all Netflix users worldwide can take advantage of the new capability, regardless of what plan they have. \nAlthough Netflix has been partnering with some airlines to provide access to streaming content, the download feature means customers can finally take their own viewing profiles on the go or where there is no Internet access. \nCustomers have long clamored for such a feature, and Netflix executives previously said it was “never going to happen.” But in April, chief executive Reed Hastings said the company would “keep an open mind” about it as the company’s international growth forced it to grapple with limited connectivity in some areas. \nA few months later, rumors surfaced suggesting that a plan was in the works. And now, it appears that Netflix has relented, giving its customers what they had wanted. \n\n(c) 2016, The Washington Post. \n\n ",

      "text": "Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock  41PM PT \n  spoke out in support of the FCC’s network neutrality policy Wednesday as speculation swirls that the policy could be repealed during the presidency of Donald Trump . \n“This is an unpredictable new administration, for sure,” said Sarandos at the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce’s state of the entertainment industry conference in Los Angeles. “The decision to preserve net neutrality that President Obama came to was based on the public good. It’s politically popular. It serves the public good.” \nSarandos’ comments follow weeks of speculation that the Trump administration could engineer a reversal of the FCC’s policy on network neutrality, which prevents Internet service providers like Comcast from favoring or impeding the streams that flow through its distribution pipes from content providers like Netflix. \nSarandos also questioned the motives of future FCC commissioners. “Some of the people that are being batted around for FCC — people are concerned that they have personal interest in not having net neutrality,” he said. “It’s a really inefficient way to advance your personal initiatives to get into government. You can be much more effective outside.” \nSarandos didn’t specify which potential appointees he was referring to but he was alluding to economists Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, who Trump recently tapped to review FCC policies as part of the president-elect’s transition team. Both men, who have worked as consultants to Verizon and Sprint, respectively, have publicly opposed network neutrality and are reportedly to be under consideration for FCC commissioners under a Trump administration. Trump hasn’t spoken out recently against network neutrality, though he tweeted criticism of President Obama over it years ago. \nNetflix is among several tech giants that have been vocal proponents of network neutrality in the past in order to prevent ISPs from either degrading the company’s streams or giving preferential treatment to other streaming services. CEO Reed Hastings has taken on ISPs like AT&T and Comcast, to whom Netflix could find itself shouldering increased payments known as interconnection fees if network neutrality has repealed. \nWhile other analysts have suggested there is some upside for Netflix in such a scenario such as reduced competition from other content providers, fears on Wall Street of a negative impact sent the Los Gatos, Calif.-based company’s stock down in the weeks after the election, while share prices for cable ISPs rose. \nEarlier this year, a federal appeals court upheld the rules pushed through by current FCC commissioner Tom Wheeler classifying broadband providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act). But Wheeler may not stick around during the Trump administration, which could reclassify ISPs under Title I or make other moves that would essentially neuter net neutrality. \nWho will be joining the FCC next year is unclear until Wheeler discloses his plans, which is factoring into delays in the confirmation of another FCC commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel. \nSarandos made his comments in a keynote interview with Variety   at the conference, where he was presented with the Chamber of Commerce’s “Commitment to California” award. \nThe executive also talked about Netflix’s strategy as a studio, given their planned expansion into 1,000 hours of programming for 2017, as compared to its competition. He emphasized that the studio won’t be creating series for any other outlet. \n“We’re not going to build out the Netflix studio to make content for other people,” he said. “We’re going to build it as an internal efficiency in how to make the best shows for Netflix for our subscribers around the world.” \nSarandos argued that the usual practice of studios creating series for others was an inherent conflict. “We’re not looking not to make shows we don’t own,” he said, “[But] we want to buy the content that is the best storytelling.” One example of that is the recent series “Gilmore Girls,” which is owned by Warner Bros. TV. \nAt the event, Sarandos was presented with the award by Drew Barrymore, star of Netflix’s upcoming series “The Santa Clarita Diet,” for its upcoming move to expansive new office space in Hollywood in January. “We’re not just going to live and work here. We’re going to shoot here,” said Sarandos. \nHe reported the streaming service has filmed 10 features and 16 scripted series in California this year. “Beyond tax credits, the reason we like to do it is the magic,” he said. “The notion that when you call out for talent, most of the people that are going to be ready with a great experience, you’re much assured of that in Hollywood.” \nBarrymore praised Netflix for offering her the opportunity to film in her home state. “It was the best writing I’d seen in so long, and you brought me back to California,” she said of the series. “And you built your studios here!” Filed Under:",

      "text": "Lorelai Gilmore Share this article \nSince Gilmore Girls: A Year in a Life was released on Netflix last week, fans all over the world have been trying to make sense of the crazy ending. We've seen theories that Rory and Jess actually slept together or that Rory is carrying the baby for Lorelai , but up until now we really haven't seen anything that discusses how crazy everything else that happened is. \nWell, Glamour has brought a fan theory to our attention that runs the gamut. TreeHugBookLove , a Reddit user and clearly a very enthusiastic GG fan, believes that throughout all four episodes, Lorelai is actually in a coma and everything that happens is actually just a dream. Yup. Let that sink in for a second. \nIf you look back at the revival, many of our favorite characters are exhibiting personality traits that are a bit different from what we remember. For example, our beloved Emily Gilmore is wearing JEANS, and Rory is even having ONE NIGHT STANDS with men dressed in Wookiee costumes. Well, TreeHugBookLove thinks all of this is because, as they explain it, shortly after \"Season 7, Lorelai was in a car accident (this is supported by the numerous times her shitty car was mentioned throughout the show, it could have easily broken down while she was driving causing her to hit a tree) and unfortunately ended up in a coma.\" And it only gets better. \nThen, after Lorelai is in the coma, she starts to have some crazy dream-like hallucinations (because of the meds, of course) where she \"has a skewed perception of the world, believing that Emily is 100% irrational and Rory is immature and sex-obsessed.\" And that's not all. Some of the scenes in the revival are not happening IRL but are actually versions of people coming to visit her at the hospital in order to try and help her get better. For example, \"Kirk plays his experimental movie, Taylor plays a musical about Stars Hollow to inspire her to return to her hometown, Luke jokingly plays the film Wild because he knows Lorelai was at a turning point in her life and he likes the outdoors.\" So all of those scenes in the show are actually just what is going on in her head. \nAnd then, to make sense of the final scene, good ol' TreeHugBookLove says that it's actually just Lorelai dying. Morbid, we know. The Reddit user writes that \"Rory, being Lorelai's Healthcare Power of Attorney, has decided to give the doctors permission to try a new experimental medication, which ends the coma and Lorelai's life: the manic joyful wedding scene followed by the shocking 'last four words' is her body and mind's reaction to the end, imagining her own legacy.\" \nWelp. Whatever you say, TreeHugBookLove. We applaud your creativity, but we are going to side with RandomRedditGuy_ on this one. You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history.\nMost popular Review: Natalie Portman lost as ‘Jackie’ 7 reasons why ‘This Is Us’ hits home Reports: Kanye West to be hospitalized indefinitely Billy Joel to guest star on ‘Kevin Can Wait’ McConaughey gives college students golf-cart ride home Netflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nTV 16 Christmas-themed TV episodes on Netflix Not all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline.\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nMovies What to watch now on Netflix The change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\n@Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Netflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\nSign up for Newsday's Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs, TV and more.\nsign up",

      "text": "netflix offline viewing on the go download More ‘Tis the season for oversized meals, oversized sweaters, and now, oversized quantities of Netflix. That’s because the streaming service has now made it possible for users to “download in addition to stream great series and films at no extra cost.” That’s right — you can now watch Netflix offline, as long as you remember to hit that little download button on the details page before heading off to a Wi-Fi-less land.\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” wrote Eddy Wu, Director of Product Innovation at Netflix. But now, you don’t have to depend on a Wi-Fi connection in order to enjoy your favorite pastime.\nNetflix has been hinting at the possibility of such a feature for quite some time now, with Netflix CEO Reed Hastings suggesting during the company’s first-quarter earnings call that offline viewing could be on the horizon. And now, he’s made good on that suggestion.\nnetflix offline viewing on the go More netflix offline viewing on the go More netflix offline viewing on the go More netflix offline viewing on the go More Read More netflix offline viewing on the go More netflix offline viewing on the go More “Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline,” Wu continued. “For example, Orange is The New Black , Narcos and The Crown are available for download today.”\nMore : LeEco, the ‘Netflix of China,’ ramps up U.S. push by offering products at retailers\nThe best part is that Netflix hasn’t limited this feature to just some subscription tiers — rather, regardless of what plan you may have, you can start downloading and watching offline today. If you’ve got an Android or iOS device, offline viewing is now a possibility.\nThere are some stipulations, of course. As mentioned above, Netflix’s own series are the first to be available for download, and it’s not yet clear how many titles outside of Netflix’s own creation will be available. The service is also currently limited to mobile devices and won’t work on a laptop, so those who want to watch a larger screen will need to do so on a tablet. Still, this is a major move for the service, especially for those in areas where high-speed internet is hard to come by.\nYou will, of course, have to update the Netflix app on your device to the latest version in order to take advantage of the new feature, but that hardly seems like a steep price to pay for binge watching your favorite programs just about anytime, anywhere. So consider this an early holiday present from Netflix.\nNetflix 4K streaming hits Windows 10 PCs — but only those with Intel ‘Kaby Lake’ CPUs PlayOn Cloud is a DVR for streaming services like HBO Now, Amazon Video Time to kill?

      "text": "Netflix Introduces Offline Viewing on Selected Titles Available on iOS and Android devices. By Michael Passalacqua \nNetflix will now let you download select titles for offline viewing on iOS and Android devices. \nThe new feature will be offered at no additional cost and can be used by clicking on the download button on the details page of select titles. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation. A look at the new feature, via Netflix Although a full list of titles with the download feature wasn't given, Netflix did reveal that popular shows like the aforementioned Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, Narcos, and The Crown are all available for download today, with \"more on the way.\"\nThe service didn't shed light on when new downloadable titles will be available, or whether eventually all its content will be available on the move. \nIn the past, Netflix has been against offline viewing capabilities for users, but expressed interest in the feature earlier this year. Amazon Prime Video has offered offline viewing since last year. \nMichael Passalacqua is a freelance writer for IGN. Chat with him on Twitter about the New York Giants’ unsurprising mediocrity.",

      "text": "FILE - In this Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, file photo, a person displays Netflix on a tablet in North Andover, Mass. Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) More SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.",

      "text": "Video Content Editor for Film School Rejects/One Perfect Shot, Novelist. Tweets @hperryhorton 16 mins ago Joaquin and Gus — Together Again, Netflix Goes Offline, and Wes Anderson Directs The VVitch The day’s top headlines in bite-size portions. M ore than 20 years after they first worked together on the ripped-from-the-headlines erotic thriller To Die For, Joaquin Phoenix and director Gus Van Sant are re-teaming (possibly) for the film Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Too Far On Foot , the story of real-life cartoonist John Callahan who was left paralyzed after a car crash at the age of 21. Callahan first started drawing as a form of therapy before turning it into a controversial career that led to many a boycott in his hometown of Portland, Oregon. I lived in Portland for a decade; it’s not that difficult to get a boycott aimed your way, but Callahan was a particular master at it, dealing in taboo subjects with black humor that pissed in the flax flakes of many a young white urbanite. A planned film adaptation of his autobiography has been in the works for decades, first brought up in the late 80s when Robin Williams wanted to portray Callahan, but it looks like it’s going to take another Portlander, Van Sant, to finally get it off the ground. The director and Phoenix have been looking to work together again for a number of years now, and nearly did on Sea of Trees (which ended up going to Matthew McConaughey), but this feels like a much better fit — especially where Phoenix is concerned — than that other project, which by all accounts is really, really bad. Nothing’s etched in stone just yet, but all signs are this is a go. Phoenix will next appear as Jesus in Mary Magdalene, and Van Sant recently shot When We Rise , an ABC miniseries documenting the LGBTQ civil rights movement from Milk screenwriter Dustin Lance Black. Variety had the exclusive. If you’re on the Netflix mobile app today, you might notice something new and amazing: a download button. That’s right, ‘Flix fans, after years of hearing our pleas, the streaming service has finally acquiesced and made programming available for offline viewing on mobile devices. Not everything is available, but a good chunk of stuff is, including several Netflix original programs like Orange is the New Black, Narcos, Stranger Things, Master of None, The Crown, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and House of Cards. This means the next time you fly, you can still visit the Upside Down without getting charged through the nose for mid-air wifi. There’s a menu on the mobile app that will tell you what’s available for download, and expect more titles to be added soon. A couple quick technical notes: if you’re an Apple user, you’ll need iOS 8.0 or later to download and view, and if you’re on Android, 4.4.2 is required, plus the latest version of the Netflix app. For more on the subject, dig what our own Jacob Oller has to say right here . A nd lastly today, we’re going to leave you smiling thanks to the fine folks at CineFix who created this trailer imagining what Robert Eggers’ The VVitch would look like if it was “a New England folk tale” written by Roman Coppola and directed by Wes Anderson, the team behind The Darjeeling Limited and Moonrise Kingdom . It’s funny what a little change of music and title cards can do, and by funny I mean utterly hilarious. If you link this, there’s a bonus link below the video: X-Men as directed by Wes Anderson. Same gag, same big laughs.",

      "text": "By Emily Yahr , The Washington Post\nThe opening scene in the third episode of Netflix’s new “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” features Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel) sitting by a pool in Stars Hollow, doing their usual quick banter. But the snappy dialogue turns obnoxious as they start mocking their fellow poolgoers.\n“Belly alert,” Lorelai mutters as an overweight man passes by. “Holy moly,” Rory echoes. They scoff at a woman in a bikini (“Just go naked”) and then dub a heavy man in a Speedo “Back Fat Pat.” Meanwhile, people drop by to welcome Rory back to town, since she moved home after a rough patch in her journalism career. “I’m not back!” she repeatedly whines to her well-wishers, even though it sure looks like she’s back for good.\nRelated Articles November 27, 2016 The ‘Gilmore Girls’ final four words: Did you hate or love them? November 18, 2016 The “Gilmore Girls” revival is far from perfect, but — luckily for Netflix — fans won’t care October 3, 2016 Gilmore Girls’ Luke’s Diner taking over Colorado coffee shops on Wednesday July 27, 2016 No spoilers, but ‘Gilmore Girls’ star says chemistry is back The scene exemplifies the worst parts of “Gilmore Girls,” the acclaimed WB series that ran from 2000 to 2007: Lorelai and Rory’s banter that could turn cruel and grating; Rory’s blindness to her unbelievable privilege; the main characters simply thinking they’re better than everyone else. Already, viewers are calling out this particular scene: “The ‘Gilmore Girls’ Fat-Shaming Scene Was Unnecessary.”\n“About The Body-Shaming On ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.'”\n” ‘Gilmore Girls’ fans are dragging the revival for its ‘cringe-worthy’ fat-shaming.”\nWhile every great TV series has its flaws, a major problem with TV reboots is that they often focus a glaring spotlight on all of the show’s initial problems, which ultimately make for a subpar viewing experience — and threaten to tarnish the original series.\nMake no mistake, the highly-anticipated “Gilmore Girls” revival, which landed on Netflix the day after Thanksgiving, was thrilling to many fans, some of whom can’t find a negative thing to say. But it has also garnered lots of criticism over the past several days, from diehard loyal viewers to people who never saw the original show but decided to watch the revival because of all the hype.\nThe main issues mostly involve Rory, who started the series as a quiet, brainy introvert who loved to read and didn’t need a social life because her mother was her best friend. Eventually, she came out of her shell, and throughout the seven seasons, wound up in various romantic entanglements and career woes as she embarked on her dream to become a journalist. Rory’s evolution was frustrating at times, especially because she never seemed to recognize how many advantages she had, thanks to her wealthy grandparents, and was often deemed “special” even if she didn’t display extraordinary qualities.\nIn the revival, Rory, as many have pointed out, has become insufferable — a disappointment to the fans that used to look up to her. She cheats on her boyfriend, Paul (Jack Carpenter), and is embroiled in an affair with her college boyfriend, Logan (Matt Czuchry), who is engaged. Rory’s career is in shambles and she can’t land a full-time job. Multiple critics have pointed out that this is because she seems to be a terrible reporter, one who sleeps with a source and then doesn’t prepare for a job interview at a website because she thinks she’s too good for the position. (She doesn’t get the job.) As one piece in The Washington Post sums it up, “Rory Gilmore is a monster.”\nOther complaints include the terrible Stars Hollow musical, which in the original series would be a quick scene; in the revival (which runs 90 minutes per episode), it’s a 20-minute gag that goes on and on. Some people are upset about the infamous “last four words” of the show, in which Rory reveals her pregnancy and ends the series on an infuriating cliffhanger.\nA disappointing revival — or even one that doesn’t live up to sky-high expectations — happens all the time: Just look at Season 4 of “Arrested Development,” or “Fuller House,” or even “Heroes Reborn.” Worst-case scenario, they result in fans’ hesitation to re-watch the original series. After all, it might look different now that they know how the characters turn out in the future. Why get invested in Luke (Scott Patterson) and Lorelai’s love story when they turn out to be such a boring couple?\nAnd forget potential viewers who were curious about all the publicity about the revival and decided to tune in — if they can’t stand the reboot, there’s no way they’ll go back and watch the first seven seasons.\nTherein lies the conundrum of TV reboots. They’re essentially fan service, so they’re destined to alienate new viewers. But when the fans are also disappointed in the revival, then there’s the risk of damaging the show that they loved all along.",

      "text": "netflix tivo intellectual property bolt plus larger More TiVo is extending its partnership with streaming TV service Netflix through a licensing agreement that will see the two companies pair up in new ways.\nOn the product end, TiVo set-top box owners will be able to continue to access Netflix directly through the devices. This will allow subscribers to enjoy unified search across the entire content catalog. Most significantly, they can now also access Netflix through a dedicated button on the TiVo remote.\nRelated : You can finally watch Netflix on airplanes and the subway with offline downloads\nFurther, a new intellectual property agreement gives Netflix the opportunity to license TiVo’s patent portfolios, as well as patents for over-the-top (OTT) offerings, which are held by Intellectual Ventures.\nTiVo’s new parent company Rovi, which acquired the firm this year for $1.1 billion, had previously filed suit against Netlix for allegedly infringing on five of its patents — a suit that Netflix eventually won. This new agreement would give Netflix access to TiVo and Rovi’s more than 6,000 patents and pending applications for use in its streaming service. The patents relate to DVR and interactive program guide functions.\nBill Holmes, global head of business development at Netflix, says the agreement will help provide “an integrated experience across more devices.”\nTom Carson, CEO of TiVo, deems the new agreement a “major milestone” for the company as it expands its offerings in the OTT space.\nNetflix currently has more than 86 million members in over 190 countries. TiVo offers its intuitive interactive program guide, as well as its own DVRs.\nEarlier this month, TiVo entered into an intellectual property agreement with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. that provides certain rights under TiVo’s patent portfolios for Samsung’s line of mobile, consumer electronics, and set-top box businesses. The deal followed ongoing litigation between the two. And at the end of October, TiVo renewed its product and intellectual property licenses with Panasonic.\nWith its latest app, Tablo turns your Xbox One into an over-the-air DVR In a bid for more eyeballs, Netflix is raising $1 billion for content TiVo is working on a new DVR, but this one doesn’t plug into your TV",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access By MICHAEL LIEDTKE The Associated Press November 30, 2016 — 7:01pm Elise Amendola FILE - In this Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, file photo, a person displays Netflix on a tablet in North Andover, Mass. Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when theyíre not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday.   \nSAN FRANCISCO — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Netflix Inc. will now allow users to download shows and movies to their smartphones and tablets to watch when they're offline, the company said Wednesday.\nThe Los Gatos, Calif., video streaming firm said the download function is available for both iOS and Android operating systems, for a mix of original and licensed content.\nNetflix said many popular movies and series are already available for download, including its original shows \"Orange is the New Black\" and \"The Crown.\"\nUsers have long clamored for a download option that would allow them to watch Netflix content in areas with poor or costly connectivity -- aboard an airplane in flight, for instance. But with increased competition from Amazon Prime Video, which unveiled a download button last year, Netflix may have decided that now was the time, said Paul Verna, senior analyst at EMarketer.\n\"Amazon is definitely encroaching on Netflix's turf,\" he said. \"It doesn't seem like something that requires a tremendous investment on their part to enable, so I guess at a certain point they decided, 'Why not.'\"\nBesides garnering some amount of goodwill from customers, Netflix may also benefit from the data it can gather from users of the new feature.\n\"I'm sure they've analyzed the implications of what it means for one of their customers to download a show versus stream it,\" Verna said. \"Whatever those implications are, it must be valuable data to them.\"\nShares of Netflix were up $1.51, or 1.2 percent, to $119.02 in Wednesday morning trading.\n(c)2016 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,” ”House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Also: GoPro cuts staff and programs in bid to stay afloat, Android smartphone users have a new malware problem to watch out for. More Subscribe on YouTube\nYou can almost feel the internet suddenly slowing down\nIt’s finally happened: you can now download TV shows and movies from Netflix to your mobile device. Of course, there’s a catch: not everything Netflix offers is available for download. But a lot of stuff we love is, like Stranger Things, House of Cards, The Crown and Orange is the New Black.\nYou’ll note those are all Netflix originals, but many movies are also available for you to enjoy while offline, which is something that Netflix has said it would never do in the past. So why the change? In a word: competition, especially from Amazon Instant Video, which has allowed downloading for a while now.\nYou’ll need to update your Netflix app and once you do, you can tell a show or movie is savable if it has a little arrow at the bottom of the screen, and Netflix says that yes, more and more content will be downloadable as time goes on. Thanks, Reed!\nGoPro sharpens its focus in bid to stay afloat\nThe tough times continue over at actioncam icon GoPro, with news now that 200 jobs are about to vanish, the company’s entertainment division is about to close and the company’s president, Tony Bates, is on his way out.\nIt’s been tough sledding recently for GoPro as competitors make inroads with competing cameras and a massive recall of their Karma drone, which was supposed to be a breakout new product for the company. There’s still no word on when or if the Karma will fly again, but GoPro did say that sales of their new camera, the Hero 5, are up 35 percent heading into the holidays, so some good news there at least.\nGoPro’s “entertainment” division was essentially a system that paid content creators for their video efforts, and it paid out about a million dollars over the last year. But, no more. Here’s hoping 2017 flies a little higher for the company.\nWe need a blocking program for it called Skipper… or maybe Ginger\nAndroid smartphone users have a new malware threat to deal with, called Gooligan. Security experts at Check Point say the malware is typically hidden in third-party apps that have the ability to root a user’s phone and send user data to a remote server.\nOnce infected, the phone becomes a platform for a fraudulent ad campaign, and those responsible do have access to everything on the phone, including google Docs and so on. We’ve got more details on the malware and how to avoid it, so hit the link below for more information.\nGoPro is offering a free Hero5 camera as part of its Karma drone recall Returned your Note 7?

      "text": "The Netflix logo is shown in this illustration photograph in Encinitas, California October 14, 2014. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo More (Reuters) - Video streaming pioneer Netflix Inc has added an option that allows subscribers to download shows at no additional cost on their mobile device to watch without an internet connection.\nNetflix signaled in recent months it would add an offline viewing option to better compete as the streaming video market becomes more and more crowded. Amazon.com Inc’s rival streaming video service, Prime Video, has had this option for about a year.\nWhile the new option announced on Wednesday is available for all of Netflix’s subscribers, it could have greater appeal in international markets such as Africa and Asia, where internet service is less ubiquitous than it is in the United States.\nThe international market is becoming the main driver of growth for Netflix. Of their 86.7 million subscribers, 47.5 million of them come from the United States.\nGrowth among U.S. subscribers has slowed in 2016. Netflix added just 370,000 subscribers during the third quarter and only 4.3 million since the third quarter of last year, suggesting they are reaching a saturation point.\nIn that same time frame, Netflix has added 13.2 million international subscribers, including 3.2 million in the third quarter. Much of that has to do with Netflix’s expansion by more than 130 countries earlier this year to over 190 nations currently. China is a notable holdout.\nNot everything in Netflix’s vast library is available to download just yet, including the recently released “Gilmore Girls” revival. Currently available shows include Netflix-owned “Stranger Things,” “The Crown” and “Narcos” along with licensed shows and movies like “Parks and Recreation” and “Spotlight.”\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post.\nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS platforms, the company said.\nNetflix shares rose as much as 2.4 percent before it eased, up 0.1 percent to $117.62 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq.\nThe new option received widespread praise on social media Wednesday.\n“You can now download stuff off Netflix to watch without internet,” wrote Twitter user kt (@Katie_Ottaway_), “what did we do to deserve this miracle.”\n#NetflixOffline was also the top-trending hashtag on Twitter, worldwide.\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru and Tim Baysinger and Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Jeffrey Benkoe)",

      "text": "By Peter Hall \nIn case 2016 wasn’t already full of enough unprecedented changes in the world, here’s another one. Netflix has now done what they said they’d never do: allow users to download movies to watch offline. \nSince its inception, Netflix has insisted that movies streamed on its service had to be, well, streamed.

      "text": "By MICHAEL LIEDTKE\nAP Technology Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\n ",

      "text": "Netflix Launches Downloads for Offline Viewing on Smartphones, Tablets source Netflix has finally rolled out a feature subscribers have been requesting for years: The company will now let members worldwide download select TV shows and movies for viewing on Apple and Android devices while disconnected from the internet. The latest versions of the companys mobile apps include a download button on the details page for a film or TV series  although not all titles on the streaming service are currently available to watch offline. The app also includes a new menu item showing whats available to download. Netflix said it will add more series and movies to download in the future. Original series including Orange Is the New Black, Narcos, House of Cards, Stranger Things, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master of None and The Crown are available for download starting Wednesday. Other titles available for offline viewing include TV shows Breaking Bad, Supernatural, The Office, The Flash and The 100, and animated movies Minions, Kung Fu Panda 3 and Home. Content currently not available to download for offline viewing includes Netflixs reboots of Gilmore Girls and Fuller House, as well as the Marvel street-hero series including Daredevil, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. Also excluded are Disney movies including Jungle Book, Zootopia and Lilo & Stitch. While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, weve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited, Eddy Wu, Netflixs director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post announcing the feature. Amazon Prime Video has offered offline viewing to members on iOS and Android apps for more than a year, while YouTube Red and Starzs mobile apps also provide video downloads for access in offline mode. Netflixs new download feature is included in all plans and available for Android and iOS phones and tablets. To download titles, users will need iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later as well as the latest update of Netflixs app. Netflix execs had previously raised the prospect of allowing downloads for offline viewing, but they had suggested the company would first launch the feature in countries with constrained bandwidth infrastructure. eazy253",
