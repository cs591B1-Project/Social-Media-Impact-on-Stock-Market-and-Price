      "text": "You know that iPhone 6s battery issue that we’ve been discussing recently? It turns out there might be two separate iPhone battery problems, and they’re affecting a variety of devices, not just the iPhone 6s. DON’T MISS: This is why your iPhone 7’s battery might die in a year Apple has acknowledged that some iPhone 6s units may switch off with plenty of battery juice left to go and it’s offering a free battery replacement program. The program was unveiled soon after a Chinese watchdog announced an investigation into the matter. According to Quartz, the China Consumers Association said on Wednesday that Apple needs to take further measures, as the battery problem affects other iPhone versions, including the iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus. Furthermore, it appears that even battery replacements might shut down unexpectedly, according to a Chinese customer who already received a new iPhone 6s battery. However, this is just one person’s experience. As Business Insider points out, It’s unclear at this time whether the whole battery problem is caused by Apple’s recent iOS 10.1.1 update. After the October update, iPhone users have been complaining of random shutdowns even when there’s plenty of battery life to go. The problem affects a variety of iPhones, not just the iPhone 6s. If it’s indeed a software issue, then it should probably be fixed in an upcoming update. However, Apple has not acknowledged this particular issue — that’s assuming it’s something entirely different than the problem Apple is fixing in its iPhone 6s battery replacement program. https://twitter.com/tfadell/status/804232051595640833 Even former Apple employee Tony Fadell took to Twitter to express his issues with the new Phone battery woes. https://twitter.com/tfadell/status/804215290871607296 Earlier this year, battery problems — the exploding kind — brought down one of the best handsets of the year. The iPhone’s battery might not explode, but Apple’s got an emerging Batterygate on its hands.",

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 12:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Apple's Secure iPad Activation Lock Bypassed Via iOS Bug 2 December 2016, 2:14 am EST By Carl Velasco Tech Times Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The World Now Playing Two bugs affecting Apple’s activation lock feature for iOS 10.1 and 10.1.1., respectively, have recently been discovered. The process involves overloading Wi-Fi network fields with thousands of characters and a trick using Apple’s Smart Cover for iPad. ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple's activation lock feature for iOS makes it difficult for thieves or anyone other than the owner to unlock an iPhone or an iPad, wipe all the data inside it and essentially repurpose it as a new device. It's difficult, yes, but still possible. iOS Activation Lock Bug Two bugs have recently been discovered that could potentially make it feasible for someone to circumvent Apple's activation lock security feature. One of the bugs affects iOS 10.1 , and the other affects the latest version of Apple's operating system, iOS 10.1.1. The first of the two bugs was discovered by Hemanth Joseph, a security researcher in India. Joseph bought an unlocked iPad Air running iOS 10.1 from eBay for a friend last month but found out that the device was locked. Relatively new to iOS, Joseph scoured the internet for methods on how to unlock the iPad Air, to no avail. He booted up the device again and went through Apple's preliminary setup process until he got to the activation lock screen. Asked to choose a Wi-Fi network, Joseph tapped \"other network.\" When it came to the name and the WPA2 enterprise key fields, he filled both with thousands of characters. He kept copying and pasting countless characters in the field until the device froze. To make sure the device was still responding, Joseph pressed the lock button, which took him back to the Welcome screen. Joseph continued to figure out how to purposely fail the setup process for him to end up on the home screen. Pressing the sleep/wake button clearly wasn't the right method, since doing so only restarted the setup wizard, but with the help of Apple's Smart Cover and precise timing, Joseph successfully landed on the iPad 's home screen. Joseph uploaded the entire process on Google Drive. The Activation Lock Bug Is Also Present On iOS 10.1.1 The other bug was discovered by Vulnerability Lab, a group of researchers who monitor possible vulnerabilities or exploits in popular manufacturer products. The group, like Joseph's handiwork, typed in a surfeit of characters on the setup fields and also used the smart cover trick. Both demonstrations have shown that the home screen appears only for a brief period before disappearing. But Benjamin Kunz-Mejri, founder of Vulnerability Labs, told Security Week that quickly pressing the sleep/wake button maintained access to the iPad's home screen. The Danger of Bypassing Activation Lock If Apple's activation lock feature continues to yield to these relatively simple methods of bypassing, then it's easy to imagine that individuals, even without any hacking experience, could potentially find ways to wipe the device clean and sell it anew. Even more alarming is that a user's personal information can now be more easily accessible. Personal information such as photos, contacts and conversations, among others, may fall into the wrong hands and spell disastrous results. \nFortunately, the bug Joseph discovered has reportedly been fixed by Apple via an update last Nov. 16. The second bug, however, remains unfixed, but the impending arrival of iOS 10.2 should iron that out eventually. TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

      "text": "2016 has been a somewhat disappointing year for Apple, but that's with the caveat that the company's growth was unsustainable. One way or another, the technology giant was eventually going to come back down to earth, and that's exactly what happened over the past twelve months. Still, despite the fact that sales have been consistently falling throughout 2016, the iPhone 7 was Apple's chance to stabilize. Based on recent reports, it's becoming increasingly clear that the iPhone 7 wasn't enough to revitalize the market. DON'T MISS: iPhone 6s battery problems might be bigger than we thought Sources from Taiwan's handset supply chain reportedly told DigiTimes this week that Apple is reducing orders for the iPhone 7 in the wake of decreasing demand for the new flagship. Those sources say that the initial surge of demand was thanks in large part to excitement over the Jet Black model and the battery explosion crisis that forced Samsung to issue a worldwide recall for the Galaxy Note 7. Now that the market has calmed down and the sheen of Apple's latest color option has worn off, \"demand for the iPhone 7 devices in China and other markets has scaled down significantly since their launch less than three months ago,\" the sources claim. \"Suppliers and consumers alike\" have already turned their attention to the 2017 version of the iPhone, which is expected to be a major leap forward rather than yet another iterative evolution of the iPhone 6. As DigiTimes notes: \"Market rumors have indicated that the next generation iPhone will come with OLED displays, glass cases, dual-lens cameras, enhanced CPUs, and advanced sensors, while supporting mixed reality (MR) and wireless charging technologies.\" So with the iPhone 8 already dominating the conversation, despite the fact that we're only a few months out from the launch of the iPhone 7, sources in the supply chain \"are mostly conservative about the shipment outlook for the iPhone 7 in the first half of 2017,\" expecting to ship 5 million fewer iPhones from January to June than they did from July to December this year. Looks like Ming-Chi Kuo knew what he was talking about.",

      "text": "Apple turns (RED) for World AIDS Day (1 of ) FILE - In this Friday, Nov. 23, 2012, file photo, Tashalee Rodriguez, of Boston, uses a smartphone app while shopping at Macy's in downtown Boston. Shoppers are flocking online Monday, Nov. 28, 2016, as “Cyber Monday” sales hit their peak. Each year, during the busy holiday shopping weekend that kicks off on Thanksgiving and the Friday after, known as Black Friday, more and more shoppers decide to skip the mayhem in stores and shop online. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File) 4 changes shoppers will see as they buy on their phones ANNE D'INNOCENZIO ASSOCIATED PRESS | December 1, 2016, 2:07PM | Updated 10 hours ago. NEW YORK — Shoppers buying on their phones this holiday season will see new ways stores are making it easier and faster as they try to lock in sales before people swipe to the next site. \n\"It's not just a shopper's tool,\" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, the research arm of Adobe Systems. \"It's now so embedded in our existence we don't even think about the fact that we pulled out our phone and bought things.\" \nMobile shopping accounted for $4.61 billion in sales from Thanksgiving through Monday, according to Adobe Digital Insights. Some 54 percent of visits to retailers' sites and 36 percent of sales for the five-day period came from phones and tablets. \nHere are four ways smartphones are changing the way people shop — and how retailers are responding: \nMORE IMPULSE BUYING: Mobile shopping entices people to buy right when they're thinking about it, Gaffney said, \"It's this sense of urgency.\" She noted that retailers that had more mobile traffic enjoyed a 30 percent increase in online revenue. \nRetailers need to make it easier to find items so shoppers don't quickly move on. \n\"They want it fast,\" said Peter Cobb, co-founder and executive vice president of eBags, which says mobile accounted for 43 percent of visits and 20 percent of sales for the five-day period. The handbags and luggage site now highlights the top five sales hits to save people from sorting through 90,000 products. \nWal-Mart Stores Inc., which has worked to improve its app including the browse feature, said 70 percent of Walmart.com traffic and 60 percent of orders Thursday and Friday were driven by mobile devices. \nFOCUSED ON DEALS: Even in an improving economy, shoppers are fixated on deals — and mobile phones make it easier to grab them. \nCustomers look to have spent nearly 3.5 percent less on average for the four-day weekend starting Thursday than a year ago, according to a survey conducted over the weekend by the National Retail Federation trade group. Much of the drop had to do with the heavy discounting shoppers demand. The NRF's survey showed more than 36 percent of shoppers said everything they bought this past weekend was on sale, compared with 32.5 percent a year ago. \nRetailers are shifting to a stream of discounts and alerts during the entire week via email and social media. Toys R Us is doing more flash sales, and eBags introduced a page called \"Steals and Deals\" highlighting items that are heavily discounted for a limited time. \nMarket Track, which monitored nearly 1,500 products online from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, says stores changed prices more often than last year, and more were lowered than raised. \nSome 41 percent of prices shifted at least once, compared with 27 percent last year, said Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing. About 16 percent changed more than once, compared with only 7 percent in 2015. \nSEEKING SPEEDIER SERVICE: People buying on the go want a swifter response when they need help. \n\"When you have shoppers who are engaged, you have to try to capture as much revenue as you can,\" said Kevon Hills, senior vice president of operations at StellaService, which tracks customer service for retailers and online companies. \nTwo years ago, 97 percent of retailers offered email as a way to interact with customers, but that fell to 81 percent heading into this holiday season, StellaService said. Some 90 percent use live chat, up from 80 percent two years ago. And in 61 percent of chat interactions over the holiday weekend, someone responded within 20 seconds, up from 45 percent a year ago.

      "text": "Loading the player... Apple ( AAPL ) is reducing its iPhone 7 handset orders as the initial sales momentum has begun to fade, Taiwan tech news site DigiTimes reported Thursday.\nApple's 10th-generation smartphones saw strong initial demand thanks to the popularity of the new jet-black models and the high-end iPhone 7 Plus with its dual-camera system, DigiTimes said . But early enthusiasm has faded and supply chain partners are reporting that Apple is cutting back on production of iPhone 7 handsets, the news site said.\nThe iPhone 7 series phones launched on Sept. 16 and benefited from rival Samsung's recall of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.\nComponent suppliers and consumers already have shifted their attention to the rumored iPhone 8, due out next fall, DigiTimes said. That 11th-generation iPhone is expected to sport an OLED display, glass-case design and possibly wireless charging.\nSupply-chain companies are forecasting iPhone 7 shipments in the first half of 2017 to be at least 5 million units less than those shipped in the second half of 2016, DigiTimes said.",

      "text": "Fallen smartphone brand Nokia challenges Apple, Samsung again By Published Friday, December 02, 2016 \nNokia-branded mobile phones are about to make a comeback via a new venture that will reunite the Nokia brand with veteran Nokia executives who aim to move into smartphones capitalising on an existing operation that sells low-cost basic phones. \nHMD Global, a new Finnish company set up to revive the Nokia phone brand, on Thursday took over the basic phone business which Nokia Corp sold to Microsoft in 2014. \nNokia the company now largely makes telecom network equipment. \nHMD, officially founded six months ago, opens for business this month. \nIt has several advantages over other start-ups, including Nokia's strong global brand, experienced management and Foxconn as a manufacturing partner. \nBut it also has hurdles to overcome if it is to break into a crowded smartphone market dominated by models from scores of different players using Google's Android platform. \n\"The barriers to entry for the Android phone space are low,\"mobile phone analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight said. \"What HMD has is the Nokia brand and management experience. The key to its success will be driving scale.\" \nHMD has a licensing deal with Nokia giving it the sole use of the Nokia brand on mobile phones and tablets for the next decade and key cellular patent licences, for which it will pay royalties to Nokia, which otherwise has no investment in HMD. \nAs part of the plan, HMD has agreed to rely on Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer, to manufacture all its Nokia devices. \nHMD said it plans to introduce new Nokia Android smartphones in the first half of 2017. \n\"We want to be one of the key competitive players in the smartphone business,\" chief executive Arto Nummela told Reuters. Samsung and Apple are now big players, although Chinese brands like Huawei are closing the gap. \nRather than building its own system, the company is working in close partnership with Android's creator's, Google. \nNummela said he believed his team's extensive industry relationships with carriers and retailers, powered by the Nokia brand, could help them quickly capture smartphone share by convincing entry-level buyers of its feature phones to upgrade in markets like India, Indonesia and Russia. \n\"We really see the opportunity to create some space for ourselves on the (store) shelves,\" Nummela said. \"Consumers may be carrying different smartphones now, but are they really in love and loyalty to those brands?\" \nNummela is a long-time Nokia sales and product development executive, who moved to Microsoft when the phone business was sold. \nHMD President Florian Seiche is a mobile phone industry veteran who previously worked at Siemens, Orange, HTC and Nokia. Chief Marketing Officer Pekka Rantala is a former CEO of Angry Birds game maker Rovio, as well as a Nokia veteran. \"We are not going to skip any markets, in the long term,\"Seiche said of its global game-plan, adding that HMD has already set up offices in 40 locations around the world.

      "title": "New Features in Push Notifications Mobile",
      "text": "Push notifications are becoming increasingly popular. Vendors like Apple and Google are adding new features to push notifications within their new releases.\nNearly all mobile applications today make use of push notifications in some way, so we will not be discussing the definitions or how-to basics for push notification systems.\nIn this article, we will examine the new push notification features arrived on iOS 10 and Android N.\nApple introduced support for displaying  image, GIF, video, audio and custom content in notifications with iOS 10 while Android N has new notification styles like messaging style, new notification grouping method like bundled notifications. The most important innovation in Android N notifications is direct reply.\nPrior to iOS 10, there was no way to intercept messages between APNs and iOS application. Now, two extensions are available. These extensions are Notification Service Extension and Notification Content Extension.\nNotification Service Extension Notification Service Extension is a layer between APNs and iOS application and runs before iOS shows the notification. It provides customizing the content of notifications like encrypt-decrypt content or download files like image, audio, and video.\nImage notification sample:\n\nGIF notification sample:\n\nVideo notification sample:\n\nHow to Add Notification Service Extension to Your Project \n\nWhen we create service extension, three new files are added to the project folder.\n\nThe Notification Service Extension class has two methods, the first one being didReceive() and the second being serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() .\n// // UNNotificationServiceExtension.h // UserNotifications // // Copyright © 2016 Apple Inc. All rights reserved. // @available(iOS 10.0, *) open class UNNotificationServiceExtension : NSObject { // Call contentHandler with the modified notification content to deliver. If the handler is not called before the service's time expires then the unmodified notification will be delivered. // You are expected to override this method to implement push notification modification. open func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Swift.Void) // Will be called just before this extension is terminated by the system. You may choose whether to override this method. open func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() } \nIn didReceive() method, we can download files and add these files to the notification. If this download process takes a certain time, the serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire method runs as a means to handle the timeout.\nNotification payload must have mutable-content : 1  key-value field to run service extension.\nOur sample NotificationService implementation:\nclass NotificationService: UNNotificationServiceExtension { var contentHandler: ((UNNotificationContent) -> Void)? var bestAttemptContent: UNMutableNotificationContent? override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) { bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent) if let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent { if let attachmentUrl = bestAttemptContent.userInfo[\"attachment-url\"] as? String { var url = URL(string: attachmentUrl) downloadFile(url: url!) { localURL in if let localURL = localURL { do { let attachment = try UNNotificationAttachment(identifier: \"\", url: localURL, options: nil) bestAttemptContent.attachments = [attachment] } catch { print(error) } } contentHandler(bestAttemptContent) } } } } override func serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire() { if let contentHandler = contentHandler, let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent { contentHandler(bestAttemptContent) } } private func downloadFile(url: URL, handler: @escaping (_ localURL: URL?) -> Void){ URLSession.shared.downloadTask(with: url, completionHandler: { (location, response, error) in guard let httpURLResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpURLResponse.statusCode == 200, let location = location, error == nil else { return } do { let documentsUrl = try! FileManager.default.url(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask, appropriateFor: nil, create: true) let destination = documentsUrl.appendingPathComponent(url.lastPathComponent) try FileManager.default.moveItem(at: location, to: destination) handler(destination) } catch let error as NSError { print(error.localizedDescription) } }).resume() } } \nNotification Content Extension Notifications can be created with custom content. Notification Content Extension provides a way to process the notification content and create a new custom user interface. One disadvantage of content extension is that there's no interaction with the view. For interaction, notification actions must be used.\n\nHow to Add Notification Content Extension to Your Project \nWhen we create the content extension, three new files are added to the project folder.\n\nNotificationViewController implements UIViewController and UNNotificationContentExtension .\nUNNotificationContentExtension protocol:\n@available(iOS 10.0, *) public protocol UNNotificationContentExtension : NSObjectProtocol { // This will be called to send the notification to be displayed by // the extension. If the extension is being displayed and more related // notifications arrive (eg. more messages for the same conversation) // the same method will be called for each new notification. public func didReceive(_ notification: UNNotification) // If implemented, the method will be called when the user taps on one // of the notification actions. The completion handler can be called // after handling the action to dismiss the notification and forward the // action to the app if necessary. optional public func didReceive(_ response: UNNotificationResponse, completionHandler completion: @escaping (UNNotificationContentExtensionResponseOption) -> Swift.Void) // Implementing this method and returning a button type other that \"None\" will // make the notification attempt to draw a play/pause button correctly styled // for that type. optional public var mediaPlayPauseButtonType: UNNotificationContentExtensionMediaPlayPauseButtonType { get } // Implementing this method and returning a non-empty frame will make // the notification draw a button that allows the user to play and pause // media content embedded in the notification. optional public var mediaPlayPauseButtonFrame: CGRect { get } // The tint color to use for the button. @NSCopying optional public var mediaPlayPauseButtonTintColor: UIColor { get } // Called when the user taps the play or pause button. optional public func mediaPlay() optional public func mediaPause() } \nNotificationViewController must implement the didReceive() method. In the  didReceive method, you can access the notification content and create your own custom UI according to this content.\nThe  UNNotificationExtensionCategory field of Info.plist file is key to running Notification Content Extension. The category field of the notification payload and UNNotificationExtensionCategory field must be the same to run the content extension.\n\nNotification Actions Notification action is the action button below the expanded notification view. We interact with notification through these action buttons.\nThe  UNNotificationAction class must be used to create action button:\nlet goClosestATMAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: ActionType.goClosestATM.rawValue, title: \"Go Closest ATM\", options: UNNotificationActionOptions.foreground) \nThe  UNNotificationAction object must be set to the actions field of UNNotificationCategory :\nlet mapCategory = UNNotificationCategory(identifier: \"myNotificationCategory\", actions: [goClosestATMAction], intentIdentifiers: [], options: []) \nThe UNNotificationCategory object must be set to UNUserNotificationCenter ’s categories:\nUNUserNotificationCenter.current().setNotificationCategories(Set([mapCategory])) \nYou can handle the action button click event on userNotificationCenter r method of class, which implements UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate protocol.\nfunc userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) { if response.notification.request.content.categoryIdentifier == \"myNotificationCategory\" { if response.actionIdentifier == ActionType.goClosestATM.rawValue { } } completionHandler() } \nIf you forget to write the  escaping  keyword in the  method signature, your method won’t be called.\nNotes Your project’s Push Notifications capability must be enabled.\n\nRegistration of push notification, UNUserNotificationCenter delegate, notification action, and notification category assignments can be done in AppDelegate’s application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method:\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool { registerPushNotifications() UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = notificationHandler let goClosestATMAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: ActionType.goClosestATM.rawValue, title: \"Go Closest ATM\", options: UNNotificationActionOptions.foreground) let goSecondATMAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: ActionType.goSecondATM.rawValue, title: \"Go Second ATM\", options: UNNotificationActionOptions.foreground) let goThirdATMAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: ActionType.goThirdATM.rawValue, title: \"Go Third ATM\", options: UNNotificationActionOptions.foreground) let mapCategory = UNNotificationCategory(identifier: \"myNotificationCategory\", actions: [goClosestATMAction, goSecondATMAction, goThirdATMAction], intentIdentifiers: [], options: []) UNUserNotificationCenter.current().setNotificationCategories(Set([mapCategory])) return true } func registerPushNotifications() { UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) { (granted, error) in let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(types: [.badge, .sound, .alert], categories: nil) UIApplication.shared.registerUserNotificationSettings(settings) } } func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegister notificationSettings: UIUserNotificationSettings) { if notificationSettings.types != UIUserNotificationType() { application.registerForRemoteNotifications() } } \nAndroid N Notifications Android N arrived with many features for push notifications like direct reply, messaging style, and bundled notifications. Also, the standard view of notifications changed.\nDirect Reply Direct reply allows the notification to receive inline text. Before Android N versions, we used notification action buttons for this purpose.\nDirect reply text input is at the bottom of the notification.\n\nSo, you don’t have to open the application to send a reply message.\nHow to Add Direct Reply to the Notification First, we must create a RemoteInput object. Then, this object must be set to Notification.Action ’s addRemoteInput method. Finally, this Notification.Action object must be set to NotificationBuilder ’s addAction method.\nRemoteInput remoteInput = new RemoteInput.Builder(Constants.KEY_TEXT_REPLY) .setLabel(\"Reply\") .build(); Notification.Action action = new Notification.Action.Builder(Icon.createWithResource(getApplicationContext(), R.drawable.reply), \"Reply\", replyPendingIntent) .addRemoteInput(remoteInput) .build(); notificationBuilder.addAction(action); \nHow to Access Reply Input Value From Intent Bundle remoteInput = RemoteInput.getResultsFromIntent(getIntent()); if (remoteInput != null) { Intent intent = getIntent(); String inputText = remoteInput.getCharSequence(Constants.KEY_TEXT_REPLY).toString(); } \nMessaging Style Another new feature of Android N notifications is Messaging Style. This style is very convenient for messaging applications. You can also display old messages with a new message. Also, you use the direct reply feature with this style.\n\nHow to Use Messaging Style on Notifications First, we must create a Notification.MessagingStyle object. This class gets displayUserName parameter. You can set a conversation title to appear at the top of the notification. You can add messages that you want to show using the  addMessage method of messaging style object. Finally, the messaging object must be set to setStyle method of notification builder.\nNotification.MessagingStyle messagingStyle = new Notification.MessagingStyle(\"Me\"); messagingStyle.setConversationTitle(messageBodiesList.size() + \" new messages with \" + senderUserName); messagingStyle.addMessage(messageBodyElement, System.currentTimeMillis(), senderUserName + \": \"); notificationBuilder.setStyle(messagingStyle); \nIf you set direct reply action to the  addAction method of notification builder, you can use the direct reply feature on this style.\nNotes To receive notifications, the application should get Internet permission. On Andorid N, it isn’t enough to add these permissions to manifest.xml file. You must write code to get these permissions.\nActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, new String[]{\"android.permission.INTERNET\"}, 1); \nYou must override onRequestPermissionsResult method of the  Activity class to get user answer for permissions.\n@Override public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String permissions[], int[] grantResults) {}",

      "text": "The new MacBook Pro was a “ courageous ” decision for Apple in a bunch of different ways: only USB-C ports, that Touch Bar, killing off MagSafe. But all of those decisions have valid (if small) design benefits for Apple, so we’ll let them stand.\nOne thing that’s difficult to explain away is the Pro’s lack of graphical power. For a laptop that’s supposed to be aimed at creative professionals — the people who made Macs desirable in the first place — the Pro is woefully inadequate for video editing, photographers, or anyone who needs more than a glorified netbook.\nDON’T MISS: A 75-year-old’s excellent Tweet may be the only good thing in 2016\nYes, integrating a graphics card means more weight, more cost, and a shorter battery life. But that’s not what we’re talking about here. There is another way, thanks to the USB-C ports Apple decided to litter across its latest and greatest laptop.\nWith a lot of trickery, some users and tech blogs have managed to get an external GPU designed for Windows laptops running on a MacBook Pro. Because of the tremendous speed and throughput of USB-C ports, it’s very feasible to hook up an external graphics card to the MacBook Pro when you’re at your desk, and use that for the heavy lifting.\nAs an added side benefit, a GPU enclosure can also include a bunch more ports, including Ethernet, SD card readers, and USB-A ports — all things that people have complained are missing on the new MacBook Pro.\nIt sounds like the perfect solution: portability and battery power when you’re on the move, true desktop-class practicality and performance when you’re tethered to a desk.\nIt would be the perfect solution, except for one tiny detail: Apple doesn’t want it to happen. The company has refused to make an external GPU enclosure for MacBooks, and using a Windows one requires some hardcore tinkering. To get a Razer Core running with the new MacBook Pro, AppleInsider detailed a real tale of woe:\n“Getting an external GPU to work in macOS requires system integrity protection (SIP) to be disabled through the terminal. Then, a hack must be installed allowing for the Apple-laid block on some Thunderbolt 3 peripherals to be bypassed.\nThird, a DSDT system file needs to be edited, allowing for the functionality. Then, a script has to be run for graphic card identification, and even after all that, drivers may need to be installed.\nThen, there’s compatibility issues that may have to be dealt with. The closer a GPU is to the “reference design” or manufacturer’s standard, the better the results.”\nImagine if Apple put some of its talented engineers towards designing a custom GPU for MacBooks. Sure, it would have the GPU built in, and it’d probably cost somewhere around $800 for a graphics card that’s $300 in stores. But considering people are spending easily upwards of $2,000 on the MacBook Pros (plus an extra $250 in dongles), it’s really not that much of an ask.\nTrending right now:\nHow to tell if Apple owes you a new iPhone battery 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today A 75-year-old’s excellent Tweet may be the only good thing in 2016 See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple’s track record when it comes to admitting to faulty design is somewhat spotty, but customers can put another notch in the win column thanks to a new refund program that addresses an iMac part failure.\nAccording to a report by MacRumors , the company has distributed an internal update regarding an issue with the display hinge on iMacs sold between December of 2012 and July of 2014, noting that the Apple will now absorb the cost of repairs and refund past repairs that were paid for out of pocket.\nMUST SEE: Apple may soon be sending drones to map your neighborhood\nReports on Apple’s support forums show that many, many iMac owners have ran into trouble with the iMac’s screen hinge losing its ability to hold the display at any given angle. The faulty hinge makes it so the screen tilts forward immediately, rather than holding itself at the desired level.\nApparently a plastic washer is to blame for the hinge losing its integrity, and while the part that causes the issue is tiny, the repair costs for replacing the hinge can be significant. In some cases, the final bill totals over $100, which is a pretty hefty dent.\nIf you’re an iMac owner with a busted hinge, the repair will now be covered in its entirety, provided you take it to an Apple authorized repair center and your computer falls within the timeframe that the guidelines dictate. If you already had the hinge repaired, and paid for it yourself, you can contact Apple in order to begin the refund process and get your repair cost back.\nTrending right now:\nHow to tell if Apple owes you a new iPhone battery 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today A 75-year-old’s excellent Tweet may be the only good thing in 2016 See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

It turns out there might be two separate iPhone battery problems, and they’re affecting a variety of devices, not just the iPhone 6s. DON’T MISS: This is why your iPhone 7’s battery might die in a year \nApple has acknowledged that some iPhone 6s units may switch off with plenty of battery juice left to go and it’s offering a free battery replacement program. The program was unveiled soon after a Chinese watchdog announced an investigation into the matter.\nAccording to Quartz , the China Consumers Association said on Wednesday that Apple needs to take further measures, as the battery problem affects other iPhone versions, including the iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus.\nFurthermore, it appears that even battery replacements might shut down unexpectedly, according to a Chinese customer who already received a new iPhone 6s battery. However, this is just one person’s experience.\nAs Business Insider points out, It’s unclear at this time whether the whole battery problem is caused by Apple’s recent iOS 10.1.1 update.\nAfter the October update, iPhone users have been complaining of random shutdowns even when there’s plenty of battery life to go. The problem affects a variety of iPhones, not just the iPhone 6s. If it’s indeed a software issue, then it should probably be fixed in an upcoming update. However, Apple has not acknowledged this particular issue — that’s assuming it’s something entirely different than the problem Apple is fixing in its iPhone 6s battery replacement program.\nNever has happened w any other iPhone for me in 9 yrs.

      "text": "Home » News » Kerala News » Kerala-based researcher bypasses Apple's iPad activation lock Kerala-based researcher bypasses Apple's iPad activation lock 46 minutes   New York, Dec 2 : Hemanth Joseph, a Kerala-based security researcher, has identified a bug running in iOS 10.1 version of Apple's operating system that allowed him to bypass the activation lock on an iPad. [NK Kerala] The activation lock in Apple's iPhone or iPad is hard for someone other than owner of the device to hack and set it up as a new device. Joseph bypassed activation lock in a locked iPad by discovering a weakness in the device setup process running iOS 10.1, Forbes reported on Friday. When Joseph was asked to select a Wi-Fi network, he chose 'other network' and selected WPA2-enterprise as the type of network to connect to, that gave him three input fields to fill -- name, username and password. Upon testing, he came to know that there is no character restriction in those fields and he typed thousands of characters than iOS can handle, expecting that it would cause the software to crash. This caused the iPad to freeze and then he locked it by closing Apple's magnetic Smart Cover over the screen. After opening the cover, the device was at the same screen, but as few seconds passed by, it crashed to iOS home screen. This made Joseph bypassed the activation lock and to have full access to the iPad. The bug discovered by Joseph was reportedly fixed in an iOS update last month. According to Joseph's website, he is currently working as information security researcher at the firm Slash Secure and also serving as commander at Kerala Police Cyberdome. He is founder of India's first open security community for students called 0SecCon (www.0SecCon.com). Joseph has been listed Google's Hall of fame and received a bounty of $7500 for reporting a critical vulnerability in Google Cloud Platform. Earlier, researchers at US-based Vulnerability Lab discovered the iOS 10.1.1 bug. Like Joseph, the team began by overloading the Wi-Fi setup fields and employed a smart cover. Just like in Joseph's iPad scenario, the home screen appeared for an instant and then it's gone. anuj/na/vm",

      "text": "Indians Abroad | Indo-Asian News Service | Updated: December 02, 2016 14:44 IST EMAIL COMMENTS Hemanth Joseph, a Kerala-based security researcher and now a commander at Kerala Police Cyberdome. New York: Hemanth Joseph, a Kerala-based security researcher, has identified a bug running in iOS 10.1 version of Apple's operating system that allowed him to bypass the activation lock on an iPad.The activation lock in Apple's iPhone or iPad is hard for someone other than owner of the device to hack and set it up as a new device.Mr Joseph bypassed activation lock in a locked iPad by discovering a weakness in the device setup process running iOS 10.1, Forbes reported on Friday.When Mr Joseph was asked to select a Wi-Fi network, he chose 'other network' and selected WPA2-enterprise as the type of network to connect to, that gave him three input fields to fill -- name, username and password.Upon testing, he came to know that there is no character restriction in those fields and he typed thousands of characters than iOS can handle, expecting that it would cause the software to crash.This caused the iPad to freeze and then he locked it by closing Apple's magnetic Smart Cover over the screen. After opening the cover, the device was at the same screen, but as few seconds passed by, it crashed to iOS home screen.This made Mr Joseph bypassed the activation lock and to have full access to the iPad.The bug discovered by Mr Joseph was reportedly fixed in an iOS update last month.According to Mr Joseph's website, he is currently working as information security researcher at the firm Slash Secure and also serving as commander at Kerala Police Cyberdome.He is founder of India's first open security community for students called 0SecCon.Joseph has been listed Google's Hall of fame and received a bounty of $7500 for reporting a critical vulnerability in Google Cloud Platform.Earlier, researchers at US-based Vulnerability Lab discovered the iOS 10.1.1 bug. Like Joseph, the team began by overloading the Wi-Fi setup fields and employed a smart cover. Just like in Mr Joseph's iPad scenario, the home screen appeared for an instant and then it's gone.

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Apple's iTunes and Apple TV and Google Play are to be hit by a Russian draft legislation introducing restrictions on foreign ownership of online video services.\nUnder a draft law penned by the Media Communications Union (MKS), an industry association that includes Russia's major telecom companies and media groups, foreign ownership of online video services operating in Russia will have to be limited to 20 percent stakes.\nGoogle Play, iTunes and Apple TV will be directly affected by the legislation because they offer, in addition to other content, movies and television services and shows, the local business daily Vedomosti reported.\nAccording to the report, if the draft is adopted, foreign video services will have to pull out of Russia or change ownership to comply with the law.\nVedomosti Quote: d an MKS representative as saying that Apple and Google will have the option of requesting an exemption through the government commission for foreign investment.\nApple and Google haven't released subscriber figures for Russia, but iTunes and Google Play are considered to be among the market leaders, while Apple TV is less popular.\nGoogle and Apple did not reply to The Hollywood Reporter's request for comment.\nMeanwhile, contrary to initial fears, the legislation won't affect YouTube.\n\"Services that provide user-generated content, such as YouTube, as well as social media and search engines won't be affected by the legislation,\" MKS said in a statement sent to THR.\nAlthough the draft has yet to be approved by Russian parliament, its chances for passing through parliament are high. A similar legislation concerning foreign ownership of media companies was adopted with ease two years ago.\nThat legislation came into effect on Jan. 1, 2016, forcing Sweden's Modern Times Group, which owned 39 percent of the Russian TV company CTC Media, to sell its stake and pull out , while Discovery was forced to enter a joint venture with a local company to continue distributing its channels in the country.\nRead more: Russian Distributor Pulls Discovery Channels from Leading Pay TV Operator",

      "text": "Youtube Apple reportedly using drones to improve Maps and combat Google Maps \nApple is said to be using drones to improve Maps, according to a latest report from Bloomberg . Along with the drones, the company will also some indoor navigation tech to improve its app to better compete with Google. \nApple currently uses cars equipped with cameras and sensors to travel and record mapping data. However, by replacing cars with drones, the company will be able to record this data faster and improve Maps at a much faster speed. As per the report, Apple is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information. The drones will examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, added the report citing a person familiar to the matter. Apple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Air division to help run the drone team. \nIn addition to drone, Apple is further bolstering Maps feature for indoor usage and also for its in-car navigation service. Similar to Google Maps, indoor mapping will allow iPhone users navigate through museums and airports. The company had acquired a startup Indoor.io for interior mapping project. Finally, Apple is also adding better assistance for changing lanes while driving, and both of the new Maps features are said to be planned for a 2017 release. \nApple had launched Apple Maps in 2012 to take on Google Maps on iOS. However, the app was criticized for having inaccurate information and poor driving directions. \nSource Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

      "text": "Apple’s track record when it comes to admitting to faulty design is somewhat spotty, but customers can put another notch in the win column thanks to a new refund program that addresses an iMac part failure. According to a report by MacRumors , the company has distributed an internal update regarding an issue with the display hinge on iMacs sold between December of 2012 and July of 2014, noting that the Apple will now absorb the cost of repairs and refund past repairs that were paid for out of pocket.\n\nMUST SEE:  Apple may soon be sending drones to map your neighborhood \nReports on Apple’s support forums show that many, many iMac owners have ran into trouble with the iMac’s screen hinge losing its ability to hold the display at any given angle. The faulty hinge makes it so the screen tilts forward immediately, rather than holding itself at the desired level.\nApparently a plastic washer is to blame for the hinge losing its integrity, and while the part that causes the issue is tiny, the repair costs for replacing the hinge can be significant. In some cases, the final bill totals over $100, which is a pretty hefty dent.\nIf you’re an iMac owner with a busted hinge, the repair will now be covered in its entirety, provided you take it to an Apple authorized repair center and your computer falls within the timeframe that the guidelines dictate. If you already had the hinge repaired, and paid for it yourself, you can contact Apple in order to begin the refund process and get your repair cost back.\nTrending right now: \nHow to tell if Apple owes you a new iPhone battery 10 paid iPhone apps on sale for free today A 75-year-old’s excellent Tweet may be the only good thing in 2016 See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple has announced to developers that it is switching up its pricing strategy in eight countries over the next few weeks. Today, Apple sells apps in many regions with the prices shown as US Dollars irrespective of the local domestic currency. Later this month, the following App Store countries will now price apps in their local native currency; Egypt (Egyptian Pound), Kazakhstan (Kazakhstani Tenge), Malaysia (Malaysian Ringgit), Nigeria (Nigerian Naira), Pakistan (Pakistani Rupee), Philippines (Philippine Peso), Qatar (Qatari Riyal), Tanzania (Tanzanian Shilling) and Vietnam (Vietnamese Dong). \nCustomers feel more comfortable purchasing goods in the currency that they recognize and understand so the transition should induce more App Store revenue in these markets, which is generally beneficial to third-party developers and Apple. \nDevelopers will now be paid in the respective local currency for sales in those markets which introduces some price variation from the exchange rates at any particular time. \nApple also warned developers that Egyptian revenue will be impacted by the introduction of a new VAT regime, so proceeds from Egyptian App Store sales will be subject to a 13% VAT tax rate.",

      "text": "Apple Primed to Win Against Australian Banking Cartel in Apple Pay Standoff \nApple isn’t budging and the banks want to form a cartel. Weibo \nA petition to collectively bargain and boycott Apple on Apple Pay by three of Australia’s “big four” banks is set to be dismissed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the country’s antitrust regulator. \nFintech is all the rage and Australia’s big banks want in, by demanding access to Apple’s in-house Apple Pay platform with their own terms. \nThe Commonwealth Bank, the National Australia Bank and Westpac are three of Australia’s ‘big four’ banks complaining that Apple is barring them from gaining access to its Apple Pay platform, after negotiations between the banks and the tech giant fell apart earlier this year. \nThe other ‘big four’ bank, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has struck a deal with Apple and is already seeing the benefits of partnering one of the world’s leading mobile platforms. Within four days of launch, the ANZ Apple Pay microsite reportedly clocked 61,000 unique visitors, while web traffic to ANZ’s website went up 6%. Stringent confidentiality measures do not reveal the actual number of ANZ customer’s debit and credit cards pinned onto Apple Pay. Suffice to say, the interest generated by financial applications via Apple pay has the other big banks scrambling to renegotiate with Apple, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. Apple and Australian banks are at a standoff over financial technology implementations. \nFor its part, Apple has submitted its reasons arguing against the banks’ collusion to bargain and even boycott the California-based tech giant. Apple notes that banks are free to develop their own iOS apps, confirming that the banks have not agreed to Apple’s terms about Apple pay. Apple’s biggest argument is for its users’ privacy, noting that third parties should sync to its digital wallet platform in the fear that such access would fundamentally undermine customer privacy and security. \nUnder Australian law, banks can form cartels, with permission from authorities and in this case, the three big banks along with a number of other smaller financial institutions amount to two-thirds of the Australian credit card market. Their proposed boycott if Apple doesn’t come to terms with their demands for access, would see Apple Pay shunned for up to three years from their customers. About the Money or the Tech? \nIt has been claimed that ANZ, the only big bank that did strike a deal with Apple, is sharing a portion of the traditional interchange fee charged during a payment or a transfer. The other banks are at an impasse with apple about the fees charged by Apple for transactions made through Apple pay. This is one of the main sticking points in the standoff. \nThe other argument from the banks toward forming a cartel is their lack access to the NFC (Near-Field Communication) controller in iPhones, which Apple has steadfastly refused to grant access to. Developing their own NFC-compatible wallets would pit their apps in direct competition with Apple Pay, which has resulted in yet another impasse. The outcome of the banks’ request to form a cartel could have a telling impact on the commercial banking landscape. \nIn light of the details, ACCC chairman Rod Sims told Reuters this week that if the banks’ reasons for forming a cartel is for the fees, they are unlikely to win the case. This notion is, as things stand, the preliminary decision determined by the regulator, which would mean the banks’ request to collude and bargain against Apple is destined to be denied. \nStill, the decision was “finely balanced” Sims said and could be reconsidered if the banks made a telling argument for access to Apple’s NFC infrastructure. \nThe final ruling by the regulator is due in March and could have a telling effect on the advent of banks’ relationship with disruptive financial technology. If Apple is threated with a shut-out against a majority of Australia’s banks, perhaps it could look closer to its own platforms for solutions. \nPreviously alleged Australian banking cartels have been cleared of colluding against disruptive new technologies like bitcoin, by allegedly denying fundamental banking services to bitcoin startups. \nMeanwhile, Apple is also seeing a similar collective petition against its policy of preventing third parties with access to its NFC technology in South Korea, by a number of Fintech firms. \n ",

But Apple has a different idea: take to the sky. \nBloomberg , citing sources familiar with the matter, reports that Apple will add a fleet of drones to its current roster of camera-and-sensor equipped minivans that criss-cross the U.S. in order to best rival Google and more quickly collect information for the company’s Maps app. \nUnder the new initiative, Apple will work with robotics and data-collection experts to capture and update maps faster than it’s currently able to with its fleet of actual road traveling vehicles. \nSpecifically, the drones will examine street signs and make note of areas under construction where roads are being improved to created. This data will then be sent to Apple techs who will “rapidly” update the app, Bloomberg reports. \nIn addition to collecting data about roadways, Apple is working to develop a system with recently acquired startup Indoor.io that would allow it to see inside buildings. \nIndoor mapping, the source tells Bloomberg, would allow Apple to create maps of museums, airports, and other large buildings that could be confusing for consumers to navigate. \nBloomberg reports that the idea of using drones to map roads has been around for at least a year at Apple, as the company applied for a Federal Aviation Administration exemption to fly commercial drones in Sept. 2015. \nThe FAA granted the exemption in March, according to Bloomberg, giving it the ability to “operate an an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography.” \nIt’s unclear when the drones could take flight. Apple declined to provide comment to Bloomberg on the new initiatives. ",

      "title": "Safety tests of 400 fake Apple chargers bought online reveal that 99% are dangerous",
      "text": "Reddit \nA large-scale test of 400 fake Apple chargers bought online from eight different countries – including the USA – found that a staggering 99% failed safety tests. \nThe BBC reports that the tests were commissioned by UK consumer protection body Chartered Trading Standards Institute, which found that of the 400 chargers purchased online, just three had sufficient insulation to protect against electric shocks in the most basic safety test performed. The CTSI urged consumers to buy only from reputable suppliers … Leon Livermore, Chartered Trading Standards Institute chief executive, said: “Only buy second-hand electrical goods that have been tested and only buy online electrical goods from trusted suppliers. It might cost a few pounds more but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one.” \nThe institute provided four pieces of advice when checking a new charger. Plug pins – Plug the charger into a socket, but don’t switch it on or connect to a device. If the charger does not fit easily, the pins may be the wrong size. There should be at least 9.5mm (0.3in) between the edge of the pins and the edge of the charger Markings – Look for a manufacturers’ brand name or logo, model and batch number. Check for the “CE” safety mark, but be aware it can be easily forged [FCC and UL in the US] Warnings and instructions – User instructions should include conditions and limitations of use, how to operate the charger safely, basic electric safety guidance and details of safe disposal Damage – Never use a charger that has a frayed cable or other visible damage \nHowever, some counterfeit chargers have fake markings and safety leaflets. \nApple recently carried out its own tests on chargers sold on Amazon as ‘genuine’ Apple kit, finding that almost 90% of them were counterfeit. Amazon has since established a new Brand Registry program requiring sellers to obtain permission from brand owners before branded products can be offered for sale. Guides",

      "text": "Wikipedia/Paul03798 \nA former senior manager at Foxconn, one of Apple's manufacturing partners, allegedly stole 5,700 iPhones and sold them on for than $1.5 million. \nAFP is reporting that the Taiwanese man, named only as Tsai , has been indicted over the allegations and faces trial, with a potential 10-year jail sentence if found guilty. \nThe thefts are alleged to have happened in Shenzen in China, where Foxconn has factories. He allegedly had eight employees smuggle out iPhone 5 and 5s handsets between 2013 and 2014, then selling them on for millions. \nThe Taiwanese company apparently first noticed the issue after an internal audit, and Tsai was arrested then bailed in 2016. \nFoxconn is one of Apple's key suppliers, helping manufacture iPhones and other products for the Cupertino company — as well as other major tech companies. It has more than 1.3 million employees , and has previously been criticised over working conditions — an issue highlighted by employee suicides . \nApple did not immediately provide Business Insider with a comment.

But you would be wrong. For the last few weeks, Facebook has been testing the delivery of targeted ads to Roku and Apple TV based on what people are watching. \nAs revealed by a Bloomberg report , Facebook is gathering information about the shows Roku and Apple TV owners are streaming. It then uses the Facebook profile linked to the same IP addresses to tailor the commercials that are shown to individual users. \nA Facebook spokesperson says that the tests are being carried out on the A&E network as well as Tubi TV. At the moment the test involves displaying ads for its own products and services, non-profit groups and a small number of well-known brands. If the tests prove successful, it is safe to assume that more advertisers will get on board and more commercials will be customized in this way. \nWhile Facebook has long-relied on advertising -- it is second only to Google in this regard -- the company's latest experiments show just how much importance it places on video. If the advertising venture takes off, there will be money to divide up between various streaming networks but, as Bloomberg points, tracking the efficacy of individual ad campaigns could be tricky. \nAnd then, of course, there is the question of privacy...",

      "text": "Sensors in future Apple devices could warn users of environmental hazards Sensors in future Apple devices could warn users of environmental hazards Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + Patents - Patents + When it comes to innovation, there are not many smartphone manufacturers that can compete with Apple. While next year's 10th anniversary of the iPhone can be the cause of much speculation regarding possible new features, a patent application to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office submitted by Tim Cook & Co. on Thursday might have just given us an insight on what the company is planning to surprise us with beyond 2017.The application specifies a technique by which an environmental sensor could be placed into a device speaker cavity. This approach would allow such components to have a part of them exposed in order to sample material and at the same time they would be relatively protected by the housing of the device. The diaphragm located in the speaker cavity or port would use sensor circuitry to draw in, capture and expel various sampling materials such as air and water. Having a speaker system that drives out water is nothing new to the owners of the Apple Watch Series 2 , however, the motions of the diaphragm could also be used to refresh the sample material in order to ensure more accurate readings by preventing stagnancy. \nIllustrational graphics from Apple's patent application Apple also describes a plethora of different components that can be used in this sensor configuration, including an oxygen sensor, a biological substance sensor, a temperature sensor, a carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide sensors, an ozone sensor, a humidity sensor, various gas sensors and more. While it is not exactly clear which devices would incorporate this technology or when (if ever) would Apple decide to mass produce it for consumers, the potential benefits of having such features in your phone or watch simply can't be ignored. Host devices could be configured to take readings from these sensors and issue notifications to users after the data analysis has been complete. For example, if a person possessing such a gadget enters an area with a high concentration of dangerous gasses, the device would issue an alarm which could potentially save that person's life. Moreover, if this technology catches on and becomes an integral part of the smartphone/watch of tomorrow, scientists would be able to gather data much more accurately through crowdsourcing. Having such specific, real-time information could not only let people with asthma know which areas to avoid on any given day, but would also give researchers a better picture of the location, reason and time at which pollution happens, which is important when taking steps to reduce its effect on our environment.",

File Photo: \nA months-long investigation culminated in a raid that seized $7 million in knockoff Apple and Samsung phones Thursday night in Brooklyn, police said . \nPolice raided two Gravesend warehouses, one at 203 Highlawn Ave. and the other at 2172 Coney Island Ave., and discovered 31,000 phones in cardboard boxes and $71,000 in cash. \n“These products are dangerous. They are not what the manufacturer produced in a safe manner,” Chief Brian McCarthy of NYPD’s Criminal Enterprise Division said in a statement. \nThe investigation began earlier this year after agents discovered suspicious packages funneling through JFK International Airport. \nThe counterfeit products were sent from the warehouses to several stores and sold to customers, police said without identifying the shop locations. \nThree unidentified men were arrested in connection to the knockoff operation.

      "title": "Tech Wreck, YouTube's 4K, Apple's Drone Maps, Fitbit Buys Pebble? -- Eye On Tech",
      "text": "Summary \nTech stocks continue to get whacked on seemingly no news. \nYouTube's upping its live-streaming game with 4K, while Apple will reportedly use drones for its Maps. \nFitbit is reportedly going to buy Pebble for about $34 million got $40 million. Tech Wreck There's not a lot of explanation behind the selloff in tech, but it's certainly noteworthy with the PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ ) taking an almost 2% hit on Thursday. The ETF is down almost 3% over the past three days and is up just 1.6% since the election, certainly lagging other indices, mainly the Dow. So why the drop? It's hard to say with any real certainty. The market is clearly going through a broader market rotation -- with noteworthy selloffs in stocks like Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). But could it really be as simple as that? Under a Trump presidency, investors seem to believe that infrastructure stocks will see a significant boost in the years to come. Hence, investors are ditching tech and going with more industrial names (along with energy and financials, for reasons of their own). While tech may not be bad necessarily, it doesn't have a big government-backed catalyst pushing it higher like other sectors. Unfortunately, there's no telling how long it will last, but should the rest of the market continue higher, it's hard to imagine tech riding the pine for too long. YouTube Starts 4K Live-Streaming The platform first added 4K support several years ago, but it will now support the ultra-high resolution for live-streaming events as well . Alphabet's YouTube currently holds the web's largest portfolio of 4K videos, which should come at little surprise given its leadership on the Internet. While YouTube is definitely big, it just feels like to me that it is not being maximized to its full potential. 4K is great for those that are able to stream it. And YouTube has done a lot over the years to improve its functionality and obviously to increase its revenue stream via ads. The web is moving closer and closer towards a video-centric world, consumers continue to cut the cord and Facebook management recently said that in five years its whole platform could be video. Netflix has already said it won't do sports, while Amazon has been making a push in that direction -- we all know the power that live sports carries. Why can't YouTube start to generate some sort of traction in that arena? I know the people on the YouTube team are great at what they do and it is a phenomenal platform and business. It just feels like with so much emphasis going into video from so many different companies on the web, that YouTube -- the actual king of video! -- could be doing more. Be it sports, live TV, movies, etc. How about when it launched The Interview ? That was pretty big. Its library of rental/movies for purchase seems unlikely to gain too much traction when its competing with Apple and others, and now that Netflix now has downloadable content . Call me crazy, but it feels like YouTube still has way too much untapped potential. Apple's Maps Initiative It wasn't all that long ago that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) sent Google hiking when it came to maps on its iOS devices, but the former's product was considered by most to be subpar when compared to the latter. The company has a put a lot more effort into the application since then and now it will use a unique method for continuing that enhancement: Drones. Instead of using vehicles to drive around and collect data, the company will instead fly drones. The hope is that it's able to provide users with more detailed information. However, Apple isn't stopping with the outside world, it's headed indoors as well. The company wants to map out airports and other \"high traffic building interiors\" - presumably thought to be places such as malls for example - in order to provide a better experience for its users. Maps is not a revenue generator. But it's sort of like what we have talked about with Facebook in the past. Not every idea needs to be geared towards generating profits, or even sales for that matter. Sometimes, companies just need to improve their product, to prevent customers from opting for other devices. Apple needs \"sticky.\" That's why it made the ecosystem, that's why it has iCloud. Calendar, Mail, Maps. All of it is just for improving the user experience. Fitbit's Buying Pebble? Say goodbye to Pebble - at least, that seems to be the plan assuming Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) ultimately buys the company. Word on the Street says Fitbit is in talks to buy Pebble for just $34 million to $40 million, which is barely enough to cover Pebble's current debts. Obviously, it would appear that Pebble is selling itself out of need rather than want. The company laid off a quarter of its staff earlier this year and a price tag that's just enough to cover its debt isn't a sign of financial strength. Fitbit will reportedly phase out the Pebble brand if it indeed takes it over, and will mostly purchase the company for its intellectual property - well, that and ridding itself of a competitor. Assuming that the IP from Pebble is able to benefit Fitbit and if the company does pick up a slight sales gain as a result of one less competitor, this acquisition should be seen as a good one by the company. Even at $40 million, it's still a relatively small purchase and Fitbit has more than enough cash on hand to do the deal. While Fitbit certainly has its own set of problems and a lot to work through - indicative of the 70% drop in its stock price over the past year - I don't think Pebble with hurt. On the flip side though, it's far from the game-changing catalyst that Fitbit needs. Amazon Adds HBO, Cinemax The e-commerce juggernaut has added Time Warner's (NYSE: TWX ) HBO and Cinemax to its Amazon Channels platform. The price for each service ($15/mo for HBO, $10/mo for Cinemax) is not changing, and it appears that the main benefit here to customers is convenience. When using Amazon Channels, they can more conveniently flip from one service to the other. Now obviously this isn't a needle-mover for Amazon. But it does help both companies. It helps Time Warner by keeping its platforms in front of the eyes of its customers. For Amazon, it creates a stickier platform, that is to say, \"just one more reason\" to use Amazon or stay on Amazon. For Amazon, that's what it's really all about. That's essentially the theme of Eye on Tech today and this week. Companies keeping their customers' eyes on their product. Be it Facebook, Apple, Netflix or Amazon, the goal is all the same.

      "text": "Apple's Profit Downturn and Negative Customer Opinions Threaten 'Decade-Long Malaise' for Company Friday December 2, 2016 5:17 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Analysts at financial firm Oppenheimer today added to the pile of criticisms aimed at Apple and its current, and future, state of innovation within the technology industry. In a recently published note (via Business Insider ), the firm addressed a few \"strategic issues\" it currently has with Apple, as well as concern for the future trajectory of the company. In the near-future, Oppenheimer believes that iPhone sales will peak, specifically in 2018, and that \"the company lacks the ability to raise prices across its iPhones, iPads and Mac products,\" which is hurting its growth. The firm also described a disharmony between \"Apple's primary role as 'the hardware platform' ... with its secondary role as 'the software and service provider.'\" \"We believe Apple lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging); instead will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone ... We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater.\" While the \"Apple is doomed\" mindset has been prevalent for much of the company's lifespan, the \"universe of negativity\" surrounding the company became more noticeable throughout 2016. In April, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and quarterly revenue since 2003, and although initial shipments of the new Touch Bar MacBook Pro models were reported as strong, subsequent user experiences have largely varied between positive and negative opinions . In October, Apple forecasted a return to growth for the last half of 2016 thanks to the holiday shopping season, potentially putting an end to the company's downturn after its first annual revenue decline since 2001 and three consecutive quarters of negative growth. The constant bright spots in Apple's revenue remain its services category, including the App Store , iCloud , and Apple Music .",

Maybe read this before using it next. Photo by Jaap Arriens, NurPhoto via Getty Images \nStep away from the fake Apple charger -- it could be unsafe. \nA study published by UK business watchdog Trading Standards Friday claimed that 99 percent of counterfeit Apple chargers bought online fail a basic safety test. \nInvestigators purchased 400 Apple chargers from different retailers around the world over the internet and put them through the tests that they would need to pass in order to be sold in shops in the UK. In all, 397 chargers failed. \n\"Criminals across the globe are using online platforms to lure you in with cheap deals for fake items, many of which are dangerous and have been known to overheat and cause house fires,\" said Lord Toby Harris, chairman of Trading Standards, in a statement. \nEven seemingly reputable retailers might not always be safe. In October, Apple filed a lawsuit against online sellers , after it was revealed 90 percent of iPhone chargers sold on Amazon were fake. \nIf you have an iPhone charging cable you bought online, you can use CNET's handy guide to figure out whether or not it is safe. Apple also provides its own guide to help you spot bogus Lightning connectors. \nTo be sure you're buying a bona fide Apple charger, it's best to buy directly from the company or another reliable retailer.

      "text": "Loading the player... The Nasdaq composite tumbled for the second straight session Thursday, falling 1.4%, with semiconductor and software names leading the downside.\nNine of the Nasdaq 100's 10-worst percentage decliners hailed from the chip sector, with losses ranging from 4% to 7%. Microchip ( MCHP ) and Lam Research ( LRCX ) took the biggest hits, falling around 8% each.\nThe S&P 500 eased 0.4%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4%, helped by strength in Goldman Sachs ( GS ). Apple ( AAPL ) lagged in the Dow after Taiwan tech news site DigiTimes reported that Apple is cutting back on production of iPhone 7 handsets.\nPreliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in higher than Wednesday, more so on the Nasdaq.\nAt the New York Mercantile Exchange, January-delivery West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $51.06 a barrel, up $1.62, or 3.3%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points to 2.44% ahead of Friday's jobs report. Economists expected nonfarm payrolls to rise by 170,000, although the estimate range is pretty wide, from 150,000 to 230,000.\nOil and gas producer Parsley Energy ( PE ) reversed lower after a strong start. Shares fell 0.7%. It closed just above a 37.30 buy point after a powerful move higher Wednesday, although Thursday's reversal wasn't good to see so soon after a breakout.\nIn   , Semtech ( SMTC ) bucked weakness in the chip sector after reporting a solid earnings late Wednesday, but a 13% intraday gain faded to 4% by the close. It was featured in the latest Earnings Preview column as an options play.\nThe IBD 50 had a rough go of it as 17 names in the index fell 2% or more. But a slew of financial components in the IBD 50 rose 2% or more, including Bank of the Ozarks ( OZRK ), which topped a 49.07 buy point, and East West Bancorp ( EWBC ).\nUlta Beauty ( ULTA ) rose more than 4% after the close following its earnings report. The company earned $1.40 a share, up 26%. Sales rose 24% to $1.1 million as same-store sales climbed 16.7%. Earnings at the fast-growing retailer were expected to rise 23% to $1.37 a share.\nRELATED :\nApple Cuts iPhone 7 Orders As Sales Slump: Report \nJust One Thing Matters In Friday's Jobs Report",

More than 80 iconic landmarks across 13 countries will join (RED) to promote awareness of the ongoing fight against the AIDS epidemic, by turning red to mark World AIDS Day on December 1. (Photo by Don Arnold/Getty Images for RED) Advertisement \nApple will be participating in Red's AIDS awareness campaign. Its inclusion will also involve some of its games on AppStore. \nFrom November 30 to December 6, twenty games of the tech giant will be utilized as avenues to assist in raising funds for the Red group which is a non-profit organization organized by U2 lead singer Paul Hewson, who is famously known as Bono, and Bobby Shriver last 2005. 50 percent of the revenues accumulated by Red through its game items will be forwarded to the Global Fund , an association launched to address the proliferation of epidemics associated with AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Advertisement \nIt is the aim of this consortium to put an end to the said diseases. Financial proceeds will be used to provide assistance to HIV-affected populations in Ghana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda and South Africa. \nParticipating game apps include Angry Birds 2, Best Fiends, Candy Crush Royale, Clash Clans, Clash Royale, CSR2, Farm Heroes Saga, Farmville, FIFA Mobile, Hay Day, Plants and Zombies, PewDiePie, SIM City, War Dragons and Yahtzee with Buddies. \nAs part of commemorating World AIDS Day on December 1st, around 400 Apple stores will have red logos. The tech company has declared that a dollar will be contributed to a charity partner for every Apple Pay purchase on AppStore. It has been pledged that the Cupertino-based organization will be handing out a million dollars during the occasion. \nIn line with this, the Bank of America will also be giving another million as part of its promotion that involves the use of its cards for Apple Pay transactions done from December 1 to December 7. Advertisement \nApple will also be distributing Red-marked products. The items that are made available include iPhone 7 smart battery cases, iPhone SE cases, Beats Pills with portable speakers and Beats Solo3 wireless headphones. \nSo far, the Red organization has procured around $365 million in its campaign. As one of Red's biggest supporters, Apple has given about $120 million during the last decade.",

      "title": "Watch: Apple's 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar vs. 2015 MacBook Pro",
      "text": "Watch: Apple's 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar vs. 2015 MacBook Pro By Friday, December 02, 2016, 04:42 am PT (07:42 am ET) Apple recently released the first MacBook Pro redesign since 2012, and in typical Apple fashion, there's been some controversy over the new machines. People are talking about are the lack of legacy ports, and the need for adapters to use current devices and accessories. With so many Macbook Pro users waiting for this redesign, AppleInsider takes a closer look and compares the new 15-inch model to the old to see if you should upgrade to the 2016 model, or stick with 2015's version. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in every dimension from the previous model. Even though it's not a huge change on paper, the change is immediately noticeable in person. If your MacBook Pro travels with you, you'll appreciate the smaller footprint. It fits better in laptop bags, where the older 15-inch model can be tight. Even with the smaller and lighter design, the cooling performance isn't compromised. In our normal usage which includes video and photo editing, It was immediately noticeable how much quieter the new machine was. Connected to a 31-inch 4K display, the 2015 model typically sits at 58C with fans fans at 40%. This generates a noticeable hum that can get annoying in quieter rooms, but your sensitivity to the noise may vary. Under the same conditions, the new machine runs 10C cooler and remains perfectly silent. To take it a step further, we transcoded video footage to stress the processors. Under load, the latest Macbook Pro runs at an average of 85C at 50% fan speed. At full \"turbo boost\" speed, the 2015 model runs at an average of 93C with 100% fanspeed and has to slow down it processor to keep it from overheating. Not only is the 2016 MacBook Pro cooler and much quieter, it finished transcoding 10 video clips about 15% faster. The 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro's speakers were one of the best on the market, but Apple has managed to make then even better with the 2016 model, implementing improved loudness, bass, mids, and highs. This new machine has hands down the best speakers available in a laptop this size and has no problem filling a room with sound. Incorporating the DCI-P3 \"Wide Color\" color space, the display has also been improved, granting better color accuracy, contrast and brightness. The benefits of the new display are pronounced if you use your new MacBook Pro in bright rooms or outside. Performance Our new 15\" Macbook has the base 2.6GHZ processor compared to the 2.5ghz in the 2015 model. We started off with Geekbench 4. The new MacBook Pro was actually 8% slower in the CPU Test. With further inspection, even though the processor's base clock is slightly faster the max boost speed is 200 Hz slower, and under full load 400 Hz slower, which is what gave us the benchmark numbers. Real world results, like our transcoding test say something else entirely, as the older MacBook Pro can't keep up the faster speed for long because of heat —so, overall, the new MacBook Pro is faster and cooler. Media editing tasks In Photo editing, both machines edited smoothly using Adobe Lightroom, but the latest Mac 15-inch Macbook was about 8% faster in converting 50 edited raw photos to JPEG. That's not a big difference, as Lightroom along with most photo editing apps are more dependent on the processor and generally don't max out the machines unless you're applying a series of filters. For video editing we see much more of a difference. The latest MacBook Pro is on average about 50% faster with heavier tasks showing the bigger improvements. Rendering a 5-minute 1080p video with luts and film grain applied was 52% faster, and the same project in 4K was 54% faster. A much heavier project with multiple scaled 4K clips with effects was 94% faster. Along with these speed improvements the 2016 Macbook Pro runs cooler and quieter. Entertainment! If you like to play games on your portable machine, the 2015 Macbook with the AMD 460 graphics is about 60% faster in the \"Heaven\" Unreal Engine benchmark, and under BootCamp can play some modern titles like \"Battlefield 1\" with medium-to-high setting at a constant 60FPS —which is something the older model could never do. Dongle life? Gone are the HDMI, Thunderbolt 2, and USB 3 type-A ports along with the SD card reader. Replacing them are 4 Thunderbolt 3 ports that can be adapted to almost any connection. While most users seem to be frustrated by the loss of ports, USB-C is the future. Apple's change to these ports exclusively will drive the market for updated devices and cables much faster than if they would have left some USB ports, similar to the shift to USB with the original iMac. Magsafe is also missing, which was a great feature to have if you're laptop cable is prone to being pulled. If this is critical there are a few third party options for the USB-C Ports. While most users will need at least 1 USB-C to USB-A adapter and SD card reader, many old devices can be used with an updated cable. In our use, this hasn't been a big deal. We do confess, though, that it would have been good if they kept the SD card slot. External Video The new 15-inch MacBook has an advantage of being able to power either four 4K displays, or two 5K displays, like the new LG Ultrafine 5K that we have on order and can't wait to test out. We reviewed the 21-inch 4K model and its a display that technically matches the new MacBook Pro well and allows users to charge the MacBook Pro, send display and audio signals, and connect to additional device with one cable. Battery and charging With regard to battery life, Apple claims the new machine can last up to 10 hours compared to 9 with last year's model. Many users have been reporting worse battery life with regular use. During 4K youtube playback, our 2015 MacBook Pro displayed 21% longer battery life than the 2016 MacBook Pro. If you're on the go you can charge the 2016 MacBook Pro with a USB-C power bank, which is something the 2015 model can't do. Testing the batteries during 4K rendering, the 2016 MacBook Pro lasted 40% longer before dying. So from our testing, during simpler tasks like web browsing, the efficiency of the latest processor doesn't completely make up for the smaller battery. In medium to heavy tasks, the 2016 MacBook Pro stacks up or is better than the older model. Touch Bar After about 2 weeks, we're using the Touch Bar more and more, and do find the extra features useful. The Touch Bar is really responsive and customizable, and the timeline scroll function in Final Cut Pro and skimming through video on YouTube is a big benefit of the feature. There's too many features to list here and initial thoughts of it being gimmicky are gone. Just like Force Touch, as time goes on there will be more uses for this technology, and it will only get better for the user. Typing with the new keyboard The Latest Macbook Pro uses the second generation butterfly key switches —and we feel that the improved switches are great. This new keyboard gives much more physical feedback to the user than the first generation of the technology in the 12-inch MacBook, and that makes all the difference to us. During an online speed test we were slightly more accurate accurate with the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard, even though we have years of experience with the old style keyboard. The new trackpad is absolutely huge, and while I initially thought it to be excessive, I found it limiting going back to the smaller one in the 2015 model. The trackpad's size contributes to ease of use for multi-touch gestures, and we've found the palm rejection works great. Overall from a professional photo and video editing perspective, the 2016 15-inch Macbook Pro is a fantastic redesign and update from last years model. If you've been waiting to upgrade, and if you're trying to decide which model to buy, we would definitely suggest the new model.

      "text": "Fake = dangerous.\nPhoto by Jaap Arriens, NurPhoto via Getty Images Step away from the fake Apple charger -- it could be unsafe.\nA study published by UK business watchdog Trading Standards Friday claimed that 99 percent of counterfeit Apple chargers bought online fail a basic safety test.\nInvestigators purchased 400 Apple chargers from different retailers around the world over the internet and put them through the tests that they would need to pass in order to be sold in shops in the UK. In all, 397 chargers failed.\n\"Criminals across the globe are using online platforms to lure you in with cheap deals for fake items, many of which are dangerous and have been known to overheat and cause house fires,\" said Lord Toby Harris, chairman of Trading Standards, in a statement.\nEven seemingly reputable retailers might not always be safe. In October, Apple filed a lawsuit against online sellers , after it was revealed 90 percent of iPhone chargers sold on Amazon were fake.\nIf you have an iPhone charging cable you bought online, you can use CNET's handy guide to figure out whether or not it is safe. Apple also provides its own guide to help you spot bogus Lightning connectors.\nTo be sure you're buying a bona fide Apple charger, it's best to buy directly from the company or another reliable retailer.\n ",

      "text": "Apple lacks \"courage\" and \" risks to the company have never been greater,\" claims Oppenheimer Apple doom-mongering has kicked up a few notches over the course of 2016. | Topic: Apple \n\"Apple is Doomed!\" \nYou've probably heard that phrase a million times, but a whole raft of analysts believe that the Cupertino giant is headed for the tar pits, and a new note by analysts at Oppenheimer sees a gloomy ten years ahead. See also : How Apple plans to make more money from its cheap iPhone \nThe problem according to the Andrew Uerkwitz at Oppenheimer is a lack of courage to move forward. \n\"We believe Apple lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging); instead will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone.\" \nAnd this is exactly what we've seen over the past few years. Apple is more and more focused on selling iPhones, while letting the remainder of its hardware lineup stagnate through lack of attention. Sure, Apple has revamped the MacBook Pro , but the rest of its computer offering is stale. \nUnder CEO Tim Cook's stewardship, Apple is yet to release a hit product. The iPad - which was released when Steve Jobs was at the helm - is tanking, and the Apple Watch remains little more than a drop in the ocean in terms of both sales and profitability. \nThe note goes on to say: \n\"We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater.\" \nSo, when's the malaise due to kick off? \n2018 is a critical point, according to Oppenheimer. This is when iPhone sales are expected to peak, thanks to \"one last 'growth' hurrah from the tenth-anniversary phone,\" but after this Apple is going to begin to suffer because it can't raise iPhone prices (some analysts already feel the iPhone is getting too expensive to make ), is faced with falling Mac and iPad sales, and has difficulty balancing out \"Apple's primary role as 'the hardware platform'... with its secondary role as 'the software and service provider.'\" \nThe problem plaguing Apple is the continual question of \"what next?\" Over the past 16 years Apple has launched the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad, and the Apple Watch, and over that time has kept the Mac line sort-of refreshed, moved to releasing a free Mac operating system every year, launched a music and content business, and developed a cloud strategy. \nBut it's never enough. And with iPhone sales showing all the signs of weakening, the pressure on Apple to deliver the \"one more thing\" that will keep the billions flowing into the company increases daily. \nDespite the overall depressed tone, Oppenheimer believes that the next iPhone, along with strong profitability, and the big pile of cash the Apple is sitting on, that this will keep investors interested, and as such it is not changing it's \"perform\" rating for Apple.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nA daily digest of IT news, curated from blogs, forums and news sites around the web each morning. We highlight the key commentary and demystify the real story. Apple using drones to take on Google Maps Computerworld | Dec 2, 2016 3:53 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Thinkstock Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! \nIt's a bird! It's a plane! It's an Apple drone! \nExpect to be saying that more in the future, as Apple launches drones to improve its Maps app, which has long been thought of as playing second fiddle to Google's more robust map app. Well, now Apple is aiming to finally close that gap, and they will be using drones to do it. \nIn IT Blogwatch, we get a little lost. \nWhat exactly is happening? Shrey Pacheco has the background : Apple may be planning on take on Google’s extensive mapping services by using drones. According to a report...the company is putting together a team of robotics and data collection experts...this team will use drones to capture and update its map information faster than its existing fleet of minivans. \nAnd how will the drones create a better Maps? Mark Gurman and Alan Levin have the details : Apple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction...The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users. ... Since Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by...updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber...and OpenTable...The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort. \nAny details on how exactly Apple is going to use these drones? Not a whole lot, but Mike Murphy tells us what he knows : Apple was granted permission to fly drones by the...FAA in March...The company’s original application to the FAA does not go into much detail...saying just that they would do “aerial data collection, photography, and videography.” ... Apple’s...application says it intends to use 11 different models of drones—some quadcopters, some fixed-wing drones—to capture information...There is no indication that Apple intends to build its own drones. \nAren't there a bunch of restictions on drone flying, though? Lee Mathews knows what's up : There are several caveats: drones must be flown by professionals who remain within the line of sight, flying is mostly limited to daylight hours, and...drones aren’t supposed to...fly over people or buildings. \nSo how is Apple supposed to update Maps with those limitations? April Glaser might know : Right now...it's illegal to fly drones over populated areas and near airports, although the rules are still being written...This month the FAA is expected to release a proposal for new rules that would dictate how drones will be allowed to fly over people. If Apple truly does hope to use drones to improve Maps, the company will...have to get involved in the FAA rulemaking process. \nIs Apple improving Maps in any other ways? Tonya Riley fills us in : More than...enhancing its outdoor maps, Apple is...advancing an indoor mapping system for public places like museums and airports, though that probably won’t involve drones whizzing by your face. \nSo when will these changes start to roll out to users? Jake Smith has that info : If all goes to plan, Apple is expected to launch the new...features in 2017. Apple is...focused on improving in-car navigation, as well. One feature will offer better guidance for changing lanes while driving. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page , LinkedIn page and Twitter stream .

      "text": "Tweet \nWhen the time comes to buy a charger for your Apple device, you better make sure that what you are getting is the real deal. Why? A new report from UK's Chartered Trading Standards Institute says that the vast majority of counterfeit chargers for Apple products are not safe to use. \nCTSI purchased 400 fake chargers from suppliers across the globe and discovered that 397 of them -- or 99.25 percent -- fail to meet what it considers a \"basic safety test\". In other words, if you use one to top the battery on your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, MacBook or other Apple product you risk damaging the device -- or worse. \n\"Only buy second-hand electrical goods that have been tested and only buy online electrical goods from trusted suppliers\", says CTSI chief executive Leon Livermore. \"It might cost a few pounds more but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one\". \nGlobal independent safety science company UL purchased chargers from eight countries -- a list which includes Australia, Canada, China and US -- and conducted multiple tests to check the difference in voltage between input and output. Only three of them kept the current below the required threshold. The other 397 suffer from \"insufficient isolation with potential for electric shock\". \nIn the second-hand market, CTSI says that 15 percent of the 3,019 tested goods are non-compliant. The number raises to 27 percent in London. The institute also says that it looked at traders believed have a low level of compliance, but also at major chains and dealers. \nCTSI provides a couple of recommendations regarding the things that you should look for, including the distance between pins, proper markings, and warnings and instructions. But, when you are shopping for a charger, keep in mind that it may be hard to tell whether you are looking at an original product or not. \nCounterfeit copies can be very well made and hard to identify unless you know what to look for. And, when buying online, there is a very good chance that you could see the photo of the real product and get something else instead. Also, when you need a charger right away, the rush to buy something as soon as possible may make you ignore the warning signs. \nPersonally, I would recommend buying new chargers only from official dealers. But, if you want to buy second-hand, make sure the seller can provide some proof as to the origin of the charger: ask to see a the receipt for the charger or the device it came from. If it is a third-party charger, make sure that it is approved by Apple. \nAlso, shop around for a charger before you pull the trigger on one. Chances are, you may not pay as much as you think for an original one. Last but not least -- however, don't hold me responsible for this in case something goes awry -- in the case of smartphones and tablets you could get away with an original charger from a different manufacturer, if the voltage and amperage on it match the ones Apple lists on its own chargers. They pass the same basic safety tests, even though they do not come from the same company, and should work the same, save for some advanced features like quick charging support.",

      "text": "Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo \nLast month, Apple said that nearly 90 percent of the Apple-branded chargers sold on Amazon are actually fake . As a result, we suggested that our readers make sure they purchase their chargers direct from Apple, since third-party chargers might be seriously dangerous. Now there’s strong evidence that, if you have a fake charger, it is dangerous. \nIn fact, Trading Standards recently asked investigators from a company named UL to examine 400 fake Apple chargers to see just how safe they really are. Out of 400, a shocking three of them — only three! — were found to provide enough protection against electric shock, according to the BBC . The report warns that fake chargers can put the lives of users at risk. \nIt’s true. In fact, it seems that most of the reports we cover that involve fire from mobile phones seem to be the result of a third-party charger or battery. It’s imperative that you use approved chargers and batteries with electronic devices, especially as they become more powerful with advanced charging technologies, bigger batteries and more power demands. Otherwise, you’re basically playing with a ticking fire bomb. Stop buying third-party chargers \nThird-party chargers may be appealing because of their price. They often cost much, much less than a marked-up Apple charger, after all. But there’s no reason to buy them. You’re putting your own life at risk. If Apple and other manufacturers are wise, maybe they’ll think about dropping the prices of first-party chargers in order to help squash the demand for, and sales of, dangerous knock-offs.",

Safety specialists UL tested 400 counterfeit chargers bought from 8 countries—including the U.S., China and Australia—and found that only three had enough insulation to guard against electric shocks. Trading Standards, the group that commissioned the study, warned buyers to be wary of chargers that don’t seem to fit easily into a socket or don’t bear a manufacturer’s logo and safety certification mark. They also warned that some safety markings are being faked, recommending that buyers check to see if their charger comes with instructions that include conditions for proper use, basic electrical safety advice, and details about how to dispose of the device safely. Apple is currently suing one third-party vendor that the company said put customers “at risk” with its counterfeit power adapters on Amazon.",

What better way to celebrate to your health, than by keeping things simple and pure—with my Apple Cider Delight Smoothie Recipe . As we know, apple cider is one of those drinks that is just so easy to get overly fancy with, as far as unhealthy add-ons. Let’s keep it clean this season and avoid the downward exhaustion spiral that occurs with sugary holiday drinks- there’s already more sugary food in general! Pick your treats wisely :)…and your body will thank you and you’ll avoid feeling overly heavy and bloated! Therefore, you’ll be apt to be more cheerful at these cheery events, instead of feeling internally yucky, and that is truly priceless. To Buy Or Not To Buy \nAs we all know, apple cider is an amazing way to warm up during the colder months . When it comes to making this smoothie, the decision is yours to make on whether you want to find a healthy apple cider recipe that is Beauty Detox approved, or if you want to find an organic brand at your local health food store. \nOne thing I can’t stress enough, is to make sure you are reading the labels of store bought. Many times there is large amounts of ADDED sugar in apple cider and that is something we want to avoid as much as possible. \nWhen you are use to eating clean, apple cider is already sweet enough—due to that fact that it’s essentially apple juice. So definitely no refined sugar needed!! If you should decide to get all domestic and want to make it yourself, it’s very important to source an organic apple juice base. Remember, apples are one of the Dirty Dozen produce items, and this means they are one of the most highly pesticide-sprayed crops ( scary! ). \nHoliday beverages (including this festive smoothie), should be limited. We don’t want to overdue it, since they are really meant as a treat and not a staple in our beauty routines. Prepare your ingredients. Add your apple cider base. Add the banana. Add the one date (okay, just one itty bitty date to make it extra sweet!). Next, add the cinnamon. Then add the pinch of nutmeg. Enjoy! \nRemember, there is always room for improvisation with apple cider—whether you make your own or buy it. If you’re as enamored with apples and cider as I am, you’re going to want to find more than one way to drink it this season. For now, let’s start with this one! 😉 Let’s get blending….

      "text": "| Follow About | \nAppleholic, (noun), æp·əl-hɑl·ɪk: An imaginative person who thinks about what Apple is doing, why and where it is going. Delivering popular Apple-related news, advice and entertainment since 1999. Friends don’t let friends buy fake Apple chargers An astonishing 99% of fake Apple chargers sold are unsafe, standards body warns Computerworld | Dec 2, 2016 4:39 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nYou had one job...I only asked you to recharge the smartphone! \nDon’t buy or use fake Apple device chargers as an astonishing 99 percent of them are unsafe and their use puts you at risk, a global safety body warns today. Danger warning \nIn tests conducted by Illinois-based firm UL and commissioned by the UK Trading Standards organization , all but three of 400 fake chargers sold as being made by Apple failed basic safety tests. \nThese fakes are dangerous. \n“During a recent operation investigators bought 400 counterfeit Apple chargers from suppliers around the world, online, and found that 397 of them failed a basic safety test,” the organization warned . \nIt found them likely to cause electric shock or burst into flames if exposed to high voltage, typical in a power surge. Fake as sold \nThe warning emerges just weeks since Apple filed suit against Mobile Star for manufacturing fake chargers sold through Amazon. \nApple purchased and tested over 100 Lightning cables and chargers marked \" Fulfilled by Amazon \" across nine months. It found 90 percent of them were fake (even though one was sold through Amazon as “original”). \n“Unlike genuine Apple products, they are not subjected to industry-standard consumer safety testing and are poorly constructed with inferior or missing components, flawed design, and inadequate electrical insulation,” Apple told the court. (I still wish Apple would make a wider selection of chargers/cables .) \nWay back in 2014, Ken Shirriff tore down a bunch of fake chargers to compare these with the originals. He found that Apple’s chargers used better components, were better built, and had more electrical insulation crammed inside than cheap and unsafe fakes. His post is still an essential read if you want to understand why these things are dangerous. Explosive situation \nThere have been multiple claims of incendiary iPhones since Samsung utterly failed customers by inadequate testing of the batteries used in its life-threatening Galaxy Note 7 devices . This is an equivalence that does not exist. \nApple investigates these reports, so it does seem incredibly revealing that the first step it took while investigating them was to launch litigation against makers of fake charging devices. It would be easy to speculate that fake charging devices are the primary cause of those rarely reported iPhone explosions. \nLord Toby Harris, chair of National Trading Standards, said: “Criminals across the globe are using online platforms to lure you in with cheap deals for fake items, many of which are dangerous and have been known to overheat and cause house fires.\" Complicated lives \nModern life is complicated, and the devices we use are also complex. A cable is not just “a cable”, it is a complex product that may contain small quantities of RAM, a processor and more. \nCharging devices contain similar complexities and should be built to handle quite complex power management tasks. This means that when you buy a cheap non-branded power adaptor you are taking a big risk: that's made even worse when you purchase a fake adaptor that is being sold as being the genuine article. How to buy legitimate devices \nWhat can you do to ensure you aren’t using a fake charging device? Purchasing advice Always purchase charging devices from the manufacturer of the device you wish to charge, if possible. When purchasing an Apple charger check for the signs of counterfeiting such as mistakes in brand names or logos. Check that plugs carry appropriate safety warnings and are correctly spelt. It may help to compare charging devices and cables you are thinking about purchasing to those you know to be genuine. If you do purchase a charger from vendors who are not the manufacturer, be wary of deals that are too good to be true and read reviews of the seller before you make a purchase More advice on buying these things. Usage advice Never use a charger that is damaged Never use a damaged cable Be careful that pins on the plug fit securely without using excessive force. Never cover a device that is being charged Unplug your chargers when not in use \nThese cheap chargers may cost a little less, but the cost in damage to you or your devices may be immense. \nGoogle+?

      "text": "Email Posted Dec. 02, 2016, at 9:42 a.m. \nDOVER-FOXCROFT — In late 2014, Foxcroft Academy was named an Apple Distinguished School for a two-year designation ending in 2016. This year will not be the end. The school’s distinction as an ADS will continue for another two-year term. \nIn a letter received from Emilio Umeoka, vice president of Apple Education, he states, “The administration and faculty at Foxcroft Academy have shown that they demonstrate the Five Best Practices of an Apple Distinguished School: visionary leadership, innovative learning and teaching, ongoing professional learning, compelling evidence of success, and a flexible learning environment.” \nFoxcroft Academy is honored to receive this distinction for a second straight cycle. \n“We were the first school in Maine to offer 1:1 iPads to our students and our commitment to innovative learning has not wavered,” said Arnold Shorey, FA Head of School, in a press release. “Our teachers and students use these Apple devices as tools in the classroom of today, with the thought of what will be done tomorrow. This separates us from many high schools and academies in the state.” Story continues below advertisement. \nThrough innovative practices and experiences, FA students are empowered to direct the path of their own learning as they collaborate with a faculty excited to work with individuals or small groups for independent study or enrichment. \nNew for our teachers this year is Apple Teacher, which offers tips, inspiration, news, and learning materials to help unlock the magic of Mac, iPad, and built-in apps in the classroom. \nStudents and FA faculty live the Apple education mission everyday to provide a learning environment that supports the way students live and how they want to learn. \n\nThis post was contributed by a community member.

      "text": "Comment Elon Musk beats out Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Steve Jobs as the most admired tech leader in a survey among 700 founders. Web Summit via Flickr \nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk beats out Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Steve Job as the most admired tech leader among 700 founders. The survey by VC firm First Round Capital was conducted from August to September 2016 and published just recently. \nMusk received 23 percent of the votes . Amazon's Jeff Bezos was way behind at only 10 percent. He was followed by Zuckerberg with just 6 percent and Jobs got 5 percent. Another Facebook executive, Sheryl Sandberg was the most cited female with one percent. According to the Country Caller , Musk was described by the San Francisco-based firm as \"more revolutionary than the legendary Steve Jobs\". \nMusk is nothing short of an ambitious businessman. He has several unearthly goals up his sleeves. From setting up a global high-speed internet connection through thousands of satellites to establishing a colony on Mars by 2024. SpaceX wants to be the first one to send an unmanned spacecraft to the famous Red Planet by 2018. The company has also been a constant partner of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In fact, SpaceX has been striking deals with NASA. According to Recode , they are set to launch satellites \"that will monitor the earth's surface water and climate change\". \nBut this is not to say that SpaceX did not suffer from any hurdles along the way. Their rocket has exploded a few months ago. The investigation is still underway and the definite cause is yet to be determined. Though the said Falcon 9 rocket is planned to be launched on Dec. 16 since the incident. \nAs for Tesla, the US automaker had a good third quarter earnings . Musk was also instrumental for the company's shareholders to vote in favor of SolarCity's acquisition . Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system hit the news after a fatal crash incident that involved a driver while using the said technology. Germany even sent a letter to Tesla owners and reminded them to not rely entirely on the Autopilot. \nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles has also a proposed regulations that would prohibit Tesla and other carmakers to use the word \"auto-pilot\" or \"self-driving\". Apparently, they are only misleading consumers as they are being used in marketing. Still, Musk just confirmed that Tesla will be releasing an Enhanced Autopilot feature. This is a step towards the company's goal of fully autonomous cars. \nImagine once Musk is able to achieve those feats regarding Mars and cars, he will be admired much more.",

      "text": "Why The Race To Wireless 5G? The Internet Of Things (Investor's Business Daily) \nExpectations are for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL )'s iPhone 8 to involve a major redesign and upgrade , with the main enhancement being a flexible edge-to-edge OLED display. \nApple may need to raise the price of this model “to avoid margin compression,” Bernstein’s Toni Sacconaghi said in a report. He has an Outperform rating on the company and a price target of $135. The OLED Display \nInvestors have been wondering whether there would be sufficient OLED screen capacity for Apple next year and the number of models of OLED phones the company could offer. Samsung would likely be the main supplier of OLED screens for Apple in 2017–2018, and the company seems to have “enough capacity to provide Apple with OLED screens for its entire iPhone lineup,” Sacconaghi stated. \nThe analyst estimated the cost of a large screen flexible OLED display at more than ~$50 for Apple, which compared with $20 for a similarly-sized rigid TFT-LCD display. He added, “Given other expected feature enhancements to iPhone 8, we believe that it will be imperative for Apple to raise price on the offering to avoid margin compression.” \nIt would unclear whether Apple would limit OLED to one offering, because it may be unable to secure enough supply or because “across the board OLED offerings (accompanied by a necessary price hike) might ultimately prove inelastic,” Sacconaghi added.

John Sculley was CEO. \nThe ad suggests that Apple was having trouble making enough Macs. \n\"When Apple Computer developed the Macintosh, we knew a lot of people would want one. We just didn't figure they'd all want one at once,\" the ad says.\nThe classified goes on to list requirements, including two years' supervisory experience, and assembly programming skills.\nThe best part? The minimum salary was $24,000, or about $56,000 today.\nCheck out the help wanted ad for yourself. We'd guess the position has been filled by now: \nRAW Embed \n \n \nNOW WATCH: What those tiny rivets on your jeans are for \n",

      "text": "Steve Jobs and John Sculley AP \nA fun piece of Apple history was uncovered hiding behind a mirror in Silicon Valley. \nWhen Reddit user polar8 took down his bathroom mirror while renovating, he discovered some old copies of the San Jose Mercury News from July, 1984 nestled behind it. \nOne of the help wanted ads in those old newspapers was for a senior engineer position at Apple Computer, which was at that time, an 8-year old company that had just launched the Macintosh, the first home computer with a mouse. John Sculley was CEO. \nThe ad suggests that Apple was having trouble making enough Macs. \n\"When Apple Computer developed the Macintosh, we knew a lot of people would want one. We just didn't figure they'd all want one at once,\" the ad says. \nThe classified goes on to list requirements, including two years' supervisory experience, and assembly programming skills. \nThe best part? The minimum salary was $24,000, or about $56,000 today. \nCheck out the help wanted ad for yourself. We'd guess the position has been filled by now:",

      "text": "A third-party charger for Apple gadgets may be a lot cheaper than the ones hanging off shelves at the Apple Store, but a vast majority of those chargers aren't safe, a new study has concluded.\nThe Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), a UK association representing trading standards professionals, has tested 400 counterfeit chargers for Apple products, the BBC reported Friday. The result was pitiful: Only three chargers were insulated well enough to protect against electric shocks.\nSEE ALSO: This portable charger is powered by energy created with your hand\nAnother test targeted second-hand goods in local shops, and found that 15% of 3,019 electrical goods were non-compliant with UK standards. Considering the potential danger, a counterfeit charger could cost you your home or even your life.\nLeon Livermore, the CEO of CTSI, warned in a statement on the Trading Standards website against using second-hand and counterfeit electronics goods, which could \"cost you your home or even your life.\"\nA counterfeit charger could cost you your home or even your life.\nAnd Gillian Guy, CEO of UK consumer organization Citizens Advice , which gives people advice and information on a number of issues, including consumer rights, warned consumers to avoid counterfeit goods.\n\"Look out for tell-tale signs of counterfeiting such as mistakes in brand names or logos, and check plugs for safety marks — all genuine electrical items made in the EU should have a CE mark on them,\" he said in a statement.\nIt's unclear, however, how \"counterfeit\" chargers, which were bought online from eight countries, were defined in the testing. Chargers and other Apple accessories range from extremely cheap, no-name products to quality, branded products that are built by a third-party manufacturer. In other words, there may be a big difference between using a cheap plug from an unknown brand and using a plug meant for a Samsung Galaxy to charge your iPhone.\nIt's also unclear whether the chargers tested were for iPhones, MacBooks, other Apple devices or all of the above.\nWe've contacted CTSI to find more about the methodology, but have not yet heard from them.\nA recent Apple lawsuit targeted a manufacturer of counterfeit Apple chargers, warning that such devices are not built to standards and \"pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.\"\nIn the suit, Apple claimed that nearly 90 percent out of the chargers and other Apple accessories it has purchased on Amazon were fake.\nBONUS: Getting up close and personal with the iPhone 7 Plus",

      "text": "Consortium forms out of worries Apple could monopolize AMOLED supply with future iPhones   06:30 am PT (09:30 am ET) Several major Chinese smartphone vendors are forming a consortium with a supplier to invest in AMOLED production in 2017, mainly out of worries that Apple will end up monopolizing panel supplies with upcoming iPhones, according to reports. Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, and BBK will be cooperating with panel maker Royole on joint investment in AMOLED production, said DigiTimes , citing Chinese media. The concern isn't so much 2017 —when the first OLED-based iPhone is expected to premiere —as 2018 to 2020, when persistent demand by Apple is expected to put a crimp on what other smartphone makers can obtain, and potentially handicap their production plans. Royole is already said to be expanding its AMOLED capacity to 45,000 units for 2017, and planning new production lines in 2018. BBK has meanwhile created an independent subsidiary to concentrate on panel production, which is reportedly aiming to hit a 60,000-unit AMOLED capacity between 2017 and 2019. Apple is rumored to be preparing not two but three flagship iPhone models for next year, though only one of them, a 5.1- or 5.2-inch variant, is predicted to use OLED. High-quality OLED panels can still be expensive, in part because most suppliers are still building up capacity. The OLED model is expected to feature an edge-to-edge display, and it along with other iPhones may gain wireless charging, something long present on higher-end Android phones. Topics:",

      "text": "If Apple is slashing semiconductor orders, TSMC would bear the most impact. Is this what's happening? TAIPEI — It’s comforting to know that the sky is not falling yet. \nEarly this morning, I became alarmed when I saw a headline scrolling across my TV screen saying ‘ Chipmakers Tumble Most Since June on Report Apple Cut Orders ’. As a diligent reporter, I of course was skeptical and checked immediately with my sources. \nIf Apple is slashing semiconductor orders, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) would bear the most impact. The world’s biggest foundry has Apple as its largest customer and is probably the sole supplier of Apple’s latest A10 processor. \nTSMC spokesperson Elizabeth Sun, as a matter of course, said that her company cannot comment on individual customers. Elizabeth and I go through this routine frequently. \nI checked with a number of analysts who follow TSMC and the smartphone business, and not one said that they are aware of Apple axing chip orders. Orders typically decline during the post-Christmas holiday season in line with expectations, they said. \nThe strongest note of warning came from analyst Andrew Lu, who recently left Barclays to write as a technology analyst for Smartkarma. \n“Apple will no longer be a driver,” Lu said in a phone conversation with me. “There hasn’t been anything new coming from Apple since Steve Jobs passed away.” \nThe ‘Chipmakers Tumble’ report from Bloomberg News cited above was based on an earlier story from Taiwan’s Digitimes news service that said Apple is cutting orders amid fading sales momentum. Bloomberg did not note any additional sources of information in the Digitimes report. Even so, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index plummeted 4.9 percent as all 30 members fell, the Bloomberg story said. \nI’ve been following Digitimes for more than two decades now, and I think it’s fair to say that Digitimes is wrong about as much as it is right. It’s amazing that a news service in Taiwan can have such a huge impact on global financial markets. Or maybe other factors were involved. It’s always hard to say what moves stock markets. The Bloomberg story added that large-cap technology shares have been falling since the U.S. presidential election amid concerns about Donald Trump’s trade policy, regulatory risks and Silicon Valley’s relationship with the White House. \nBe that as it may, financial analysts I contacted said things don’t look all that bad.",

      "text": "Raymus Munt/YouTube \nIt should go without saying, but if you buy a spare charger for your iPhone or iPad, you should absolutely make sure it’s from a known, reputable company.\nYour latest reminder of this comes from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute , a UK consumer protection organization that teamed up with Illinois-based safety testers UL to examine 400 “counterfeit Apple chargers” from various suppliers.\nAccording to the study , all but three of the 400 counterfeit chargers failed a “basic” safety test, in which high voltages were applied to the chargers to see if they had enough isolation to protect against electric shocks.\nThe study comes just a few weeks after Apple reportedly conducted its own study on third-party power accessories, and found that roughly 90% of Apple chargers and cables sold through Amazon were unsafe. CNET and Bloomberg recently reported that Amazon is trying to take more concrete steps to prevent the sale of those knockoff devices.\nRaymus Munt/YouTube Whatever the case, fake chargers are still more common than they should be today. The CTSI has a few simple tips for ensuring yours is safe — making sure it plugs in smoothly, that its pin size isn’t abnormally large or small, that it has the appropriate commission (FCC, CE, etc.) and manufacturing markings, that it has detailed safety warnings and instructions, and so on.\nThe simplest thing you can do, though, is to simply buy from a big name. Here’s a crude, but generally effective tip: If you don’t know them, they don’t own a website that looks professional, and you can’t find any stories about them on Google, stay away.\nGetting chargers and cables directly from Apple is the easiest thing to do. Especially on the cable side, if you don’t want to pay the premium Apple often slaps on, look for accessories with Apple’s MFi (Made for iPhone/iPad/iPod) certification on its packaging. \nRaymus Munt/YouTube If you buy a device on Amazon, using a site like Fakespot to ensure its user reviews are legitimate can’t hurt, either. Apple has a set of tips on how to avoid counterfeit charging accessories on its site as well.\nAnecdotally, I’ve used chargers from Anker, Monoprice, and AmazonBasics for years without any issues. There are others, but the point is that, while it’s possible to get a reliable, speedy Apple charger without paying as much as Apple charges, you shouldn’t cheap out — especially since this is a safety concern, for both you and the products you're charging.\n“Sadly, we suspect our work is just skimming the surface and we urge consumers to be vigilant when buying electrical products online: be wary of deals that look too good to be true and search for reviews of the seller before making your purchase,” said Lord Toby Harris, chair of the UK’s National Trading Standards, in a statement.\nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 December 2, 2016, 9:44 A.M. ET Qualcomm: Apple’s Gonna Dump Intel if They Keep Lagging, Says Northland By Tiernan Ray \nOne Street observer this morning thinks yesterday’s sharp sell-off in tech names was a great opportunity to pick up a valuable name, Qualcomm ( QCOM ). \nQualcomm shares yesterday closed down $3.97, or almost 6%, at $64.16. The stock is down 16 cents at $69.06 this morning. \nNorthland Capital Markets ’s Tom Sepenzis today urges investors to “buy on the dip” Qualcomm’s shares, which he rates Outperform, with a $75 price target. \n“Expansion into new markets including the IoT, automotive and eventually, the server market add several avenues for upside over the next few years,” for Qualcomm, he writes. \nSepenzis, moreover, thinks Qualcomm is going to come out on top in the war for mobile baseband modem chips, where Intel ( INTC ) has lately been its biggest obstacle. \nIntel, you’ll recall, this year won part of the business to supply the modem in Apple’s ( AAPL ) iPhone that Qualcomm had previously had to itself for several iterations of the device. \nBut Sepenzis points to reports that Intel’s modem is slower than Qualcomm’s, and thinks Apple might cut off Intel if it continues to lag Qualcomm: There have been several reports over the past month that have compared the speeds associated with both the INTC and QCOM modems in their respective iPhone models, with INTC coming up short. Apple apparently has throttled the speeds on the QCOM modems to keep the experience consistent across carriers, with the QCOM X12 modem capable of 600 mb/s while the INTC XMM 3360 modem tops out at 450 mb/ s. While Apple will certainly keep a second source if possible, it isn’t going to do so for too long if it has to handicap half of its devices. This should give QCOM a path towards recapturing all of Apple over the next two years if Intel doesn’t find an answer. Currently, the next generation INTC XMM 7480 modem is still capped at 450 mb/s. QCOM has already introduced the X16 modem, capable of 1 gb/s, the first gigabit modem.",

      "text": "  Another Company Is Bearish on Apple's Long-Term Future Oppenheimer joins UBS in questioning Apple’s long-term strategy by Bryan M. Wolfe December 2, 2016 \nConcerns about Apple’s long-term future were on display in a “brutal” note about “strategic issues” from the analysts at Oppenheimer. This comes just days after USB also expressed concerns about the iPhone maker, according to Business Insider . \nIn the strongly worded note to investors, Oppenheimer explains: \nWe believe Apple lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging); instead will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone … We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater. \nAt the heart of Oppenheimer’s concern is the belief that iPhone sales will peak in 2018. They couple this with Apple’s inability to raise prices across its iPhone, iPad, and Mac lines, and see a clash between “Apple’s primary role as ‘the hardware platform’… with its secondary role as ‘the software and service provider.'” \nEarlier this week, USB’s Steve Milunovich offered similar concerns in a long-ranging Business Insider interview. \nI also have concerns about Apple. While 2017 should be a very good year for Cupertino thanks to the “iPhone 8,” what comes next is blurry, at best. \nWhat’s the “one more thing” we’ll be talking about in 12 or 16 months? Anybody?

      "text": "A proposal to name a street after the late Apple chief executive and co-founder Steve Jobs has divided the leftist city council of a Paris district.\nThe local district mayor wants to call one of several new streets around the vast Halle Freyssinet high-tech startup hub the “Rue Steve Jobs” in honor of the U.S. inventor of the iPhone who died in 2011.\nBut Green and Communist local councilors in Paris’s 13th district don’t like the idea because of Apple’s aapl social and fiscal practices.\n“Steve Jobs was chosen because of his impact on the development of personal computing and because he was a real entrepreneur,” said a spokeswoman for mayor Jerome Coumet, defending the proposal.\nShe said other streets would be named after British computer scientist and code-breaker Alan Turing, U.K. mathematician and computer pioneer Ada Lovelace, U.S. naval officer and computer programming pioneer Grace Murray Hopper, and French civil engineer Eugene Freyssinet, who invented pre-stressed concrete.\nLeftist councilors are not impressed however by Jobs’ reputation and heritage.\nThey criticized working conditions at Apple’s Chinese subcontractors as well as the iPhone maker’s alleged tax avoidance methods in Ireland, which have come under fire from the European Commission.\n“The choice of Steve Jobs is misplaced in light of the heritage he has left behind,” communist local councilors said in a statement.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nThe Paris city council, in which leftist parties have a majority, will take a vote on the issue sometime next week.\n“Steve Jobs is not a perfect man, but he has changed our daily lives by popularizing computers, the mouse and the smartphone,” Coumet said on his Twitter twtr feed.\nHalle Freyssinet, a former freight railway station designed in 1929, will become one of Europe’s biggest start-up hubs and will house some 1,000 start-ups when it opens early next year.",

      "text": "iPhones Mysteries of the GPU in Apple's iPhone 7 are unlocked Apple's GPU in the A10 Fusion chip used in the iPhone 7 is based on the same architecture used in the A9 chip, with tweaks for the speed boost U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 2, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 7 and AirPod earbuds Credit: Susie Ochs WWDC 2015: The top 3 biggest reveals \nUsers have praised the performance of Apple’s A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7, but its underlying graphics architecture may not be so new after all. \nThe GPU in the iPhone 7 uses a custom version of the PowerVR GT7600 GPU, which is based on the same graphics processor architecture as in last year’s iPhone 6S and 6S Plus , according to an analysis by The Linley Group, which specializes in semiconductors. [ Get the most from your iPad: Visual guide: The iPad's new split-screen multitasking . • How iOS 9 solves the dilemma between iPad and laptops . • iPad face-off: Microsoft Office vs. Apple iWork vs. Google Apps . ] \nApple has claimed that the A10 Fusion CPU is two times faster than its predecessor, the A9, and the GPU about 50 percent faster. \nBenchmarking has revealed a mixed bag for A10 Fusion GPU’s performance, according to the analyst firm. Some benchmarks supported Apple’s GPU performance gain claims, and others fell way off. But the high levels of GPU performance are only temporary. \nThe big problem is Apple’s GPU can’t sustain its peak performance for long without concerns of overheating, Linley Gwennap, founder and principal analyst at Linley Group, said in a research note this week. \nApple has been amassing in-house graphics experts to improve the GPU technology in mobile devices. Apple made tweaks in the PowerVR GT7600 GPU architecture—which it licensed from Imagination Technologies—to improve performance. \nGwennap estimates Apple increased clock speed by 50 percent to get those performance gains. The custom Apple GPU blows away competitors when operating at peak speed, but it can’t sustain that performance. \n“We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users,” Gwennap said. \nThe A10 Fusion GPU has six cores and operates at around 900MHz. It cranks up the frequency to reach peak speed. \nThe next advance in Apple’s GPUs would be to adopt the architecture underlying Imagination’s next-generation PowerVR Series8 GPU Family. Imagination has released PowerVR Series8XE GPUs for low-cost devices but hasn’t released a high-performance successor, which in theory would be based on the same architecture. \nThat raises questions about how Apple will proceed with its next custom GPU. The underlying PowerVR Series8 architecture has many structural changes from its predecessor, the Series7. Series8 is tuned for VR and other emerging applications, and it supports the latest APIs like Vulkan. Apple has shown no interest yet in Vulkan, which is becoming a standard in game development. \nLinley Group placed the Adreno 530 GPU in Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 ahead of the Apple’s latest GPU in overall size, power efficiency, and performance metrics. \nThe size of the chip is an important metric because it “controls both cost and power, so Adreno’s efficiency edge should benefit both customers and end users,” Gwennap said. \nDavid Kanter, an analyst for Real World Technologies, also detailed some advances in Apple’s GPU on his website. The tweaks differentiate Apple GPUs from generic PowerVR GPU designs. Apple formerly licensed generic PowerVR designs for earlier A-series chips until it started tweaking the underlying architecture that defines those GPUs. \nApple’s tweaks ensure the A10 Fusion GPU can calculate faster and also ensures harmony with Apple’s Metal API, which brings better special effects and visuals to the company’s iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple TV. \nThe A10 Fusion GPU offers superior 16-bit floating-point performance and data conversion functions. The company also uses a custom shader compiler and graphics driver. \n“The proprietary design enables Apple to deliver best-in-class performance for graphics, and other tasks that use the GPU, such as image processing and machine learning,” Kanter wrote. \nApple is trying to make a GPU that works best with its hardware and software, much like it has done with its CPU, Kanter said. It’s taken tighter control of its entire product stack, and customizing the GPU was the next logical step. This benefits users, who get a better gaming and graphics experience. \nBenchmark results vary depending on the test performed, and device-specific tweaks may not measure well. But as a graphics architecture, PowerVR is falling out of favor to mobile device makers, and Apple’s tweaks to the underlying chip design may ultimately hold the key to the architecture’s future. \nApple previously was in talks to acquire Imagination Technologies, but the negotiations went nowhere.

      "text": "Loading the player... Stocks shed most of their gains in the final hour of trading, with Apple ( AAPL ) once again turning lower even as RV makers powered ahead.\nThe Nasdaq rose 0.2% after climbing more than 0.6% intraday to a fresh all-time high intraday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average edged up more than 0.1%. Volume was tracking higher across the board vs. the same time Monday.\nGaming software, medical stocks and makers of mobile homes/recreational vehicles led the upside in today's stock market action while metals miners, solar and oil lagged. West Texas intermediate crude prices sank nearly 4% to $45.23 a barrel amid reports that a production-cut deal may be in jeopardy ahead of an OPEC meeting Wednesday in Vienna.\nUnitedHealth Group ( UNH ) was the Dow's biggest gainer, gapping up nearly 4% to a new high in above-average volume. Shares are well extended past a 144.58 buy point. After the close Monday, the health insurer reiterated its 2016 guidance and offered a bullish outlook for 2017.\nApple fell as much as 1% in early trade, briefly reversed higher but closed down 0.1%. The stock has been trading below its 50-day moving average for most of this month as it shapes a flat base. It's also regained a 110.33 cup-with-handle entry initially cleared in mid-September. \nResearch firm IDC expects worldwide smartphone shipments to increase 0.6% this year, well below last year's 10.4% growth. It also projects Apple iPhone shipments to fall 11% to 206.1 million this year, for its first full year of shipment declines.\nOn the IBD 50 , Thor Industries' ( THO ) strong quarterly results boosted the mobile home/RV maker group. Shares gapped up and soared nearly 13% to a record best after the Indiana-based company's fiscal Q1 earnings and sales cruised past views.

      "text": "| News \nWhen Apple sued an Amazon supplier of counterfeit iPhone chargers in October citing “safety risks” for its customers, skeptics could be forgiven for assuming that the company was attempting to bolster its legal case with fear-inducing language. But according to a new study commissioned by the UK Trading Standards office, Apple wasn’t kidding. Those fake chargers will kill you. \nAs reported by the BBC , of the 400 counterfeit chargers tested by engineers, only 3 passed a basic safety test. The 397 others didn’t have enough insulation to protect users from electric shocks. \nAnd this isn’t just a UK problem. The testers acquired their fake Apple chargers from retailers selling in eight different countries, including the U.S., China, and Australia. \nLeon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, urged consumers to be cautious when shopping: \nIt might cost a few pounds more, but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one. \nThe good news is that major companies and retailers are starting to take note of the issue. Following Apple’s aforementioned lawsuit, Amazon itself recently announced new action against vendors selling counterfeit goods via its platform. \nWhile the problem of counterfeit goods may never be solved, consumers can attempt to protect themselves by buying only from trusted retailers and examining their purchased chargers for the appropriate regulatory markings. It’s also important to stop using and discard any chargers or cables that are frayed or damaged, counterfeit or not. Share this:",

      "text": "Comment When all else fails, resetting the entire phone may be the only option. Future CDN. \nMany users have been complaining of Apple's iOS 10 update, with the number one problem on the new OS being a battery drainer . Another big problem for iOS 10 is with its messaging, with users complaining about stuck messages, lack of notifications, and crashing of the messaging app itself. \nThe new iOS 10.1.2 hasn't solved the battery draining issue just yet, and the messaging problem isn't spared. There are currently two specific messaging problems, and the following lists down solutions to these problems. These solutions are curated for everyone, even for users without technical knowledge: \n1. iMessage automatically installs other aps \nWith iOS 10, other apps are automatically installed with the iMessages App Store. While this can be helpful if a user is interested to check out other messaging add-on apps, it can be confusing for those who just want to use iMessage for plain-and-simple messaging. To turn off this automatic installation, open the iMessage app > tap on the arrow icon > click Apps > click the four-circle icon on the screen's bottom left > select Store > click Manage > turn off Automatically Add Apps. It is a long process but definitely worth all the trouble. \n2. iMessage crashes when sending messages \nThe iMessage app crashing when sending messages is a common, and understandably irksome, complaint. \nThe first step is to reboot the device. This may help refresh iOS 10. If rebooting does not help, a user may have to delete the entire thread as this may most likely be causing iMessage to crash. To delete, tap and hold the message or conversation thread > click Delete. To delete multiple conversations, click Edit on the top left of the iMessage screen > select specific threads > click Delete All. \nIf rebooting and deleting both do not help, a user may try to reset the network. To do this, go to Settings > General > click Reset Network Settings. \nIf network reset does not help, a reset of the entire device may be needed. Before doing so, a user must make sure all data are backed up on iTunes. To do this, plug in the phone on a laptop or PC with iTunes > open iTunes > click the iPhone icon on the upper left of the iTunes application > check Backup Phone. When backup is complete, on the iPhone or iPad device, open Settings > General > Reset > click Reset All Settings. \nApple is currently developing solutions to the iOS 10 messaging issue, and while this is being done, users can resort to the solutions mentioned so iMessage can still be used without further problems.

      "text": "  \nThe iPhone 6s has been back in the news recently following Apple’s admission that there are a series of device that has defective batteries. It has an exchange program under way , but the problem seems to be bigger than was initially thought . Now, Apple has an explanation for what’s going on. \n“We found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs,” Apple explained to Business Insider on Friday. “As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur. It’s important to note, this is not a safety issue.” \nThat last bit comes as a bit of a surprise. Apple explains that the iPhone 6s is shutting down on purpose to prevent any danger being presented to the end user. So, really, the iPhone 6s is working properly while the battery isn’t. This is different from, say, the Galaxy Note 7, which wasn’t shutting down but instead would ignite when the battery failed (for very different reasons.) iPhone 6s battery failures are an inconvenience, but not a safety concern \nApple builds on the explanation that this is not a concern for customer safety. Instead, it’s just a very annoying problem for folks who own iPhone 6s units with defective batteries. “We also want our customers to know that an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature,” Apple explained, showing that other circumstances can also cause an iPhone to shut down on purpose. “To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage.” \nGood to know. Your iPhone 6s isn’t going to just burst into flames, but if it’s shutting off when it says you really have 30-percent of life left, you should probably take it in for an exchange. You can check if your unit is part of the affected bunch by visiting this page.",

      "text": "Apple reveals cause of unexpected iPhone 6s shutdowns By Dan Pye ● 6 minutes ago \nIn a statement on its Chinese language website , Apple has revealed the source of the battery problem that has been causing iPhone 6s devices to shut down unexpectedly when the battery reaches 30 percent. “We found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs,” Apple wrote. “As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur.” \nThe company goes on to point out that the problem isn’t a safety concern, claiming the sudden shutdowns are just the iPhone’s way of ensuring the faulty battery doesn’t hurt the device. “To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage,” the statement reads. Apple is offering free battery replacements for affected devices and has provided an online tool allowing users to enter their iPhone 6s’s serial number to determine if it is eligible for the recall.

      "text": "Pro tip: when charging your Apple gadget, stick to the devices provided by Cupertino.\nApproximately 99 percent of phony Apple chargers bought online are unsafe, according to a report from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (TSI). The UK-based organization recently bought and analyzed 400 allegedly counterfeit accessories from suppliers in Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Thailand, and the US. Only three chargers passed an electrical strength test, which determines how much voltage will flow between the input and output; 397 contained the potential for electric shock.\nOfficers conducted a subsequent investigation closer to home, focused on local charity shops, antique dealers, and secondhand stores throughout England. When examined by an electrical engineer, 15 percent of 3,019 used electrical goods failed the test; that number rose to 27 percent in the capital city of London.\n\"Many of us quite rightly assume that everything we buy will be safe,\" Toby Harris, chair of consumer watchdog National Trading Standards, said in a statement. \"But recent work by our teams show how dangerous electrical goods can easily end up in homes up and down the country.\"\nThere are some tell-tale signs of a bogus phone charger, according to the TSI. Legitimate devices should include markings like a manufacturer's brand name or logo, model, and batch number, as well as user instructions. The Institute also warns against faulty pins; if the charger does not properly fit in a socket, it can cause overheating, arcing, and mechanical damage.",

Apple recently began a battery swap program, allowing owners of affected iPhone 6s units to get their device fixed for free, or a refund if they previously paid out-of-pocket. On Thursday, the company introduced a Web tool for checking for a qualifying serial number . Topics:",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo For the second time in a week, Apple has released another beta for iOS 10.2. Get it while it’s hot.\nRolling out now, the new software is the fifth beta release in the past few months, and introduces features such as new wallpapers, a Preserve Camera setting, and additional emoji.\nDue to the frequency of releases over the past several weeks, it’s likely the final version of iOS 10.2 will be out soon—maybe even before the New Year.\nDevelopers can download iOS 10.2 beta 5 now; a public beta will likely follow shortly.\nOther additional features users have discovered in iOS 10.2 include new iMessage effects, the addition of Apple’s new TV app, and other minor software tweaks.\nIf any other big features are discovered in iOS 10.2 beta 5, we’ll be sure to let you know.\n\n\nSource : 9to5Mac ",

      "text": "99% of fake Apple chargers fail basic safety tests 2nd December 2016 Apple has complained of a \"flood\" of fakes being sold on Amazon - and they could be a fire hazard. \nIf you're thinking of saving some money by buying a cheap charger for your Apple device, you might want to think again. \nBack in October it was revealed that Apple was taking legal action to counter the \"flood\" of fakes on sale on Amazon. And now investigators have revealed that the vast majority of these fakes fail a basic safety test. \nOf 400 chargers tested, only three had the requisite insulation to protect against electric shocks, the BBC reports . \nTrading Standards comissioned the tests, which were carried out by American safety consulting and certification firm UL. \nUL tested fake Apple chargers it bought from eight different countries around the world, including the US, China and Australia. It applied a high voltage to the chargers, to see how they would react. \nTrading Standards said the only way to be safe was to buy electrical goods from trusted suppliers. \n\"It might cost a few pounds more, but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home, or even your life, or the life of a loved one,\" said Leon Livermore, chief executive of Chartered Trading Standards Institute. \nGillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens' Advice Bureau, urged consumers to look out for signs a product was fake. \nMORE: Apple AirPods hands-on review More after the break \n\"Look out for tell-tale signs of counterfeiting such as mistakes in brand names or logos, and check plugs for safety marks - all genuine electrical items made in the EU should have a CE mark on them,\" she said. \nOther warning signs include plug adaptors not fitting into the socket properly (there should be at least 9.5mm between the edge of the plug pins and the edge of the charger), and a lack of official instructions containing conditions and limitations of use, and safety guidelines. \nThe lawsuit brought by Apple back in October was against a company called Mobile Star LLC, who Apple accused of copyright infringement for claiming its chargers are made by Apple. Apple said of 100 chargers it bought from Amazon, 90 were fake.",
