      "title": "Analysis: After $195 mln in talc verdicts, J&J strives to change court",
      "text": "After a $67.5 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson on Oct. 27 marked its third straight trial defeat in an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer, the company is hoping to reverse the trend by having the cases heard in a different court.\nAll three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits.\nThe plaintiffs claim studies show J&J's Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link.\nIn a court filing in August, J&J argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs' lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women's lawyers have denied J&J's claim.\nThe company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments.\nJohn Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere.\nBeisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs' experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative.\nIn the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed.\nJ&J unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said.\nLast week's $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May.\nThe first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013.\nJere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J to make a deal.\n\"If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases,\" he said.\nLARGE VERDICTS\nLarge verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007.\nShareholders in J&J, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants.\nJ&J no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J's baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015.\nSome legal experts said it made sense for J&J to fight on.\n\"Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement,\" said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J's case is somewhat different.\nA settlement would not necessarily cap J&J's liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled.\nHoward Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market.\n\"This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos,\" Erichson said. \"This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful.",

      "text": "CHICAGO (REUTERS) - An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV.\nBoth companies are currently testing the products separately in early-stage trials in people with HIV.\nThe study, published   in the journal Nature, evaluated monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, the monkey version of HIV, and showed the treatments were much more effective when used together than separately.\nAll nine monkeys that got both treatments showed significantly reduced viral loads. In three of them, the combination therapy has kept the virus at bay for six months after anti-retroviral therapy or ART drugs were stopped.\nThe study is part of ongoing efforts to develop a so-called functional cure for HIV that would allow people infected with the virus to stop taking daily anti-retroviral therapy.\n\"Current anti-retroviral drugs, although they're lifesaving, do not cure HIV. They merely hold it in check. We are trying to develop strategies to achieve ART-free, long-term viral suppression,\" said study author Dr Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\nFor the study, the team used what is known as a \"kick and kill\" approach. The two-punch strategy is designed to lure dormant HIV-infected immune cells out of hiding places in the body and then attempt to eradicate them.\nThe trial evaluated a therapeutic vaccine called Ad26/MVA, which J&J and partners are testing in early-stage human trials.\nThe vaccine works by provoking a broad immune response from the adaptive immune system, the part that recognizes specific pathogens and produces lasting immunity.\nThey combined this with Gilead's experimental drug called GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that kickstarts the innate immune system, a more generalised line of defense that mounts the body's initial response to infection.\nGilead is also testing this in trials of HIV-infected patients.\nIn the study, they evaluated 36 monkeys infected with SIV that had been treated with ART for six months to get the virus under control. They then divided the group into four arms, with one getting the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone, another getting the TLR-7 agonist alone, a third getting the combination of the two, and a fourth getting a placebo.\nThen, they discontinued ART in all of the animals and monitored levels of the virus in their blood and lymph nodes.\nAnimals that got Gilead's TLR-7 agonist saw no benefit and the virus quickly rebounded. Those that got the vaccine alone showed some reduction of viral load and a modest delay in viral rebound. The biggest effect was in the combination group, which saw a 2.5 times longer delay in viral rebound compared to the control group.\nIn this group, levels of virus in the blood were 50 times lower than in the controls, and the virus fell to undetectable levels in three of the animals, which have been off ART for six months with no viral rebound.\n\"If all the animals' viral loads had been undetectable, that would have been a home run,\" said Barouch. \"But the fact that all animals showed a reduction in viral load and three out of nine were undetectable, that's a solid base hit. It's definitely something that we can work from.\"\nBarouch said his team has been in talks with both companies to test the combination therapy in patients with HIV.\nTopics:  AIDS/HIV MEDICAL RESEARCH More  //str.sg/4gsQ Copy",

      "title": "A Message From Johnson & Johnson’s CEO About the U.S. Presidential Election",
      "text": "By Alex Gorsky, CEO and Chairman of Johnson & Johnson Alex Gorsky \nThe presidential campaign in the United States is finally over, and the result stunned the experts and political establishment in America and around the world. Now that the confetti has fallen and the last political ads have finally flickered and faded from view, it is time to ask the one really important question: Now what? \nWhen the campaign promises, accusations and claims are long forgotten, the United States goes on as a nation, as a people. The world goes on. The president-elect has called for us to build the future together, to heal the bitter divisions. That is most important now. \nAn inscription on the national seal of the United States tells us how to do that: E Pluribus Unum . That phrase in Latin translates to: “from many, one.” From different people of different backgrounds, from many different interests and many opinions, from many talents, strengths and aspirations we are one nation. Now we go forward together. We meet our challenges and opportunities together. \nWe have learned the strength of that idea at Johnson & Johnson ( No. 8 on the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies list). For over 130 years, our business globally has depended on inventing the future of healthcare. From the beginning we learned that innovation is seldom the product of the solitary genius. Rather, true innovations are the product of collaboration. And that collaboration is driven by a diversity of ideas, individuals and disciplines … working together toward a common goal. That has led to breakthrough after breakthrough, from medical miracles that have changed lives to the simple consumer product ideas that have made every day a little better. This process connects our business in over 60 countries to the concerns and hopes of literally billions of people around the globe. \nIn my travels around the world, meeting with people of Johnson & Johnson from so many different countries and cultures, I see that strength in our global workforce:From many, we are one. Over 125,000 people with one common mission to help people everywhere live longer, healthier and happier lives. \nAs a company, of course, Johnson & Johnson does not take sides in presidential elections. And our employees represent virtually every political viewpoint. But in the U.S., whether red or blue in politics before the election, now we are all red, white and blue. Together, we will stand by the side of our new president, just as we have done with the current and past administrations. And, we will continue to support the Congress and all state and local leaders. Our future and the future of our children and grandchildren depend on that. \nAnd as the world’s largest and most broadly-based healthcare company, we recognize we have a unique perspective on the needs, wants, hopes and fears about health and wellness of a billion people whose lives we touch around the world every day. We believe that means we also have a unique responsibility. So we will do all we can to help the president and other leaders around the world to meet the challenge of providing the finest healthcare to all citizens, the best possible outcomes at the best possible value. \nAnd while we provide our support, we will not just be quiet bystanders, cynical critics or simply cheerleaders. We will do our best to provide leadership on the health and wellness issues that we understand better than anyone else. And we will stand up and fight for the interests of all of the responsibilities defined in our Credo ; the doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and fathers and all others who use our products, our employees, suppliers and shareholders and the communities in which we live and work. \nWe will also continue to provide positive economic impact and good jobs wherever we do business. Our company and our employees will continue to contribute many billions of dollars in federal, state and local taxes. We will be active in meeting our civic responsibilities. \nI know I speak for all of us at Johnson & Johnson in wishing the new president and all political leaders the best of luck and the best of health. Our nation and the world need the very best they have got to give. Share this:",

If so, here are Jim Cramer's top takeaways for today's trading.\nJohnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) : Cramer sat down with Alex Gorsky, chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson and a retired army captain, to talk business, politics and the many advantages of hiring veterans.\nThursday's show, ahead of Veterans Day, was shot before a studio audience of West Point Cadets, veterans, military personnel and their families.\nGorsky said of the 45,000 Johnson & Johnson employees currently in the U.S., more than 5% of them are veterans. He said, \"We couldn't do what we do without the great work of veterans\" that provide leadership and problem-solving skills the company needs. Johnson & Johnson makes hiring veterans a priority and trains recruiters on how to translate military skills into workforce assets.\nGorsky also noted his involvement in the Travis Manion Foundation, which aims to help veterans and the families of fallen veterans. He said the foundation proves that our country is always stronger together.\nWhen asked about this year's political season, which has vilified the pharmaceutical industry, Gorsky said that health care is important and it's an important part of our economy, so it deserves to be part of the debate. But, he said, it's important to remember all of the good that pharma brings and the many diseases it cures and not just focus on the problems that still need to be solved.\nReal Money: Mark Newton has 5 health-care stocks set to bounce\nRead Jim Cramer's interview with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.",

      "title": "Going Up Against AbbVie's Humira, Johnson & Johnson Presents Less-Than-Stellar Phase III Data",
      "text": "View More Jobs Johnson & Johnson said its experimental sirukumab treatment for rheumatoid arthritis showed mixed results against AbbVie Inc's top-selling Humira in a large trial. By one measure, patients with moderate to severe disease who took sirukumab showed significantly greater improvement in the Phase III study than those taking Humira, J&J said on Saturday. But another comparison showed no significant benefit of one drug over the other. In the 559-patient study, those taking sirukumab scored declines after 24 weeks of 2.58 with a low dose and 2.96 with a high dose on a widely used nine-point scale of disease activity.

      "text": "Better Buy: Johnson & Johnson vs. Merck newsfeedback@fool.com (Keith Speights) 0 \nIf you owned shares of either Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) or Merck (NYSE: MRK) over the last five years, you're likely a happy camper. Both stocks are up more than 75% during the period. Both have also seen their shares climb by double-digit percentages this year, with Merck outperforming J&J by around 5%. Which is the better choice for investors looking at 2017 and beyond? Here's how J&J and Merck stack up. Image source: Getty Images. The case for Johnson & Johnson \nIn a sense, Johnson & Johnson is three companies rolled into one. The healthcare giant's three business segments -- consumer, pharmaceutical, and medical devices -- are all multi-billion dollar enterprises. \nThe best investing case for J&J comes from its pharmaceutical segment. Sales for the segment grew over 9% in the first three quarters of 2016. The company claims several products boasting solid year-over-year sales increases, notably including anti-inflammatory drugs Simponi and Stelara, HIV drug Edurant, and blood thinner Xarelto. \nJohnson & Johnson's biggest success story right now, though, is cancer drug Imbruvica. Third-quarter sales nearly doubled the amount generated in the prior year period. The future also looks promising for Imbruvica: The drug is currently in half a dozen late-stage clinical studies targeting additional indications. \nThat's just the tip of the iceberg. J&J's pipeline includes 28 late-stage programs. This count doesn't include rheumatoid arthritis drug sirukumab, which is awaiting regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe. \nDividend-seeking investors really have a lot to like about Johnson & Johnson. The dividend yield currently stands at 2.7%. J&J has increased the dividend for 54 consecutive years. \nThe company hasn't been a slouch at growth, either, posting 32 consecutive years of adjusted earnings increases. With a solid lineup featuring Imbruvica plus over $40 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities that could fund further acquisitions, Johnson & Johnson should be able to keep its growth streak going. The case for Merck \nMerck also has its own rising star with Keytruda. Sales for the cancer drug totaled $919 million. That's just the start. Analysts expect Keytruda to reach peak annual sales of over $8 billion. \nThe company also continues to see solid growth from its vaccines franchise. Sales for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil and its ProQuad/M-M-R II/Varivax vaccines increased by double-digit percentages in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the prior year period. In addition, new hepatitis C drug Zepatier has contributed significant revenue this year. \nMerck does face some challenges. Cardiovascular drugs Zetia and Vytorin lose patent protection in 2017. An agreement actually allows a generic version of Zetia to launch even sooner -- in December 2016. \nSeveral pipeline candidates could help boost sales in the future. Merck's pipeline includes 21 late-stage programs. Anacetrapib, which targets treatment of atherosclerosis, could run into trouble since two chemically similar drugs failed to win regulatory approval. However, Merck has multiple Keytruda studies in additional indications plus several diabetes candidates in late-stage development, along with experimental Alzheimer's disease treatment verubecestat. \nThanks largely to Keytruda and other possible winners in the pipeline, Wall Street thinks that Merck will be able to grow annual earnings by around 6% over the next five years. That's close to the same level expected for Johnson & Johnson. \nMerck's dividend yield of almost 2.9% is a tad higher than Johnson & Johnson's. However, the company uses more of its earnings to fund dividend payments than J&J does. Also, Merck can't boast of the string of annual dividend increases like J&J can. Better buy \nMerck should be a pretty good choice for investors looking for a reasonable dividend yield. Keytruda will likely become one of the biggest-selling drugs on the market, fueling Merck's growth well into the future. 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes \nHowever, I think Johnson & Johnson is the better pick for long-term investors. J&J provides consistency combined with a solid potential for steady (if not spectacular) growth. My take is that investors will continue to be happy campers with either one of these stocks, but J&J shareholders will probably have the bigger smiles a decade or more from now. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Johnson and Johnson \nDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Johnson and Johnson wasn't one of them!

      "text": "Post a comment / Nov 15, 2016 at 1:57 PM Shares 50 JLABS’ San Francisco facility \nJohnson & Johnson Innovation and its drug development arm Janssen have awarded $500,000 grants to two startups and one translational research lab as part of the company’s latest “ QuickFire Challenge .” \nAccording to J&J, the three winners were chosen from a pool of 470 global applicants, spread throughout 40 countries. Along with the funding boost, the successful programs will gain access to JLABS incubator space in a location of their choice. \n“We reviewed an unprecedented number of world-class technologies through this QuickFire Challenge and our three grant recipients represent potentially transformative innovations that employ cross-sector approaches to intercepting and preventing disease,” said Barry A. Springer, VP of strategy, technology, and innovation and research at Janssen BioTherapeutics, in a company news release . \nOf the three winners, one is from Melbourne, Australia, while the other two are based in the United States. They are as follows: \nRMIT University : From the Micro/Nanomedical Research Center at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Leslie Yeo and her team have pioneered a portable handheld personalized nebulization platform that can convert drugs into aerosol form, for direct delivery via inhalation to the lungs. \nGlyscend : Co-founder and CEO Ashish Nimgaonkar is developing a pill that can produce an intestinal barrier, thereby mimicking the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery has been shown to have a profound beneficial effect, not only on obesity but also on type 2 diabetes, independent of weight loss. \nNeurotrack : led by Elli Kaplan, CEO, the California-based company has developed the Imprint™ Check-Up, a five-minute test that uses eye-tracking technology to assess cognitive decline before symptoms appear. A related Cognitive Health Program provides users with tools and lifestyle advice to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and diseases like Alzheimer’s. \nThe World Without Disease QuickFire Challenge focuses on integrated solutions that combine aspects of pharmaceutical, medical device, and consumer science. Applicants are judged based on their potential to improve a significant, unmet global health need. J&J also screens for startups working in its scientific focus areas. \nAlongside the company’s stated aim “to fight for a world without disease,” the QuickFire Challenge works to promote J&J’s network of innovation labs and incubator facilities. Earlier challenges were deployed to recruit promising startups for its newly-established incubators, including those in Canada and Australia. \nA major component of the award is the guaranteed space in a JLABs incubator. These are pitched as “no-strings-attached” facilities. Janssen provides many of the resources necessary to launch a biomedical R&D program, but it doesn’t require an equity share of the startup in return. \nDeals may be negotiated later in the company’s development life cycle, but the companies aren’t bound to exclusive contracts with Janssen. \nPhoto: JLABS",

      "text": "NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. , Nov.   Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) today announced the establishment of the Susan L. Lindquist Chair for Women in Science to honor the life and legacy of Susan Lindquist , Ph.D., a globally renowned scientist whose intellectually courageous, boundary defying research significantly advanced science and medicine in the field of protein folding.  Dr. Lindquist, who passed away October 27 , left behind a storied career and reputation in biomedical innovation that spanned basic research, entrepreneurship, and mentorship for women in science. The $5 million Chair is endowed in perpetuity at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and will be awarded to a female scientist to advance biomedical research.\n\"Sue was a scientific pioneer who changed fundamental understanding of the biology of human health. As part of the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors, she challenged us to use science and technology in new ways to help improve the health and lives of people all around the world,\" said Alex Gorsky , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson. \"We are pleased to establish this Chair in Sue's name as a greatly respected and beloved scientist and as a passionate advocate for women in science.\"\nAn insightful leader with an incomparable perspective on the intersection of academic and commercial medical research, Dr. Lindquist's research changed the scientific community's understanding of protein folding and its role in human health, including diseases such as Parkinson's and Huntington's.  In addition to founding and co-founding multiple biotechnology companies, she served on the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors since 2004 as Chairman of its Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee and as a member of its Regulatory, Compliance & Government Affairs Committee. When she joined the Whitehead Institute as both a Member and the Institute's Director in 2001, she became the Institute's first female head and one of the first women in the nation to lead a major independent research organization. \nDavid C. Page , M.D., Director of the Whitehead Institute and Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ), said, \"We are so pleased to partner with Johnson & Johnson to honor Sue's legacy and the impact of women in science. In shaping the focus of this endowed Chair with Sue and Johnson & Johnson, our aim was to ensure the incumbents have great flexibility in how they pursue her legacy of stellar science and courageous leadership.\"\nDr. Lindquist's personal warmth and generosity were widely admired. As one colleague remembered, \"she became one of my dearest mentors—never failing to check in on me, regularly inviting me to lunch to talk about the latest developments in our labs, even thinking to send me a gift to welcome my newborn son. Speaking with Sue always left me with a sense that everything was possible—that one could be a first-class scientist and a first-class human being. The world somehow expanded for all of us because she was in it. Sue made a point of lifting others up and championing younger people—she showed by example that this is how to have maximal impact.\"\n\"Sue changed the face of research in so many ways, and she will be deeply missed. We are pleased that her legacy and inspiration continues in her research and in support for other women in science through this new Chair,\" said Paul Stoffels , M.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. \"She was a phenomenal role model in all ways, to young men and women alike.  She was one of the finest people I have ever had the privilege to know.\"\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160831/403394LOGO \n \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/johnson--johnson-establishes-susan-l-lindquist-chair-for-women-in-science-300364183.html \nSOURCE Johnson & Johnson\nRelated Links \nhttp://www.jnj.com",

      "text": "View More Jobs \nNEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) today announced the establishment of the Susan L. Lindquist Chair for Women in Science to honor the life and legacy of Susan Lindquist , Ph.D., a globally renowned scientist whose intellectually courageous, boundary defying research significantly advanced science and medicine in the field of protein folding. Dr. Lindquist, who passed away October 27 , left behind a storied career and reputation in biomedical innovation that spanned basic research, entrepreneurship, and mentorship for women in science. The $5 million Chair is endowed in perpetuity at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and will be awarded to a female scientist to advance biomedical research. \n\"Sue was a scientific pioneer who changed fundamental understanding of the biology of human health. As part of the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors, she challenged us to use science and technology in new ways to help improve the health and lives of people all around the world,\" said Alex Gorsky , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson. \"We are pleased to establish this Chair in Sue's name as a greatly respected and beloved scientist and as a passionate advocate for women in science.\" \nAn insightful leader with an incomparable perspective on the intersection of academic and commercial medical research, Dr. Lindquist's research changed the scientific community's understanding of protein folding and its role in human health, including diseases such as Parkinson's and Huntington's. In addition to founding and co-founding multiple biotechnology companies, she served on the Johnson & Johnson Board of Directors since 2004 as Chairman of its Science, Technology & Sustainability Committee and as a member of its Regulatory, Compliance & Government Affairs Committee. When she joined the Whitehead Institute as both a Member and the Institute's Director in 2001, she became the Institute's first female head and one of the first women in the nation to lead a major independent research organization. \nDavid C. Page , M.D., Director of the Whitehead Institute and Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ), said, \"We are so pleased to partner with Johnson & Johnson to honor Sue's legacy and the impact of women in science. In shaping the focus of this endowed Chair with Sue and Johnson & Johnson, our aim was to ensure the incumbents have great flexibility in how they pursue her legacy of stellar science and courageous leadership.\" \nDr. Lindquist's personal warmth and generosity were widely admired. As one colleague remembered, \"she became one of my dearest mentorsnever failing to check in on me, regularly inviting me to lunch to talk about the latest developments in our labs, even thinking to send me a gift to welcome my newborn son. Speaking with Sue always left me with a sense that everything was possiblethat one could be a first-class scientist and a first-class human being. The world somehow expanded for all of us because she was in it. Sue made a point of lifting others up and championing younger peopleshe showed by example that this is how to have maximal impact.\" \n\"Sue changed the face of research in so many ways, and she will be deeply missed. We are pleased that her legacy and inspiration continues in her research and in support for other women in science through this new Chair,\" said Paul Stoffels , M.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson. \"She was a phenomenal role model in all ways, to young men and women alike. She was one of the finest people I have ever had the privilege to know.\"",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson Is Sitting On A Time Bomb Nov.17.16 \nJ&J is a solid yield play, but there are obvious risks to consider. \nMore about Remicade. \nMore about legal risk. \nFair value is in the region of $107 a share, I argue. I recently warned you about the detrimental effect that high interest rates could have on the valuation of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), but here I'll focus on a couple of side risks I barely touched upon in my recent coverage of this $316bn market-cap behemoth, which so far includes: What To Make Of Johnson & Johnson At $118 In The Wake Of Q3 Results ( 18 October ) How Johnson & Johnson Could Plummet To $98 ( 17 October ) Remicade \nA federal judge in Boston invalidated a key patent on Johnson & Johnson's blockbuster arthritis drug Remicade, increasing the odds that Pfizer Inc. will sell a rival copy in the U.S. J&J pledged to appeal, \" Bloomberg reported on 17 August. Until recently, its shares comfortably traded close to a 52-week high of about $126, but have become more volatile since the day before quarterly figures were released. Click to enlarge (Source: yahoo finance) If you wonder why Remicade is so important, just look at the numbers highlighted in the tab below. Click to enlarge (Source: JNJ 10-Q) Remicade turnover represents the majority of sales for the immunology drugs portfolio, and roughly 21% of total pharma sales both in the third quarter and in the first nine months of the year. Click to enlarge (Source: JNJ 10-Q) It isn't growing at a very fast clip on a relative basis, but its performance is clearly relevant given its contribution to group sales and earnings. Growth JNJ noted in its quarterly results that immunology products \"achieved operational sales growth of 17.8% as compared to the same period a year ago,\" adding that ontributors \"to the growth were REMICADE (infliximab), STELARA (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab) driven by U.S. market growth and increased penetration for both STELARA (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab).\" Additionally, it said that \"REMICADE (infliximab) sales to distributors were positively impacted by an inventory build in the current period as well as lower inventory levels in the third quarter of 2015.\" \"The patents for REMICADE (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE in those markets.\" The damage could be contained, although during the quarterly call with analysts, management failed to reassure investors, and JNJ shares inevitably struggled. The payout is solid and the stock doesn't look madly expensive, but risks remain even at the current price of $116 a share. Pfizer The day before JNJ reported its quarterly figures, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) announced that it would begin \"shipment of INFLECTRA (infliximab-dyyb) for injection, a biosimilar of REMICADE (infliximab) to wholesalers in the United States in late November 2016.\" \nINFLECTRA will be introduced at a 15% discount to the current wholesaler acquisition cost of REMICADE, its reference product. WAC is not inclusive of discounts to payers, providers, distributors and other purchasing organizations,\" Pfizer said a month ago. End of the story? No, really. JNJ's rival \"is reportedly looking at selling or spinning off its consumer healthcare business,\" The Motley Fool wrote earlier this week . Legal Risk Aside from Remicade, another element that is often overlooked by investors -- as several readers kindly reminded me in recent weeks -- is the legal risk associated to some products that still belong to JNJ's vast portfolio as well as others that were recently discontinued. JNJ said in its quarterly report that in June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General \" filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc.\" \nThe complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers' use of talc contained in JOHNSON'S Baby Powder and JOHNSON'S Shower to Shower (a product no longer sold by Johnson & Johnson) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. This matter is currently scheduled for trial in September 2017. \" It is hard to quantify the damage here, but arguably JNJ and its investors are sitting on a time bomb, given certain news that has been published in recent months. Click to enlarge (Source: schmidtlaw.com; to read the full coverage, please click here ) This, for example, was the headline from Bloomberg in early May: Click to enlarge (Source: Bloomberg) It is simple math on paper: assuming the low end of that $55m-$72m range, this issue could cost JNJ up to $55bn, or about four years of net profits. Of course, JNJ had funding options at its disposal, but nonetheless value destruction is possible over the next 12 month or so. Its gross cash pile stands at $18bn, which comes on top of $22bn of marketable securities, against some $23.5bn of non-current debt obligations and $3.4bn of short-term debts. Click to enlarge (Source: JNJ 10-Q) On 27 October, JNJ said \"we deeply sympathize with the women and families impacted by ovarian cancer. We will appeal today's verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder.\" \nIn fact, two cases pending in New Jersey were dismissed in September 2016 by a state court judge who ruled that plaintiffs' scientific experts could not adequately support their theories that talcum powder causes ovarian cancer, a decision that highlights the lack of credible scientific evidence behind plaintiffs' allegations.\" If a worst-case scenario plays out, it might have to use some leverage to support the dividend, an analysts told me this week -- which, of course, would harm its credit rating. Consumer Speculations aside, more details emerged in the 10-Q about the performance of its sluggish consumer business. Click to enlarge (Source: JNJ 10-Q) Now, with the Dollar Index hitting a 14-year high , more pain ahead is likely for JNJ shareholders, also in light of recent trends for interest rates -- in fact, it's back to square one for the year on that front, as the 10/2 year Treasury yield spread indicates. Click to enlarge (Source: YCharts.com) Meanwhile, my DCF model points to a fair value through to early Q1 that is some 8% below its current level of $116, excluding one-off adjustments. For all these reasons, I'd look for value elsewhere at least until the end of the fourth quarter.

Women and athletes are encouraged to use these products to stay fresh,” said attorney Cheryl L. Snow of the Law Offices of James S.

Rogers notes many cancer-stricken victims are just realizing the link to their use of baby powder and cancer diagnosis. \n“Talc is a carcinogenic mineral,” Rogers said. “Numerous studies have linked it to ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, Johnson & Johnson consumers were never warned about the dangers of these products when used regularly for decades.” \nJohnson & Johnson issued this statement: \n“We recognize that women and families affected by ovarian cancer are searching for answers, and we deeply sympathize with everyone affected by this devastating disease. We are defending the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder because science, research, clinical evidence and decades of studies by medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of cosmetic talc.” 47.606209 -122.332071 ",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson ’s ( JNJ - Free Report ) subsidiary, Janssen Therapeutics, announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved its prescription drug Stelara for the treatment of moderate-to-severely active Crohn’s disease in adults.\nStelara is presently marked in the EU and U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis.\nThe approval was not surprising as the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had granted a positive opinion to Stelara, recommending approval for the indication in September. Also, in the same month, Stelara received the FDA approval for the same indication. J&J is also evaluating Stelara as a subcutaneous treatment for ulcerative colitis (phase III ongoing) and axial spondylytis (phase III).\nSales of Stelara in the upcoming quarters should receive a boost with this label expansion. According to the company’s press release, more than five million people worldwide suffer from Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis which are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price and Consensus\nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price and Consensus | JOHNSON & JOHNS Quote:\nApart from Stelara, J&J is also working actively on expanding the label of other new marketed products like Simponi, Xarelto and Imbruvica. For Imbruvica (partner: AbbVie, Inc. ( ABBV - Free Report ) , six additional indications have been approved since its launch and the drug is also being evaluated in a number of combination therapies. For Xarelto, there are eight new indications seeking trials as part of the EXPLORER clinical development program. While Johnson & Johnson has exclusive U.S. marketing rights of Xarelto, the drug is being marketed by Bayer AG ( BAYRY - Free Report ) outside the U.S.\nSimponi (partner: Merck & Co., Inc. ( MRK - Free Report ) received approval this year in the EU for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in combination with methotrexate. Also, the company plans to file two line extensions for Simponi Aria, the intravenous formulation of Simponi, in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. We believe that in the forthcoming period, these drugs will contribute significantly to the company’s top line.\nJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "View All Posts \nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) — This leader in the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer products industry has drug launches planned that should lead the industry’s growth. \nLast November, it received FDA approval for a breakthrough therapy to treat double refractory myeloma. European approval was received in May 2016. Further, management believes it will have 10 new drugs from 2015 to 2019, each with the potential to achieve $1 billion in annual sales. \nRestructuring of its medical device unit, announced in January 2016, is expected to save $800 million to $1 billion by 2018. Standard & Poor’s estimates 2016 and 2017 EPS of $6.73 and $7.01 and has a target price of $143 which is 20.7X their forward 12-month estimate of $6.90. \nFurther it rates JNJ as a four-star buy. JNJ pays an annualized dividend of $3.20, for a 2.8% yield, and has a quality rating of “A.” 7 Stocks to Buy From the Scrap Heap \nThis Dow member is in the process of breaking to an uptrend after topping on Aug. 1 at $125. Since then, the stock has been restrained by a downtrend line that roughly tracked its 50-day moving average. That line and the average were pierced last week when the stock gapped through resistance on very high volume but then retreated back to support and closed the open gap. \nThis technical action sets JNJ up for another run through the resistance at $116 to $117. With the political situation now resolved and an expectation of regulatory relief at hand, that blue-chip drug stock should be bought. \nThus, buy JNJ at $116 with the assumption that it will break through resistance and achieve a trading target of $135 for a proposed gain of 16% plus dividends. \nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2016/11/johnson-johnson-jnj-stock-healthy-ipmedia/. \n©2016 InvestorPlace Media, LLC",

      "text": "Woman says using Johnson & Johnson powder caused her ovarian cancer \nLONDON — The teenage girl’s instructions were direct: She didn’t want to be buried, but to be frozen — with the hope she can continue her life in the future when cancer is cured. \n“I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they may find a cure for my cancer and wake me up,” the 14-year-old wrote to a judge before her recent death. \nShe said “being cryo-preserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up — even in hundreds of years’ time.” \nHer plaintive words convinced High Court Judge Peter Jackson to grant her final wishes in what he called the first case of its kind in England — and possibly the world. \nThe judge said the girl had chosen the most basic preservation option at a cost of about $46,000. \nThe girl’s divorced parents disagreed about the procedure, with the mother favoring it and the father initially saying no, though he softened his stance as his daughter’s death neared. \nThe girl, who along with her parents can’t be named for legal reasons, asked the court to designate that only her mother could dispose of her remains so that she could be cryogenically preserved, an unproven technique that some people believe may allow frozen bodies to be brought back to life in the future. \nThe concept is regarded with widespread skepticism by many in the medical community. \n“It is no surprise that this application is the only one of its kind to have come before the courts in this country — and probably anywhere else,” the judge said. \nHe called the case “an example of the new questions that science poses to the law.” \nThe judge made the ruling in October, and imposed restrictions on any media coverage while the girl was still alive out of respect for her stated desire for privacy. \nHis ruling cleared the way for the girl’s remains to be taken to a specialist facility in the U.S. for the start of the preservation process. \nThe girl was too ill to attend court proceedings, but Jackson visited her in a hospital. He said he was impressed by the “valiant way” she dealt with her impending death from a rare form of cancer. He said she spent her final months researching cryonics on the internet. \nJackson said his decision was based on resolving the dispute between the parents and did not represent a finding on cryogenic preservation. \nHe seemed focused on the girl’s expressed desire, even though she was too young to write a legally binding will. \n“I don’t want to be buried underground,” she wrote at the end of her note. “I want to have this chance. This is my wish.” Share this: ",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson ’s ( JNJ - Free Report ) subsidiary, Janssen announced the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for its pipeline candidate guselkumab for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nThe application is served on the basis of four studies – phase III VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2 and NAVIGATE, and phase II X-PLORE – evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab administered by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nResults of the VOYAGE 1 study were recently presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology congress in Austria, while VOYAGE 2 and NAVIGATE data are expected to be presented at upcoming scientific congresses.\n\nData from the VOYAGE 1 trial (n=837) showed that significantly higher proportions of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with guselkumab achieved high rates of skin clearance compared to those receiving placebo. 73% of the patients receiving guselkumab achieved near complete skin clearance versus 2.9% on placebo.\n\nThe active comparator arm of the VOYAGE trial evaluated guselkumab in comparison with AbbVie Inc.’s ( ABBV - Free Report ) top-selling product, Humira. The study demonstrated statistically significant efficacy of guselkumab compared to Humira after week 16, which was maintained through 48 weeks of treatment. Almost 50% of the patients treated with Humira achieved near-complete skin clearance compared with 73% receiving guselkumab.\n\nA phase II trial evaluating guselkumab in moderate-to-severely active psoriatic arthritis is also ongoing. Per the company’s press release, around 125 million people worldwide suffer from psoriasis, including 7.5 million Americans with their disease ranging from mild to severe and disabling. Hence, an approval of guselkumab would give the company access to a wide patient population in the U.S.\nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price \n\nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price | JOHNSON & JOHNS Quote \nZacks Rank & Key Picks \nJohnson & Johnson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "November 19, 2016 – /PressAdvantage/ – TheProductLawyers.com reports on a recent article by Economic Calendar that indicates Johnson & Johnson has experienced growth over the last quarter.\nThe article states, “In the latest quarter, the company has beaten both revenue and earnings estimates by $110 million and $0.03 per share, respectively. JNJ generated sales growth of 4.3% to $17.8 billion compared with the same period last year.”\nThat may come as a surprise to many women, given the number of lawsuits the company has faced recently in regard to their talcum powder products.Talcum powder’s alleged link to ovarian cancer has been the source of many lawsuits that have been filed against Johnson & Johnson. The lawsuits, which now reach over 2,000 in number suggest that plaintiffs have used their powders and subsequently developed the deadly disease. Plaintiffs argue that the company should be held responsible for charges including fraud and negligence for failing to warn consumers about these alleged risks.\nJohnson & Johnson has denied such claims, stating that their products were developed by “following the science” and that no such link exists. Juries, however, have found that the pharmaceutical giant should be held responsible and the company has been made to pay millions in the three trials that have since concluded. Johnson & Johnson is looking to appeal those decisions.\nAs these lawsuits are expected to grow in numbers, Banville Law is seeking to help those currently suffering. The firm has many years of experience fighting large pharmaceutical companies who have put dangerous drugs and devices onto the market, foregoing public safety for corporate greed. Attorneys at Banville Law want to assist those who believe they have been directly affected by the use of Johnson’s talcum powder. Affected individuals may be entitled to financial compensation and legal action. Banville Law is currently offering free consultations to individuals who qualify.\nFor more information, to schedule a consultation or to ask questions contact Banville Law at (888) 976-6742 .\n###\nContact TheProductLawyers.com:\nBanville Law\n888-478-9711\ninfo@banvillelaw.com\n165 West End Ave #1h,\nNew York, NY 10023\nReleaseID: 60013392\n ",

Commercialisation is the process of introducing a new product or solution into commerce – making it available on the market. As you are submitting your application, you will find a downloadable project plan template that will guide you step-by-step so that we can better understand the feasibility of your idea. If you have a business plan to share, that is great.” \nTherefore, entrepreneurs who are above 18 years of age and work in the following fields promoting early child development and maternal health, empowering young girls and improving family wellbeing are encouraged to apply before January 17, 2017. \nAccording to the company, participants with the best solutions will receive up to $100,000 in funding and mentorship from scientists, engineers and researchers in the Johnson & Johnson Consumer Research & Development organisation. \n“The winner(s) of the challenge could also receive dedicated space at a lab facility in Africa throughout their product or service development, dependent on the needs of the solution submission,” the company added. \nIt should be noted that selected candidates will be judged based on solution that addresses at least one of the three critical health areas mentioned earlier and is innovative and creative. Also, the company said it is looking for solutions that are scalable and must outline commercialisation plan and how the award would help the applicant reach a critical milestone within the timeframe of a single year. \nIntended applicants can submit their application through the company’s website.",

      "text": "FDA has approved a label expansion for Genmab and Johnson & Johnson’s multiple myeloma drug Darzalex three months ahead of schedule. The nod clears J&J to market Darzalex in combination with Celgene’s Revlimid or Takeda’s Velcade as a second-line treatment for the bone marrow cancer.\nJ&J bagged breakthrough status in the indication in July, filed for approval in August and received confirmation FDA would prioritize the review last month. That set the partners up to hear from the FDA by mid-February, but the agency has used a fraction of the time available to it to make its decision. The FDA acted similarly swiftly when it originally approved Darzalex last year. The earlier decision took the FDA two months.\nThe speed at which the FDA has acted reflects the strength of the data put together by J&J and Genmab. J&J’s submission for second-line use in combination with Celgene and Takeda’s drugs was based on the Castor and Pollux Phase III trials, the results from which wowed attendees at cancer conferences earlier this year.\nHaving secured the approval ahead of schedule, Genmab now expects the first commercial sale of Darzalex in combination with Revlimid or Velcade to happen before the end of the year. When J&J makes the sale, it will trigger a $65 million (€61 million) milestone payment to Genmab. The payout continues the succession of milestones received by the Danish drugmaker as Darzalex has advanced. Investors have responded by driving up the share price of Genmab by 360% in two years.\nThe optimism of investors is underpinned by a belief that Darzalex will quickly establish itself as a cornerstone of clinicians’ go-to second-line treatment regimens. And hope that, over time, the drug can muscle in on several other use cases, including first-line treatment, maintenance therapy and management of asymptomatic “smoldering” multiple myeloma.\nWork to continue expanding use of Darzalex is underway. A PDUFA date for the drug in combination with Celgene’s Imnovid is scheduled for June. And additional data on a subcutaneous formulation of Darzalex are due next month. That formulation, a Phase III trial that could start next year, would significantly shorten infusion times.",

He noted that in recent years, J&J had derived about half its revenue from acquired products. \nJohnson & Johnson agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye care business for about US$4.33 billion in cash in September. \nActelion shares have risen more than 13 percent this year, valuing it at about US$17 billion. \nIn October, Actelion raised its earnings guidance for the third time this year as sales from its new drugs Opsumit and Uptravi, which treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), for the first time surpassed those of Tracleer, its decade-long mainstay that lost U.S. patent protection last November. \nJohnson & Johnson and Actelion were not immediately available for comment. \n(Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Rigby and Alan Crosby) - Reuters",

      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg  55   \nLONDON (Nov 25): Johnson & Johnson has approached Actelion Ltd about a potential takeover of the US$17 billion Swiss drugmaker as the US health-care giant works to expand its pharmaceutical lineup, people familiar with the matter said. \nDeliberations are still at an early stage following J&J’s initial offer, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Actelion is working with an adviser to explore options, and any discussions may not lead to a transaction, the people said. \nWhile Actelion, Europe’s largest biotech firm, has been named as a potential takeover target for years, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jean-Paul Clozel has previously said the company planned to remain independent. The 61-year-old, who is one of Actelion’s largest shareholders, may now be more open to entertaining a sale at a sufficient premium, one of the people said. \nAn acquisition would add to the US$246 billion of pharmaceutical deals announced this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Representatives for J&J and Allschwil, Switzerland-based Actelion declined to comment. \nLung Medicines \nActelion gained 1.9% to close at 158 Swiss francs Thursday after a report from StreetInsider.com said the company had attracted takeover interest. The shares have risen 13% this year, valuing it at almost US$17 billion. New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J, with a market capitalization of about US$308 billion, has risen 10% this year. \nJ&J Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso has said he would consider deals of any size that fit into the strategy of building up its three main businesses — consumer, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. The company agreed to buy the eye-surgery equipment unit of Abbott Laboratories for US$4.33 billion in September. \nActelion has brought to market two new lung medicines that are poised to become blockbusters over the next three years. That will reduce dependence on Tracleer, a medicine to treat a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs, which accounted for more than half its revenue last year. \nSales of Tracleer may plummet following the introduction of cheaper copycats in the first quarter of 2017. Meanwhile, revenue from Opsumit is projected to surpass US$1 billion next year, while Uptravi is forecast to cross that threshold in 2019, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. For the longer term, the company is also developing experimental drugs for insomnia, lupus and multiple sclerosis.",

      "text": "U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson has approached Swiss biotechnology firm Actelion Ltd about a potential takeover, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people it said were familiar with the matter.\nThe report said deliberations were still at an early stage following Johnson & Johnson's (J&J) initial offer, and Actelion was working with an adviser to explore options.\nActelion declined to comment. J&J did not respond to a request for comment.\nActelion shares were indicated 6.5 percent higher in pre-market activity in Zurich on Friday. Before Thursday's report, Actelion shares had risen more than 13 percent this year, valuing it at about $17 billion.\n\"With J&J having a market cap exceeding $300 billion, Actelion would clearly be an affordable asset for the company. Less clear to us is the logic of the timing, ahead of a likely favorable ex-U.S. cash repatriation window for U.S. corporates,\" JP Morgan Cazenove analysts said in a note that cited Actelion CEO Jean-Paul Clozel's comments in the past opposing a sale.\n\"We also see little in the way of obvious therapeutic overlap to allow synergies, beyond J&J’s interest in the Xarelto anti-coagulant which could have some modest overlap with cardiologists prescribing PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) therapies,\" they added.\n ",

      "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson has approached Swiss biotechnology firm Actelion Ltd about a potential takeover, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing people it said were familiar with the matter.\nThe report said deliberations were still at an early stage following Johnson & Johnson's (J&J) initial offer, and Actelion was working with an adviser to explore options.\nActelion declined to comment. J&J did not respond to a request for comment.\nActelion shares were indicated 6.5 percent higher in pre-market activity in Zurich on Friday. Before Thursday's report, Actelion shares had risen more than 13 percent this year, valuing it at about $17 billion.\n\"With J&J having a market cap exceeding $300 billion, Actelion would clearly be an affordable asset for the company. Less clear to us is the logic of the timing, ahead of a likely favorable ex-U.S. cash repatriation window for U.S. corporates,\" JP Morgan Cazenove analysts said in a note that cited Actelion CEO Jean-Paul Clozel's comments in the past opposing a sale.\n\"We also see little in the way of obvious therapeutic overlap to allow synergies, beyond J&J’s interest in the Xarelto anti-coagulant which could have some modest overlap with cardiologists prescribing PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) therapies,\" they added.\nJ&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said earlier this year the company was interested in making deals to expand its main consumer, medical device, and pharmaceuticals segments. He noted that in recent years, J&J had derived about half its revenue from acquired products.\nJ&J agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash in September.\nIn October, Actelion raised its earnings guidance for the third time this year as sales from its new drugs Opsumit and Uptravi, which treat PAH, for the first time surpassed those of Tracleer, its decade-long mainstay that lost U.S. patent protection last November.\n(Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Crosby and Mark Potter)",

      "text": "LONDON: Johnson & Johnson has approached Actelion Ltd. about a potential takeover of the $17 billion (Dh62.44 billion) Swiss drugmaker as the US health-care giant works to expand its pharmaceutical line-up, people familiar with the matter said.\nDeliberations are still at an early stage following J&J’s initial offer, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Actelion is working with an adviser to explore options, and any discussions may not lead to a transaction, the people said.\nShares of Actelion jumped by the most in more than two years. While Actelion, Europe’s largest biotech firm, has been named as a potential takeover target for years, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jean-Paul Clozel has previously said the company planned to remain independent. The 61-year-old, who is one of Actelion’s largest shareholders, may now be more open to entertaining a sale at a sufficient premium, one of the people said.\nAn acquisition would add to the $246 billion of pharmaceutical deals announced this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Representatives for J&J and Allschwil, Switzerland-based Actelion declined to comment.\nActelion gained 9.8 per cent, the most since June 2014, to 173.50 Swiss francs as of 9.10am on Friday. The shares had previously risen 13 per cent this year, valuing it at almost $17 billion. New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J, with a market capitalisation of about $308 billion, has risen 10 per cent this year. \nJ&J Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso has said he would consider deals of any size that fit into the strategy of building up its three main businesses — consumer, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. The company agreed to buy the eye-surgery equipment unit of Abbott Laboratories for $4.33 billion in September.\nActelion has brought to market two new lung medicines that are poised to become blockbusters over the next three years. That will reduce dependence on Tracleer, a medicine to treat a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs, which accounted for more than half its revenue last year.\nSales of Tracleer may plummet following the introduction of cheaper copycats in the first quarter of 2017. Meanwhile, revenue from Opsumit is projected to surpass $1 billion next year, while Uptravi is forecast to cross that threshold in 2019, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. For the longer term, the company is also developing experimental drugs for insomnia, lupus and multiple sclerosis.\n—Bloomberg",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson Approaches Swiss Firm Actelion About Potential Deal -- Update November 25, 2016, 12:18:00 PM   Johnson & Johnson Approaches Swiss Firm Actelion About Potential Deal -- Update By Austen Hufford \nSwiss biopharmaceutical company Actelion Ltd. said Friday that it had been approached by Johnson & Johnson about a possible deal. \nAs of Wednesday's close, Actelion had a market value of about 16.7 billion Swiss francs ($16.4 billion). With a typical takeover premium of 25% or more, a deal for the company would be valued at more than $20 billion. Johnson & Johnson's market value is more than $300 billion. \nJ&J confirmed Friday that it is in \"preliminary discussions\" with Actelion. It isn't clear where talks between the companies stand or whether Actelion is receptive. \nActelion makes drugs for rare diseases, with a focus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, a type of high blood pressure that affects arteries in the lungs and in the heart. \nActelion was founded in 1997 by Jean-Paul Clozel and other former Roche Holding Ltd. employees who left the Swiss drug giant after it decided not to pursue a project their group was working on, according to its website. In 2000, Actelion went public and its valuation has climbed sharply since then. \nLast year, the company reported revenue of 2.05 billion francs and a profit of 551.9 million francs. \nJohnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., makes an array of products from baby soap to Tylenol pills and devices that manage diabetes care. \nThe company has been acquisitive as of late. In September, it reached a deal to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye- surgery equipment business for $4.3 billion. \nBloomberg had reported Thursday that J&J had made an initial bid for the specialty drug company. \nShares of J&J rose 0.7% to $113.91 in morning trading in the U.S. \nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com  161218ET  ",

      "text": "Reportedly, Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ - Free Report ) recently approached Swiss biotechnology company Actelion Ltd. ( ALIOF - Free Report ) with a potential takeover offer.\nBloomberg reported that according to sources, the companies are holding initial talks after J&J’s offer.\nActelion is a leader in the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) market with key drugs like Opsumit, Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri and Uptravi. The newer drugs – Opsumit and Uptravi –have been received well and are poised to become blockbuster drugs. These should make up for the lost revenues from Actelion’s older PAH medicine, Tracleer, which is facing competitive pressures. Tracleer is rivalled by Gilead Sciences Inc.’s ( GILD - Free Report ) Letairis and United Therapeutics Corporation’s ( UTHR - Free Report ) Remodulin, Adcirca and Tyvaso.\nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price\nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price | JOHNSON & JOHNS Quote:\nTracleer lost patent protection in the U.S. last year and will also lose exclusivity in the EU in early 2017. Sales of Tracleer declined 18% in constant exchange rates in the first nine months of 2016, while that of Opsumit surged 63%. Uptravi, which was launched this year, recorded sales of CHF 160 million in the first nine months of 2016. Actelion’s strong sales performance enabled it to increase its 2016 guidance.\nAt the third-quarter conference call, when asked about its acquisition plans, J&J mentioned that as far as pharmaceuticals are concerned it will most likely use an “acquisition type” strategy instead of a licensing strategy if it decides to add another major therapeutic area to its existing five major therapeutic areas.\nJ&J also said it has specific areas of focus in the Consumer segment, mainly international growth in emerging markets, over-the-counter medications and the beauty space in Asia. Within the Medical Devices segment, J&J continues to look for bolt-on acquisitions in orthopedics and general surgery. Although certain areas like structural heart look attractive in the cardiovascular segment, the company was pretty clear about being disciplined from a valuation aspect.\nConfidential from Zacks\nBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

      "text": "Reportedly, Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ - Free Report ) recently approached Swiss biotechnology company Actelion Ltd. ( ALIOF - Free Report ) with a potential takeover offer. Bloomberg reported that according to sources, the companies are holding initial talks after J&J’s offer. Actelion is a leader in the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) market with key drugs like Opsumit, Tracleer, Ventavis, Veletri and Uptravi. The newer drugs – Opsumit and Uptravi –have been received well and are poised to become blockbuster drugs. These should make up for the lost revenues from Actelion’s older PAH medicine, Tracleer, which is facing competitive pressures. Tracleer is rivalled by Gilead Sciences Inc.’s ( GILD - Free Report ) Letairis and United Therapeutics Corporation’s ( UTHR - Free Report ) Remodulin, Adcirca and Tyvaso. \nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price \nJOHNSON & JOHNS Price | JOHNSON & JOHNS Quote \nTracleer lost patent protection in the U.S. last year and will also lose exclusivity in the EU in early 2017. Sales of Tracleer declined 18% in constant exchange rates in the first nine months of 2016, while that of Opsumit surged 63%. Uptravi, which was launched this year, recorded sales of CHF 160 million in the first nine months of 2016. Actelion’s strong sales performance enabled it to increase its 2016 guidance. At the third-quarter conference call, when asked about its acquisition plans, J&J mentioned that as far as pharmaceuticals are concerned it will most likely use an “acquisition type” strategy instead of a licensing strategy if it decides to add another major therapeutic area to its existing five major therapeutic areas. J&J also said it has specific areas of focus in the Consumer segment, mainly international growth in emerging markets, over-the-counter medications and the beauty space in Asia. Within the Medical Devices segment, J&J continues to look for bolt-on acquisitions in orthopedics and general surgery. Although certain areas like structural heart look attractive in the cardiovascular segment, the company was pretty clear about being disciplined from a valuation aspect.
