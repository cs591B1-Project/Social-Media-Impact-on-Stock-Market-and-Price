      "text": "\nQUOTE OF THE DAY \n“There will come a moment…to start envisaging together with government a phase-out period for cigarettes, and I hope this time will come soon” — Andre Calantzopoulos , CEO of Philip Morris, one of the world’s largest tobacco companies. Yes, you read that right. \nMarket Snapshot \nPropelled by early energy sector gains, U.S. markets ended mixed Wednesday, but the Dow still locked in its best month (+5.4%) since March Shares of controversial pharma giant Valeant Pharmaceuticals tanked 8% after negotiations with Takeda broke down. The dead $10 billion deal involved selling off Valeant’s leading stomach-drug division to the Japanese pharma company—that can’t feel good If At First You Don’t Succeed \n…Try again…and again…and again. After years of failing to agree on production cuts, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) finally reached success yesterday. The oil cartel agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day , which will reduce global production by 1%. It may not sound like much, but it’s a big deal. Non-OPEC producers aren’t putting their necks out there nearly as much, apparently only cutting production by a total of 600,000 barrels a day. Oil prices surged over 9% on the news, as many expect that yesterday’s deal will help work off the oversupply and balance prices in the future. Oil market-watcher Daniel Yergin said it best: “ OPEC is back in business. ”\nNo WiFi? \n…We good. Streaming giant Netflix (-0.43%) just went for it: offline viewing. You can now download movies and shows straight to your phone or tablet…at no extra cost. Looks like those subway rides just got a lot more (or less) productive. This move puts Netflix in another category , with giants like iTunes and Amazon Prime Video, that offers video rentals and purchases for download. And let’s not forget about Netflix’s global reach: the ability to download content in areas of the world with spotty internet speeds adds value to Netflix’s services as it continues to expand internationally.\nGoPro: Do Not Pass Go \n…Do not collect $200. It’s been a year to forget for GoPro (+1.53%): its stock price has been cut in half amidst deep losses and a crippling recall of its highly-anticipated Karma drone. After such a demoralizing year, what’s next? Yesterday, the action camera company announced it would be laying off 200 employees (15% of its workforce)…and GoPro’s president will be stepping down at the end of the year…and the company will be shutting down its entertainment division. Yikes. The moves are an effort to downsize and could get GoPro back to profitability , but it also means giving up on the dream of becoming an all-encompassing media company. Some dreams just don’t come true.\nWhat’s In the Box? \n…Profits? Maybe someday. Box (+1.5% after hours), the online storage company (not to be confused with Dropbox), reported solid quarterly earnings yesterday, inching closer and closer to the coveted milestone of positive free cash flow (read: not losing money). Sounds like a good goal to us. Box’s revenue rose 31% to $103 million, with management attributing the success to increased adoption of new products. Almost there, Box.\nRBC Loses its Mojo \n…Yesterday was a cold day in Canada indeed after its largest bank missed Street expectations, driven by poor trading revenues. The Royal Bank of Canada (-3.35%) also scaled back its return on equity target (an important metric for banks) due to interest rate and regulation concerns. But fret not: CEO Dave McKay says the future’s looking bright for RBC as its steadier businesses continue to grow.\nOther Stories \nApp-installing malware found in over 1 million Android phones Albertsons is in talks to buy Price Chopper Reddit will limit the reach of a pro-Trump board and crack down on its ‘most toxic users’ Cook ups Apple support for fight against AIDS Economic Calendar \nMonday: Government T-Bill Auctions Tuesday: Tiffany (+) Earnings; U.S. Q3 GDP (2nd Estimate) (+) ; Consumer Confidence (+) ; Case-Shiller Home Price Index (+) Wednesday: Royal Bank of Canada (-) , American Eagle (-) , Box (+) Earnings; Private Employment Report (+) ; Pending Home Sales (+/-) ; Beige Book (+) ; Personal Income and Outlays (+/-) Thursday: Kroger, Dollar General, Ulta Salon, Smith & Wesson Earnings; Motor Vehicle Sales; Weekly Jobless Claims; PMI Manufacturing Index; ISM Manufacturing Index; Construction Spending Friday: Big Lots Earnings; November Jobs Report Secure the Bag Alert \nAs you await the delivery of your Cyber Monday purchases, keep one thing in mind: a package isn’t safe until it’s resting in your arms, in the relative security of your home. In other words, get it off your front porch ASAP—holiday “porch pirates” are a real thing. Don’t worry though, there are ways to prevent this thievery. Here’s what you need to know:\nFirst, the stats: 23 million packages were stolen last year before the rightful owners could open them, according to insurancequote.com. Ouch. 49% of people say they try to fend off stoop stealers by adjusting their schedules in order to be home when a package arrives, making for a smooth handoff with the UPS guy. 36% of millennials say they have recovered a stolen package by sharing video evidence and working with the police—keep it up, young folks. One company, Ring, offers a doorbell cam to catch thieves. It’s niche, but in high demand: Ring has seen sales rise so much that it’s increased its workforce from 300 to 700 employees this year. Interview Question of the Day \n1 + 4 = 5\n2 + 5 = 12\n3 + 6 = 21\n8 + 11 = ?\n( Answer )\nBusiness Person of the Day \nJim Delligatti , creator of the Big Mac, has passed away at 98. Delligatti developed the idea for the iconic burger in 1965, believing the burgers and fries menu needed something bigger and jazzier. The original price was 45 cents—a far cry from today’s $5 burger—but that ain’t stopping us. Plus, we’ve seen worse .\nFood for Thought \nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, the federal government is on track to forgive at least $108 billion in student debt in the coming years. Enrollment in such plans has more than tripled over the past three years, amounting to 5.3 million borrowers who owe roughly $355 billion. There are still about eight million Americans in default on their student loans.\nThis embed is invalid\nShare This\n",

Subscribe Nokia Returns To Smartphone Market In 2017 Netflix offline \nNetflix is one of the most popular video streaming platforms, but until now it has only been able to stream video. There was no way to download content to watch offline. Users are understandably excited that Netflix has finally made that an option in the latest version of its Android and iOS apps. Don’t get too excited, though. While the functionality is there, the content is decidedly not. \nWhen you open the updated Netflix app, it will draw your attention to the ability to download content. Yay! Then it offers to show you what content is available for download. Oh. Not all the TV and movies in Netflix’s catalog are supported for offline playback. Those that are will have a download button at the bottom of the description for movies and next to the individual episode titles for TV shows. \nYour downloaded content is accessible from the navigation menu. Each item shows the run time and file size, which isn’t huge. A 43-minute TV episode in HD is between 150MB and 250MB and a 90-minute movie is between 350MB and 450MB. So, Netflix is compressing the files somewhat, but that probably won’t matter on a smartphone screen. There is also a high quality download option for some devices, which makes the files 2-3x larger. Netflix downloads. \nThe experience is fine for content that supports offline watching. Now you’ll be able to watch Netflix on a plane or anyplace you have poor signal. It can also save you from blowing through your monthly data plan. \nThe problem is how much content simply isn’t available for download. A cursory inspection of the catalog shows that almost no content owned by Fox, the BBC, or Disney can be downloaded. Even Netflix original content like Luke Cage is streaming only because Marvel is owned by Disney. You can chalk this up to the nature of copyright. Netflix has the rights to stream these series and movies, but letting users save it offline (even when it’s securely stored in the app directory) is an entirely different thing. \nNetflix says more content will be available for offline playback later, but it offered no specifics. In the meantime, there’s a lot of good stuff with offline support. That includes most of the Netflix originals. ",

      "text": "Why Netflix's Latest Reveal Is A Surprise To Subscribers And Industry (Seeking Alpha) \nWhile mentioning that there were no indications from the companies of a possible deal between Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ), Bernstein’s Todd Juenger commented in a report that such a deal would be “a huge, dilutive, transformational event.” TV Demise May Be Inevitable \nThe more Disney succeeded in accelerating the success of Netflix, the faster would be the demise of the former’s core TV network businesses, Juenger pointed out. He added, however, that the demise of Disney’s core TV network businesses may “happen anyway,” and that it may be better for the company to “own the winning solution.” Buying Makes More Sense Than Building \nDisney may need to pay as high as ~$70 billion to acquire Netflix . Although this price is substantially higher than what Disney would need to build from scratch, opting for the latter would take a long time, during which the expense would “flow through the P&L,” while Disney would still have to compete with Netflix, Juenger explained. \n“The estimated -31% dilution. But we don't care so much about the dilution, never do. To us what matters is whether the thing you bought is worth, to your shareholders, more or less than what you paid, and how does that compare to the NPV of the next best alternative,” the analyst wrote. \nJuenger has a Market-Perform rating and a price target of $102 on Disney. \nNetflix was a Wall Street darling in 2015, climbing more than 140 percent. However, its run slowed in 2016 at one point trading in the red year-to-date before spiking higher in late October. Latest Ratings for DIS",

      "text": "Comedy fans were elated when word came that Dave Chappelle would be hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" on Nov. 12. The elusive and popular stand-up comic hadn't told jokes for a TV audience in years, and his postelection episode drew season-high ratings.\nIt turns out that his \"SNL\" monologue was just a teaser for more material: Netflix announced last week that it will release three new stand-up specials from the comedy giant.\nNext year, the streaming service will release a pair of unseen concert specials from Chappelle's \"personal comedy vault\"; they were filmed at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium. A premiere date has not been set for an original performance recorded for Netflix.\n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix vice president of original documentary and comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.\"\nHis most-recent program, \"Dave Chappelle: For What It's Worth,\" was released in 2004 and directed by Stan Lathan, who will direct all the new Netflix specials.\nChappelle, considered one of the greatest active stand-up comics, famously began performing as a teenager in Washington, D.C. He became a masterful comic, recorded several stand-up specials and landed movie roles, including a part in the 1998 movie \"Half Baked,\" a cult favorite that he co-wrote.\nBut he catapulted to fame in the early 2000s with his wildly popular sketch-comedy program, \"Chappelle's Show.\" The Comedy Central series was marked by Chappelle's unabashed and biting approach to joking about race and racism. But as the show took off, he became more uncomfortable with how the public was receiving his work.\nChappelle reportedly walked away from a $50 million deal to film a third and fourth season, and his departure to South Africa fueled rumors about his well-being. He told Time in 2005 that he had gone overseas for solitude and quiet.\n\"I was doing sketches that were funny, but socially irresponsible,\" he told Oprah in 2006. \"I felt like I was deliberately being encouraged, and I was overwhelmed. It's like you're being flooded with things, and you don't pay attention to things like your ethics.\"\nChappelle has been absent from the small screen since, but he has been performing. If you want to see his new material, you have to see it live.\nAnd he has been prolific. In April 2007, he set a record for the longest performance at Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, with a six-hour, seven-minute set. (The record had been nearly four hours shorter, set by Dane Cook.) Months later, Chappelle broke his record with another marathon show.\nIn 2014, Chappelle performed 10 consecutive New York shows at Radio City Music Hall. According to Netflix, he has performed more than 500 concerts in the past three years.\nThe deal with Chappelle continues Netflix's dominance of highly anticipated comedic releases. The streaming service also will put out two new specials from Chris Rock after an eight-year absence.",

Netflix adds offline viewing, massive layoffs at GoPro: Tech Today About Video Tech Today:   / December 1, 2016 \n  to its workforce and Gooligan malware infects over a million Google accounts. Share (0) linkedin Transcript This is CNET, and here are the stories that matter right now. Netflix has finally allowed its subscribers to download content from the servers of its vast library for offline viewing, but not all of the shows and movies will be available Available for download. Either way this is sure to make those long flights much more bearable and updated mobile Apple soon roll out that will add an arrow icon next to title that can be downloaded for offline viewing. [MUSIC] GoPro is laying off 15% of its workforce that's about 200 employees and shutting down the ambitious entertainment arm of the company that was designed to be a one-stop shop for action camera content. goPro has had a rough year dealing with weak hardware sales and a drone line that has struggled to take off. And finally, new malware called Gooligan is targeting legacy versions of Android. Including false KitKat and Lollipop flavors of the mobile operating system. More than one million Google Accounts have been compromised, and that number grows by 13,000 users a day. Security software company Check Point has a way to detect infection on their website.

This is important news to anyone who has time to kill on the subway or airplane, or really anyone who doesn’t feel like, y’know, talking to other human beings (so, everyone). The feature is only available through the Netflix app on iOS and Android smartphone and tablet devices, and there’s no definitive catalog of available titles anywhere, but I used our list of the 50 Best TV Shows on Netflix Right Now to see which of your favorite series are download-ready. (Netflix has vowed to eventually add more titles, so cheer up, Lost fans.) \nThe following shows are available now (and don’t forget the secret codes ). \n– 30 Rock",

      "text": "Andrew Husband HBO/Amazon \nBetween Taylor Swift’s announced television channel and Netflix’s decision to finally allow subscribers to download and watch some programming while offline , cord-cutters are finding their market saturated with options. Such is the case for Amazon Prime users who, for a little extra money per month, can add premium cable channels and other streaming networks to their “Amazon Channels” feature. Now users who require regular doses of shows like Westworld and The Knick can watch both (and more) since HBO and Cinemax have entered the fray. \nAccording to a press release, Amazon Prime subscribers can now add HBO and Cinemax to their Amazon Channels selection for an additional $14.99 or $9.99 per month respectively. Each add-on includes access to original programming, as well as the many recent and popular films each channel currently possesses the exclusive television rights to broadcast. \n“HBO has produced some of the most groundbreaking, beloved and award-winning shows in television history. Their selection of blockbuster movies is unsurpassed, including hits like Batman vs. Superman , The Revenant , and Deadpool ,” Amazon Digital Video vice president Michael Paull said in a statement. “Prime members can now watch the latest episodes of the critically-acclaimed Westworld and Game of Thrones without the need for a cable subscription.” \nPrevious premium channels made available to Amazon Prime users include Showtime and Starz, as well as streaming-only services like NBC’s comedy-centric SeeSo and other fare. With the addition of HBO and Cinemax, over 80 video subscriptions are now available for subscribers to add as they see fit — thereby reducing the need for paid cable at home. Whether or not the new ease of access will help Westworld fans understand what the hell is going on , however, remains to be seen. Share This",

      "text": "Netflix's 'Binge Candle' Is Specially Designed for Gilmore Girls Viewing Wax Is Divided Into 90 Minute Sections With Scents for Different Seasons By Alexandra Jardine. Published on Nov 30, 2016 Editor's Pick \nNetflix is ingenious at coming up with fun hacks and products to enhance your viewing experience -- past examples have included its trick-or-treat repelling Halloween Doorbell and a pair of Netflix socks that pauses your show if you fall asleep. \nIts latest accessory has been created specially for fans of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" its reboot of the popular show in four 90-minute installments, each set in a different season: winter, spring, summer and fall. \nRecognizing that for many fans the show will be a mother-daughter date night, the brand and agency TBWA/Chiat/Day created a limited-edition scented \"Binge Candle\" that burns through each season as you watch it. \nThe candle, which has been part of a limited giveaway to fans in the U.S., Asia and Europe, has four layers of different-smelling wax. The idea is that you transition in scent from season to season in 90-minute intervals, just as the seasons change in the Connecticut town of Stars Hollow where the show takes place. As the final credits roll at the end of episode four, the candle should be burned out. Rate this Ad \nYou must be registered to rate the ad. Please Login or Register Now About",

      "text": "Tai Gooden | 12.1.16 | 10:26   Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images \nH ave you ever wanted to watch your favorite Netflix shows on the go, but don’t want to pay for Wi-Fi or use your precious data? If so, your continued prayers to the binge watching gods have been answered. Now, Netflix finally lets you download shows to watch offline so you can continue your binging saga and ignore everyone in public. \nNetflix Director of Product Innovation Eddy Wu made the announcement on the streaming service’s website and said the service will be offered at no extra cost . “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” he said. \nUsers will be able to click a download button on a movie or TV series’ details page and save the show to watch later. Netflix’s new feature is available for all phones and tablets that use both iOS and Android. The latest update for the app became available shortly after the announcement and some movies and TV shows are already available to download. The downloaded titles will give a set amount of time that the shows are able to be viewed on the device. And, there are already plans to open up download access for more movies and shows. \nI didn’t think it was possible, but this update has managed to make Netflix even better. Think about how road trips, public transportation rides, cross-country flights, and really any time you’re away from home and internet access will be easier to deal with when you have Orange is the New Black or Stranger Things to occupy your time. You can also watch more Netflix at work – a win for every bored employee in the world. You’ll never have to sit bored out of your mind or interact with strangers in public ever again if you don’t want to. \nThe new Netflix feature may also work to your advantage if you are traveling to another country. You may not be able to watch downloaded shows if the country you’re traveling to does not have the show available, but you may be able to gain access to shows that aren’t available in the U.S. and download them to watch during your travels. So, you can be a Netflix wizard all over the world. \nThanks to the Netflix powers for making dreams come true.",

      "title": "Netflix Brings Offline Downloads for Mobile Devices",
      "text": "For years, fans of the most popular video streaming service, Netflix, have been clamoring for offline playback support.\nWe’ve seen this feature included with competitor services such as Amazon Prime Video for well over a year now. Even other competitors like Starz and now YouTube Red offer the ability to download video content onto a mobile device so users can play their favorite media back at a later time when they are without Internet access. Netflix resisted this trend initially, but eventually caved and recognized that users in many parts of the world simply do not have access to the Internet everywhere they go. Thus, the company launched an offline playback feature – but only for select markets. Yesterday though, Netflix officially launched its offline viewing feature worldwide for Android and iOS smartphones and tablets .\nFor iOS users, you must be running version 8.0 or higher whereas Android users will need to be on Android 4.4.2 KitKat or higher . As long as you’re on a compatible version of Android or iOS and have updated to the latest version of the Netflix application, you can download select TV shows and movies for offline playback. You’ll simply need to look for the download button located on the details page of a TV show or movie.\nAt this time, unfortunately, not every title on the service supports offline playback. Although more movies and TV shows are promised to support offline playback in the future, right now we’re told you can download many of the most popular shows such as Orange Is the New Black , Narcos , House of Cards , Stranger Things , Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , Master of None , and The Crown right now. Next Wednesday, other titles like Breaking Bad , Supernatural , The Office , The Flash , Minions , Kung Fu Panda 3 , and Home will be made available, with more to presumably follow.\nSource: Netflix Media Center \n",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn While Bernstein’s Todd Juenger and team aren’t calling for Walt Disney ( DIS ) to buy Netflix ( NFLX ) and don’t claim to have any knowledge of a potential acquisition , client’s kept asking, “What do you think of the idea of Disney acquiring Netflix?” Their reply: “[We] are (perhaps surprisingly) open to it.” They explain why:\nGetty Images Our initial reaction to almost any proposed acquisition is skepticism . In this case, we’re talking about a huge ($70bn?), dilutive, transformational event. And to the extent Disney accelerated the success of the company being acquired (which is usually the point of an acquisition in the first place), the faster it would cause the demise of Disney’s core TV network businesses.\nBut then we reminded ourselves – we believe the demise will happen anyway. From that POV, it is better, then, to own the winning solution. Imagine the appeal of a Disney/Netflix-branded SVOD service. Some argue Netflix would even bring with it the next Disney CEO.\nStill begs the question of whether Disney needs to spend ~$70bn to acquire, rather than build. Disney could build for less than $70bn, but it would take a long time, the expense would flow through the P&L the entire time, and they would still have to compete with Netflix forevermore.\nWe roughly estimate -31% dilution. But we don’t care so much about the dilution, never do. To us what matters is whether the thing you bought is worth, to your shareholders, more or less than what you paid, and how does that compare to the NPV of the next best alternative.\nShares of Walt Disney have gained 0.8% to $72.51 at 8:48 a.m. today after raising its dividend . Netflix has advanced 0.3% to $117.33.",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe cold months of December and January are upon us which means we’ll be spending more time inside. Although the thought of spending most of your days inside for the next few months sounds a bit depressing, technology has provided us with one of the best gifts we could ask for on a snowy day at home – streaming. \nStreaming is one of the most popular solutions available that can save you from going completely stir crazy as you hang out at home to avoid the cold weather this season. If you plan to let your streaming habits reach an all time high this season, chances are you’ll probably run out of things to watch after a while and will be looking to find what to watch on Netflix. Here are four apps and online tools you can use to find awesome new content as well as old favorites on Netflix and other popular streaming platforms. 1. FlickSurfer \nIf you enjoy being the person in your inner circle who recommends the most cutting edge shows and movies, Flick Surfer is about to be your new best friend. The site provides lists for top-rated content on Netflix and other streaming apps that can help you identify awesome content that hasn’t been hyped up. You can filter your results by genre, critic reviews, and awards won. If you’re looking for work produced by a specific director or cast member, you can even use the site’s search feature to find content released by him or her. \nEverything you need to further establish yourself as the go-to person for movie and show recommendations is at your fingertips with this cool resource. 2. What to Watch \nOne of the worst things about being an avid Netflixer is the tendency to complete entire seasons in one weekend. Fortunately, finding a new show that’s similar to the one you’ve been binge watching for the past couple of days can help you get over the post season finale blues. What To Watch is a free online tool that provides a list of recommended shows you can watch next based on your interests. Simply enter three of your favorite shows into the tool, then press the “Go” button to generate a list of shows you might enjoy watching next. The list provides multiple options as well as trailers and summaries for each suggested show. 3. Yideo \nIf you’re looking for a specific movie or show you haven’t seen in a while, chances are you’ll have to look in a few places before you find it. It’s a bit discouraging when you can’t find the content you want on Netflix, but Yideo can help you find out if it’s available on another streaming site. One catch is you’ll have to download the app to use this tool. The good news is the Yideo app is free and available on iOS and Android devices. Once you have the app, you can also use it to set up notifications for when and where your favorite shows become available to stream. 4. Fan TV \nFan TV provides another platform that shows you where you can stream the content you’re looking for, but it also provides information regarding trending content for specific genres. For example, if you wanted to keep up on the most popular new releases on each streaming platform, you could check out the site’s “What’s On” feature to find this content and get info on where and how you can stream it. \nSo there you have it, four awesome apps that can help you find the movies and shows you need to get through another season indoors. You no longer have to bother with what to watch on Netflix. Simply plug in to these apps and let them recommend shows you will like. Have an app or tool you’d recommend to fellow streaming junkies?

Well, here's a reason to do it all over: Netflix created a \"binge candle\" that smells different during each episode. \nThe four 90-minute episodes each represent a different season—Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall—as do the layers of the candle, \"so you can smell along in real time,\" states a video about the candle. You light it as you start, and burn straight on through, just like you did with a box of tissues. \nThe candle was part of a giveaway that, sadly, has already ended (unlike our shock at the last four words).",

Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "text": "Michael Kovac | Getty Images CEO of the Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger. Clients kept asking Bernstein's Todd Juenger whether Disney should buy Netflix so the media analyst decided to write an analysis of such a deal despite the fact there are no reports suggesting any partnership is being contemplated by either party. \nIn this purely speculative missive, the analyst says he would be open to the deal, which he calculates would cost Disney $70 billion. Juenger writes: \n\"Our initial reaction to almost any proposed acquisition is skepticism. In this case, we're talking about a huge ($70bn?), dilutive, transformational event. And to the extent Disney accelerated the success of the company being acquired (which is usually the point of an acquisition in the first place), the faster it would cause the demise of Disney's core TV network businesses. But then we reminded ourselves — we believe the demise will happen anyway. From that POV, it is better, then, to own the winning solution. Imagine the appeal of a Disney/Netflix-branded SVOD service. Some argue Netflix would even bring with it the next Disney CEO.\" \nAfter being the market's darling momentum stock for years, Netflix shares are up just 2 percent in 2016 through Wednesday as investors broadened out their interests beyond the infamous \"FANG\" stocks to industrials and banks. Disney has fared worse, however, with the stock down more than 7 percent this year through Wednesday on subscriber losses at its cable networks like ESPN. Netflix's market value is about $50 billion while Disney's is triple that. \nThe analyst believes the essential question is whether Disney is better off competing with Netflix by building its own platform or spending $70 billion to buy the content-streaming leader.",

      "text": "What's on Netflix > Top Lists > Top 20 Christmas Movies on Netflix in 2016 Top 20 Christmas Movies on Netflix in 2016 Tweet \nAs the Holiday season begins, it’s almost the time where the family wants to sit down by the fire and enjoy a stop of festive family entertainment. Whether you wish to join them or not is another matter. \nWhether you are the sort of person who embraces the festive spirit, or more of a Scrooge, here are 20 of the best festive movies streaming over December. 20. Happy Christmas (2014) \nBreaking up around Christmas must be very difficult, especially when you have to move into someone else’s life, let alone someone who has a child! She has to come to grips with the responsibility for a child and dealing with her life. This is maybe not sounding like the most uplifting experience, but there is a valuable conclusion involving realisations of relationships and happiness, but make no mistake, this is not suitable for small children. But there will be plenty that are on this list. 19. A Russell Peters Christmas Special (2011) \nA comedy Christmas Special hosted by Russell Peters, breaking down the average monotonous holiday gives a nice attitude to the stand-up performance. He brings attention to all the people who may not be so lucky around Christmas. Tells people to enjoy what they do have, and have fun. 18. I Am Santa Claus (2014) \nA slightly odd addition to the list is the documentary of five real professional Santa Clauses and what happens the rest of the year. This is a very raw, real look at the men in the ‘red suits’ whose lap your child is sitting on. It’s an interesting incite to something you normally don’t think about. 17. Snow Buddies (2008) \nThis film is primarily for only young children, and you are a very brave adult if you watch this all the way through. This is a Disney Christmas Spin-off and follows five puppies who fall from the sky, and then have to compete in a big dog sledge race. There isn’t much more to say; young children will love it. 16. The Legend of Frosty the SnowMan (2005) \nThis one is also for parents to sit their young children in front of to keep them busy for an hour. This is a story… I mean legend, of a snowman in the town of Evergreen, which is in despite need of some magic. His quest is to spread fun-loving and spirit (not the alcoholic kind) around the citizens of Evergreen, to ensure a fantastic Christmas. 15. 12 Dates of Chistmas (2011) \nIt’s like Groundhog Day, but for Christmas… and dating. After Kate hits her head at a department store, she is forced to re-live Christmas Eve over and over to perfect her day. She has to get over her ex, learn to love her step-mother and fall in love with, what seems like the perfect guy. Did I say it was a blind date? 14. The Search for Santa Paws (2010) \nAnother Christmas Dog film that is only really suitable for young kids. Can a dog save Santa as he loses his powers. The film is full of cute dogs and puppies that kids will lap up (pun intended). This Disney original has been followed by many sequels, but as usual, the original is the best. 13. Saving Santa (2013) \nA little stable Elf discovers the secret of Santa’s Sleigh and has to harness it to defend the North Pole and Save Santa… Twice. This cute animation is for kids which involves a time travelling Elf, what can possibly be bad about that? Kids of most ages will enjoy this film and the fun feeling it supplies. The story is not too patronising, even for you adults, and the animation is pleasant. 12. Snow Day (2000) \nWhen school is called off thanks to snow, everyone knows how excited children can get. And they will do anything to save it, even if it means hijacking a snow plough to keep it closed. This is more of a slightly older kids movie with a somewhat fairytale plot that they can enjoy. 11. Pete’s Christmas (2013) \nIt’s like Groundhog Day, but for Christmas… and not dating. Pete has the worst Christmas ever, then it gets stuck on repeat, is this his opportunity to fix Christmas for his family? Or will he keep on having this horrible day? This film can be more for the whole family to enjoy as there is nothing really to censor, with quite sweet not a patronising comedy.",

That means you can distract yourself with Netflix's expansive library without any internet connection, such as in airplane mode when flying home for the holidays or even on the subway commuting to work! \nUnfortunately, not every title on the streaming service is available to watch offline, but Netflix plans to add more down the road. In the meantime, many of Netflix's original series, including Orange Is the New Black , Narcos and The Crown , are available to download right now. \nThe 25 best Netflix originals, ranked \nSubscribers can access the download feature on their Apple and Android devices through the Netflix app, which now includes a \"download\" button on the Details page. The download feature is included in all Netflix plans, although users will need iOs 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later to access it, along with the most recent version of the Netflix app.",

      "text": "Netflix now allows users to download its content for offline viewing. \nFacebook's new Instant Games could open the door for increased revenues down the line. \nGoPro provides a sales update and details a reorganization. Facebook's New Revenue Stream? Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) haven't been doing bad necessarily, but despite topping earnings and revenue estimates last quarter, the stock has struggled to maintain its upward trajectory thanks to management's comments about slowing growth in the future. I mean, we can't possibly expect a $340+ billion market cap company to continue growing revenues at more than 50%, right? Seems reasonable and given that reduction in expectations, the stock is actually handling it pretty well. But amid Facebook facing a slowdown in ad-based revenue, it is clearly looking for other ways to keep its revenues moving from the lower left to the upper right. The company has now introduced a number of games , including Pac-Man, Words With Friends, Space Invaders and others for its users to play in their News Feeds. It also allows for in-game chat and group chat capabilities. The Instant Games service will allow users to load full-screen games on their devices, available for users in 30 countries. While there aren't any revenue streams available just yet, it doesn't mean that over time in-game purchases or possibly advertisements couldn't generate sales for Facebook. Instant Games is just the latest addition for the company, which has worked to make its Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram properties more attractive to users too, while also boosting features found on its original Facebook platform. Specifically, the company has added interactive calendar features, a marketplace, a workplace and a jobs/recruiting feature. The company has also tapped into appointment requests, event ticketing and food ordering. Will all of these features spit out revenue growth? No. But perhaps between all of them, it will help to bolster the company's revenue growth rate and will ensure that long-term earnings growth remains viable, especially as it continues to make pinpointing customers an easier task for advertisers. Download Netflix Content On Tuesday we touched on the idea that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) isn't going anywhere and being placed on set-top boxes shows just that. On Wednesday though, the company announced perhaps some of the most significant news about its service in a while: its content is now downloadable . Downloadable content plays into the idea of keeping the platform in front of consumers' eyes as much as possible. It's what Snapchat (Private: CHAT ), Facebook and a number of others are constantly striving to do. The longer companies keep themselves planted in front of customers, the stickier their platform becomes and the more valuable their product is. If users can download shows or a movie from Netflix, they now no longer have to rent something from the Apple Store when they're on a flight, for instance. Or now, they don't have to use up their data when they're not streaming via WiFi. This is valuable both at times when we don't have service and in other countries where internet connections may not be as prevalent as they are in the U.S. The product feature gives customers one more reason to stay subscribed and one more reason to justify paying a higher price when Netflix inevitably raises prices once again. This in turn fuels the whole circle: Netflix gains further in popularity, more customers ditch the cable box, more cable companies partner up with Netflix, Netflix gets bigger, more valuable and more popular. Then it's rinse and repeat. Now the question of Netflix's existence isn't really a question, unless it comes to someone buying them. But its stock is another story. Trading at 377x last year's earnings and 122x next year's expectations, it's anything but cheap. But how do you assign value to a game-changer like Netflix? GoPro's Restructure Shares of GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ) climbed 1.5% Wednesday, but closed well off the highs after it announced a restructuring. From the SA News Alert : \n\"The restructuring includes the closure of its entertainment division, facilities reductions, and the elimination of more than 200 full-time positions plus the cancellation of open positions for a reduction in force of approximately 15 percent.\" The result will shave about $85 million off the company's planned 2017 operating expenses and CEO Nick Woodman looks like he may finally be serious about refocusing the company's efforts on its core business. That would be a big win for a company that has seen its stock price fall from the mid-$80s at its highs, to sub-$10 prices. Aside from perhaps an increase in confidence that management is straightening out the company, investors should also be happy to hear that the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday period saw sales climb 33% vs. 2015. That's pretty impressive and it shows that GoPro's products are still in demand. Of course, last year's five-day stretch didn't go quite as well, thanks to some inventory management issues. Some may recall the company's disappointing Q4 results and also a string of job cuts earlier this year . So all of this is to say, where's GoPro headed from here? All the latest signs have said not to trust this now sub-$1.5 billion company. With management continuing to swing and miss, increasing competition and a stock that never seems to stop declining, how do you know when it's time to step in? I see GoPro as a category leader, for sure. And maybe its sales results this year will be really impressive. But I'm not a big believer in its Karma Drone, simply because of its high price and the addressable market. Its last earnings report was not good, to put it kindly . While every stock eventually bottoms - and GoPro actually looks pretty good on a chart - I can't be certain whether its has or not.

      "text": "Share \nNetflix had an early Christmas present on offer for anyone who has ever been deep into a binge when they were forced to suddenly be someplace where streaming isn’t an option. \nAnnounced via Twitter, Netflix has indicated that it will allow customers to download its in-house-produced content to their devices for offline viewing. \nThis is something of a reversal on Netflix’s part. The firm had previously denied it would allow offline downloading. That stance had softened by earlier this year as the company said it was working to develop a solution for customers who are flying or otherwise unable to access a network. Amazon has been enabling downloading services for a year, but those services are reportedly limited. \nIt also remains a bit unclear what devices will be able to download films. Phones and tablets will likely both be included, but it remains unknown if the option will also be open to desktop computer users.",

      "text": "Netflix \nSubway commuters, your ride will never be the same. \nNetflix app users can now download TV series and movies to watch with or without an Internet connection; that means you're free to binge-watch all eight episodes of \"Stranger Things\" and all three seasons of \"Black Mirror\" any time you're riding a train underground. \nNetflix introduced the new download feature to its platform for phones and tablets on Android and iOS Wednesday. \nSubscribers to the streaming service will see a new button appear next to TV series episodes and movies currently available for download when they update their app. \nBut users should know that not all Netflix content is ready for downloading. (You won't be inhaling the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival in a subterranean tunnel just yet.) \nIn this new era of entertainment everywhere, we encourage you to follow the old etiquette rule for respecting your fellow straphangers: \"Wear your f**king headphones,\" in the words of our friends at Brokelyn .",

      "text": "1 of 5 Sure, you've had mashed 'taters for Thanksgiving, and probably for a few days after. But if you want some of them French-fried 'taters a la Sling Blade streamed on the Netflix, you're out of luck as of Dec. 1. MMMM- hmmm .\nThat movie, featuring a mentally challenged adult man fascinatingly portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton , has an impressive 96 percent \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Your writer highly recommends it, but now you'll need to get the DVD or watch on pay-per-view. Bonus: See if you can find the original short, called Some Call It a Sling Blade featuring Thornton with J.T. Walsh and Molly Ringwald , who did not appear in the full-length feature. Thornton wrote the short, and the full-length adapted screenplay that the short pitched to Hollywood. He took home an Oscar for his writing and a nomination for his acting.\nAs Karl might say: \"Aight, den\" ... on to more highlights from December's comings and goings in Netflix's video treasure trove (full list below):\nLove Kevin Spacey ? You'll cringe with his character in American Beauty ( 88 percent Fresh ) but that rose has wilted and left Netflix streaming. Like a desperate MiG 29 trying to land on a broken Russian aircraft carrier, \"Top Gun\" ran out of streaming fuel on Dec. 1.\nWith the family all home for the holidays to argue about the election, you might consider The In-Laws a good distraction from the inevitable. Think again . This isn't the 1979 version starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin . There's never enough Falk and Arkin – ever . The remake does have Albert Brooks, so there's that. Regardless, you won't have to worry about the remake any more – on Netflix streaming, anyway.\nIf you just KNOW the government is hiding something really big via coded messages known only to the Illuminati, you have until Dec. 14 to find out – that's when The Da Vinci Code disappears like so much invisible continental congressional ink.\nDon't fret the losses ... a lot of cool new stuff is being added starting Dec. 1, including TOGA!!!! – National Lampoon's Animal House . And you'll be able to Netflix and Chill with Bob Ross to a greater degree than ever before ... featuring a collection of the big-haired painter's best, plus more than a few happy little trees starting bright and early Dec. 1.\nWho can't use a little more Robin Williams ? Barry Levinson 's \"Toys\" joins the holiday fun Dec. 1, with awesome contributions from LL Cool J , Michael Gambon and the military-industrial complex . Critics hated it . If that doesn't convince you to watch it, try the awesome improv trailer Williams did for it:\nA slew of Netflix Originals are being added as well in December. Top of that list to watch with your Facebook-fake-news-sharing uncle is Barry , a biopic about Barack Obama that arrives on Dec. 16. Perhaps not. Possible alternatives from the newly arriving list include The Way of the Dragon , the awesome 1972 kung fu flick that features Bruce Lee denuding conservative commentator Chuck Norris ' chest of hair before dispatching him ... or perhaps Hitler: A Career ? Both arrive on Dec. 1. There's always America's biggest patriot beating up bad dudes in Marvel's Captain America: Civil War – arriving as a big present from Netflix on Christmas Day. Maybe just put your uncle on a brony filter and play it safe with My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic: Season 6 , arriving Dec. 20.\nHere's the full rundown:\nDeparting Netflix in December 2016 December 1\n50 First Dates (2004)\nAmerican Beauty (1999)\nBlack Ops: Series 2\nCamp Takota (2014)\nCarmen Jones (1954)\nCats & Dogs (2001)\nCurious George: Swings Into Spring (2013)\nDon't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)\nElizabeth: The Golden Age (2007)\nEvent Horizon (1997)\nFrequencies (2013)\nMcConkey\nMedora (2013)\nMonkey Business (1952)\nMyth Hunters: Series 1\nMyth Hunters: Series 2\nNeil Young : Heart of Gold (2006)\nPaycheck (2003)\nPirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie (2008)\nRiver of No Return (1954)\nSling Blade (1996)\nThor: Hammer of the Gods (2009)\nThe Great War Diary: Season 1\nThe In-Laws (2003)\nThe Out-of-Towners (1999)\nTop Gun (1986)\nValley of the Dolls (1967)\nWorld Trade Center (2006)\nDecember 2\nLegends of the Knight (2013)\nThe Red Baron (2008)\nDecember 3\nThe Best of Me (2014)\nDecember 5\nHoles (2003)\nDecember 14\nThe Da Vinci Code (2006)\nDecember 15\nHigh Profits: Season 1\nWorld War II in Colour (2009)\nDecember 16\nBeyond the Hills (2012)\nDecember 22\nDark Skies (2013)\nDecember 26\nJust Friends (2005)\nDecember 27\nSpy Kids (2001)\nDecember 31\nHercules: The Legendary Journeys: Seasons 1-6\nArriving on Netflix in December 2016\nDecember 1\nAlways (1989)\nAngels in the Snow (2015)\nBeverly Hills Cop (1984)\nBeyond Bollywood (2014)\nBlack Snake Moan (2007)\nChill with Bob Ross: Collection (1990)\nCompulsion (1959)\nD2: The Mighty Ducks (1994)\nDavid Blaine : Street Magic (1997)\nDreamland (2010)\nFor the Love of Spock (2016)\nGirlfriends' Guide to Divorce: Season 2 (2015)\nGlory Daze: The Life and Time of Michael Alig (2016)\nHarry and the Hendersons (1987)\nHitler: A Career (1977)\nHoliday Engagement (2011)\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids (1989)\nHouse of Wax (2006)\nHannibal (2001)\nMerli: Season 1 – NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nMerry Kissmas (2015)\nNational Lampoon's Animal House (1978)\nPicture Perfect (1997)\nRainbow Time (2016)\nRodeo & Juliet (2015)\nSwept Under (2016)\nSwitchback (1997)\nThe Angry Birds Movie (2016)\nThe Crucible (1996)\nThe Little Rascals (1994)\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)\nThe Rock (1996)\nThe Spirit of Christmas (2015)\nThe Way of the Dragon (1972)\nToys (1992)\nUncle Nick (2015)\nWaking Life (2001)\nWe're Back!

That means you can distract yourself with Netflix's expansive library without any internet connection, such as in airplane mode when flying home for the holidays or even on the subway commuting to work! \nUnfortunately, not every title on the streaming service is available to watch offline, but Netflix plans to add more down the road. In the meantime, many of Netflix's original series, including Orange Is the New Black , Narcos and The Crown , are available to download right now. \nThe 25 best Netflix originals, ranked \nSubscribers can access the download feature on their Apple and Android devices through the Netflix app, which now includes a \"download\" button on the Details page.

That means you can distract yourself with Netflix's expansive library without any internet connection, such as in airplane mode when flying home for the holidays or even on the subway commuting to work! \nUnfortunately, not every title on the streaming service is available to watch offline, but Netflix plans to add more down the road. In the meantime, many of Netflix's original series, including Orange Is the New Black , Narcos and The Crown , are available to download right now. \nThe 25 best Netflix originals, ranked \nSubscribers can access the download feature on their Apple and Android devices through the Netflix app, which now includes a \"download\" button on the Details page. The download feature is included in all Netflix plans, although users will need iOs 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later to access it, along with the most recent version of the Netflix app.",

      "text": "Netflix enabled a download option in the official Netflix application for Android and iOS mobile operating systems a couple of days ago.\nI thought that this was a really cool option, considering that you could download shows or movies at home using Wi-Fi, to watch them elsewhere where the reception is not as good or not available at all.\nThink of an eight hour or longer flight. Yes, the shows and movies of the in-flight entertainment system may be nice, but what if you could watch your favorite show instead on your Android or iOS device?\nAnyway, I tried the new Netflix app version and realized that it did not show the download button. While the app version was the one Netflix released on the day it made the announcement, all options related to downloading shows or movies for offline watching are not available.\nFirst thought that it might have something to do that I rooted the device, or that it was a server-side roll out of the feature.\nI found a couple of suggestions online, like clearing the application cache or removing the app and installing it again. Those did not work in my case, and I noticed that other users were having the issue as well.\nTip: I suggest you verify download options by loading The Crown TV show as it supports downloads. Not all shows or movies support downloads on Netflix right now.\nWhy you cannot download Netflix titles to your device \nWhile Netflix did mention that the feature is included in all plans and available worldwide, it never mentioned that it is available for all devices.\nIf you open the Netflix support site , you find out that you need iOS 8.0 or later, or Android 4.4.2 or later for the download feature to work.\nIf you read on, you will come to another restriction that the company did not mention in the announcement:\nAndroid devices must be able to stream Netflix in HD to select video quality. Visit our article about Android for more information about HD capable models.\nCheck the list of Android devices that support HD officially to see if your device is listed on it. Mine is not, and that is the reason why I don't see the download option.\nNow, the list is not complete. The Samsung Galaxy S4 is not listed on the page for instance, but users can download Netflix titles using it.\nChance is high however, that if you have a phone released by a Chinese company, say Xiaomi or Huawei, that you may not be able to use Netflix's download functionality right now.\nUnless Netflix starts to enable the functionality for more devices, there seems little that you can do to enable downloads on Netflix.\nNow You: Have you tested the feature? Did it work?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon .

      "text": " 53AM PT \nRegina King has booked yet another starring role. \nShe’s joining the cast of Veena Sud ’s “ Seven Seconds ,” a crime drama slated for a 10-episode run on Netflix. \nIn the drama, tensions run high between African-American citizens and Caucasian cops in Jersey City, where a teenage African-American boy is critically injured by a cop. \nKing plays Latrice Butler, a devout churchgoer and a proud wife and mother. After she moved out of the projects with her family and becomes a first-time home owner, she is shaken to her core when she learns that her 15-year-old son, Brenton, has been involved an incident. When she learns that there’s more to Brenton than she and her husband were aware of, Latrice is rocked by the power of her anger at her son’s predicament — an anger that will change her life, her relationship with her husband. \nThe Emmy-winning actress (“American Crime”) joins previously announced cast members David Lyons (“Game of Silence”), Michael Mosley (“Sirens”) and Patrick Murney (“Public Morals”). \nKing is already slated to return for the third season of ABC’s “American Crime” as well as HBO’s “The Leftovers.” She’s also spent time behind the camera as well, directing “Scandal,”“The Catch” and “Greenleaf,” among others. \nKing is repped by ICM, John Carrabino Management and Del Shaw. \nSud (“The Killing”), who will serve as showrunner on the series, executive produces with Gavin O’Connor, Lawrence Bender, Kevin Brown and Alex Reznik. The show hails from Fox 21. Sud \nThe series is based on the 2013 Russian action movie, “The Major,” which was written, directed by and starring Yuri Bykov and produced by Rock Films. \n\nNo premiere date has been announced yet.",

      "text": "By Kevin Fitzpatrick December 1, 2016 9:05 AM | ScreenCrush HBO \nAs if the ability to watch Netflix offline weren’t enough, soon all your streaming options will change the way you watch TV. Amazon seems to be keeping plenty competitive as well, now adding the option to include HBO or Cinemax to its Prime subscription, albeit for a price. \nAmazon confirms that HBO and Cinemax have been made available to its Channels selection of add-ons for Prime video members, with a caveat to your existing subscription. Both are available with 30-day free trials, after which HBO will cost you an additional $14.99 per month, while Cinemax rings up at $9.99 monthly. \nSays Amazon: \nHBO has produced some of the most groundbreaking, beloved and award-winning shows in television history. Their selection of blockbuster movies is unsurpassed, including hits like Batman vs. Superman , The Revenant , and Deadpool . And, our customers have been asking when all that wonderful content will be available on Amazon Channels. \nPrime members can now watch the latest episodes of the critically-acclaimed Westworld and Game of Thrones without the need for a cable subscription. We’re thrilled to work with HBO to bring their cutting-edge content to Amazon Prime members with Amazon Channels. \nThe Channels service provides over 70 additional add-on packs for Prime video beyond the regular subscription, while the HBO and Cinemax additions offer both licensed movies and the full TV library. Granted, the pricetags aren’t too different from an HBO Now subscription, but it’ll certainly make things easier for Amazon bundlers.",

That means you can distract yourself with Netflix's expansive library without any internet connection, such as in airplane mode when flying home for the holidays or even on the subway commuting to work! \nUnfortunately, not every title on the streaming service is available to watch offline, but Netflix plans to add more down the road. In the meantime, many of Netflix's original series, including Orange Is the New Black , Narcos and The Crown , are available to download right now. \nThe 25 best Netflix originals, ranked \nSubscribers can access the download feature on their Apple and Android devices through the Netflix app, which now includes a \"download\" button on the Details page. The download feature is included in all Netflix plans, although users will need iOs 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later to access it, along with the most recent version of the Netflix app.",

      "text": "Subscribe to the Times ‘Hail, Caesar!’ (Dec. 24) Take a trip back to 1950s Hollywood, where the studios still controlled everything and communism was possibly as close as the nearest writer’s room. The latest movie from the Coen Brothers concerns Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), a studio fixer who cleans up after scandalous stars and saves his bosses from tabloid ruin. There’s a cavalcade of familiar faces in this Tinseltown homage, including George Clooney, Channing Tatum, Scarlett Johansson and the soon-to-be young Han Solo, Alden Ehrenreich. Photo Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz in “The Lobster.” Credit A24 New on Amazon Prime Alfred Molina and John Lithgow play a recently married couple who are made to separate after losing their home and income. The result is a heartfelt story that is likely to make you crave a hug or a good cry. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story ‘The Lobster’ (Dec. 2) In this dark comedy from the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, David (Colin Farrell) signs up for a resort that will pair him with a new romantic partner within 45 days — or else he’ll be turned into the animal of his choice. This is a good choice for viewers with a more offbeat sense of humor. You’ll need it to get through this strange dystopian world. ‘Anomalisa’ (Dec. 17) After a chance encounter at one of his speaking engagements, Michael (David Thewlis) falls for one of the attendees (Jennifer Jason Leigh), creating an existential and romantic crisis for the married man in this melancholy stop-motion animated film from Duke Johnson and Charlie Kaufman (“Being John Malkovich,” “Adaptation”). Photo Charlie B. Barkin and Anne-Marie in “All Dogs Go to Heaven.” Credit MGM New on Hulu ‘All Dogs Go to Heaven’ Don Bluth doesn’t get as much love as his former employers at Disney, but his animation style made an impression on a generation of children who grew up watching “The Secret of NIMH” and “The Land Before Time.” “All Dogs Go to Heaven” is pretty dark for a kid’s movie (we are talking about the afterlife here), but it manages to remain vibrant and charming, thanks in part to the voice talents of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise. ‘ No Country for Old Men’ I’m not suggesting you gather the family on Christmas week for this one, but this tautest of thrillers from the Coen Brothers won Best Picture for a reason. In the film, a Texas man (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a grisly murder scene and takes off with a bag of loot. Hot on his trail is a psychopath (Javier Bardem) and a poor old sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who’s tired of all the senseless violence. ‘Shivers’ Another great holiday film! In one of David Cronenberg’s earliest films, a parasite created from foul scientific experiments spreads throughout an apartment building, causing its victims to become sex-obsessed. ‘The Trip to Italy’ (Dec. 23) If you liked watching Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon trade Michael Caine impressions over amazing plates of food in 2011’s “ The Trip ,” then there’s a good chance you’re going to enjoy this follow-up. As the title implies, it’s pretty much like the first. But in Italy. Also of Interest “Apocalypse Now,” “Apocalypse Now Redux,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” “Pulp Fiction,” “Rosemary’s Baby,” “The Silence of the Lambs,” the “Friday the 13th” series (Parts 1-8), “Anomalisa” (Dec. 17) Photo Amy Adams in “Enchanted.” Credit Barry Wetcher/Walt Disney Pictures New on Starz ‘The Fortune Cookie’ Buttressed by the acerbic wit and speed of Billy Wilder’s direction and screenplay, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are at the top of their game in this 1966 film. Here, Lemmon plays an injured cameraman whose lawyer brother-in-law sees an opportunity to exploit the insurance companies. What could go wrong? ‘Enchanted’ (Dec. 16) Long before conversing with aliens in “Arrival,” Amy Adams talked to animals in this delightful romantic comedy, in which she plays the bubbliest (and most naïve) princess in an animated kingdom. That is, until an evil queen (Susan Sarandon) drops her into harsh (live-action) New York City. She eventually has to choose between Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden, so it’s not all bad. \nAdvertisement",

      "text": "Amazon Prime Instant Video review Netflix look out… Amazon is back with a much improved user experience Tested at Compare Prices Our Verdict A more advanced, easier-to-use version of its former self, Amazon Instant Video is one of the most complete and competitive streaming services out there For Ultra HD and HDR content included Valuable original content First to newer releases over Netflix Vast catalogue No Apple TV or Google Chromecast support Jump to Reviewed on 1st December 2016 \nGone are the days when Amazon was the go-to website for only books, CDs and DVDs. Now the shopping Goliath is vying for your custom anywhere, anytime and in any way it can – not least in the digital realm. \nIt wants you to download books from its Kindle Store, stream music from its Prime Music catalogue, and subscribe to its Amazon Prime Instant Video service. \nThe latter has had plenty of different names over the years (Amazon Unbox, LoveFilm Instant, Instant Video…), but has always been in direct competition with Netflix . That’s not an easy place to be, as fellow video streaming service NOW TV would concur. \nAt the time of our last review of the service in 2014, it was a silver medalist in a two-horse race. We praised Amazon’s extensive catalogue and wide platform support, but found its subscription packaging was confusing and needed simplifying. \nTwo years is a lifetime in the fast-moving digital realm, so it’s hardly surprising that much has changed: the size of its catalogue and number of subscribers has gained traction in a big way, and while it still nests within Amazon’s all-encompassing website, the service has been considerably simplified. \nMORE: Netflix review f Price \nThere are two cancel-anytime subscription tiers, both of which offer a 30-day free trial: Prime Video for £6 per month , which is the Netflix-rivalling video streaming service, and a £8 per month (or £70 upfront) Prime membership that adds ad-free streaming of Prime Music , unlimited photo storage in Amazon Cloud Drive, and one-day shipping service on select Amazon-stocked products. \nAmazon Video – the subscription-free on-demand and rental part of the website, available to everyone and anyone – has also been worked into the Prime Video and Prime offering, with select titles also available to subscribers. \nAnd the fate of Amazon-owned LoveFilm? It’s still with us, but clinging on as a postal service. \nMORE: Amazon Prime Music review Features \nPrime Video (and Prime) subscribers have access to over 15,000 movies and TV episodes – more than enough to satisfy the most ardent couch potato. It has grown considerably since 2014, when it was a little over 2000. \nSize isn’t everything, of course, and while there are a fair few oldies – who wouldn’t want Fist of Fury 3 and all eight series of Downton Abbey available at the touch of a button? – there is no shortage of new releases either. \nIn fact, while new films ( Neon Demon , for example) and hot-off-the-lens TV shows (Season 7 of The Walking Dead ) are only available to buy or rent outside of the subscription offering through the 38,000-strong Amazon Video service, the Prime Video catalogue still tends to be quicker to newer titles than Netflix. \nA fair few of last year’s big hits such as the Macbeth adaptation, Academy Award-winning Spotlight and nominee Room are present, as well as films that had theatrical releases just months ago, like A Walk in the Woods . \nTitles are constantly coming and going, but Amazon’s own content is on the rise too. In 2011, Netflix began the trend of producing its own original content, and Amazon has clocked on. \nSince 2013, Amazon Studios has produced TV dramas, comedies, documentaries and children’s programming under the ‘Amazon Originals’ umbrella: Bosch , Hand of God , Mad Dogs , Alpha House and Man in the High Castle , to name just a few. \nExclusive to Amazon, they all fall under the subscription tier, and with many now in a second season and some renewed for a third, it seems Amazon is doing something right. \nIndeed, Transparent won a Golden Globe award in 2015 for best TV series (musical or comedy), and the much-anticipated Grand Tour , fronted by petrol-heads Clarkson, Hammond and May, has surely already secured a fan base since the first episode aired on 28th November. \nAmazon Originals’ Ultra HD content is available under the Prime Video and Prime subscription tiers at no extra cost, for anyone who has a 4K TV with the 4K-supporting Amazon app (like the LG OLED65E6V and Samsung UE55KS7000 ) and an internet connection of at least 15Mbps. \nCurrently it’s the cheapest way to stream 4K content, as Netflix only offers it under its £9 per month Premium subscription tier. \nMORE: What is Ultra HD TV and 4K TV? Everything you need to know More after the break \nThere are a few 4K Amazon Original shows also available in HDR: all three seasons of Transparent , both seasons of Mozart in the Jungle , and the first seasons of Red Oaks , Mad Dogs and Man in the High Castle , to get you started. \nWhile these 4K and 4K HDR offerings aren’t comprehensive enough to sideline Full HD altogether, they are on par with Netflix. \nFor those prepared to splash out, Amazon Video offers more to rent or buy. New release Concussion currently tops the bill at £27, accompanied by other releases at £20. \nNetflix was first to support Dolby Vision (Dolby’s alternative to the more universal HDR 10 version of HDR ) and Amazon has followed suit by offering the likes of Bosch and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment films in the Amazon Video section – albeit only in the US for now. \nMORE: HDR TV - What is it? How can you get it? Ease of use \nFar from being limited to PCs and laptops, Amazon Instant Video can also be used on Android and iOS platforms, thanks to mobile apps. \nIt’s also available on the Fire TV and Roku media streaming sticks and Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and has become common on TV and Blu-ray players’ smart offerings. \nApple TV remains a gaping hole in its platform support, although you can always AirPlay it to the Apple TV from the iOS app. \nSimilarly, there’s no native support for Google Chromecast, but you can cast a laptop or phone screen from a Google Chrome web browser or Chromecast app to your telly. \nThe user experience is much improved across all platforms. \nThe service is still buried in amongst the Shoes & Bags and Sports & Outdoors categories in the search bar menu, but it’s now much easier to browse and filter what’s included with your subscription and what isn’t. \nIn ‘All Videos’, content included with Prime is indicated with a sash, and categories are clearly flagged in blue to avoid confusion. \nWant to see what’s available under the subscription service? Use the filters to strip out paid-for content, so you can choose to see just TV shows or movies. The web platform adds extra tick-box filters like genre, release date, actor and certificate. \nLike Netflix, the home interface is a busy banner list of seemingly endless categories: Ultra HD TV, Amazon Originals, Highest Rated TV and Movies Out This Week to more obscure 2016 Emmy Award Shows, Movies in French, and our favourite: 90 Minutes or Less Movies. \nBelow there’s tabs for your Video Library (content you’ve purchased) and Watchlist (content you’ve flagged to watch later), as well as a handy search bar for when nothing but old episodes of The X-Files will do. \nWe wish HDR programming had its own tab, but our only other gripe is that when you return to the menus, you are taken back to start of the list instead of where you left off – frustrating for those partial to casual browsing. \nMORE: 4K streaming vs 4K Blu-ray vs Blu-ray – which is best? Performance \nNo longer does streaming mean noisy pictures and buffering waits you could boil the kettle during. But neither does high-definition streaming bring the absolute crispness and subtlety of the Blu-ray. \nThe quality gap is narrowing though, with streams from Amazon consistently sharp, clean and punchy. \nOn the audio front, Amazon supports multi-channel up to Dolby Digital 5.1, so you get an improvement in sound to match the step up in picture quality. \nThe high-definition stream of gangster film Legend , starring Tom Hardy, contrasts with the bleak streets of 1960s East End. \nMORE: 10 of the best film scenes to test picture quality \nBut there is plenty of definition in the gleaming cars, PVC dresses, the shine to the Kray brother’s slicked-back hair and the anxious faces of their imminent casualties. \nNavy suits and mahogany interiors have a richness that gives their club the intended sense of grandeur, and thanks to a sense of smoothness and poise, the brutality of the fistfights will have you grimacing, rather than distracted by any motion blur. \nIn our opinion, paying out for a 4K telly is worth it for streams alone. Bosch in the higher resolution is notably sharper than HD streams, glossier and cleaner too. \nOur praise for HDR streaming is more reserved, as it is with Netflix streams too, the benefits considerably more noticeable on the 4K disc format. Verdict \nAmazon Prime Instant Video has undoubtedly matured as a video streaming service. \nIt offers a vast and attractively up-to-date catalogue – uniquely inclusive of 4K and HDR material – under a subscription that’s competitively priced and much simpler to grasp than before. \nThe opportunity to easily open your wallet wider to what Amazon Video offers is a bonus, as is the option to incorporate Amazon’s shopping and other digital avenues for a few quid a month extra. \nTime to go Prime? Maybe. All we’ll say is, Netflix better watch out… \nSee all our Amazon reviews See all our",

      "text": "Divya Amladi @divyamladi | 12.1.16 | 12:36 pm   Netflix \nD id anyone else cringe all the way through the Gilmore Girls revival? Not just because Rory has her head wedged up her ass for the duration of Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life , or because the writers lazily rely on tired jokes about hipsters to show us how times have changed, or because of the awkward scene that references David Foster Wallace as David Wallace more than once. No, the deepest cringes are for the blatant racist, homophobic and fat shaming attitudes throughout the show’s four installments.These are truly the things that make this year’s most buzzed about reboot painful to watch. \nMuch like the Full House second series, Fuller House , Netflix’s Gilmore Girls redux makes it excruciatingly obvious that what is in the past should stay in the past. Writer and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has worked hard to stay faithful to the world she crafted for her characters, and while those characters were perhaps tolerable during the original 2000-2007 run, not having updated the show for today’s slightly more inclusive TV landscape brings the casual racism, homophobia and body shaming of the former show into sharp focus. \nIn the early 2000s, when Gilmore Girls premiered, I was slightly younger than Rory and while her uber rich family and small-town New England life were not exactly relatable, her teen angst was. The people of Stars Hollow, whom she preferred to those who resided in stuffy Hartford, were lovable weirdos. Excepting the whole Logan storyline, it was fun to watch Rory reject high-society life in favor of her simple roots. (Admittedly, that’s a huge thing to overlook; Rory definitely leaned the fuck in on high-society life eventually. At least the parts of it that advantaged her, while still hanging out in Stars Hollow enough to think she wasn’t totally a part of the one-percenter world that she was actively benefitting from. Anyway, Rory sucks but that isn’t even the point right now.) \nIn those early aughts, minority representation on TV was pitiful (to say the least), so the fact that multiple actors of color were featured in the main cast was progressive, at least on the surface. Casting Rory’s best friend as Korean-American appeared groundbreaking…until you took into account that her mother, Mrs. Kim, was a grating Tiger Mother stereotype and that all of the other Koreans in Stars Hollow besides Lane were treated as a monolith. Lorelai’s coworker Michel is a closeted gay black Frenchman, which again, was novel. Except that he’s reduced to an accent joke every time he’s on screen. Time and again, in the Gilmore world, an accent means you’re not worthy of being understood. By the far the most condescending storyline is a recurring gag wherein Emily Gilmore’s help—always foreign, almost always women of color—are interchangeable and disposable. \nThe thing about nostalgia, which is all the more clear in a Trump’s America™, is that it romanticizes good, even mediocre, even horrible, and washes out all unpleasantries, even if the unpleasantries are definitive to the thing being romanticized. Problematic as the show was, the elements that endure are the close relationship between Lorelai and Rory that all mothers and daughters sort-of-kind-of wish they had, the fast-talking, the unexpected cameos (Norman Mailer?), and the inhuman coffee consumption. \nFor those wondering if the Netflix version is anything like the original, it is, especially in the way that it continues to fetishize skinny white women and caricature anyone who doesn’t fit that mold. I didn’t grow up in a small town, so forgive me — maybe people truly are that incapable of noticing how offensive they’re being, but it’s too easy to write the show’s problematic comments off simply because it’s set in a small town. \nWith Gilmore Girls , it’s always been difficult to discern when the writers are winking at the audience. Are we supposed to be laughing at the characters — like when Emily says she has no idea what language her maids are speaking because she’s ignorant and doesn’t take the time to get to know them, or are we supposed to laugh along with her because hey, isn’t it crazy that they speak broken English and isn’t it hilarious that Emily is somehow fundamentally incapable of figuring out which language the people who share her home are speaking? \nAt a cursory glance, it appears that the show has taken notes on lack of diversity seriously, as there are a few more extras in town with melanin in their skin, and even some with speaking roles (although not many, and it does feel like very obvious and superficial placement of brown and black bodies as props intentionally placed to absolve the show of its more systemic and unrefined crimes) And as you keep watching, you realize that maybe somehow, the show’s characters have gotten even worse. \nMrs. Kim, Lane’s mom, is up to her crazy old tricks in the “Spring” episode, leading a group of lost-puppy Korean teens around the International Spring Food Festival. They’re her choir, “fresh off the boat.” Why does she need these kids off the boat? Why does it sound like they’re products, items, that she acquired? Why don’t any of the Koreans get to have personalities? Lane’s mom was always chiefly characterized by her harshness and a litany of other qualities unquestionably derived from your standard Asian mom stereotype, but it seemed in the revival like time and distance from the original run of the series had impressed upon the showrunner’s a compulsion to push through heavy-handed character exposition by putting the characters into an even more extreme level of the clichés they were already dripping in. So, like, we’d remember who they are. The problem is, when who the characters always were was pre y offensive and kinda racist, trying to reintroduce them in just a few moments on screen meant going even deeper (and doing so very quickly) into the parts of them that were always problematic. \nLater in the same episode, there’s a bizarre gay witch hunt. Now that Michel’s finally out, I suppose Amy Sherman-Palladino is patting herself on the back for her progressiveness. But in the scene where the town discusses its Pride parade, things get weird. Tight-ass Taylor, the town selectman, announces that there aren’t enough gays in Stars Hollow for a parade, because people haven’t “volunteered” to out themselves. He’s contacted nearby towns to ask if they could “lends their gays,” you know, because gays—like Koreans—are interchangeable items, not individuals. The joke here is supposed to be that everyone suspects that Taylor is gay, and that he’s not owning it. But why should he? Luke can’t even wrap his simple brain around the news that there are three gay people in town. Good stuff all around. \nAnd then there’s Lorelai’s mom, Emily Gilmore. True to form, Emily Gilmore has a new maid, Berta, at the start of the series. Shockingly, she actually holds on to this one throughout all four episodes. Berta is more humanized than her previous maids, but once again, a running joke is that Emily is clueless as to what language Berta is speaking. Berta’s entire extended family moves into the Gilmore mansion (and all end up working for her, and none of the other members of the family get speaking roles, or names), and later, Emily’s Nantucket home. The eldest Gilmore girl is painted as a generous benefactor. Commenters online have noted that it’s sweet that Emily “adopted” the family. CREDIT: Netflix \nIn truth, Berta has offered to move her family in to take care of a woman who is so clueless, she doesn’t know how to boil soup. Sure, Emily is grieving and in a numb state, but the whole storyline reads like a weaksauce commentary on immigrants moving in and taking over. Every time Berta is on screen, Emily has to comment about how she has no idea what Berta is saying or what Berta is cooking, or who the other people are in her house because they “keep appearing.” Perhaps Rory could have schooled her grandmother on Google translate? Isn’t the grating backbone of these scripts all about pounding into our heads that it’s 2016 now? \nIn the final episode, “Fall,” Berta and her family are nestled asleep in chairs in Emily’s Nantucket abode—do they not have a room to sleep in? No, seriously: Eventually Emily sells the huge house that could’ve comfortably fit all these new people, opting to chuck it (it makes her sad because dead husband) in favor of living at a much smaller beach house, where Berta’s kids end up sleeping in chairs. (OK, admittedly, they could’ve just been napping there, but it sure as fuck looked like Emily was tucking them in for the night in arm chairs while their mother slept on a couch behind them.) But hey, again, these people of color are not treated as people so much as objects; you can just put those anywhere. \nAnd then there’s the fat shaming (because of course there is). The most surprising of all. Gilmore Girls was once a show that celebrated fuller ladies, like Sookie, Babette, and Ms. Patty. Hell, they even let Ms. Patty be defined in part by an effusive sexuality; Babette was always presumed to be boning the shit out of her guy, and Sookie got a fairly well-developed romantic storyline. True, these characters were ultimately aesthetic foils meant to cast Lorelai and Rory’s dewy, bony asses into exalted relief, but hey, let’s just decide to call body-size representation in the original series something slightly less than a total nightmare. \nBut in the revival, plus-size bodies became just another topic for Rory and Lorelai’s shtick. In the “Summer” episode, whiny jobless Rory and smug fake Southern belle Lorelai spend their days judging overweight men at the Stars Hollow Municipal Pool. They have a code word for them, Pat. Or Butterbutt. So original. The pool is a “minefield” for these men, Lorelai notes in repugnance. Who are Lorelai and Rory to judge? They worship junk food and abhor exercise. I am convinced they suffer from hyperthyroidism, or some other metabolic disorder, which allows them to maintain their slim figures while stuffing their faces at every possible opportunity, but that’s neither here nor there because it’s rude and gross to assume things about how people’s bodies work and why they look the way they do. Like, doesn’t it seem like two people who inhale shitty food and never exercise, and yet retain slender bodies, should be more aware than most that a person’s outward appearance is a piss-poor measure of their lifestyle (not that it really matters anyway)? CREDIT: Netflix \nAnd speaking of that pool scene, let’s pay no mind to the young Asian boy who, for completely unexplained reasons, spends the whole time standing behind Rory, shading her from the sun with a parasol, later running after her carrying her things while she engages in drama with other white people, calling her fucking “Khaleesi.” Let’s just skip over that batshit moment. \nFor a show that obviously embraces white-girl feminism, Gilmore Girls is perennially, insufferably tone deaf to issues of race, class, homosexuality, and body acceptance. It’s got a shiny, liberal façade, but at the core of the show is an unhealthy obsession with blah basic bitches. Here’s hoping there’s no season two for the Netflix show. (And no, we truly do not care about what becomes of those final four words.)",

This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new “download” button. \nNot everything is already available to download — you won’t find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos, The Crown or the new season of the Girlmore Girls through the offering. \nBut the company said the offering does include many member “favorites.” \nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment.

      "text": "deepa \nSwifties, pause your Netflix, because Taylor Swift has something new for you to binge-watch. This week, she launched a channel — it's officially called a \"specially curated video catalog,\" but close enough — on AT&T's DirecTV streaming service. It'll be home to unseen Tay performances and behind-the-scenes moments. \nJudging from fans' excited tweets , Taylor Swift NOW is already available on TVs, tablets, phones, and computers subscribed to AT&T. So far, it's aired an acoustic set of \"How You Get The Girl\" and a clip of the 1989 singer stopping a fan on the sidewalk after seeing her concert tee. Here's a sneak peak via the channel's intro vid, featuring Tay herself: \nNow, does this mean Taylor Swift NOW and chill could become a thing? God help us all.",

      "text": "Share \nIn a Christmas-came-early move, Netflix stunned yesterday with the announcement that offline viewing is now available. \nAt no extra cost to Netflix subscribers, you can now download to save content to watch later when you don’t have an internet connection . \nFrequent travelers can instantly see the value. Those on long flights with sub-par or no video options can use their iPad or Android device (in airplane mode, of course) to watch their favorite movies and TV shows. \nThe new option will undoubtedly be an instant hit as well with those on international flights, when you’ve already watched everything even remotely interesting and still have 6+ hours remaining on the flight . \nThe news comes at just the perfect time as families shove kids in the back of the car for the holiday road trip to visit Great Uncle Bruce, take flights to visit far-flung relatives, and squeeze in a couple more business trips. \nPlus, if you’re someone that likes to binge watch a whole Netflix original series (ie. The Crown, and the instant hit Stranger Things) you can download the episodes and keep watching. \nAlthough Netflix is not the first streaming service to offer the option to save content to view offline, it is one of the most attractively priced with options starting below $10 a month. \nAre you a Netflix subscriber yet?

      "text": "9 Netflix movies you should definitely download 9 Netflix movies you should definitely download Huzzah! Netflix now lets you download movies for offline viewing! Here are nine great ones to take on your next flight, road trip or whatever. Up Next You can't hide from government hacking \nBest. News. Ever! As of yesterday, Netflix 's mobile apps will let you download content for offline viewing. That's awesome for anyone who wants to stock up on videos for planes, trains, treadmills and other Wi-Fi-challenged destinations. \nFirst things first: Make room for all those downloads. Find out how to free up extra space on your Android phone or tablet . iOS users, check out these 5 tricks to free up space -- and this weird trick that might net you extra gigabytes. \nWith that out of the way, let's turn our attention to movies. (Prefer TV? Here are my 9 Netflix TV shows you should definitely download .) Sadly, Netflix currently offers scant few films for download (the TV selection is much better), so the pickings are pretty slim. But there's at least some good stuff in the mix; check out my picks for your mobile-viewing pleasure: 'Boyhood' \nA slow, methodical and utterly riveting look at family life, as seen through the eyes of a boy who's seven years old at the start -- and 18 at the end! Director Richard Linklater shot the movie over the course of 12 years, following not only the titular actor but also co-stars Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette. It's trippy enough to watch them age so much in the span of two hours, but what could have been mere novelty is buoyed by smart storytelling. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' Enlarge Image \nSpeaking of trippy, if you've ever been through a painful breakup (and who hasn't?), you'll appreciate the core conceit of this Oscar-winning Charlie Kaufman screenplay: What if you could erase all the memories of the one you loved? Jim Carrey ventures down that rabbit hole, with expert help from Kate Winslet, who received an Oscar nomination. Though sometimes funny, this is hardly your typical romantic comedy. It's atypical in all the best ways. 'Hot Fuzz' \nPut Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together in just about anything -- \"Shawn of the Dead,\" the British series \"Spaced\" -- and it's guaranteed to be gold. \"Hot Fuzz\" starts out as something akin to a buddy-cop movie, but, well, let's just say it doesn't end up that way. I won't spoil it, except to say it's often brilliantly funny and definitely worth your time. 'Kung Fu Panda 3' Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET \nThe vast majority of Netflix movies are older, often lesser-known releases, so it's always pleasant to find something as recent and high-profile as \"Kung Fu Panda 3.\" The plot matters not; the kids will love it. Heck, even some older \"kids\" might like it as well. 'Love Actually' \nAw, Hugh Grant. And Keira Knightly. And, look, there's Martin Freeman. And Andrew Lincoln pre-zombies! Is it any wonder this 2003 rom-com has evolved into a cult classic? But guess what: It's not a family film, which I discovered to my horror while re-watching it with my mother-in-law present. Because I'd forgotten Freeman's plotline, which is seriously R-rated. So do not watch this with your parents or your kids, unless you're not easily embarrassed. Which I am. 'Pulp Fiction' \nSay what you will about Quentin Tarantino: The man can tell a story. Or, in this case, multiple stories, most of which seem completely unrelated until they start to weave together. \"Pulp Fiction\" is funny, bizarre, shockingly violent at times (it's Tarantino, after all) and thoroughly riveting. For better or worse, this is the movie that resurrected John Travolta's career. \"Royale with cheese!\" 'Shakespeare in Love' \nOscars all around! Who's to say the Bard wasn't a struggling poet plagued by writer's block? And who's to say he wasn't ultimately inspired by someone as captivating as Gwyneth Paltrow? As muses go, I think she was a much better choice than Julia Roberts, who was originally cast to play Viola. The film itself, clever and comedic, echoes \"Romeo and Juliet\" as it imagines Shakespeare's creation of it. 'Spotlight' \nAnother fairly new release, \"Spotlight\" won the 2015 Academy Award for Best Picture -- despite a story that sounds, frankly, dull as a dirt. A newspaper investigation into the Catholic Church? About something as lurid and appalling as child sex abuse? Doesn't sound like my idea of entertainment. But the story is so well told, without sensationalizing the material or lionizing the investigators, I found myself thoroughly captivated (and, yes, appalled). 'The Imitation Game' \nWhile we're on the awards circuit, \"The Imitation Game\" earned a 2014 Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, with nominations for Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, director Morten Tyldum and the movie itself. The story of British cryptographer Alan Turing , who helped the government decrypt key German intelligence codes during World War II, is made all the more compelling (and tragic) by his eventual vilification. Because, at the time, the British government treated homosexuality as a crime. \nOK, those are my picks. Now let's hear yours! What downloadable movies will you be grabbing from Netflix?

      "text": "MORE Netflix users finally get to hear the two words they have been waiting for: offline mode.\nThe streaming media company confirmed in a tweet that subscribers will get to download their favorite programs onto a smartphone or tablet instead of just stream through a broadband connection.\n\"Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time,\" reads a tweet, which includes a promotional video touting the feature.\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode.

Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8\n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 The feature is available now through an update on iOS and Android. Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation says the download feature is available on all plans.\nOn the iOS app, users can visit the menu and discover a section of content \"available for download.\" The selection includes a mix of original programs such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black , as well as older movies and TV shows from networks such as Parks and Recreation . More shows and movies will support downloads in the future, says Wu.\nAmazon offers an offline viewing option through its Instant Video service, but it's only available for a select group of movies or TV shows hosted by the service. Streaming services from Epix and Starz also support offline viewing.\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 .",

Some notable titles are leaving while some flashy titles are showing up. \nOne in particular that will get Marvel fans excited is \"Captain America: Civil War.\" The highest grossing film of 2016, so far, will land on your streaming devices starting Chritmas Day. Nothing like watching Iron Man and Captain America duking it out to celebrate Christmas. \nOther titles worth mentioning that are making their way to Netflix in December include \"The Angry Birds Movie,\" \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" and \"The Legend of Bagger Vance.\" \nSome titles heading out include \"Top Gun,\" \"The Da Vinci Code,\" and \"The Boxtrolls.\" \nHere's the full list of everything coming to and going from Netflix this December: Add:",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nIf Netflix’s Fuller House reboot has proven anything, it’s how much people still love Full House . (Behold the magic of many years of broadcast syndication.) However, if you needed further proof that Tanner nostalgia is a real thing, look no further than the fact that Full House creator Jeff Franklin just bought the San Francisco house that acts as the Tanner home for $4.15 million from a previous owner frustrated with the constant stream of Full House tourists. Charlie and I went to San Fran to go house hunting. This one looks familiar. Think I should buy?! #fullhousehouse pic.twitter.com/FSi9M0QdlV \n— jeff franklin (@fullhouseguy) May 31, 2016 \n“There are probably 250 fans per day that show up and take a picture in front of it,” Franklin told The Hollywood Reporter . “It will be a lot more fun for the fans because now the house will look like the Tanners really live there. It’s a gift to the fans but it’s also fun for me to own it.” Image via ABC \nThe house in question, which is located at 1709 Broderick Street in San Francisco’s Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood, didn’t have much to do with the original Full House production, despite being one of the most recognizable parts of the series. The show used many of the same stock shots of the exterior of the house for the eight seasons. \nFranklin added: “No one has allowed us to shoot in that house since we did our very first stock shoot back in April of ’87. Our audience has watched the same cars drive by that house now for 29 years. It’s going to be really nice to see some new cars drive by the house.” \nFranklin is already at work restored (or is it de-storing?) the house to its former Full House glory. He had changed the door from seafoam green back to its Tanner red. The Fuller House producer plans also plans to redo the modern interiors to make it more sitcom-y, as if the Tanners actually live there. We await the inevitable Pinterest design board. \nFrankly, even if Franklin didn’t want the house for himself or to rent out (which he says is his ultimate plan), this is a great buy. Not only can Netflix use it for any future seasons of Fuller House that may come to be, but it is also kind of a genius marketing move for the second season of Fuller House that’s set to drop on Netflix in a few weeks on Dec. 9 th . \nIf none of that pans out, the house could definitely be turned into some kind of Full House Museum a la the A Christmas Story House that I am moderately convinced is one of Cleveland’s main tourist attractions. Full House fever is real, folks. When you’re lost out there and you’re all alone, a light is waiting to carry you home. Related Content",

      "text": "Tweet \nNetflix has FINALLY added functionality that enables you to download some of your favorite shows to your mobile device to enjoy when you are offline. This functionality has been rumored for months now but finally came to fruition yesterday. \nThere’s a lot to take in as the new feature comings with a massive asterisk attached to it. Given the number of questions we’ve seen online; let’s run through some of the big questions surrounding Offline Viewing on Netflix. Technical Questions What devices is the download functionality available on? \nFor the moment, it seems that the download functionality is currently limited to mobile devices, specifically Android and iOS devices. The official support page says that you need iOS 8.0 or later and Android 4.4.2 or later to be able to download the titles. How big are the file sizes? \nThey obviously vary from show to show and movie to movie. We’ve downloaded quite a few shows now and here are the file sizes you can expect. TV Episode (Hour long) 200MB TV Episode (Half hour long) 120MB Movie (1 hour 45 minutes) 380MB Movie (2 hours) 500MB Can you download entire seasons from Netflix? \nNo. You have to download individual episodes, at least for the moment. Is this available on desktop and other streaming devices? \nAt the moment, no. We don’t expect Netflix to ever add offline capability to desktop devices just because of the piracy issue and as for streaming devices, most don’t actually operate without an internet connection. It’s likely that other portable devices such as the Amazon Fire Tablet and other mobile OS’s will get it but no plans are in place as of yet. My application doesn’t have the download functionality \nYou may need to update your application. Go to either the App Store or Google Play and update your Netflix application. How long can you have shows/movies offline before you have to go back online? \nAfter 30 days the device that you use get’s disconnected so you have to sign back in to reactivate it. How many devices can you use offline viewing on? \nYou can use up to 4 devices at a time for download before it won’t allow new devices to download shows and movies. Content Questions Are all Netflix Originals available to download? \nWith a few exceptions, nearly all of the Netflix Original catalogue is available to download onto your device. One of the exceptions is Arrested Development and Lovesick where Netflix got the rights to stream the show later down the line. What other shows are available to download? \nA lot. Although there are no definitive lists on fansites just yet, you will find every title that’s available to download in a special new category. Highlights include Breaking Bad and House. We’re not sure what the conditions are for third party titles to be available but we guess that Netflix has to shell over additional money. What movies are available for offline viewing? \nAll the Netflix Original movies are available to download plus a tonne of third party and again, we can’t list each one so you’ll need to browse yourself. \nGot anymore questions? Put them in the comment box below and we’ll do our best to answer them. Also on What's on Netflix Subscribe to our newsletter",

      "text": "Masi Oka To Star In Netflix's Death Note Megan Peters Tweet This \nIf you’re a fan of Death Note , then you have surely heard about Netflix’s upcoming adaptation of the series. The popular streaming site will debut Adam Wingard’s version of Death Note next year, and fans have been eagerly waiting for updates on the series. The film, which is already in production , will see Nat Wolff star as Light Turner (Yagami) while Keith Stanfield plays L. The Western cast of Death Note has made some fans uncomfortable, especially in light of recent whitewashing controversies surrounding projects like Ghost in the Shell . \nHowever, there will be at least one Japanese actor in the film. Producer Masi Oka ( Heroes ) has confirmed he also has an on-screen role for Death Note , and fans are happy to hear so. \nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Oka talked about his work on Death Note . “I’m very fortunate to be able to do things also behind-the-scenes, creating some TV shows and also producing a lot of movies,” he said. “I recently finished producing Death Note for Netflix, which I have a part in as well.” \nSo far, there’s no word on who Oka will be playing. Most fans are inclined to believe that the actor will play Touta Matsuda. The character is a younger member of the Japanese Task Force, and fans know him for his awkward social skills. Matsuda works hard to overcome his rookie status and have his colleagues respect him, but things become difficult when he’s asked to help find the killer Akira. \nWith Oka joining the on-screen cast, the actor will be joined by plenty of other all-star talent. Aside from Wolff and Stanfield, Margaret Qualley will play Mia Sutton, Paul Nakauchi will play Watari, and Shea Whigham will play James Turner. Willem Dafoe has also been cast in Death Note as Ryuk, the iconic Shinigami from the anime. \nWhen Death Note debuts next year, fans should expect to see a dark, gritty take on the series. The series, which is already known for its dark themes, will get a R-rated iteration under Wingard’s guidance. The director spoke to Collider about his mature vision for Death Note , and he said the project could do whatever it wanted. \n“We can do whatever we want,” he started. “So, doing my first live-action anime thing, to me it was important that you have those adult themes. So, it’s got nudity, it’s got swearing, it’s got a ton of violence.” \nAdam talked about his own past with anime and said that the genre’s unflinching association with adult-oriented content inspired him. \n“The thing about anime is that it’s so adult-oriented,” he explained. “I remember going to Suncoast growing up and you see Akira there with the little 'Not for Kids' sticker on it. That always made an impact on me.” \nDeath Note began filming in June and is slated to release in 2017.",

      "text": "Devon Terrell plays a young Barack Obama in the upcoming Netflix original Barry. Netflix The end of the year is typically a harried time, what with all the social and financial obligations surrounding the holiday season — which means it’s also a perfect time to ignore all those obligations, stay in, and watch something great (and preferably not holiday-related) instead. December’s streaming additions offer plenty of options for doing just that, with a nice blend of new original content, some acclaimed movies from early 2016 you may have missed, and a few older classics that are the definition of cinematic comfort food. So when you need a break from the holiday hullabaloo, try cueing up one of the following movies or TV shows, all of which are perfect for helping you forget all the things you’re supposed to finish before the end of the year. New in December on Netflix White Girl (available December 1) Elizabeth Wood’s feature directorial debut received warm notices out of Sundance earlier in the year, particularly for its star, Morgan Saylor. (You might know her better as Dana Brody from Homeland — and that might not necessarily be a plus for this movie in your book.) It’s your classic “good girl meets bad boy, then leaves behind everything she previously was to keep him” narrative. But where lots of versions of that story demonize the characters for their bad choices, Wood has real empathy for her lead character’s screw-ups. Beverly Hills Cop (available December 1) Eddie Murphy’s groundbreaking turn as Axel Foley was one of the most successful comedies of all time, both financially and critically. But in 1984, a black cop from Detroit upending the expectations and norms of an all-white police squad wasn’t just excellent film fare — it was revelatory satire. Murphy oozes charm, confidence, a mastery of physical comedy and improvisation (including a whole ad-libbed monologue ), and a complete awareness of how unsettling his presence is to the upper-crust white society he’s invaded. Watching him gradually seduce one officer after another (especially a perpetually delighted Judge Reinhold ) into helping him take on a high-profile drug smuggler will restore your faith in comedy’s ability to serve as the most searing of all social commentaries. Fuller House , season two (available December 9) It’s entirely possible you’ve tried to forget Fuller House exists. We wouldn’t blame you. But there’s somewhat compelling evidence that when season one debuted back in February, it actually lowered traditional TV ratings . So of course Netflix was going to make more, and season two appears to feature the Fuller House gang celebrating every single holiday they can think of, to keep with the month’s festive mood. Also, Stephanie kisses Kimmy’s little brother, which can only end well. Barry (available December 16) One of the less expected trends of the 2016 movie year has been “films about young Barack Obama,” thanks to Southside With You (which follows Barack and Michelle Obama’s first date) and this, which follows his days at Columbia University in New York. Here, Devon Terrell plays the future 44th president as a young man who’s unsure of where he fits in — and worries the answer to that is “nowhere.” It’s a more subdued, internal film than you might expect, but it could be a good way to commemorate the last month of Obama’s presidency. Captain America: Civil War (available December 25) Given that the third Captain America entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of 2016’s highest-grossing films, chances are good that those interested in the Russo brothers’ second Cap sequel have already seen it. But it’s well worth revisiting, and not just because it sets up about 15 MCU movies to come. Civil War engages with some heady ideas regarding government oversight and wartime collateral damage, all wrapped up in the trappings of a sticky revenge thriller. Plus, the big airport showdown between feuding Avengers factions is one of the most purely grin-inducing superhero set pieces ever, one of the few compelling arguments for the ever-expanding bloat of the MCU. New in December on Hulu Pulp Fiction (available December 1) Quentin Tarantino’s 1994 neo-noir dark comedy classic bent a lot of moviegoers’ minds with its nonlinear storytelling about hit men, a gangster’s wife, bandits, and a boxer. The film won the prestigious Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and garnered an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and it manages to be both a cult favorite and one of the most important films of all time. The Legend of Drunken Master (available December 1) In 1978’s Drunken Master made a name for a then-unknown 24-year-old Jackie Chan thanks to its brilliant fight sequences and Chan’s ability to combine incredible martial arts with physical comedy. Years later, as an international star, Chan returned to tackle the story of 19th-century martial arts artist Wong Fei-hung with The Legend of Drunken Master , a reboot of the first film that repeats Wong’s journey from alcoholic wastrel son to a master of Zui Quan , or drunken fighting, but with a rollicking heist trajectory thrown in. As with the first film, what makes The Legend of Drunken Master stand out are the extended, intense fighting sequences — but with Chan at his peak and with a major studio budget at his disposal, these fight scenes are arguably even more entertaining. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (available December 1) If you’re ever in need of a warm and heartfelt distraction, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is a solid option. The adaptation of Ann Brashares’s hit novel follows its source’s splintering into four different teen girl perspectives as they spend a summer apart, connected only by the single pair of jeans that somehow fits them all. Also, the four women are played by America Ferrera, Blake Lively, Amber Tamblyn, and Alexis Bledel circa 2005, which can make for some excellent “aw, remember when?” moments. This I s Spinal Tap (available December 1) You can trace the rise of comedy’s “mockumentary” style right back to This I s Spinal Tap ’sruthlessly funny satire of outlandish rock star exploits and the people who indulge them. As written by and starring Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and Rob Reiner (who also directed), This I s Spinal Tap is packed with so many jokes that it’ll take at least a couple of viewings to catch them all. Might as well reserve an evening to settle in and crank this movie up to 11. Stories We Tell (available December 3) Director and actress Sarah Polley started out making a documentary about her parents, and especially about the life and loves of her mother. But in the course of making the film, she discovered something about herself that upended everything she thought she knew to be true. This deeply moving picture is a formally inventive, thoughtful documentary — and one that it’s best you know as little about as possible before watching. New in December on Amazon Prime Lars and the Real Girl (available December 1) For a whimsy-packed story about a reclusive loner and the sex doll he insists is his real live girlfriend, Lars and the Real Girl is a remarkably sincere movie. Much of the credit for that goes to Ryan Gosling’s performance as the titular Lars, but it’s also due to the script’s approach of treating Lars’s delusion with empathy and relative nuance. The people around Lars worry about the emotional connection he’s formed with “Bianca,” but they also indulge his fantasy because they believe it will help him in the long run. That Lars mostly sidesteps all the potential problems its wacky premise implies is a tiny miracle. The Lobster (available December 2) Set in a dystopian near future, The Lobster is a (very) dark comedy about how we expect people to form relationships — and their status when they don’t. Colin Farrell plays David, who is sent to the hotel to which all single people must go and find a mate within 45 days. If they don’t, they are transformed into beasts and sent into the wild for good. It’s stark, biting, and brutally funny. Mozart in the Jungle , season three (available December 9) Mozart in the Jungle won a Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy TV Series last year, along with one for Gael García Bernal as its lead. But don’t take it too seriously. In its first two seasons, Mozart in the Jungle was a perfect antidote for the era of Too Much TV, a lighthearted comedy about professional musicians and trying to make it in the big city. With Bernal and Lola Kirke leading the cast, it’s pure delight. Anomalisa (available December 17) Charlie Kaufman’s puppet-based dramedy is fairly light on the second part of that portmanteau; it’s an incredibly sad film at heart, and most of the laughs to be had are of the nervous and/or ironic variety. But nonetheless, it’s a movie experience like few others. The film’s stop-motion puppet animation is purposefully unsettling — especially during a weird and lovely sex scene — and thankfully humanized with soulful voice performances from David Thewlis (as a depressed sales rep at a bland convention) and especially Jennifer Jason Leigh (as an insecure young woman who catches his eye). Café Society (Available December 22) Woody Allen’s latest movie throws an all-star cast — from Kristen Stewart to Blake Lively to Steve Carell — into 1930s Hollywood, where screwball romances and foiled Oscar campaigns reign supreme. Jesse Eisenberg plays Allen’s requisite neurotic creative, who falls in love with Stewart’s character while accidentally-on-purpose romancing Lively’s. (All things considered, he could have it a whole lot worse.) Caf é Society didn’t make a huge splash when it debuted, but hey, it sure is pretty! New in December on HBO Now Singles (available December 1) The 1990s revival is still going strong, so join in on the cultural regression with a viewing of what might be the most ’90s movie ever: Singles, Cameron Crowe’s paean to the Seattle grunge scene and the Gen-Xers who inhabited it . Centering on the romantic entanglements of two central couples and their various associates, Singles is ostensibly a rom-com — and Crowe’s effervescent dialogue matches that tone well — but it’s more notable as a relatively authentic time capsule of a specific cultural milieu that’s since been appropriated and diluted by modern trends. They Live (available December 1) Director John Carpenter’s action-satire of 1980s yuppie America has become exemplary of anyone who can’t quite believe the out-of-whack priorities of all the idiots they’re forced to live near. In it, a man finds sunglasses that allow him to see that aliens have taken over the planet by disguising themselves as the rich and powerful — and he launches a one-man war to take it back. It’s also the movie that contains the famous line “I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I’m all out of bubblegum.” Keanu (available December 3) Keanu is a pretty stupid comedy, but one with great performers: Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele ( Key & Peele ) take their act to the big screen, playing buddies who pretend to be drug dealers in order to get back a kitten (named Keanu). In keeping with the pair’s usual themes, Keanu turns absurd situations into a way of exploring the nuances of code switching and how we expect people to “perform” race in America. (The kitten turns in a good performance too.) Midnight Special (available December 17) The first 2016 film from director Jeff Nichols (who also directed the new Loving ) is soulful science fiction at its best; those who’ve recently seen and dug Arrival should definitely check out Midnight Special , which has a similar tone, but with a more spiritual thematic bent, as well as a deep, complicated central story about parents and children. Blending elements of the heist film, the road movie, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Nichols’s film is a slow burn that metes out its set pieces frugally, but great performances from Michael Shannon, Kirsten Dunst, Adam Driver, and Joel Edgerton keep the flame bright throughout. Hail, Caesar! (available December 24) The Coen brothers’ homage to old Hollywood features Josh Brolin as a high-powered fixer experiencing both a crisis of faith and a crisis of vocation during a few particularly screwy days. There’s also synchronized swimming siren Scarlett Johansson, tap-dancing Channing Tatum, philandering centurion George Clooney, gossip columnist Tilda Swinton, and a shadowy cabal of communists. It’s pure confection with an ethical core. Was this article helpful?",

In the meantime, many of Netflix's original series, including Orange Is the New Black , Narcos and The Crown , are available to download right now. \nThe 25 best Netflix originals, ranked \nSubscribers can access the download feature on their Apple and Android devices through the Netflix app, which now includes a \"download\" button on the Details page. The download feature is included in all Netflix plans, although users will need iOs 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later to access it, along with the most recent version of the Netflix app.",

This means it’s time to start scouring the internet for access to every single bell-ringing, snow-falling, heart-warming movie out there. To that end, we’ve compiled some of the best for you, from die-hard classics to modern day holiday rom-coms — as well as where to find them! Netflix 1. 12 Dates of Christmas (Credit: ABC Family via Reviewed.com) \nYou may not have heard of it, but this is probably one of the best Netflix Christmas movies. It’s got 4 stars and is actually funny. (Credit: Walt Disney Home Studios Entertainment via Reviewed.com) \nIf you’re into puppies and Santa Clause, this will definitely be the right movie for you. 3. The Ref (Credit: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures via Reviewed.com) \nFor those of you who don’t want a sappy holiday film, this under-appreciated 90s movie has got its fair share of dark comedy. 4. White Christmas (Credit: Paramount Pictures via Reviewed.com) \nThis 1950s, feel-good romance comedy has got all the makings of a perfect holiday film: it’s funny, sweet, and oh-so-vintage. 5. Ernest Saves Christmas (Credit: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures via Reviewed.com) \nThis 80s film is the perfect mix of screwball and sweet. It’s also a great film to keep the kids entertained. (Credit: Universal Pictures via Reviewed.com) \nThis is probably everyone’s favorite—slightly depressing but still adorably lovely—Christmas film. 7. Scrooged (Credit: Paramount Pictures via Reviewed.com) \nBest. Movie. Ever. Bill Murray as a grumpy TV exec haunted by the spirits of Christmas? Yes, please. HBO Go 8. The Muppet Christmas Carol (Credit: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures via Reviewed.com) \nWhat could be better than drinking egg-nog, stuffing your face, and watching the Muppets do A Christmas Carol ? Basically nothing. (Credit: 20th Century Fox via Reviewed.com) \nIf you don’t watch Home Alone at least once every three years, you have no soul. 10. Bad Santa (Credit: Dimension Films via Reviewed.com) \nBad Santa is definitely not for kids, but those willing to put up with it’s pitch-black humor will find a surprisingly soft-center to this caustic Christmas classic. Amazon Instant 11. Gremlins (Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures via Reviewed.com) \nIf you’re into creepy, dark, scary stuff, watch Gremlins . It’s got that holiday vibe, but it’s not all cute and sparkly. 12. Miracle on 34th Street (Credit: 20th Century Fox via Reviewed.com) \nMiracle on 34th Street is probably one of the most popular Christmas films of all time.

A Christmas Story (Credit: MGM/UA Entertainment Co. via Reviewed.com) \nThis cult classic has become the de facto holiday film for many.

Elf (Credit: New Line Cinema via Reviewed.com) \nIf you like Will Ferrel, this is your film. It’s about a baby raised by an elf. Need we say more? (Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures via Reviewed.com) \nGet your hot cocoa and a cozy blanket and enjoy this magical, tear-jerking Christmas classic. Hulu 18.

      "text": "  If it ain't broke, don't fix it. A crime drama worked for Regina King for \"American Crime\" (just look at her Emmy win), so it's no wonder she is sticking with the genre, at least for now. The actress is set to star in the upcoming Netflix series \"Seven Seconds,\" reports Variety. The show will center on the aftermath of an injury-inducing incident involving a police officer and an African-American teenage boy in Jersey City. Tension will escalate in the community, but the incident will hit particularly close to home for King's character. As Latrice Butler, she'll be the mother of the injured teen, Brenton. What she learns about her son in the aftermath will shock her, not to mention affect her life and her marriage. King's co-stars include David Lyons, Michael Mosley, and Patrick Murney, and they'll be directed by Veena Sud. The \"Seven Seconds\" premiere date has not yet been announced, but 10 episodes are on the way.",

      "text": "Thursday, December 1, 2016 \"How to Survive a Plague\" movie poster. Fair use \nToday is World AIDS Day , where we remember those lost, celebrate the advancements that have been made since the early days of the epidemic and look forward to even more progress in the future. \nThree documentaries currently available on Netflix streaming explore the history of HIV/AIDS in America, with “How to Survive a Plague” and “We Were Here,” as well as one, “It’s Not Over,” which focuses on the current state of the crisis. \n“How to Survive a Plague” \nThis 2012 documentary directed by David France , a journalist who covered the AIDS from the early days of the crisis, gives an incredible overview of the fight to turn the tide on an epidemic that was wiping out a generation of LGBTQ individuals while the government was slow to react. France dedicated the film to his partner Doug Gould, who died of AIDS related complications in 1992. \nHow to Survive a Plague won awards for best documentary of 2012 from the Gotham Independent Film Awards and from the Boston Society of Film Critics, as well as a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary and a Peabody Award. \nWatch it here . \n“We Were Here” \nFilmmaker David Weissman’s 2011 film We Were Here tells the story of the HIV/AIDS crisis specifically in San Francisco . It centers around interviews with five people who were key figures during the early days of the outbreak of infections: Ed Wolf, a counselor; Paul Boneberg, an activist; Daniel Goldstein, an HIV+ artist who lost two partners to AIDS; Guy Clark, a dancer who ran a florist shop in Castro that supplied flowers for many funerals of those lost to complications from AIDS; and Eileen Glutzer, a nurse who helped administer trials of antiretroviral drugs. \nIt won LGBT-Themed Documentary of the Year and Documentary of the Year at the Dorian Awards and won the Best Documentary Feature, Jury Award at the Mumbai Queer Film Festival. \nWatch it here . \n“It’s Not Over” \nMany had hoped that by now we would have reached the point of an AIDS free generation. That is sadly not the case, and in 2014 Andrew Jenks released the important documentary It’s Not Over , which explores the lives of three millennials who are living with, or whose lives have been directly affected by, HIV/AIDS. Viewers are taken to India , South Africa and America, offering a view of the situation in key spots across the globe.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan ​Netflix to hand infrastructure heavy lifting to AWS The streaming giant has set a goal to hand AWS all of the infrastructure work that is not Netflix-specific. | Topic: Cloud \nNetflix chief product officer Neil Hunt has revealed that the streaming platform will be handing over all of the company's infrastructure work to Amazon Web Services (AWS), especially where it is not Netflix-specific. \nIn taking the infrastructure heavy lifting off the hands of Netflix's staff, Hunt said the company's development teams can focus instead on adding the features that are unique for Netflix to deliver the \"most compelling service\" to its customers. \nSpeaking at the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on Thursday, Hunt explained that the company's migration was a fairly long process, having begun the journey in 2008. \n\"[At the time], the message to let AWS do the heavy lifting in managing the infrastructure resonated loudly and clearly with us,\" he said. \nGlobally, Hunt said Netflix has 86 million customers across 190 countries, which sees the service delivering approximately 150 million hours of streaming video every day. The platform is available in three regions and 12 zones, with about 100,000 instances running at peak times. \nNetflix completed its migration earlier this year. Now a month out of its last datacentre, Hunt confirmed the streaming giant is 100 percent operating out of AWS. \n\"We don't have a datacentre anymore and that's great,\" he said. \"We've achieved improved productivity, scalability, we've got a much more nimble architecture, but more importantly AWS pushes state of the art new features and every year we get to take advantage of them.\" \n\"We've restructured our systems; there's about 500 microservices by decoupling the modules so that each team can push independently for continuous deployment that gives us the ability to iterate faster.\" \nHunt said that over the past year, Netflix has seen the opportunity to embrace containers to further optimise its microservices architecture. \n\"So this year we've turned our attention to working with AWS on the features we need to be able to hand off more of that container execution environment,\" he said. \nThe goal now for Hunt and his teams is to then bridge the gap between the desktop and production environments, which he said will give Netflix a \"finite granularity of isolation\" touted as critical for running lightweight prototypes. \n\"To adopt containers into what will be a hybrid environment we built Titus, which is a container run-time environment for both batch and service-based applications. And we also built Fenzo, which is an open-source pluggable library,\" he explained. \n\"We really don't want or need to operate all of this infrastructure; we firmly believe that it's best to let AWS do the heavy lifting of managing the infrastructure. \n\"And that's where Blox comes in, as it's aimed exactly at the space we're heading to. We're excited to engage with the Blox open source effort that integrates those types of features into Blox and ACS. We get the features that we need to do that hand off.\" \nAccording to Amazon CTO Werner Vogels, containers are driving changes in the way that systems are being built on AWS infrastructure. Although utilising containers sees an organisation let go of functions from within, Vogels said during his keynote on Thursday that letting go does not come at the cost of security, as AWS takes care of that. \n\"Netflix are going through a number of changes in the way that they are building systems,\" he said. \"There's really no more advanced customer on our platform than Netflix.\" AWS re:Invent 2016",

      "text": "By G. Clay Whittaker Credit: Netflix \nAs of today, an update for mobile apps for tablet and smartphone allows you to download content to watch offline, so you can take new episodes of your favorite show with you on your commute, on a plane, or anywhere the internet doesn’t go. Once you’ve downloaded the update, the info screen of many streamable shows will show a button for downloading. Just click it and wait. When we tried downloading an episode of Kimmy Schmidt , it was 115 MB and took our speedy-enough home network 24 minutes to download. The Imitation Game was 544 MB and took 1 hr 53 minutes. ALSO: The 13 Best Adventure Movies Now Streaming on Netflix \nFurthermore, not all of Netflix’s content is yet available. Predictably Netflix is starting with their own content, like Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black , but they promise they'll be adding more including products not produced by Netflix. \nIt’s worth mentioning that Amazon has had this option on its app for over a year, but those downloads operate a little more like movie rentals, as they expire 30 days after download, or 48 hours after you’ve begun watching. Not a huge problem, but kind of a hassle. MORE: Cable Cutting Done Right \nThere are still limits to Netflix’s tool: You’ll only be able to carry as many episodes as your memory allows and only one movie or series at a time. Also, the service is limited to app users, so laptop customers won’t have this option from their web browser. \nBut being able to take an entire season of a show with you to binge on a plane is still a huge improvement in quality of streaming life. And we imagine it could be a huge boon for people with slow speeds, and for those who have trouble with buffering.  ",

      "text": "Courtesy Netflix Stay on target The First 'White Rabbit Project' Trailer Drops You Can Finally Watch (Some) Netflix Videos Offline Archer has been renewed through season 10 , but unfortunately, that’ll be its last. If you’re not getting enough adult-oriented, action-packed, subversive satire of James Bond-esque films, you can always give Pacific Heat a shot.\nThe new series comes from Working Dog Productions , a group of Aussie comedy producers probably best known for Frontline , which was The Daily Show before The Daily Show was a thing. Most of the voices in the cast come from this group. The show was originally picked up for a run on the Comedy Channel in their home country before getting picked up by Netflix. The 13-episode season premiered on Nov. 27.\nThe show takes place on the Gold Coast of Australia, which is filled with crime. Pacific Heat is a group of operatives tasked with keeping the criminals at bay. They’re covert and highly-trained, but “they do have their own Facebook page.” Rob Sitch, an actor who voices the character Todd Sommerville, describes it as a combination of The A-Team , Hawaii Five-0 , and Charlie’s Angels .\nThe comparisons with Archer aren’t unwarranted since they’re pretty obvious. The animation has the same bright, stilted characters, who don’t seem to move unless they’re talking, blinking, or shooting something. Archer makes up for this by playing around with the low-budget appearance of its aesthetics with bombastic fight sequences and noir-esque backgrounds. From the Pacific Heat trailer, there looks to be plenty of action sequences that the animators can play around in. However, the people look off in a way I can’t describe. It might be the small eyes, the superfluous shadow on the faces, and the bodies that seem to be slightly disproportionate.\nEither way, the humor is similar, although dumbed down. In two clips shared with Geek, Pacific Heat shows off one of its characters, whose primary character trait seems to be that he’s an idiot who doesn’t know what year it is, and the dynamic amongst the group. Characters seem to talk over each other, misunderstand each other often, and talk to some off-screen presence instead of to each other. Plus there’s some old-fashioned racism.\nI’m an American with little exposure to Aussie comedy, so I’m not sure if there’s something I’m missing. Pacific Heat and the kind of awkward, obvious humor that can stem from over-the-top situations surely has an audience. It’s loud, bright, and uncomplicated. Much of the comedy comes from misinterpretation between the characters and how people as incompetent as them can be tasked with saving us. There has to be more I’m not seeing, right?\nThe series will debut on Netflix on Dec. 3.",

      "text": "The Queen. Alex Bailey / Netflix ID: 10092635 In the season finale of Netflix’s new series The Crown , Queen Elizabeth (Claire Foy) asks her husband, Prince Philip (Matt Smith), to go to Australia to open the 1956 Olympic Games in her name. He pouts and says no, he won’t go, and Elizabeth pleads with him: “Please, Philip, everyone just wants you to be happy.” Later, when Philip is dancing with the Queen Mother (Victoria Hamilton) at a party, she too urges him to go on the trip. When he protests, again, she murmurs, “You have more freedom than any consort in history, and you repay it by scowling and skulking.”\nIndeed, Philip has spent most of the 10 episodes of this season “scowling and skulking,” as the queen mother puts it. It’s not clear whether we’re meant to sympathize with Philip — whose naval career and relatively carefree life in Malta are cut short when Elizabeth becomes Queen much earlier than anyone expected — or roll our eyes at him. Smith certainly seems to think of him as a sympathetic character; he recently told Refinery29 , “He’s a rock star. He’s a maverick. He’s kind, he’s witty, he’s groovy. He’s the sort of alien of the group who says everything and he does say things that he shouldn’t.” Perhaps more surprisingly, Foy agreed: “I don’t think anyone could think he’s an asshole from the show.”\nWhether you think that or not, it’s hard to watch The Crown without feeling as if the Queen’s marriage is kind of a royal metaphor for every relationship between a successful woman and a man who can’t handle that success. And while some of the tension between the characters could be attributed to the ways in which their relationship challenged the gender norms of the 1950s, it’s also sobering to realize how much has not changed. Today, in 2016, looking back at this relationship — a prominent, visible one — it’s worth asking how much progress we’ve really made in terms of the struggle between powerful women and the men who (don’t?) support them.\nIt’s also hard to watch Philip and Elizabeth’s relationship unfold onscreen in the current political moment. Would our feelings about Philip be different if Hillary Clinton had won the election? In a Daily Beast article that came out prior to the election, Kevin Fallon wrote, “There’s an undeniable thrill in watching the rise of one of the most visible female figures in modern history at a time when, just days after The Crown debuts on Netflix, the United States could be electing its first female president.” Alas.\nIn the opening minutes of the first episode, which takes place in 1947, King George VI (Jared Harris) coughs up blood in a bathroom in Buckingham Palace. In the following scene, Philip renounces his Greek citizenship (he was the grandson of the exiled Greek king) and takes British citizenship so he can marry Elizabeth. Already, it is implied, Philip is making sacrifices for the woman he loves. But it’s hard not to read Philip’s decision to marry Elizabeth somewhat cynically. “Well done,” his uncle, Lord Louis “Dickie” Mountbatten (Greg Wise), says to him quietly after the naturalization ceremony is over, and here we have the sense that Philip is entering into this marriage in no small part to restore his own family’s name. In 1952, King George VI died, and Elizabeth ascended the throne at the age of 25.\nView this image ›\nPrince Philip kneeling before Queen Elizabeth at her coronation. Alex Bailey / Netflix\nID: 10092627 Philip seems immediately threatened by this turn of events. He’s annoyed that they must move from Clarence House, which he’s just redecorated (even though he complained that the task was emasculating), to Buckingham Palace. He’s furious that the family name (and the name his children will take) will be Windsor — Elizabeth’s family name — rather than Mountbatten. ( In real life , Philip pouted, “I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children. I’m nothing but a bloody amoeba.”) And when Elizabeth asks him to chair her coronation committee (because she wants him to have something to feel in charge of), he agrees to do it only on the condition that he has full control, usurping the traditional role of the Duke of Norwood; he then throws a fit when Elizabeth tells him he’ll have to kneel to her at the coronation.\nBut didn’t you know what you were getting yourself into? is the logical question one might have asked of Philip, and yet it seems that the answer is no, not really. Certainly, neither of them expected that Elizabeth would become Queen so soon. If she’d stayed a princess longer, he might have been able to develop more of a public identity himself (not to mention a career), instead of being forced to adhere to a strictly defined consort role. And over the course of the season, we see just how much stress the relationship causes for Elizabeth, who often feels torn between duty to the crown and duty to her husband. It was a highly unusual situation for a woman to be in — her “job” was one of the most important roles in the country, but a woman in a less rarefied position at the time (even a royal position) would have been expected to follow her husband’s wishes.\nView this image ›\nPrince Philip in Kenya. Alex Bailey / Netflix\nID: 10092614 Those historical circumstances don’t make it any less cringe-inducing to watch Elizabeth try to apologize for Philip’s immaturity. When they go on a trip to Kenya, he snidely “compliments” the hat of a chief of the Maasai tribe. “It’s a crown ,” Elizabeth hisses at him. In fact, the real Prince Philip’s public life is full of racist gaffes like this one, and worse. In 1965, he called Ethiopian art “the kind of thing my daughter would bring back from her school art lessons.” During a 1986 trip to China, he told British exchange students that if they stayed in China much longer they’d “all be slitty-eyed.” As recently as 2009, he asked a black dance troupe that had performed at the Royal Variety Performance whether they were “all one family.”\nIt’s hard not to look at Philip’s behavior as a glaring example of the ways in which men and women are treated differently as power spouses. And sadly, not that much has changed. Even in 2016, women are still often asked or expected to choose between success in work or in their relationships, because it’s seemingly impossible for a male mate to play second fiddle to a woman’s professional responsibilities. Divorce rates have been shown to increase when a woman makes more money than her husband; women who earn more than their husbands actually do more housework than women who earn less — as though forced to overcompensate for the “imbalance” they’ve brought to their marriage.\nThe Crown is positioned as comforting, gorgeous escapism; it allows audiences to dream of the beautiful old past. It is not violent, or scary; indeed, the tensions and conflicts — though high-stakes — seem almost boring in a way that also serves as a balm to election-injured souls. And yet here we are, watching yet another man throw tantrums because he can’t quite stomach the idea of his own unimportance. In that way, at least, Prince Philip was ahead of his time.\nID: 10092699",

Photo courtesy of Netflix. By Michelle Mills , San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: # Comments “Medici: Masters of Florence” is coming to Netflix in December. Photo courtesy of Netflix. \nAs we hurtle towards the holidays, many of us can’t help but think about time. We plan for the future and grow nostalgic for the past while worrying about just getting through our to-do list today. The movies and television series set to begin streaming in December reflect this obsession, so take a break and let them take you to another time…if only for a short while. \nExplore the past with “Medici: Masters of Florence” on Netflix. This political family drama set in the early 15th century Florence was filmed on location and boasts lush scenery and stars like Richard Madden, Stuart Martin and Dustin Hoffman. Cosimo de’ Medici (Madden) has his hands full, dealing with his sudden wealth after his father’s death and trying not to let it slip out that dad was really murdered as his seeks the killer. \nIf that’s not complex or timely enough for you, Netflix will also be offering the Canadian series “Travelers.” In this science-fiction piece, a group of surviving humans from the future use their consciousness to inhabit everyday people in the 21st century in a bid to save the world from its disastrous fate. \nAmazon Video will launch the second season of its Emmy Award-winning original series, “The Man in the High Castle.” Based on Philip K. Dick’s 1961 alternate history novel, it presents a view of what could have happened if the Allied Powers had lost World War II. \nKids can get into the time slip with “Lost in Oz” on Amazon Prime. Dorothy Gale finds her mother’s journal and quickly discovered that she — and her dog Toto — aren’t in Kansas anymore. She joins with a young witch and a giant Munchkin on a journey to find her way out of Emerald City and back home. \nIf all this jumping around through time tires you out, settle down with Netflix’s “White Rabbit Project.” Former “Mythbusters” members Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara continue seeking out the reality behind contraptions, weapons, stories and legends, taking on even bigger projects and raising the bar.
