      "text": "Apple's Repatriation And Share Buyback Could Trump All Nov.17.16 Open Square Capital Summary \nIf enacted, President-elect Trump's proposed tax policies could lead to a massive repatriation of offshore cash for Apple. \nCash repatriation and share buyback could reduce outstanding shares by 20%. \nApple shares should trade at +$130 shortly thereafter. As we digested the news of Donald Trump's surprising victory, our focus quickly shifted to the impact his policies could have on our portfolio. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), one of our long-term holdings, will no doubt be affected by President-elect Trump's stance on corporate taxation, immigration and global trade. Let's focus today on corporate taxation, given that his campaign has already provided some high-level details of what it wants to achieve. The other issues we'll leave for another day once additional information is released. While details of the President-elect's tax policies are still being crafted, we do know that they propose to reduce corporate taxes from 35% to 15%. His proposals also call for a 10% deemed repatriation tax. This is fairly close to House Republican proposals, which include decreasing corporate taxes from 35% to 20% and full taxation of all previously deferred income over a period of time at a high-single digit tax rate. The chance for major tax reform next year is high given the Republican controlled Congress. If the President-elect's plan were to be enacted we'll very likely see Apple repatriate a substantial amount of its offshore cash. In fact even before the election, Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, was primed to do so, having stated in an interview on Irish radio . \"We provisioned several billion dollars for the U.S. for payment as soon as we repatriate it, and right now I would forecast that repatriation to occur next year,\" While he did not provide an amount, a reduced 10% repatriation tax would be a significant incentive to repatriate the bulk of Apple's offshore cash. Let's explore the impact this would have on the stock. Apple's Offshore Mattress As of September 30, 2016, Apple has a total of $237.6B in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For simplicity, we'll call cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \"cash\". Over 90% of this cash is held overseas, in an Irish mattress (okay technically a non-resident Irish mattress), and domestic cash totals only $21.6B \nSeptember 30, 2016 \nCash, cash equivalents, marketable securities (both ST/LT) \n$21,585 \n100% Click to enlarge For our exercise, let's assume that Apple's foreign subsidiaries retain $20B of the $216B of cash as a working capital cushion to fund non-US spend. This is largely conjecture, but we're trying to estimate the impact of a repatriation plan, so this could be adjusted up or down. We're using $20B because Apple has $21B of domestic cash, and given sales are split OUS (60%) / US (40%) we're assuming that a roughly equivalent amount of offshore cash should suffice. This would mean Apple could repatriate $196B of the $216B. Applying a 10% repatriation tax would mean reducing the actual cash received to $176.4B \nForeign \nAmount retained in foreign subsidiaries \n$20.0B \n$198.0B Click to enlarge *Note that we haven't reduced the repatriation tax for any foreign tax credits (\"FTC\") that would be brought back to offset the US tax for two reasons. First, the change in corporate tax rates will force the company to true-up its deferred tax assets (\"DTA\"), and the value of the FTC will decline. Second, given that DTAs are valued at $4.1B as of September 30, 2016 and DTAs include FTCs and many other tax assets), the amount of FTCs are likely \"small\" relative to the amount repatriated, and when coupled with the reduction in corporate tax rate, the actual FTC impact may be negligible for purposes of our calculation. What could Apple do with the cash? Flushed with $176.4B of additional US cash, we don't think Apple will increase its dividend or pay out a one-time dividend; the former would unnecessarily constrain future cash management and the latter is tax inefficient. Moreover, we think Apple will refrain from repaying its $79B of debt, particularly given the low rates and long-maturity. Apple's corporate debt is also held by the US entity, Apple Inc., which means the interest expense is shielding US income from taxation. Although a reduction of the US federal corporate rate from 35% to 15% decreases this benefit, there are still state taxes to factor in, and overall the deduction, albeit reduced, is still beneficial. A large-scale M&A transaction is also unlikely given Apple's history of bolt-on acquisitions and because any large-scale acquisition would compress Apple's industry leading margins. Consequently, we think Apple will likely fund a large share buyback. How Much? There really are no restrictions on the use of Apple's cash. The company's recent cash hoarding has simply been the byproduct of a US tax system that creates its own \"reality distortion field\", which incentivizes companies to defer offshore earnings. It's important to note that none of Apple's debt has any financial covenants. Under its most recent prospectus supplement, Apple states \"The indenture for the notes does not . . . require us to maintain any financial ratios or specific levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity and, accordingly, does not protect holders of the notes in the event we experience significant adverse changes in our financial condition;\" (See for example Prospectus Supplement dated April 30, 2013) As such, the company is free to use its cash to benefit shareholders (albeit to the detriment of bondholders). The size of the share buyback will be driven more by financial conservatism than any financial restrictions, and Apple for all its vaunted cash generating prowess has historically been financially conservative. This is due in large part to Steve Job's penchant for accumulating cash after the near-Apple bankruptcy in 1997; a time when Apple needed a bailout from its rival Microsoft to survive. Apple's secrecy also means a large cash balance creates certain competitive advantages. The cash provide financial flexibility, allowing the company to pre-fund R&D for multiple generations of future products, monopolize raw materials for large-scale projects (to delays rivals from manufacturing their own copycat products), fund experiments and acquisitions that may not work, and insure financial stability to buffer itself from the fickle consumer driven market. Thus, we believe if Apple were to bring back $176.4B, it's likely to use only a portion of the cash to fund a share buyback. We think the company could retain $50B in the US and declare a buyback of $125B. Why $125B? This is the company's debt maturity profile for the next five years. Repatriating $176.4B and retaining $50B means the company would have sufficient cash to cover the debt maturing over the next five years (approx. $30B) without having to overly rely on current/future earnings. \nMaturity",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Jony Ive Says Apple’s New Design Book Was a ‘Responsibility’ \nApple design chief Jony Ive says his company had no choice but to release a book detailing some of its product designs over the last two decades. \nSpeaking to cultural site Dazed in an interview published this week, Ive said that the company “had a responsibility to…archive” some of its best designs. He noted that Apple aapl has spent the last eight years developing the book it announced this week, Designed by Apple in California , and felt it was only right to release it to the world. \n“Honestly, it felt more of an obligation than something that we felt really compelled to do,” said Ive. “The reason for that, and I guess it’s a fairly obvious one, is that as designers, we are far more interested in and consumed by the future; in what doesn’t exist yet. But we’ve been working together for 20, 25 years, and it felt like the right and appropriate thing to do. You get a sense of what we’ve learned as a team and of how technology is evolving.” Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nThe coffee table tome details the company’s product design from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Pencil. While it’s mainly a big picture book, it also includes mention of the materials and design philosophies Apple employed to create its many iconic products. Dedicated to late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the book comes in two sizes, priced at $199 for the smaller version and $299 for the bigger option. \nIn a statement accompanying the book, Ive said that he wanted it to be “a resource of students of all design disciplines.” In his interview with Dazed, which was earlier discovered by 9to5Mac, he explained in more detail the design philosophy that he believes, makes Apple’s products aesthetically appealing. \n“What we try to do is get to a point where it seems almost undesigned, where it seems so obvious that an alternative would seem contrived and not rational,” he said. “To get to that point of that ‘perceived inevitability’ is extremely difficult.” For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nIve then shifted his attention to other topics, including Jobs, the man for whom the book was made. He said they worked well together and took a holistic approach to design. \n“It’s an entire approach, an entire attitude towards the work,” Ive said. “I think it was the all-consuming nature of it being about the product. It begins and ends with the product and if your absolute and complete focus is sincerely to try and make the very best product, then all of the other issues tend to resolve themselves.”",

      "title": "Skip YouTube Ads Using the Touch Bar on Apple's Latest MacBook Pro",
      "text": "\nThis October, Apple hosted its most-anticipated albeit unexpected event that centered upon a new MacBook Pro . The keynote presentation, helmed by Apple CEO Tim Cook, finally cleared the much-hyped rumor of the aforesaid device's OLED touch strip. This time, a rumored feature on the revamped notebook has surfaced. A Redditor by the name of RomansFiveEight professed that Macbook Pro users can presumably bypass YouTube ads using the Touch Bar. More specifically:\nIn Safari, the touchbar [sic] will pop up a scrubbing control whenever a video begins to play. Amazingly, you can use that to scrub THROUGH an ad, even a non-skippable 30 second pre-roll ad; and begin your video right away!\nWho knows how long this 'feature' will exist. But, hey; pretty neat!\nIf true, this neat attribute is definitely a huge win for those who despise the spontaneous ads that pop up before they can view their desired YouTube content. However, it's a gigantic loss to content creators on the video-sharing website who make money off ad revenues. According to AppleInsider , Google -- who owns YouTube -- is allegedly working on a way to eliminate the Touch Bar trick. As of right now, there is no official word yet from Apple.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

The organization works to foster programming education, and has partnered with various other groups and businesses on Hour of Code initiatives. \n\nThis year \"many\" Apple stores will also be incorporating Swift Playgrounds , the company's new iPad app designed to introduce children and adults to programming in Swift. The app is getting a special Hour of Code challenge, plus a new set of lessons accompanied by a teacher guide.\n\nSeparately, Apple noted that it is offering tools and resources for extending Hour of Code into schools and community centers, such as a guide with lesson and activity ideas, and Swift Playgrounds-related updates for its Apple Teacher learning program.\n\nApple has participated in Hour of Code since 2013. In fact, despite launching registrations, the official workshop page currently makes no mention of them and is still highlighting 2015 efforts.",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Studio review: a beautiful invader of Apple's base",
      "text": "The heart of the Surface Studio is its 28-inch PixelSense display. It’s stunning to look at and it’s truly one of the best desktop monitors I’ve ever used. It makes things feel oddly lifelike because you can’t see the pixels — text, videos, and pictures just look great on this thing. You can even hold a piece of paper up to the screen and the Word documents shown on-screen will be the same size. The only way you could improve this monitor is if it was OLED like  Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Yoga .\nThe Studio uses a 4500 x 3000 (192 dpi) resolution, primarily because it actually has a 3:2 aspect ratio. That’s really unusual for desktop monitors, but it matches the same ratio used on the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices. I love extra vertical space for reading and writing, even if it takes a little getting used to on a display of this size. The display is glossy and reflective, but I didn't find that too troublesome in my own office space.\nThe Studio also doubles as a giant tablet This beautiful display also doubles as a giant tablet — sort of. The entire display is incredibly thin at just under 13mm, and supports touch and the same pressure-sensitive Surface Pens found on the Surface tablets. Microsoft is using what it calls a zero-gravity hinge to prop the display up, and you can push on the top of it with a single finger to move the display into various angles.\nEven though it’s easy to adjust, you can still touch or draw at any angle as it has some resistance to being pushed back. I found myself bizarrely pulling the entire display toward me and angling it underneath me to read articles online or even when I was writing because the display is just great to have up close.\nThe real party trick of the Surface Studio is its drawing board mode, and it’s also its biggest selling point. You can push the display all the way down to get really up close to it and start drawing. It won’t sit flat on a desk, though, as the minimum angle is the drawing board mode’s 20 degrees.  Microsoft explained to me that it didn’t want people placing their coffee cups on the display and spilling them on a $3,000 PC while they’re drawing.\nThe Dial feels really natural to use To help with the drawing process, Microsoft is also releasing a new accessory: the Surface Dial ( $99 ). It’s a little puck-like device that’s powered by two (AAA) batteries, and it’s designed to be another form of input. You don’t even need a Surface Studio to use the Dial, as it works on any Windows 10 machine with Bluetooth, but it’s paired best with Microsoft’s new PC. Oddly, it's only bundled in the box with Surface Studio preorders, but Microsoft plans to sell it separately otherwise.\nI’ve been using the Dial in my left hand while I draw with my right, and it feels totally natural to use. You can tap on the top, crank the dial around, or tap and hold to access menus and controls. Most of the controls are radial menus that appear when you interact with the Dial. If you place it on top of the Surface Studio then it creates those menus directly under the Dial on the display, and they’ll follow the device wherever you place it.\nI have spent hours drawing with the Surface Studio display and the Dial. As a kid I used to love drawing, but as I got obsessed with building PCs as a teenager, I dropped my pencils in favor of gadgets. The Surface Studio has unexpectedly reignited my interest in drawing, and I’ve sat at my desk doodling away instead of watching TV for entertainment over the past week. As much fun as it’s been, I’m not going to spend $3,000 on a Surface Studio just to doodle in my free time. This device is really designed to go head-to-head with  Wacom’s Cintiq displays , so I invited a real artist over to get a better idea of the Surface Studio’s capabilities.\n\"The Surface Studio is certainly the strongest contender so far.\" Lawrence Mann Lawrence Mann Lawrence Mann is a freelance illustrator who typically uses a four-year-old MacBook Pro and Wacom’s 27-inch Cintiq display to create his art at home, and a Surface Book on the go. Mann drew parts of two pieces for The Verge over a few hours with the Surface Studio, and came away generally impressed with the Studio.\n\"What astounds me is how close Microsoft have got their experience to what I have already carefully crafted with pieces from three different companies,\" says Mann, referring to his Cintiq, MacBook Pro, and Surface Book combination. Mann thought the accuracy and pen lag seemed comparable to Wacom’s Cintiq, but to be fully satisfied with the Studio he'd like to see some improvements elsewhere. He would like to have the ability to rotate the display, along with a more ergonomic stylus, and some extra buttons on the Dial for more than the basic controls.\n\"Because of the different technologies in use between Wacom and Surface, the Surface Studio does not suffer from the same cursor-to-stylus offset parallax that affects the Wacom Cintiq range,\" explains Mann. \"It’s something that has never been of major importance to me, but I know many others might find it important when they next open their wallet. The Studio’s offset parallax was virtually nothing.\"\nMann says the Studio has left him with a \"lot to think about\" in terms of opening his own wallet. \"I can safely say as a professional digital artist looking to upgrade my main device, the Surface Studio is certainly the strongest contender so far.\"\n\nApps like Sketchable are where the Surface Dial and Surface Pen really come to life. You can use the Dial to alter brush sizes, paint colors, or spin the canvas around without having to dig through menus and find the option you need. It’s a really quick way to adjust without having to use keyboard shortcuts or navigating away from your work with the pen. I prefer to use the Dial on top of the Surface Studio itself, but I did notice it doesn’t stick to the display very well. Even at the near-flat 20-degree drawing angle, the Dial gradually slipped down the display (perhaps because of oil marks left from using the touchscreen). I noticed it out of the corner of my eye when the radial menus kept bouncing down to keep up with the slipping dial, and it’s distracting and annoying.\nThe other disappointing aspect of the Dial is the lack of app support. There are nearly 20 apps on Microsoft’s official list, but even many of those just have basic zoom or scroll controls, or just the ability to adjust the system volume. Impressive Dial support can be found in Sketchable, Drawboard, or Mental Canvas, but I’m disappointed that apps like Photoshop don’t have full Dial support. Mann is equally surprised: \"I find it remarkable that Adobe haven’t already had all of their applications updated ready for this.\" Microsoft is going up against accessories like Wacom's Express Key Remote ( $99 ), so it needs to prove it's building an app ecosystem around the Dial here. It’s a slow start, but given Microsoft’s push with the Dial I’m quietly confident that most of the apps you’d want to use with it will include support soon.\n\nAside from the Studio’s creative assets, it’s a PC at heart. At the base of the display is where all the components are housed, in a box that looks like a miniature computer. On the model I was testing there’s a sixth-generation quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB Rapid Hybrid Drive, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M graphics card inside. That’s actually some old tech for such a futuristic-looking PC. Microsoft has opted for last year's Intel and Nvidia chips, and its storage isn't all solid state. This is especially tough to swallow on the GPU front, because Nvidia's 2016 Pascal architecture is miles ahead of its predecessors. Intel and Nvidia's latest chips simply weren’t ready in time for the Surface Studio, and the storage uses a mix of 128GB SSD with a 2TB hard disk drive. That's disappointing, because even a GTX 1060 would have pushed the Studio into VR gaming, something  Microsoft is starting to support directly in Windows 10 .\nThis isn't a gaming PC, but it copes fairly well with games Despite these qualms, the Studio is still very capable. This isn’t designed as a gaming PC, but I found it coped well with games like Gears of War 4 or Forza Horizon 3 . You’re not going to be able to play either on the top settings, but they’re perfectly playable on the Studio if you don’t care about maxing out all the detail. Microsoft has even built in  Xbox Wireless support — so you can use any Xbox One controller for games — and a Windows Hello-compatible 1080p camera so you can log into Windows 10 with just your face.\nApps like Photoshop are still super responsive, even if you’re working on files stored on the HDD. The 32GB of RAM will help with multitasking or when working on huge files that demand a lot of memory. And although my workload is relatively light, I wasn't able to overwhelm the Surface Studio at all even with games and multiple apps running side-by-side. Almost similar to most conventional PCs, you also get 4 USB 3.0 ports in total. Microsoft is still steering clear of USB-Type C, for now. Alongside the USB ports there's an SD card reader, headphone jack, and Mini DisplayPort for connecting up a second monitor. You can’t use this DisplayPort to use the Surface Studio as a monitor itself, though.\nAs this is an all-in-one PC, there are still some compromises with the Surface Studio. All of the ports are at the rear, which makes it hard to access them if you have the Studio placed against a wall. This isn’t a silent machine either, and the fan constantly hums away, with the volume depending on how much you’re doing with it. If you’re trying to run some games or process video then you’re going to start hearing it. It’s distracting if you’re used to silence, but it blends into the background otherwise.\nMost of the PC aspects of the Surface Studio are exactly what you’d expect from an all-in-one, and there’s very little to fault here. My main questions are around its price and uses cases. At a starting price of $2,999, it’s up there with Wacom’s 27-inch Cintiq ( $2,799 ), but for that extra $200 you’re getting a full PC and not just a monitor. For creatives, that’s a seriously tempting offer, but you’re really buying the Surface Studio because of its display. It’s stunning, and there’s nothing quite like it on the market right now that has this 3:2 aspect ratio, touch capabilities, and the Surface Pen support, all while being almost pixel perfect and super thin.\nIt’s an engineering marvel of a monitor, but I really wish Microsoft sold it separately. I want to dock my Surface Book to it, or transform any laptop into a full Surface Studio. If I’m investing in a desktop PC at this kind of price then I also really want to be able to upgrade it and use it for gaming and more powerful work. I can’t do either of those things with the Surface Studio. If this was a monitor with a powerful GPU in it designed to complement Microsoft’s existing Surface devices and \"upgrade\" them, I’d probably be throwing my wallet at my screen right now. It’s hard to do so knowing that I’m not getting the latest and greatest specs for that $2,999, and that’s before you even consider the top model I’ve been testing is $4,199.\nMicrosoft is doing what Apple refuses to do That doesn’t discount what Microsoft has attempted to do here. It’s truly something unique and a hint of real innovation we haven’t seen for some years with PCs. Others have tried to experiment, like  HP's Sprout , but it's rare to see something more than just an all-in-one. Microsoft’s  exciting Surface Studio unveil has been compared to Apple’s  disappointing MacBook Pro launch , and with good reason. Many creatives I’ve spoken to about the Surface Studio have said the same thing: why isn’t Apple doing this? Apple seems to be forcing creatives to choose an iPad Pro for touch and pen, but the powerful and professional apps just aren’t there yet on iOS, and it’s not clear if companies like Adobe are willing to rewrite their software to be just as useful on an iPad Pro. Microsoft has realized the potential in the market to reach out to creatives who feel abandoned by Apple, and it’s an influential crowd that could be swayed over by devices like the Surface Studio.\nIt’s still a small part of the overall PC market, though. Creatives will have to weigh up whether this beautiful set of floating pixels is worth the price. If you're already in that price range and considering Wacom's Cintiq — and you don't need a really powerful machine — then the Surface Studio is a no-brainer. For many, the switch from macOS to Windows 10 could be the daunting part, and for others it will be the question of how many apps truly support this new way of working with the Dial.\nThe fact that Microsoft is even being considered an alternative to Apple’s line of machines for creatives is not something anyone, not even Microsoft, was expecting for the Surface devices. The Surface Studio won't take over Mac-focused design houses just yet, but that it’s even a possibility is remarkable. The Studio is special because it knows exactly what it is and who it’s for — and it’s largely spot on. If Microsoft keeps developing its strengths here, some of Apple's most loyal customers might well be tempted to switch camps.\nPhotography by James Bareham.\nVideo by Max Jeffrey and Phil Esposito. \nEdited by Dieter Bohn and Vlad Savov. \nMicrosoft Surface Studio 8.7 Verge Score Good Stuff: Stunning display with 3:2 aspect ratio Thin and handsome industrial design Pen, touchscreen, and Dial support Bad Stuff: Old CPU and GPU Can't use as a monitor Dial needs more apps and a better base Circuit Breaker The new MacBook Pro's speaker grilles are mostly cosmetic Circuit Breaker Barnes & Noble is releasing a $50 Nook Tablet on Black Friday Circuit Breaker Eero adds Alexa integration to its mesh router system View all stories in Circuit Breaker",

      "title": "APPLE MAY PRODUCE IPHONES IN USA...",
      "text": "November 18, 2016 12:20 am JST Exclusive Apple could make iPhones in US in future: sources \nDEBBY WU, Nikkei staff writer Sources say Apple has asked its assemblers to look into making iPhones in the U.S. © AP \nTAIPEI -- iPhones might one day soon carry \"Made in America\" labels. \nKey Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry , also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S., sources told the Nikkei Asian Review. \n\"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron , the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,\" a source said. \"Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.\" \nFoxconn, based in the gritty, industrial Tucheng district in suburban Taipei, and its smaller Taiwanese rival churn out more than 200 million iPhones annually from their massive Chinese campuses. \nAnother source said that while Foxconn had been working on the request from Apple Inc., its biggest customer that accounts for more than 50% of its sales, Chairman Terry Gou had been less enthusiastic due to an inevitable rise in production costs. \n\"Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,\" the source said. \nThe person added that one view among the Apple supply chain in Taiwan is that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may push the Cupertino, California-based tech titan to make a certain number of iPhone components at home. \nAccording to research company IHS Markit, it costs about $225 for Apple to make an iPhone 7 with a 32GB memory, while the unsubsidized price for such a handset is $649. \nApple, Foxconn and Pegatron all declined to comment. \nNot Made in America \nApple's move appears to fall in line with Trump's pledge to push American companies to make their products at home. There is a widespread perception among American voters that the U.S. is losing manufacturing jobs to other countries in this age of globalization and free trade. \nOther than having its popular gadgets assembled in China, Apple also procures most of the key components for its flagship iPhones from Asian suppliers. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. makes chips for iPhones, Japan's Japan Display and Sharp supply panels for Apple's handsets, and South Korea's SK Hynix and Japan's Toshiba produce memory chips for the device. \nTrump singled out Apple several times earlier this year to hammer home his point, and vowed to slap a 45% tariff on goods made in China. \n\"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,\" he said at Liberty University in Virginia in January. \nIn March, Trump further pointed the blame at China, where Apple's assemblers churn out iPhones, iPads and MacBooks. \n\"How does it help us when they make it in China?\" Trump said during his Super Tuesday victory speech. \nThe anxiety among Trump's mostly white working-class supporters in the Rust Belt of America is understandable. While Apple claims that it created and supports 2 million jobs domestically, U.S. think-tank Economic Policy Institute estimated that America had lost 5 million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014. \nOn the other hand, Foxconn employs some 690,000 workers in China as at the end of April, equaling the entire population of Detroit. \nEven though the number is down from the peak of 1.3 million in 2012, it is still a high head count that many heads of countries, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would like to secure for their people. \nNo easy job \nYet some in the Apple supply chain said it would be impossible to move iPhone production back to the U.S. due to a lack of infrastructure and a steep hike in costs. \nApple's Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS' 60 Minutes program in December 2015 that America simply did not have enough skilled workers for the production of iPhones. \nAn industry executive familiar with the iPhone production process also said it would be difficult to produce the device in large quantities in the U.S. \n\"To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,\" the executive said. \"Even if Trump imposes a 45% tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the U.S.\" \nAnother industry source said: \"It is not easy to make iPhones in America, unless the U.S. government subsidizes local companies for producing domestically.\" \nMeanwhile, Beijing is getting edgy too. The state-run Global Times warned on Nov. 13 that if Trump starts a trade war with China, \"U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback.\" \nPolitics will trump everything \nYet there was precedent in the administration of incumbent President Barack Obama for political factors to overpower economic concerns when companies and governments haggle over corporate practices. \nFaced with political pressure to bring jobs home under Obama's government, Apple helped its Singapore-based contractor Flextronics build a Mac Pro production line in Austin, Texas in 2013, after Foxconn set up an iMac assembly line in the same state the year before. \nSharp President Tai Jeng-wu, right-hand man to Foxconn's Gou, also hinted in late October that if Apple eventually decided to produce in the U.S., he would have no option but to follow his customer's instructions. \n\"We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,\" he said. \"If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?\" \n\"Politics will trump cost concerns in the end,\" the industry executive familiar with iPhone's production process said. \"The Apple supply chain must treat Trump's campaign pledge seriously and not write it off.\" \nMark Li, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, echoed the sentiment. \n\"Although TSMC is very clear that it would be much more expensive to make chips outside of Taiwan, it's inevitable for the world's largest contract chipmaker to take 'Made in the U.S.' into consideration if the alternative is that it would lose Apple orders without moving to America,\" Li said. \nYet the big question is -- even if Apple moves the mundane assembly line back to the U.S., will American workers be keen for such monotonous and labor-intensive jobs that often attract criticism from rights groups and that even Chinese youngsters are turning their noses up on? \n\"Young people in China no longer want to work in factories but instead they want to be a Didi driver or run their small business on WeChat,\" an industry executive said. \nDidi is the Chinese equivalent of Uber, and WeChat is China's homegrown real-time messenger. \n\"As a Didi driver, you can work whenever you want. But there is no freedom in a factory -- once you're on duty, you'll be on the production line for 10 hours or more,\" the executive said. \nNikkei staff writer Cheng Ting-fang contributed to this report Asia300",

      "text": "Getty Images Customers shop at a new Apple store on August 16, 2016, in New York City. Apple may have not two but three iPhones in its next lineup, and one will feature a 5.2-inch OLED display, according to a report from 9to5 Mac. \nThe report released on Thursday said Apple is planning on its new iPhone, possibly called the iPhone 8, to feature a major structure redesign with component upgrades including an OLED screen. The other two models will be successors to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus with LCD displays, according to KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo, who has predicted several Apple hardware details with startling accuracy. \nThe display change would be a substantial breakaway for Apple, which has traditionally used LCD displays for its current iPhones. Apple's smartphone rival Samsung already features OLED displays on some of its premium devices. OLED panels are said to be thinner and offer more vibrant colors than LCD. \nThe report also said the new OLED iPhone might feature a \"bezel-less\" front design and the home button will be integrated into the display. The screen panels could also extend around the sides. \nA separate report from the Nikkei Asian Review on Thursday said Apple might one day soon move production of its iPhone to the U.S. Nikkei, citing a source, said President-elect Donald Trump might push the tech giant to make some iPhone components in the U.S. \nCNBC has reached out to Apple for comment about the two reports.\n\nRead more on Kuo's predictions in the full report from 9 to 5 Mac here.",

      "text": "on Thursday November 17, 2016 @11:45AM from the truth-hurts dept. Apple is exploring the idea of making iPhones in the United States. But the company has realized that it will cost more than double to make the shiny new gadgets at home , according to a report on Japan-based outlet Nikkei. From the report: Key Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S., sources told the Nikkei Asian Review. \"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,\" a source said. \"Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.\" Foxconn, based in the gritty, industrial Tucheng district in suburban Taipei, and its smaller Taiwanese rival churn out more than 200 million iPhones annually from their massive Chinese campuses. Another source said that while Foxconn had been working on the request from Apple Inc., its biggest customer that accounts for more than 50% of its sales, Chairman Terry Gou had been less enthusiastic due to an inevitable rise in production costs. \"Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,\" the source said.",

      "title": "Report: Apple Takes Big Step Toward AR-Ready iPhone 8",
      "text": "Apple has made no bones about its interest in augmented reality. And lately, evidence is mounting that the company is rapidly moving to adding AR to its mobile products, possibly as soon as next year.\n\nThe latest piece of the puzzle emerged tonight (Nov. 16) when Business Insider reported on an effort underway at Apple to integrate AR technology into the iPhone's camera app. The report, which cites \"a person familiar with matter,\" says Apple's AR push is tapping resources from an array of startups bought by the company with an eye toward getting AR into its product lineup as quickly as possible. \n\nThat looks like it's going to be next year. Business Insider's sources say Apple will add AR capabilities to the iPhone's camera app, likely in 2017's iOS 11 update. Once that AR support is in place, you'll be able to point your iPhone's camera at a real-world object, and the software will be able to recognize it. Business Insider says the AR feature could also tap into the facial recognition features added in iOS 10, allowing the Camera app to recognize and manipulate people's faces.\nMORE: iPhone 8 Rumors: What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone \nGiven the rumored timing of Apple's planned updates to its Camera app -- the company typically releases major iOS updates at the same time as it rolls out new iPhones -- it looks like AR could wind up being one of the major additions to next year's iPhone 8. The company is reportedly planning to overhaul the phone's design -- think OLED displays that stretch from one edge of the phone to the other -- so adding AR features would allow Apple to tout substantial software changes for the iPhone as well.\n\nIn some sense, Apple would be playing catch-up with an AR-enabled phone. Google and Lenovo teamed up to release the Phab2 Pro , a phone that uses motion tracking and depth perception features to superimpose virtual objects on top of the real world as seen through that phone's camera. The Phab2 Pro has just started shipping after it was unveiled earlier this year.\nThis is hardly the first time someone has suggested that AR will be a major focus for the iPhone 8 . Last month, tech blogger Robert Scoble predicted that the next iPhone would feature a virtually see-through design, making it well-suited for AR uses. Scoble says he based his forecast on talking to multiple industry sources, including those making the components for the next iPhone.\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Apple is working on a pair of AR glasses similar to Google Glasses. But that AR product likely won't appear until 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg says.\nApple normally plays its cards close to the vest when it comes to future product plans, and it has yet to confirm any of the many rumors already swirling about the iPhone 8. But it has been quite up front about its interest in augmented reality. In July, CEO Tim Cook confirmed to Wall Street analysts that Apple was investing in AR . More recently, Cook spoke enthusiastically about AR's potential during a TV interview, especially when compared to virtual reality.\n\n\"There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality,\" Cook said on Good Morning America back in September. \"Both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.\"\n\nShould reports of Apple adding AR features to the iOS Camera app pan out, augmented reality could wind up meeting that potential sooner rather than later.\nSee Also : Best Augmented Reality Apps \nI Touched Augmented Reality with Meta 2 iOS 10 Photos: All the New Features and How to Use Them Best Camera Phones About the author Philip Michaels @PhilipMichaels Philip Michaels is a senior editor at Tom's Guide.

      "text": "PlayStation Vue’s TV streaming service arrives on Apple TV Posted Strange days indeed \nApple may not have yet launched its own TV streaming service, but there’s now another way to watch live television on Apple’s set-top box: Sony’s PlayStation Vue’s Apple TV application has arrived . The service, which is available on Apple TV 4th generation devices, offers all of Vue’s standard features, including its cloud DVR, support for simultaneous streams, and it works with the Siri Remote, the company says. \nSony has been working to bring the service to more platforms in recent months, in order to make the streaming TV service more accessible to those who don’t have a PlayStation gaming console. In October, for example, it hit Android TV , and this month, it launched on the web for Mac and PC users. However, Apple TV support remained one of users’ top requests, says Sony. \nA competitor to Dish’s Sling TV, and soon, Hulu’s live TV service as well as AT&T’s DirecTV Now, Vue has been focused on promoting its feature set and user experience as its biggest differentiating factors. While the service unfortunately just lost all Viacom channels , Sony still believes its larger selling points like its cloud DVR will give it an edge over rivals. \nIn addition, compared with Sling TV, Vue lets you watch on more devices at the same time, making it a better fit for larger families where several people want to watch different programs on their own devices and TV sets. With Vue, you can watch on up to five devices at once, while Sling’s best plan (Sling Blue) only allows up to 3 simultaneous streams. \nThe availability of the live channels – like NBC, Fox, ESPN, NFL Network, and others – will depend on where you live. But you’re also able to add on premium networks like AMC, FX, HBO and Showtime, to round out the experience. And PlayStation Vue offers a few different pricing tiers ranging from those who want a more basic experience to those who want all of Vue’s channels, including sports, movies and premium networks. \nThe Apple TV app is straightforward to use. Tabs at the top let you move in between the programming guide, access search, or adjust your settings. And its simplified layout is much easier to navigate that the messy interface offered by Sling TV, in terms of aesthetics. \nThough ultimately, the choice of which streaming TV service will come down to a number of factors beyond looks, with Vue’s continued expansion to support more devices, higher number of simultaneous streams, and other unique features, it’s definitely one that should be considered when cutting the cord for good.",

Staff Writer, Macworld | Nov 17, 2016 9:20 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Apple Apple flirts with, but doesn't commit to touchscreen \nLong-time Apple watchers have speculated that next year’s iPhones will move from LCD to OLED displays, but this week a strange rumor emerged from a reliable Apple analyst: Next year, Apple will release three iPhones, and only one of them will have an OLED display. \nNow we know why that could be. Apple would love to bring OLED to its entire iPhone lineup, but the supply isn’t there, Bloomberg reported . OLED display makers Samsung, Sharp, LG, and Japan Display are working to produce panels, but Sharp and Japan Display won’t kick production into high gear until 2018. LG is also lagging after spending years making OLED displays for television. \nAccording to Bloomberg, that leaves Samsung, which has an exclusive agreement to produce OLED displays for iPhones next year. But Apple sells a ton of phones: The company has reportedly put in an order for 100 million units to prep for next year’s holiday quarter, and Samsung might not be able to make enough. It might not even be able to produce half that amount. Last year, Apple sold 75 million iPhones over the holidays, and if Samsung can’t pull through, then the company won’t be able to put OLED displays in every phone. The 10th anniversary OLED iPhone \nApple is reportedly prepping an all-glass 5.5-inch iPhone with an edge-to-edge OLED display. The company plans to ditch the bezel and embed the Home button directly in the screen. (Am I the only one envisioning the Monolith from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey ? OK, carry on.) \nIf Apple introduced OLED in just one model of the next-generation iPhone, it would be a surprising departure, though not without precedent—with the iPhone 7 Plus, the company put a dual-lens camera system in just one phone. But displays are a different story. An edge-to-edge OLED screen would fundamentally change the iPhone experience. \nOf course, display suppliers could come through and enable Apple to overhaul its entire lineup. But with this week’s spate of rumors, it seems like the company is establishing expectations for a lone OLED iPhone.

Users will be able to take advantage of Apple TV’s Siri-enabled remote and touch-based navigation. Sony’s virtual pay-TV service is also available on PlayStation 3 and 4 consoles, Roku, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, iOS and Android devices, and Amazon Fire tablets. \nPlayStation Vue provides access to live TV programming, including sports networks like ESPN and NFL Network and entertainment channels like AMC, FX and HBO. \nUsers with an existing PlayStation Vue account can link their subscription to Apple TV and start streaming immediately. New users can sign up for one of several plan options through the PlayStation Vue website and link their subscription to Apple TV, without the need for a PlayStation console. A seven-day free trial is available to new PlayStation Vue customers. Filed Under:",

      "text": "21 shares \nEarlier this year, Apple went toe-to-toe with the FBI over the company’s refusal to unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. After refusing a court order to assist, Apple emerged as the great protector of user privacy. But was this all a farce? \nIt seems that private information still escapes from Apple products under certain circumstances – the latest being the company’s online syncing service iCloud . \nAccording to The Intercept : \nRussian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft has found that Apple’s mobile devices automatically send a user’s call history to the company’s servers if iCloud is enabled — but the data gets uploaded in many instances without user choice or notification. \nThe data – including calls made and received – collects information such as phone numbers, dates and times, and duration which is then automatically uploaded to Apple. \nApple keeps this information for up to four months, and because they control the keys to encrypted messages as well as possess the ability to unlock iCloud accounts, the device-maker could be forced to grant access to law enforcement agencies. \nChris Soghoian, chief technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union , says that because iCloud backs up normally encrypted iMessages it could actually be worse. \n…There are other ways the government can obtain [call logs]. But without the backup of iMessages, there may be no other way for them to get those messages. \nBut this is only the beginning. \nHackers could potentially collect sensitive information merely by obtaining a user’s Apple ID. \nIn order to prevent this, iPhone owners can use two-factor authentication. But that won’t stop the fuzz if they come sniffing at your door.",

More >> \nIt looks like the fight between Ireland, Apple, and the EU is only set to escalate -- Ireland is prepared to bring that fight to EU courts. An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes. \nBy Kat Boogaar d Contributor, Inc.com \nIt was 3PM, and I was blurry-eyed from working in front of my computer for the past six hours. A solid six hours of work sounds perfectly normal, right? Except this was a Saturday -- a day I normally try to reserve for computer-free activities. \nChances are, you've found yourself in this exact same scenario more times than you care to admit. The ability to be constantly connected offers great convenience, but it also makes it overwhelmingly difficult to truly unplug and disconnect -- even on weekends . \nIn fact, according to a 2013 survey, an astounding 97% of small business owners work weekends. And, another study shows that American employees work longer hours than anyone else. \nWe all deserve a little time to relax and recharge. But, taking your weekends back from that to-do list of yours can be a challenge. Use these five tips to reclaim your weekend and finally step away from that computer. 1. Adjust Your View \nBefore you can make any further changes, you first need to alter your perception of the weekend. Too many of us view it as a bonus extension of the work week. We tell ourselves that we can take care of those things we weren't able to wrap up on Friday afternoon on Saturday or Sunday. \nHowever, that assumption needs to change if you truly want to reserve your weekends for relaxation and enjoyment. \nStop viewing your weekend as the catchall for the work you can't quite finish during the regular week. It'll make you that much more productive those other five days in an effort to tie up any loose ends before you clock out. 2. Prepare, Prepare, Prepare \nSpeaking of tying up loose ends, if you previously worked the majority of the weekend and now plan to stop, you're technically losing two working days. \nObviously, you can't just cut out a chunk of your work week without it having an impact. So, adequate preparation is key to ensure that you can actually unplug for two days each week. This might mean longer hours Monday through Friday, but it's usually worth it to have an entire stress-free weekend. \nStart each week by jotting down all of the major things you need to get done before Friday afternoon. Having this master list will keep you focused on the big tasks you need to accomplish, and help you avoid missing the forest for the trees when your week gets crazy. 3. Utilize Small Pockets of Time \nWish you could add a little more time to your work week? Well, you probably can. \nNo, there isn't some magic formula that'll actually stretch your working hours. However, making an effort to effectively utilize those small pockets of time you're used to wasting -- like those twenty minutes before your next meeting starts or those ten minutes before you head out to lunch -- can really maximize your productivity. \nThose might seem like small, insignificant time blocks. But, they add up fast. And, by using them for real, productive work, you could technically add a couple of hours to each week -- meaning there's less for you to feel tempted to handle over the weekend. 4. Set Expectations \nIf you've gotten used to working weekends, chances are other people have gotten used to you working during that time as well. Maybe colleagues and clients are emailing you at all hours on Sundays. Or, perhaps you've become accustomed to having to take a call on a Saturday afternoon. \nSimilarly to how you had to adjust your own expectations, you'll also have to tweak the expectations of the people you work with. \nMake it clear that you're going to do your best to stay away from work each weekend -- even if that means you need to set an \"out of office\" message on your email. Eventually, people will get used to the fact that they shouldn't reach out to you on your days off, and you'll be able to relax without your inbox constantly filling up (hopefully). 5. Accept the Unfinished \nIf you spend the majority of your weekend working, chances are you have a lot to do -- so much that you couldn't quite cram it all into a normal work week. \nBut, take a minute to ask yourself: How much of the stuff you do over the weekend absolutely has to be done by Monday morning? I'm willing to bet only a very minor slice of it. \nI hate having pending work and projects hanging over my head just as much as the next person. However, if you're seriously aiming to reserve your weekends for personal time, you're going to need to be comfortable with recognizing what's unfinished and -- unless it's incredibly urgent -- leaving it on your desk for Monday. I promise, it'll still be there when you get back. \nYou may be accustomed to working during the weekend. But, you deserve some time to unplug and recharge. Use these five tips, and you're sure to reclaim your weekends from the firm grasp of your to-do list! \nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com \nThe original \"5 tips to take your weekends back\" article can be seen here . © 2016 Inc.com.

      "text": "Reddit \nSony’s web TV service PlayStation Vue is now available on the fourth generation Apple TV. Previously, PS Vue customers could authenticate paid video apps with Sony credentials, but access to live channel streaming was limited. \nThe new app has a fairly sleek interface once you get past the cumbersome authentication process (which requires going to a Sony URL and entering a lengthy numerical passcode). \nPlayStation Vue includes access to live TV streaming plus access to on demand content. A Cloud DVR feature also lets you save content to watch later or pause shows during live playback. \nPS Vue was already available for iPhone and iPad with a Mac client coming soon. A version on the web is already available for Mac users but requires Flash. \nAs a web TV service, PS Vue is a compelling buy for cordcutters aside from some restrictions around where you can stream. The new Apple TV app makes activation easier without the need for a PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 that the iPhone and iPad versions required. \nIf you already have an existing PlayStation Vue account, you can link your subscription to Apple TV and start streaming right away. If you’re new to PlayStation Vue, you can sign up for one of several plan options through the PlayStation Vue website and link your account to Apple TV, without the need of a PlayStation console. Plans start at $29.99, or $39.99 in select cities*, so head over to our website and enter your zip code to see the plans available in your area. \nThe service did see a major setback recently , however, with channels from Viacom disappearing for subscribers. These include MTV, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon which were reportedly going to increase the cost of the monthly service. \nYou can download PlayStation Vue on the new Apple TV by searching the App Store. Guides Apple TV \nApple TV is Apple's set-top box offering that allows users to stream content from services like Netflix, Hulu, and many more via the tvOS App Store.",

Using resources from Code.org, this session teaches the basic concepts of code using simple drag-and-drop interactions,\" per Apple's Hour of Code page. \nMost workshops will revolve around Swift Playgrounds, an iPad app tailored as an introduction to the Swift programming language. Swift Playgrounds' feature set will be bolstered by special Hour of Code challenges and lesson plans to reinforce lessons taught during the workshops. \nApple designed the Swift language to be easy to use, concise, and flexible. Within its framework, users can write blocks of code in powerful languages such as Objective-C and C++. \nYou can visit the Hour of Code workshop page to register and search for Apple stores hosting workshops near your location.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple’s iPhone 7 Isn’t Attracting Many Android Users \nFar more Android users picked the iPhone 6s than the iPhone 7, according to new data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). \nOut of all the people who have bought an iPhone 7 since its release in September, 17% say that they were previously Android users, according to CIRP. That’s up by five percentage points compared to the 2014 release of the iPhone 6, but down from 26% of iPhone 6s owners who were previously Android users. \nOverall, Apple AAPL is still attracting most of iPhone owners from its existing base of customers. And at least so far, Android users are still proving loyal to their mobile operating system. \nBut as CIRP partner and co-founder Mike Levin notes, that’s not necessarily a bad thing for Apple. After all, Android adoption is higher with iPhone 7 than it was with the company’s last big release, the iPhone 6. What’s more, he says, Android users are bolstering Apple sales in years, like 2015, when it releases modest upgrades and not as many iPhone owners are looking to update. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \n“The two more successful iPhone launches in the last three years were driven by existing loyal iPhone owners who upgrade to a new iPhone model, and rely less on Android owners who switch to an iPhone,” Levin says. “When Apple launched the less compelling iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models in 2015, existing iPhone owners essentially sat out the upgrade cycle.” \nApple released its iPhone 7 in September. The smartphone comes with a similar design to its predecessor, the iPhone 6s, but offers a faster processor and improved camera. It’s also the first iPhone not to ship with a headphone jack. While Apple has not broken out iPhone 7 sales , analysts and market researchers say the smartphone is selling well. \nCIRP didn’t share its estimate on iPhone 7 sales figures, but did say that the smartphone accounted for approximately three-quarters of all iPhone purchases in the 30 days within its release. That’s up from 71% of purchases for the iPhone 6s during its own launch window in 2015. The iPhone 6 accounted for 81% of purchases in the 30 days around its own release. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nStill, for Apple, that might not be a problem. CIRP says nearly one-third of iPhone buyers so far this year are buying the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus. That’s up from about 25% of buyers who purchased the iPhone 6 Plus. That means Apple should be able to “boost average selling prices and margins” this year. \nThe CIRP data comes from a survey of 300 U.S. Apple customers between Oct. 18 and Oct. 31. All of those surveyed purchased an iPhone in the 30-day period following its release on Sept. 16. ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Taiwan Plans to Ask Apple and Google to Pull Uber From Their App Stores \nTaiwan plans to ask Apple and Alphabet’s Google to pull apps of Uber Technologies available in Taiwan on their app stores, a government official said, upping pressure on the ride-hailing firm that is locked in a dispute with the island. \nUber operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company, which Taiwanese authorities have said is a mis-representation of its service and has ordered it to pay back taxes. \nHowever, Uber has said it is communicating with Taiwan authorities and complies with local regulations. \n“Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),” Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan’s Directorate General of Highways, which is handling the matter, told Reuters by phone on Wednesday. \nLiang said the request would include the removal of UberEATS app, which Uber launched in Taiwan on Tuesday as part of its effort to expand beyond its core taxi-hailing business around the world. \n\nIt is unclear if the move would succeed in hampering Uber in Taiwan as removing the app would not prevent alternative ways to download it. It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with. \nUber and Apple aapl did not immediately respond with comments. \nA Google googl spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further. \nTaiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday. \nUber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. It entered the Taiwan market in 2013, and its growing popularity has triggered anger from domestic taxi drivers, who staged a massive protest against Uber earlier this year. ",

      "text": "On Tuesday, Apple released something unique: not a phone or a laptop or wireless earbuds, but a coffee table book. Designed by Apple in California features exquisite photographs of iconic Apple products, beginning with the iMac in 1998 and culminating with the Apple Pencil. In true Apple fashion the book comes in two sizes: a 10.20 x 12.75-inch copy for $199 and a 13 x 16.25-inch copy for $299. Predictably, I chose the the coffee table book Pro edition.\nThe Verge bought the “small” version of the book which arrived in the office yesterday afternoon, and I realized that Apple may have been slightly disingenuous with their description: the “small” is pretty damn big and weighs a figurative ton. I could probably have saved myself the extra $100 and reduced the potential for injury to my lower back.\nNevertheless, I am so glad I ordered this book; it is a thing of great beauty. Like all Apple products, the attention to detail is meticulous: the tightly bound pages are edged in silver; the paper is Apple-specific Heaven 42 Scheufelen from Germany — as is the Bamberger Kaliko linen with bespoke dye. The printing is simply astonishing: custom low ghost Epple inks and 8 CMYK color separations (4 is the norm) with 280 line screen printing give the photographs deep, rich blacks and colors so bright as to make a grown design lover weep.\nAs for the photographs themselves, they are of course impeccable. All were shot by Andrew Zuckerman in a typical “Appley” minimalist style, bathing Apple’s older hardware in the modern “press shot” aesthetic.\nPerhaps the most interesting photographs are the “teardown” shots of MacBooks, iMacs, and the 2007 iPhone. I’ve lingered over one shot of the back of a first-generation Phone which has been scratched and dented through use. It wears a patina of rugged awesomeness with pride. \nFlipping through the 450 exquisite photographs of Apple favorites such as the 17-inch MacBook Pro, or the 2003 iSight camera — not to mention the colored iMacs of the late ‘90s and the original iPods of the early 2000s — I confess I was overwhelmed by a nagging reality: this is a tome crafted in honor of nostalgia.\nAs I reached later pages featuring the Apple Watch, the iPad, and even the brand-new MacBook Pro, I felt something lacking. The design of these newer products is certainly beautiful, but Apple’s look no longer resonates with me in the same way it once did.\nPerhaps I’m over exposed to the imagery. We are now very used to seeing photographs of the Apple Watch or iPad on glorious 5k screens; we never saw a blueberry iMac that clearly. But I think that the real reason for this book feeling nostalgic is that although Apple’s industrial design under Jony Ive has been consistently great, Apple’s competitors have improved dramatically over the last 18 years. Apple’s design doesn’t feel like a message from the future; it feels like one part of the conversation of today.\nAs Steve Jobs famously said: “You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.” Back in 2003 when I bought my first iPod and iSight camera, those products were a beacon on the hill in terms of industrial design. They were astonishing not only because they were beautiful, considered, and almost perfect in every way, but because they were the embodiment of Apple’s belief that technology didn’t have to be ugly to be utilitarian. By the early 2000s, Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, and the Apple design team were leading us out of our world of beige boxes and onto an undiscovered country where milled aluminum and candy-colored plastics were the new normal.\nIn 2016, the beige box has been well and truly consigned to the garbage pile of history and is nothing more than distant memory. That’s not to say that all the tech products of today are designed as well as those by Apple — they are most definitely not. But they are undeniably a hell of a lot better. Just look at the Microsoft Surface Pro (and especially the beautiful Surface Studio); just look at the new Google Pixel phones and Daydream VR headset; and just look at the Galaxy Note 7, which despite a proclivity for pyrotechnics is undeniably a beautiful work of industrial design.\nGood industrial design is no longer an ideal, it’s a basic requirement Good industrial design is no longer an ideal, it’s a basic requirement. High-end products simply don’t succeed without it. And that’s Apple’s fundamental problem going forward. Chamfers precisely milled to a thousandth of a millimeter now count far less than seamless usability across a variety of connected devices. We are living in a post-hardware-centric world where the new frontier for design perfection is software — and good design is assumed.\nBut that’s for tomorrow. Without the visionary design sensibilities of Steve Jobs and Sir Jony Ive, I doubt we’d be where we are today. The book Designed by Apple in California shows us the path they took to get us all here. And the book is like that path: big, bold, beautiful, and unapologetically self-indulgent. \nIt is also really heavy.",

      "text": "http://hypebeast.com/2016/11/macbook-pro-touch-bar-skip-youtube-ads?utm_source=link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share+buttons \nThis October, Apple hosted its most-anticipated albeit unexpected event that centered upon a new MacBook Pro . The keynote presentation, helmed by Apple CEO Tim Cook, finally cleared the much-hyped rumor of the aforesaid device’s OLED touch strip. This time, a rumored feature on the revamped notebook has surfaced. A Redditor by the name of RomansFiveEight professed that Macbook Pro users can presumably bypass YouTube ads using the Touch Bar. More specifically: \nIn Safari, the touchbar [sic] will pop up a scrubbing control whenever a video begins to play. Amazingly, you can use that to scrub THROUGH an ad, even a non-skippable 30 second pre-roll ad; and begin your video right away! \nWho knows how long this ‘feature’ will exist. But, hey; pretty neat! \nIf true, this neat attribute is definitely a huge win for those who despise the spontaneous ads that pop up before they can view their desired YouTube content. However, it’s a gigantic loss to content creators on the video-sharing website who make money off ad revenues. According to AppleInsider , Google — who owns YouTube — is allegedly working on a way to eliminate the Touch Bar trick. As of right now, there is no official word yet from Apple. Photographer iMore",

      "text": "Long-time Apple watchers have speculated that next year’s iPhones will move from LCD to OLED displays, but this week a strange rumor emerged from a reliable Apple analyst: Next year, Apple will release three iPhones, and only one of them will have an OLED display.\n\nNow we know why that could be. Apple would love to bring OLED to its entire iPhone lineup, but the supply isn’t there, Bloomberg reported. OLED display makers Samsung, Sharp, LG, and Japan Display are working to produce panels, but Sharp and Japan Display won’t kick production into high gear until 2018. LG is also lagging after spending years making OLED displays for television.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "title": "AirPods Launch Rumors Now Include Dates in Late November and December",
      "text": "Adding to the pile of recent guesswork rumors centering around the launch of Apple's AirPods, this week a collection of foreign retail websites have listed the Bluetooth headphones with new dates suggesting availability before the end of the year.\n\nFirst off, today Mac4Ever discovered that French retail website Fnac has posted the AirPods for pre-order, with a suggested shipping date of November 30. If true, that would mark a launch following Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but still leave customers plenty of time to add AirPods to their holiday shopping list.\nOne of many predicted AirPods shipping dates from foreign resellers, this one Fnac\n\nLast week, a launch supposedly set for around tomorrow, November 18, was floated by an Apple reseller, which reportedly told a customer it would be getting AirPods stock today, November 17. Although an impending launch as soon as tomorrow is unlikely, many Apple retail stores have been receiving demo units of the AirPods to demonstrate to customers and teach employees how to use them, suggesting Apple still intends to launch the device sooner rather than later next year.\n\nEarlier in the week Letem svetem Applem discovered that Czech website Alza had listed the AirPods as launching December 2016. That date has since been removed from the site, which now simply states that it \"accepts pre-orders\" for the AirPods.\nIf production does begin in December, as predicted by Barclays, that still leaves the option that AirPods might not launch until January 2017, which was one of the first delayed date estimates for the headphones after Apple postponed the launch beyond October. Despite that rumor, and a few other extraneous websites that mark AirPods availability as late as March 2017, many still believe it's most likely that Apple will get the AirPods out in time for the holiday shopping season.\n\nWith the highly divergent launch dates sprouting up online, it's clear that no one officially knows exactly when the AirPods will come out. On Apple.com, the AirPods are listed as both \"coming soon\" and \"currently unavailable.\" Following the delay, Apple explained that it needed \"a little more time\" with the AirPods before they would be ready to launch, but didn't divulge specific reasons why it chose to do so.Tag: AirPods\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "– A + Report claims Apple iPhone assemblers tasked to develop US manufacturing plans By Mike Wuerthele \nThursday, November 17, 2016, 09:52 am PT (12:52 pm ET) \nPrimary iPhone assemblers Foxconn and Pegatron are said to have been evaluating the ability of the company to shift production of Apple's mobile devices to the U.S., with the verdict mixed on if the move would be cost-effective.\n\n\n\n\n\"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,\" a source told the Nikkei Asian Review . \"Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.\"\n\nReportedly, Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou was critical of the plan, saying that labor and other associated costs would more than double, should the plan come to fruition.\n\nPegatron was also reportedly tasked with developing a U.S. manufacture report, but declared the shift impossible due to costs.\nA 35% cost increase, regardless if induced by labor and material shipping costs, or a tariff would likely passed on to consumers, making a $649 base-model iPhone retail for around $876. \nThe study was probably spawned because of potential political pressure and taxation for Apple promised by President Elect Donald Trump during campaigning for the office. Trump's campaign promise of a 35 percent tariff levied against products like the iPhone manufactured overseas, is presumed by the President Elect to give companies a significant economic incentive to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.\n\n\"Although TSMC is very clear that it would be much more expensive to make chips outside of Taiwan, it's inevitable for the world's largest contract chipmaker to take 'Made in the U.S.' into consideration,\" said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Li. \"The alternative is that it would lose Apple orders without moving to America.\"\n\nApple's stance on the matter \n\n\"To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an Dec. 2015 interview about a possible shift. \"Even if Trump imposes a 45% tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the U.S.\"\n\nA 35 percent cost increase, regardless if induced by labor and material shipping costs, or a tariff would likely passed on to consumers, making a $649 base-model iPhone retail for around $876.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Who’s afraid of F.A.N.G. ? asks Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray this morning, reiterating his Overweight rating on shares of Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), and Facebook ( FB ), in the wake of several days of declines last week on the heels of Donald Trump ’s upset victory in the U.S. Presidential election a week ago.\nThe fall, he believes, is “a rare opportunity to buy fear in Mega-Cap Internet.”\nMunster glosses over concerns about Trump during the election, conceding tech’s “leaders are the closest to the core issues faced in tech and their view should not be ignored.”\n“Having said that, Trump’s presidency is likely to be markedly different than the positioning used during his campaign,” he argues. “The industry and financial markets have reacted by intensely analyzing a handful of Trump’s scrambled snippets used during his campaign,” however,\nStepping back, it is our opinion that Trump will not roll back net neutrality, neglect to alter the status of H1-B immigration caps, and will not encourage crucial science and technology education. We believe the tech industry is in more control of its own destiny than Donald Trump and will work past these issues, partially offsetting this temporary headwind. \nMoreover, the stock’s are a great value, with or without a tax holdiay on overseas cash:\nAmazon,Alphabet,Facebook, and Netflix have clear, long-term tailwinds for revenue and earnings growth; in our opinion, on long-term valuation frameworks each looks attractively priced. Moreover, as investors roll their focus to 2018 estimates for their valuation frameworks these companies look remarkably attractive relative to broader tech and the market. There have been attractive opportunities to buy the tech mega-caps in the past (i.e. AMZN during its 2014 “investment” cycle, early 2016 as tech stocks reacted disproportionately to market fears) – we believe this is one of those opportunities and that long-term investors should use this pullback as an opportunity to buy long-term secular winners at discounted valuations. \nThe stocks today are mostly up, with the exception of Apple:\nApple is down 80 cents, or 0.7%, at $109.19; Amazon is up $5.32, or 0.7%, at $751.81; Alphabet is up $3.25, or 0.4%, at $783.23; Facebook is up 4 cents at $116.38; Netflix is up 21 cents, at $115.40.",

      "text": "For the past five years, the smartphone market has been dominated by two names : Samsung, and Apple. It’s hard to overstate just how popular the Galaxy and iPhone products have been.\nToday, those two remain at the top. But there are some very apparent cracks in the foundation. iPhone sales are on the decline , and Apple appears to be banking on an overhauled 2017 model to pick up the slack. Samsung, meanwhile, is just coming off one of the biggest disasters in the history of consumer tech, and is banking on next year’s presumed Galaxy S8 to fly where this year’s Galaxy Note 7 crash and burned.\nAnd as this chart from Statista shows, a handful of Chinese companies are starting to gain ground. According to recent data from research firm Gartner , Huawei, Oppo, and BBK Communication Equipment (which sells phones through the brands Vivo and OnePlus ) all made significant gains this past quarter, continuing a recent trend. Despite having little foothold in the US, Huawei is now within shouting distance of Apple.\nAs always, there are caveats. For one, while market share is good, it doesn’t equal success: Apple still takes the vast majority of the smartphone industry’s profits, because it doesn’t sell phones for cheap. And with a Trump administration on the horizon, any so-called “trade war” with China would likely kill those brands’ chances of gaining any ground in the States.\nBut as things stand now, the gap is closing.\nStatista \nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "text": "Apple iPhone With OLED Display Might Arrive In 2017, But Suppliers Reportedly Not Ready To Meet Demand 17 November 2016, 1:40 pm EST By Anu Passary Tech Times A new report affirms that the impending iPhone - set to debut in 2017 - will have an OLED screen. However, suppliers may not be able to meet the demand due to manufacturing constraints. ( Carl Court | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nApple has been rumored to have dropped the LCD screen in favor of an OLED one for its impending iPhone 8, which is slated to debut in 2017. Now, reports reaffirm the supposition of the iPhone 8 sporting an OLED screen arriving in 2017. \nAccording to a report from Bloomberg, which cites reliable sources, while Apple may be poised to unveil the 10th anniversary edition of its iPhone — said to be the iPhone 8 — in 2017, suppliers are apparently not equipped to meet the demand for the new OLED panels for the device. \n\"The trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won't have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the Cupertino, California-based company,\" revealed the publication. \nThe report also hints at the possibility of the display tech being limited to top-end models as the manufacturers of OLED panels presently lack the capability to handle the massive order volume from Apple. \nApple's rival OEMs currently deploy OLED panels on their handsets; however, these smartphones have relatively low shipping volumes when compared with the iPhone. As a result, the OEMs encounter low demand for the panels and it is only now that they are boosting their production capabilities. The problem lies in the fact that the manufacturing of OLED screens is tougher when compared with LCD. \nBasically, the major suppliers of OLED panels such as Sharp Corp., Japan Display, Samsung Display and LG Display are not equipped to manufacture the large volume of OLED panels for iPhones in 2017. The report also suggests that these limitations of manufacturing capacity may possibly spill over to 2018. \nTherefore, due to these supply constraints, whether Apple will be able to bring an iPhone 8 lineup which is all-OLED is unclear at this juncture. What Will Apple Do? \nApple is reportedly intending to bring out at least one new iPhone 8 model, which will tout the OLED panel per Bloomberg's sources. Per Ming-Chi Kuo , KGI Securities analyst, other new iPhones could possibly continue to use the LCD screens as enough OLED screens will not be available. \nSo we could likely see a new 5.5-inch OLED iPhone in addition to the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch versions, but these would have LCD screens. New Features \nSources have also let on that the impending iPhone could sport an all-glass design, an edge-to-edge display, as well as a virtual home button, reaffirming previous rumors. The OLED iPhone is expected to boast the edge-to-edge display and not the other 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models.  ",

      "title": "PSA: Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 MacBook Pro adapter doesn’t support your Mini DisplayPort displays",
      "text": "Reddit There is a bit of confusion over what displays are supported via the new MacBook Pro’s Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports. If you don’t have a display that uses a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port— like the new 4K and 5K LG displays being sold exclusively by Apple for the new MacBook Pros— then you’ll need an adapter to go from Thunderbolt 3 to whatever I/O your display has (DisplayPort, HDMI, Thunderbolt 2, etc). Something like Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter , for example. But here’s where some users have been confused and accidentally purchased the wrong adapter: Thunderbolt 2 uses the same physical connector as Mini DisplayPort, but Apple’s new Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter won’t work with DisplayPort displays. So, if you bought the new MacBook Pro and were hoping to use it with an Apple Cinema display or other Mini DisplayPort monitor like this guy , you won’t be able to do so with Apple’s official adapter. Indeed a couple of Apple support docs for the adapter ( here and here ) mention the limitation: Note that although it uses a Mini DisplayPort connector, the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn’t support connections to Mini DisplayPort displays. Also, this adapter supports only one powered Thunderbolt 2 device on a USB-C equipped Mac. The Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn’t support connections to these devices: -Apple DisplayPort display -DisplayPort devices or accessories, such as Mini DisplayPort to HDMI or Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapters -4K Mini DisplayPort displays that don’t have Thunderbolt But it’s not noted directly on the product page , which is confusing for some consumers who assumed DisplayPort compatibility and purchased without realizing. Just a snippet of the reviews on Apple’s website : So in short, if your monitor doesn’t specifically have Thunderbolt, DisplayPort aside, then Apple’s official adapter won’t work for you. There are mixed reports of people having success with other adapters on the market that offer Thunderbolt 3/USB-C to DisplayPort connections– like these ones — but since the MacBook Pros just hit the market this week, the verdict is still out on what does and doesn’t work. But accessories should soon hit the market that have been tested specifically with the new MacBook Pros. At the time of writing, Apple has yet to update its support documents that usually detail requirements for external monitors with specific Mac models. The brand new MacBook Pro plus the Apple dongle doesn't work with the Apple Cinema Display?! How can this be? pic.twitter.com/4UVqHIIEsQ \n— Brad Dwyer (@braddwyer) November 17, 2016 Guides",

      "text": "84 shares \nDespite the proud ‘designed in California’ tag on most of Apple’s products, they are generally made in China. But if a report by the Nikkei Asian Review is true, Apple might start to shift iPhone production to the US. \nThe report suggests Apple asked its manufacturer, Foxconn, to study the feasibility of assembling its devices in the US instead of China back in June. It is apparently an ongoing process, though Foxconn chairman Terry Gou is apparently not overly enthusiastic due to cost concerns. Building iPhones in the US would “more than double” the cost. \nApple also asked another iPhone supplier, Pegatron, but that company flat out denied due to similar cost concerns. \nIt’s not just a simple matter of the difference in wages between countries. As MacRumors points out, Tim Cook has previously implied China simply has a greater command on mass manufacturing: \nChina put an enormous focus on manufacturing. In what we would call, you and I would call vocational kind of skills. The US, over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields. \nThe issue is of particular relevance due to Donald Trump’s numerous comments saying he’d push for Apple to build its devices in the US. Now that he is president-elect, he’ll have more power to do so. ",

      "text": "For the past five years, the smartphone market has been dominated by two names : Samsung, and Apple. It’s hard to overstate just how popular the Galaxy and iPhone products have been.\nToday, those two remain at the top. But there are some very apparent cracks in the foundation. iPhone sales are on the decline , and Apple appears to be banking on an overhauled 2017 model to pick up the slack. Samsung, meanwhile, is just coming off one of the biggest disasters in the history of consumer tech, and is banking on next year’s presumed Galaxy S8 to fly where this year’s Galaxy Note 7 crash and burned.\nAnd as this chart from Statista shows, a handful of Chinese companies are starting to gain ground. According to recent data from research firm Gartner , Huawei, Oppo, and BBK Communication Equipment (which sells phones through the brands Vivo and OnePlus ) all made significant gains this past quarter, continuing a recent trend. Despite having little foothold in the US, Huawei is now within shouting distance of Apple.\nAs always, there are caveats. For one, while market share is good, it doesn’t equal success: Apple still takes the vast majority of the smartphone industry’s profits, because it doesn’t sell phones for cheap. And with a Trump administration on the horizon, any so-called “trade war” with China would likely kill those brands’ chances of gaining any ground in the States.\nBut as things stand now, the gap is closing.\n(Statista) \n\nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n\nMore From Business Insider \nThe 20 best smartphones in the world \n6 iMessage apps everyone should be using \nThe world’s top Apple analyst thinks there will be three iPhones in 2017",

      "text": "  15 minutes ago \nSony has been working hard to expand availability of its PlayStation Vue streaming TV service lately. After bringing it to Android TV last month , it also made its way to PC and Mac via the web a couple of weeks ago . \nToday, Sony announced that PlayStation Vue has launched on Apple TV, \"one of the most highly requested devices\", according to the company. \nPlayStation Vue is supported on the fourth-generation Apple TV, and Sony says that users \"will be able to take advantage of Apple TV's Siri Remote and easy navigation with touch, while enjoying PlayStation Vue's look and feel.\" \nIf you already have a Vue account, you can link your subscription to your Apple TV and start watching shows right now. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for one - although you'll have to do so via the PS Vue website , as you won't be able to register on your Apple TV box. Plans start at $29.99; or $39.99 if you're in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco or Miami (\"cities with major live local broadcast stations\", as Sony describes them).",

      "text": "PlayStation Vue makes its Apple TV debut Sony's cord-cutting content service continues to expand. Share Save \nYou can already find PlayStation Vue, Sony's proprietary streaming service, on most every device in your living room. It's native on the Playstation 3 and 4, available on Android TV , Roku boxes, Fire TV and Stick, not to mention compatible smart TVs. You can also find it on Android and iOS devices as a mobile app, which can be streamed to Chromecasts. Today, that ecosystem grew a bit more with the announcement that Vue is now available on Apple TV as well. \nVue's UI and features like cloud DVR won't change from what you're used to but it will take advantage of Apple TV's hardware including the Siri Remote and touch navigation. You'll be able to stream live television and sports plus gain access to premium channels like HBO and CInemax, if you don't already -- you simply need to link your Vue and Apple TV accounts. Vue offers a bunch of different channel packages and a la carte options so head over to the Vue website for more details.",

      "title": "Apple Retains Far More iPhone Call Data Than You May Realize",
      "text": "Apple continuously stores customers’ call history on its iCloud servers for as long as four months, cautioned Elcomsoft, a Russian computer forensics firm, on Thursday.\nAnyone who uses an iPhone or iPad automatically transmits this private information--including phone numbers, dates, and length of calls--to Apple when iCloud is enabled, the firm said. Privacy buffs will note that Apple can provide law enforcement with the encryption keys that unlock the data because the company holds onto these data-unscrambling cryptographic secrets.\n“There is no way to hide your calls from government requests other than disabling iCloud Drive ,” wrote Vlatamir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft, in a company blog post .\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nIn addition to logging regular call history, Apple appears to be keeping records of metadata associated with FaceTime calls at least since the introduction of the iOS 8.2 version of its mobile software in March 2015, The Intercept reports .\nIt’s worth noting that FaceTime employs end-to-end encryption that protects the audio and visual content of messages sent over the service, as Apple’s security guide lays out. Elcomsoft said that its findings contradicted other statements in the iOS security guide, however.\nFor instance, Apple says that it “has no information as to whether the FaceTime call was successfully established or duration of a FaceTime call” and that “FaceTime call invitation logs are retained up to 30 days.” Elcomsoft, on the other hand, said it found that iCloud accounts do indeed retain this information.\n“Synced data contains full information including call duration and both parties,” Katalov wrote in his post. He added that “we were able to extract information going back more than 4 months ago.”\nApple also appears to retain the metadata records associated with popular communications apps that rely on Apple CallKit, the company’s voice integration tool, since its debut of iOS 10, Elcomsoft said. Among the set are Microsoft’s msft Skype, Facebook’s fb WhatsApp, and Viber.\nFor more on iPhones, watch: \nElcomsoft further noted that when someone downloads synced call logs, users are not notified, unlike when iCloud backups are downloaded. Katalov said that this “effectively allows spying upon you without you even knowing.”\nElcomsoft gained notoriety in 2014 when a hacker reportedly used the company’s software to download personal photos of celebrities from their iCloud accounts.\nApple did not immediately reply to Fortune’s request for comment. A company spokesperson provided the following statement, however, to Forbes , which first reported the news, as well as The Intercept: “ We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data.”\n“That's why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private,” the note continued. “Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.”\nHackers looking to get their hands on people’s call histories can be foiled by two-factor authentication, an essential security feature that adds an extra layer of security to online accounts, Elcomsoft said. Those looking to keep their communications logs from the eyes of prying government authorities might have more to worry about, though.\nOf course, investigators can also obtain call records from telecom providers . Chris Soghoian, chief technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Intercept that he was more worried about other aspects of iCloud’s data management.\n“The fact that iCloud backs up what would otherwise be end-to-end encrypted iMessages is far worse in my mind,” Soghoian said. “There are other ways the government can obtain [call logs]. But without the backup of iMessages, there may be no other way for them to get those messages.”\nApple, for its part, won acclaim from privacy buffs for its strong stance in a high-profile legal battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to the encrypted contents of an iPhone used by a terrorist. The company refused to write software that would allow the Feds to extract the phone’s PIN code and stored data, and it ultimately avoided a protracted legal battle when the FBI found an alternate means of entry via a third-party contractor.",

      "text": "TvOS Update: TvOS 10.1 Beta Now Available For Apple TV! [DETAILS HERE] By Ella Rozic ,   09:00 am TAG apple , Apple TV , tvOS , update , television , technology , gadget SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JUNE 13: Eddy Cue, Apple senior vice president of internet software and services, introduces the new tvOS software at an Apple event at the Worldwide Developer's Conference on June 13, 2016 in San Francisco, California. Thousands of people have shown up to hear about Apple's latest updates. (Photo : Andrew Burton/Getty Images) \nApple released its third tvOS 10.1 Beta for Apple TV. The software update allows Apple's single sign-on feature which authenticates with your cable provider to unlock compatible paid video applications. Advertisement \nIf you must know, unlike any iOS or MacOS update, Apple has not announced the tvOS update publicly. This means that the update still has to be released this fall. For now, tvOS 10.1 beta is ONLY available to developers. \nThis could mean that if you install the update on your Apple TV, you'll be experiencing some complications than the usual simple download and install. bUnlike other Apple OS, tvOS cannot back up your Apple TV. AppleTV apps can now be purchased on iPhone, iPad, PC, and Mac https://t.co/RUtlTYg3Xj pic.twitter.com/yRmKEtGZIl \n— iMore Headlines (@iMore_Headlines) November 10, 2016 \nApple suggests two ways in updating tvOS. You can do it 'over the air' which only updates the system with your applications as it is or you can update via 'USB-C' which will restore your device to its factory settings. \n'Over the air' is not literally over the air since you still have to use a USB-C cable to connect your Apple TV to your MacBook before you can install the tvOS configuration profile. Once you finish installing the profile, you can start updating your Apple TV 'over the air' to any beta versions. \nIf you prefer to start clean, use the Restore Image option. This will connect to your Mac via USB-C. This update will erase all your apps and restore to its original settings. To know more about how to install the tvOS 10.1 update, check this site . \nAccording to reports , the software update is compatible with the fourth generation Apple TV. TvOS 10.1 update is expected to launch in December which will include Apple's new TV application. TvOS 10.1 follows the previous feature-packed update in September and the bug fix update last month. \nThe single sign-on feature of the software update is made available through the Settings app under Accounts. To take advantage of this feature, you have to update your paid video apps. Apple is expected to add more service providers as it launches the feature in December. \nWe can recall that Apple just recently released the first-party tvOS app, iBooks StoryTime . It's a tvOS app with a 'Read-Aloud' feature. \nHave you updated your Apple TV with the latest tvOS update? We would appreciate your feedback. © 2016 ParentHerald.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "Tweet \n“THE car is the ultimate mobile device,” said Jeff Williams, an executive at Apple, last year. It was taken as another sign that the maker of iGadgets would be deepening its interest in the automotive sector (among other projects, it is developing an in-house smart car that is codenamed Project Titan). Now Samsung Electronics, its big rival in the smartphone world, is following. On November 14th the South Korean company said it would pay $8bn for Harman, a firm based in Stamford, Connecticut, that makes internet-connected audio, information and security systems for cars. The deal is Samsung’s largest ever, and the first big transaction for its vice-chairman and heir apparent, Lee Jae-yong, grandson of the firm’s founder. \nThough it is best known for its sound systems, Harman is one of the world’s largest supplier of smart parts for “connected cars” that help owners to drive by linking to the internet and to chip-enabled devices. It made $7bn in revenue in the year to September, two-thirds or so of it from the car sector, and has over three times that in new orders. Its products are the first step towards autonomous vehicles. Over 30m cars use Harman’s audio and other kit, in offerings from real-time traffic reports to augmented-reality alerts on braking distances. By 2022 revenue from this “connectivity” will rise to $155bn from $45bn now, according to Strategy&, a consultancy. \nThe deal thus gives Samsung a firm foothold in the futuristic end of the automotive market. It had already edged into the sector with investments in Vinli and nuTonomy, two startups that make software for connected cars. Last year it set up a team to work on special parts for autonomous ones. Samsung SDI, a battery-making affiliate, already supplies lithium-ion batteries that power electric cars. \nHarman’s software skills and relationships with 30-odd global car brands opens doors for Samsung, says Kim Kyoung-you of the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade. It will be hoping to build a combined offering, of hardware parts and software know-how, that it will be able sell directly to automakers. \nBut it joins some technology rivals that are already moving fast in an area where Samsung’s record is minimal. In the late 1990s Samsung Motors, a foray into carmaking, went bust (Renault of France bought it). Google has been testing self-driving cars since 2009. As well as Project Titan, Apple has CarPlay, a connected-car app that it started selling in 2013. Xiaomi, a Chinese smartphone maker that is a direct rival of Samsung, filed nine patents on internet-connected cars last year. \nFor a firm that has resisted big acquisitions, the scale of the deal with Harman suggests Samsung is counting on it for its next growth spurt. The company’s smartphone division, the crown jewel of its empire, is suffering: last month it killed a new line of Galaxy Note phones after dozens exploded due to faulty batteries, incurring billions of dollars in losses. Under Mr Lee’s leadership, Samsung has been using part of its cash pile (around $70bn) to do overseas deals (though none as big as this one). \nWhether his tenure at the firm is seen as a success will largely depend on the outcome of this week’s deal. The car business may prove difficult to navigate once more. It is unclear which route to wholly connected vehicles the industry will take. Car firms may develop the technology alone (Ford, for example, has made purchases that suggest it is going down this road), in partnership with tech titans such as Google, or, as Samsung and Harman hope, they may buy it off-the-shelf. Mastery of one sort of mobile technology does not ensure success in others.",

In addition to providing access to viewing PlayStation Vue content, the app also includes unique features such as cloud DVR capabilities and simultaneous streaming, while maintaining the standard look and feel of the PlayStation Vue service with Siri Remote support. Existing PlayStation Vue users can simply download the app onto their Apple TV, link their subscription and start streaming right away, while new users can sign up for a plan through the PlayStation Vue website (an in-app purchase option does not appear to be available).",

      "title": "iOS 10 Passcode Bypass Can Access Photos, Contacts",
      "text": "by Chris Brook November 17, 2016 , 2:38 pm \nA vulnerability in Apple’s iOS versions 8, 9, and 10 could allow an attacker to access photos and contacts on a locked iPhone, according to two sources that posted videos showing how the password bypass works. According to both sources, the vulnerability also impacts the most recent version of iOS 10.2 beta 3. \nThe loophole involves tricking Siri and Apple’s accessibility feature in iOS called VoiceOver to sidestep the device’s passcode. \nOwners of two different YouTube channels that specialize in Apple jailbreak news, tutorials, and reviews, iDeviceHelp and EverythingApplePro, disclosed the bug in videos posted this week. \nLike most iPhone passcode bypasses, the process is a little far flung, but appears to work, provided the attacker has physical access to a device that has Siri enabled. \n“It doesn’t matter if you have [iOS’ fingerprint recognition feature] Touch ID, a six code, or four code passcode, it works on all of them,” Filip, who runs the channel EverythingApplePro says of the bypass, in his video. \nTo carry out the bypass, an attacker would also either need the phone number of the device or have to wait until someone calls it. In most instances, assuming a user has linked their phone number with their phone’s ‘contact’ information, asking Siri “Who am I?” will display the number. \n\nAccording to the two videos, a user could follow a series of seven steps to bypass the passcode: \nStep 1: Call phone number of device. Step 2: Device shows message icon – click ‘Message’ and then ‘Custom’ which takes you to the ‘New Message’ screen. Step 3: Long press Siri button, say “Turn on Voice Over.” Step 4: Go back to the message screen, double tap bar where the caller’s name is usually entered. Hold, immediately click the keyboard. Repeat until a slide-in effect on the iPhone’s screen above the keyboard appears. Step 5: Long press Siri to “Turn off VoiceOver,” return to messages and type the first letter of a caller’s name in top bar, tap (information) icon next to it, and create a new contact. Step 6: Select ‘add photo’ and ‘choose photo’. Attacker granted ability to view victim’s photo gallery, despite the iPhone being in a locked state. Step 7: Select a contact on the iPhone, granted ability to view previous conversations. \nTo fix the issue, at least in the short term, users can always disable Siri on their lock screen by going to Settings -> Touch ID & Passcode -> Disable Siri on the Lockscreen. \nIt’s unclear when or if Apple will fix the issue, which reportedly also affects iPads. The company did not immediately return a request for comment on Thursday. Miguel Alvarado, who runs iDeviceHelp, suggested Wednesday however that Apple may fix the issue for 4S users in a future update, iOS 9.3.6: iOS 9.3.6 should be out in a week or 2 for iPhone 4s, or at least I think so. \n— iDevicehelpus (@iDeviceHelpus) November 16, 2016 \niPhone passcode bypasses have become a common occurrence over the last few years and seem to pop up every couple of iOS releases. In March, researchers disclosed how an attacker could use Siri to bypass an iPhone’s passcode to access native iOS apps like Clock and Event Calendar. That vulnerability affected iOS 9.0, 9.1 and 9.2.1. \nAnother bypass surfaced in April that affected iOS 9.3.1. That bypass could have allowed an attacker to bypass Siri to search Twitter and in turn gain access to photos and contacts on a device. About Chris Brook",

      "text": "News Apple will cut App Store fees for video streaming apps by half Apple is reportedly reducing the fee from 30 percent to 15 percent, so that video partners will want to integrate into its forthcoming TV app. Staff Writer, Macworld | Nov 17, 2016 11:55 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Why does the iOS 10 lock screen reveal so much? \nCupertino is ready to give a big tax break to video services that are sold via the App Store. \nApple is lowering the cut it takes from selling video streaming subscriptions down from 30 percent to 15 percent, according to Bloomberg . This is Apple’s latest move to try to get video partners for the launch of its new TV app for discovering content on the Apple TV. Previously, Apple has hit major roadblocks while negotiating with networks over the price of offering a mini-bundled TV package . \nAccording to Bloomberg, some video partners already pay the 15 percent cut, but now Apple is extending the rate to all video services on the App Store as long as they’re integrated into the TV app. In addition, non-video subscription services could see the 15 percent reduced fee after the customer has completed paying a yearlong subscription. The report did not specify whether music streaming services like Spotify, Tidal, and Google Play Music will qualify for the reduced fee. \nApple’s 30-percent commission has been criticized as anti-competitive by Spotify , especially after the launch of Apple Music. Most streaming services sold via the App Store have passed on Apple’s 30-percent cut to consumers. This means that a typical $9.99 subscription will cost $12.99 if you subscribe in-app. Other services, like Spotify, has turned off in-app subscriptions altogether. \nWhy this matters: The immediate impact of this is that an App Store subscription to Hulu and Netflix will be lower, but still a little bit more expensive than subscribing elsewhere. It also points to the importance of video partners to Apple’s new TV strategy. \nServices like App Store revenue and Apple Music subscriptions are a fast-growing business for Apple, after declining iPhone sales. So, the fact that Cupertino is willing to accept a lower commission (and perhaps lower revenue marks at the end of the quarter) to appease video partners means that Apple is betting on its TV app to kickstart a service that might compensate for that loss in the future.

      "text": "If you don't already know what PlayStation Vue is, it's Sony's play into the TV streaming market and goes head-to-head with Hulu. As a cord cutter, Vue has been on my radar because of its ability to stream live sports and have channels that Hulu doesn't have like Disney XD. What's interesting is that at higher tiers you can bundle in HBO ($15), Showtime ($11), Epix (previously only available with cable) into some real cost saving if you are already using those services. Today, PlayStation announced that the Vue is now available as an app on fourth-generation Apple TVs. Sony was slow to bring the service to Apple TV as it's already on PS4, PS3, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Chromecast. Press release via MacRumors: Starting today, PlayStation Vue will be supported on Apple TV (4th generation), leveraging Apple TV's latest hardware to create an innovative experience. You will be able to take advantage of Apple TV's Siri Remote and easy navigation with touch, while enjoying PlayStation Vue's sleek look and feel. PlayStation Vue brings popular programming to Apple TV, from live sports networks like ESPN and NFL Network, to premium channels like AMC, FX, HBO, and Showtime. I'm going to sign up for the free trial and see if the service is as good as I've heard it is from friends.",

      "text": "Apple Releases New 'Bulbs' MacBook Pro Ad Highlighting Touch Bar   12:29 pm PST by Juli Clover Apple today uploaded a new MacBook Pro ad to its YouTube channel , showcasing the machine's Touch Bar and comparing it to major inventions throughout time. Called \"Bulbs,\" the ad features hundreds of exploding lightbulbs alongside brief glimpses of world-changing innovations, starting with fire and running through tilling, blacksmithing, trains, flight, the telephone, the typewriter, toilet paper, the microwave, the television, the freezer, cameras, computers, robotics, and space flight before finishing with a glimpse of the new MacBook Pro. The ad ends with the lines \"Ideas push the world forward\" and \"Introducing a tool for all the ideas to come\" as a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is displayed. In line with the rest of the ad, an image of a lightbulb is briefly shown on the MacBook Pro's screen before being exploded and unexploded via a quick gesture on the Touch Bar. Introduced in October, the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began arriving in the hands of customers earlier this week and is now available for purchase in some Apple retail stores . The new MacBook Pro features the first major redesign to the MacBook Pro in four years. It includes a new Touch Bar, Skylake processors, a thinner, smaller body, a larger trackpad, a new keyboard, and more.",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple has just shared a new TV commercial to its YouTube page, called ‘Bulbs’. The ad shows a series of lightbulbs exploding around the world, ending with a tag line ‘Ideas push the world forward’ and a few short shots of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. \nThe ad highlights human inventions like fire, harvesting, woodwork, trains, transport, television, robots and space travel, finishing with a few glimpses of Apple’s newest MacBook Pro which it calls “a tool for all the ideas to come”. Watch the minute and a half spot after the jump … \nFar from a traditional Apple product ad, the ad barely features an Apple product of any kind until the very end. The video is accompanied by the well-known opera soundtrack ‘William Tell Overture’ . \nApple describes the commercial as “Ideas have always pushed the world forward. Introducing a tool for all the ideas to come. The new MacBook Pro.”. \nThe MacBook Pro with Touch Bar was met by mixed reviews from the press; read our hands-on with Apple’s latest iteration of laptops. The Touch Bar is certainly interesting development in user interface but whether it is the pinnacle of ideas on par with the lightbulb, as the ad implies, is another question entirely. Let us know what you think about Apple’s newest TV ad in the comments below. Guides ",

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 November 17, 2016, 10:31 A.M. ET Apple, Amazon: Relax, Trump Win is a Buying Opportunity, Says Piper By Tiernan Ray \nWho’s afraid of F.A.N.G. ? asks Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray this morning, reiterating his Overweight rating on shares of Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), and Facebook ( FB ), in the wake of several days of declines last week on the heels of Donald Trump ’s upset victory in the U.S. Presidential election a week ago. \nThe fall, he believes, is “a rare opportunity to buy fear in Mega-Cap Internet.” \nMunster glosses over concerns about Trump during the election, conceding tech’s “leaders are the closest to the core issues faced in tech and their view should not be ignored.” \n“Having said that, Trump’s presidency is likely to be markedly different than the positioning used during his campaign,” he argues. “The industry and financial markets have reacted by intensely analyzing a handful of Trump’s scrambled snippets used during his campaign,” however, Stepping back, it is our opinion that Trump will not roll back net neutrality, neglect to alter the status of H1-B immigration caps, and will not encourage crucial science and technology education. We believe the tech industry is in more control of its own destiny than Donald Trump and will work past these issues, partially offsetting this temporary headwind. \nMoreover, the stock’s are a great value, with or without a tax holdiay on overseas cash: Amazon,Alphabet,Facebook, and Netflix have clear, long-term tailwinds for revenue and earnings growth; in our opinion, on long-term valuation frameworks each looks attractively priced. Moreover, as investors roll their focus to 2018 estimates for their valuation frameworks these companies look remarkably attractive relative to broader tech and the market. There have been attractive opportunities to buy the tech mega-caps in the past (i.e. AMZN during its 2014 “investment” cycle, early 2016 as tech stocks reacted disproportionately to market fears) – we believe this is one of those opportunities and that long-term investors should use this pullback as an opportunity to buy long-term secular winners at discounted valuations. \nThe stocks today are mostly up, with the exception of Apple: \nApple is down 80 cents, or 0.7%, at $109.19; Amazon is up $5.32, or 0.7%, at $751.81; Alphabet is up $3.25, or 0.4%, at $783.23; Facebook is up 4 cents at $116.38; Netflix is up 21 cents, at $115.40.",

Apple explores possibility of manufacturing iPhones in the United States Network World | Nov 17, 2016 12:21 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Apple Cool Yule Tools- Hot Picks \nWell before Donald Trump became the Republican nominee for President, the current President-elect didn't mince words when it came to American companies relying upon factories in China for manufacturing purposes. \nSpeaking to a crowd at Liberty University last January, Trump said that if were to become President, he would take steps to ensure that Apple \"builds their damn computers in this country.\" More broadly, Trump added that he'd like to see Apple manufacture all of their devices in the United States instead of outsourcing said duties to Asian-based partners like Foxconn. \nWhile Trump's promise will likely go unfulfilled, Apple reportedly isn't taking any chances. In an apparent effort to remain prepared for any type of new policy Trump might dream up, Apple has reportedly asked both Foxconn and Pegatron about the feasibility of \"moving iPhone production\" to the United States. \nNikkei reports : \nAnother source said that while Foxconn had been working on the request from Apple Inc., its biggest customer that accounts for more than 50% of its sales, Chairman Terry Gou had been less enthusiastic due to an inevitable rise in production costs. \n\"Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,\" the source said. \nPegatron, meanwhile, is also cold to the idea, with a source reportedly claiming that Pegatron nipped the idea in the bud due to economic considerations. \nBroadly speaking, the likelihood of Apple moving iPhone production to the United States appears to be slim to none. Apple's manufacturing partners in China operate massive factories that are expressly designed for consumer electronics production at scale. Additionally, these factories often employ thousands of workers with specialized skills that simply can't be found amongst the U.S. workforce.

      "text": "Apple today uploaded a new MacBook Pro ad to its YouTube channel, showcasing the machine's Touch Bar and comparing it to major inventions throughout time.\n\nCalled \"Bulbs,\" the ad features hundreds of exploding lightbulbs alongside brief glimpses of world-changing innovations, starting with fire and running through tilling, blacksmithing, trains, flight, the telephone, the typewriter, toilet paper, the microwave, the television, the freezer, cameras, computers, robotics, and space flight before finishing with a glimpse of the new MacBook Pro.\n\nThe ad ends with the lines \"Ideas push the world forward\" and \"Introducing a tool for all the ideas to come\" as a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is displayed. In line with the rest of the ad, an image of a lightbulb is briefly shown on the MacBook Pro's screen before being exploded and unexploded via a quick gesture on the Touch Bar.\n\nIntroduced in October, the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began arriving in the hands of customers earlier this week and is now available for purchase in some Apple retail stores.\n\nThe new MacBook Pro features the first major redesign to the MacBook Pro in four years. It includes a new Touch Bar, Skylake processors, a thinner, smaller body, a larger trackpad, a new keyboard, and more.Related Roundup: MacBook Pro\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Pro (Buy Now)\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "title": "Apple Says it Syncs Call Logs on iCloud As a 'Convenience to Customers' Amid Security Concerns",
      "text": "Earlier today, reports surfaced on The Intercept and Forbes claiming Apple \"secretly\" syncs Phone and FaceTime call history logs on iCloud, complete with phone numbers, dates and times, and duration. The info comes from Russian software firm Elcomsoft, which said the call history logs are stored for up to four months.\nLikewise, on iOS 10, Elcomsoft said incoming missed calls that are made through third-party VoIP apps using Apple's CallKit framework, such as Skype, WhatsApp , and Viber, also get synced to iCloud. The call logs have been collected since at least iOS 8.2, released in March 2015, so long as a user has iCloud enabled.\n\nElcomsoft said the call logs are automatically synced, even if backups are turned off, with no way to opt out beyond disabling iCloud entirely.\n\n“You can only disable uploading/syncing notes, contacts, calendars and web history, but the calls are always there,” said Vladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft. \"One way call logs will disappear from the cloud, is if a user deletes a particular call record from the log on their device; then it will also get deleted from their iCloud account during the next automatic synchronization.\n\nGiven that Apple possesses the encryption keys to unlock an iCloud account for now, U.S. law enforcement agencies can obtain direct access to the logs with a court order. Worse, The Intercept claims the information could be exposed to hackers and anyone else who might be able to obtain a user's iCloud credentials.\n\nIn some cases, hackers could access an iCloud account even without account credentials, such as by using Elcomsoft's Phone Breaker software. The tool is being updated today with the ability to extract call histories from iCloud with only an authentication token for an account from the accountholder's computer.\n\nHowever, the entire narrative is largely overblown. In a 63-page white paper about iOS security , Apple clearly defines which information it collects for iCloud backups, emphasis our own. Likewise, in its Legal Process Guidelines, Apple notes FaceTime call invitation logs can be stored for up to 30 days.\n\nHere’s what iCloud backs up:\n\n• Information about purchased music, movies, TV shows, apps, and books, but not\nthe purchased content itself\n• Photos and videos in Camera Roll\n• Contacts, calendar events, reminders, and notes\n• Device settings\n• App data\n• PDFs and books added to iBooks but not purchased\n• *Call history*\n• Home screen and app organization\n• iMessage, text (SMS), and MMS messages\n• Ringtones\n• HomeKit data\n• HealthKit data\n• Visual Voicemail \n\nFurther, in a statement today, Apple said the call history syncing is intentional.\n\n“We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” an Apple spokesperson said in an email. \"Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.”\n\nSecurity researcher Jonathan Zdziarski told The Intercept he \"doesn't think Apple is doing anything nefarious in syncing the call logs,\" which are very clearly stored for the purposes of Continuity and being able to access your call history across Apple devices, even after restoring from a backup.\n\nNevertheless, Zdziarski emphasized the need for Apple to be clear to users about the data being collected and stored on iCloud. As noted by The Intercept, Apple does not indicate call logs are synced even with iCloud Backup disabled, while FaceTime call logs appear to be stored longer than Apple's claim of up to 30 days.\n\niCloud users concerned about their accounts being compromised should set a strong password and enable two-step verification.Tag: security\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Since the launch of version 1.8 on October 17, 2016, the app has boasted an average user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 stars and has consistently ranked among the Top 50 Paid Health and Fitness Apps in the US iTunes App Store. \nIrvine, California (PRWEB) November 17, 2016 \nAutomated detection of sleep, a feature previously only available to purchasers of dedicated health and fitness trackers such as Fitbit or Jawbone, is now available to Apple Watch owners. \nSleep Watch by Bodymatter is the first and only sleep monitoring app for Apple Watch that lets users collect their sleep statistics without the need to open apps at bedtime or upon rising. The app automatically detects and monitors estimated sleep time, awake time, sleeping heart rate and sleep quality, but allows users to manually adjust their results to more accurately track their patterns. \nSince the launch of Sleep Watch version 1.8 on October 17, 2016, the app has boasted an average user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 stars and has consistently ranked among the Top 50 Paid Health and Fitness Apps in the US iTunes App Store. Reception from Apple Watch owners continues to be extremely positive: \n“...I purchased the app and have been using nightly for about 10 days. This is one app that really takes advantage of the Watch and the first indispensable app I've found.” jsamuels, MacRumors.com Forum, Nov 5, 2016 \n“I was looking for sleep tracking as close to the automatic tracking of the Fitbit as I could find and with SleepWatch my search is over. It works well and allows you to adjust the times if they are not detected correctly, can't really expect much more on that front (certainly beats having to manually start and end…)” hsafavi, App Store Review, Nov 2, 2016 \n“Auto-tracking works great with continuous app updates. Best I've used so far, well worth the $.\" Tiltasauras, App Store Review, Oct 25, 2016 \nIn numerous amounts of research prepared by many renowned institutions, the importance of sleep regularly shows to be part of a healthy lifestyle, associated with the following potential benefits: Improved mood",

      "text": "iPhones Send Call History to Apple If You've Connected Your iCloud Account iPhones Send Call History to Apple If You've Connected Your iCloud Account By 0 \nYour iPhone is sending a history of all your calls to Apple's iCloud service, Oleg Afonin, Elcomsoft researcher has revealed today. \nFor some iPhone users, this wasn't a secret. Many have figured it out on their own. This is especially true for family members that share an iCloud account on different iPhones. \nHusbands and wives , brothers and sisters have complained that their call history appears on multiple devices , making it hard to have a private life. No button to push and stop this behavior \niPhone users say they've searched for a setting that would disable syncing call logs across different iPhones, or disable call syncing in the first place. All their efforts were in vein as Apple doesn't provide such any on/off toggle. \nThe only way to avoid this behavior is for users to stop sharing the same iCloud account, or not use one in the first place. \nBesides call history, Apple also syncs to a user's iCloud account data such as photos, phone backups, contacts, notes, maps, calendars, browser history and more. The Elcomsoft researcher says that Apple is putting the privacy of their users in danger. \n\"[W]e’ve seen Apple moving more and more data into the cloud. iCloud data (backups, call logs, contacts and so on) is very loosely protected,\" he explains . There's software to retrieve call logs from iCloud accounts \nAfonin is probably the most authorized person to be speaking on this matter. His company makes Phone Breaker, a specialized software suite that can recover data from iCloud accounts. Many law enforcement agencies use Elcomsoft's software. \nWhile users can opt to include call data inside phone backups, they can't disable automatic call syncing to their iCloud account, data which Apple encrypts on their servers. \nThe problem is that if a third-party or law enforcement has access to the user's iCloud password, Elcomsoft's Phone Breaker can recover this data, despite Apple's protection measures. An iCloud authentication token extracted from the suspect’s/victim's PC is also more than enough. Users need more granular control over iCloud synced data \nIt's most likely that Apple isn't collecting this data in order to make it easier for governments to spy on users, but for QoS (Quality of Service). \nNevertheless, if Apple wants to actually provide the Q in QoS, they should provide opt-out options for each of the backed up data types. This way, users won't have to remove iCloud accounts from their phones and sync only the data they need. \nPreviously, Elcomsoft also discovered that Apple added a secondary password verification mechanism to iTunes backups that was 2,500 times weaker than the default one. Apple removed it in a later update this fall.",

      "text": "Sleep Watch by Bodymatter is the first and only sleep monitoring app for Apple Watch that lets users automatically wake up to sleep stats without having to open apps at bedtime or upon rising. Since the launch of version 1.8 on October 17, 2016, the app has boasted an average user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 stars and has consistently ranked among the Top 50 Paid Health and Fitness Apps in the US iTunes App Store.\n\nIrvine, California (PRWEB) November 17, 2016\n\nAutomated detection of sleep, a feature previously only available to purchasers of dedicated health and fitness trackers such as Fitbit or Jawbone, is now available to Apple Watch owners.\n\nSleep Watch by Bodymatter is the first and only sleep monitoring app for Apple Watch that lets users collect their sleep statistics without the need to open apps at bedtime or upon rising. The app automatically detects and monitors estimated sleep time, awake time, sleeping heart rate and sleep quality, but allows users to manually adjust their results to more accurately track their patterns.\n\nSince the launch of Sleep Watch version 1.8 on October 17, 2016, the app has boasted an average user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 stars and has consistently ranked among the Top 50 Paid Health and Fitness Apps in the US iTunes App Store. Reception from Apple Watch owners continues to be extremely positive:\n\n“...I purchased the app and have been using nightly for about 10 days. This is one app that really takes advantage of the Watch and the first indispensable app I've found.”· jsamuels, MacRumors.com Forum, Nov 5, 2016\n\n“I was looking for sleep tracking as close to the automatic tracking of the Fitbit as I could find and with SleepWatch my search is over. It works well and allows you to adjust the times if they are not detected correctly, can't really expect much more on that front (certainly beats having to manually start and end…)”· hsafavi, App Store Review, Nov 2, 2016\n\n“Auto-tracking works great with continuous app updates. Best I've used so far, well worth the $.\"· Tiltasauras, App Store Review, Oct 25, 2016\n\nIn numerous amounts of research prepared by many renowned institutions, the importance of sleep regularly shows to be part of a healthy lifestyle, associated with the following potential benefits:· Improved mood\n· Better immune strength\n· Better cardiovascular health\n· Lower stress levels\n· Improved memory\n· Maintenance of a healthy weight or improved weight loss efforts\n· Elevated energy levels during the day\n· Increased creativity\n\nSleep Watch leverages the state-of-the-art motion and pulse sensors built into the Apple Watch to estimate when users are asleep by continually monitoring the heart rate and motion data provided by the Watch. Once set up, the app requires virtually no user intervention to detect sleep, aside from simply wearing the Watch to bed. Sleep Watch can also send daily sleep briefing notifications to users upon waking up in the morning. Sleep Watch also lets users automatically sync detected sleep times into the Apple Health app.\n\n“We believe that digital health applications and wearables have a bright future in helping users achieve positive health outcomes. We chose to focus on sleep for a first application as it plays a critical role in our overall health including our cardiovascular health. We are thrilled that the feedback from our users has been so positive and we look forward to continuing to improve the functionality of the application and to enhancing the performance of our sleep algorithms.” said Aaron Giroux, Executive Chairman of Bodymatter, Inc., creator of Sleep Watch.\n\nSleep Watch for Apple Watch and iPhone is $4.99 and available now to download in the App Store at https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1138066420.\n\nIf you are a journalist and would like to review the app, please contact press(at)bodymatter(dot)io.

Executive Editor, Macworld | Nov 17, 2016 12:45 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Apple Why does the iOS 10 lock screen reveal so much? \nThe Apple store isn’t just for buying cables and adapters, visiting the Genius Bar, or checking your email on the iPads while your friend or loved one buys cables or adapters. Apple does a lot of educational programs for customers of all ages, and as of Thursday, registration is open for the popular Hour of Code workshops . \nThese will take place the week of December 5, running from that Monday through Sunday, December 11, at all 487 Apple stores worldwide (except the “company store” at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino). You can sign up for the free workshops by finding a nearby store here , and then picking a free time, and signing in with an Apple ID to complete the registration. \nHour of Code is for kids and parents who have used the iPad before but don’t have coding experience. They’ll learn the basics using Code.org’s programming tutorials, and the Swift Playgrounds app for iPad will be used in some locations as well. Apple \nSwift Playgrounds is getting a Learn to Code 3 lesson pack and Hour of Code challenge. \nSwift Playgrounds is even getting a new Hour of Code challenge, which means that classrooms who are using the free Swift Playgrounds app on school iPads can get in on Hour of Code, as well as anyone who can’t make it to an Apple Store for one of the live workshops. \n“Coding is just like any language, the earlier you’re exposed the more successful you’ll be,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, in a press statement . “Whether at an Apple Store, in a classroom or at home with an iPad, Swift Playgrounds brings real coding concepts to life and empowers the next generation with the skills they need to express their creativity.” Apple \nKids get a certificate after participating in Hour of Code at the Apple Store. \nAside from the Hour of Code challenge, Swift Playgrounds is being updated with a new Learn to Code 3 set of lessons (building on the two sets already in the app), as well as a companion teacher guide. Apple is supporting teachers who want to bring Hour of Code into their classrooms with a facilitator guide ( PDF ) that has everything you need to host a successful event. \nFor more details on Hour of Code , and the rest of the classes and workshops offered at the Apple store, visit apple.com/retail .

      "text": "– A + PlayStation Vue subscription streaming service launches on Apple TV App Store By AppleInsider Staff \nThursday, November 17, 2016, 12:11 pm PT (03:11 pm ET) \nFollowing availability on iOS and the PlayStation 4 game console, Sony on Thursday expanded its PlayStation Vue cable cutting service to the Apple TV.\n\n\n\n\nThe free PlayStation Vue app gives users access to the subscription service on their fourth-generation Apple TV. It includes live TV programming, cloud DVR, simultaneous streaming, and no long-term contact commitments.\n\nNetworks included in the service are ESPN, AMC, FX, HBO, Showtime, and NFL Network. Plans start at $29.99 or $39.99 in select cities.\n\nPlayStation Vue has offered live TV capabilities on Apple's iPad since mid-2015 . While it initially launched in a handful of major U.S. cities, availability has since expanded to include more areas.\n\nUsers can check access and channel lineups at the service's official website , where a free trial is also offered.\n\nRumors have suggested Apple has sought to offer a similar service, but the company's plans are said to have been internally delayed due to roadblocks in negotiations with content owners.\n\nApple will, however, launch a new unified television experience next month with a new \"TV\" app for tvOS and iOS. It will feature a single sign-on for existing cable providers to stream content, and also make it easy to find where programs are available across a variety of apps and services.",

      "text": "Here's a Look Inside Apple's New $200 Photo Book Thursday November 17, 2016 1:28 pm PST by Juli Clover Apple this week unveiled its latest product , a hardbound photo book that showcases 20 years of Apple products, highlighting every Mac, iPhone, iPod, and iPad released between 1998 and 2015. Because it's positioned as an art piece, Apple's \"Designed by Apple in California\" book costs a jaw dropping $200 to $300 depending on size, so we thought we'd take a look inside to see just what you're getting for that price tag. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Aside from a dedication page dedicating the book to former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, a foreword by Apple design chief Jony Ive, and an insert with product descriptions, the book is text-free, filled with large, high-quality images of Apple products. There are 450 images in total, with multiple photographs of each item to highlight its design process. It starts with the 1998 iMac , one of the first products Ive designed at Apple, and ends with the 2015 Apple Pencil . According to Apple, it took eight years to design the linen-bound hardcover book, which features specially milled, custom-dyed paper with \"gilded matte silver edges,\" and low-ghost ink. As can be seen in the video, the book is of the highest quality with gorgeous photographs, but its price limits its appeal to the general public. \"Designed by Apple in California\" can only be purchased from the online Apple Store and at select Apple retail locations around the world. It's priced at $199 for a 10.2x12.8 inch version, and $299 for a 13x16.3 inch version.",
