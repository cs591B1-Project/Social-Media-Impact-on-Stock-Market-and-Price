      "text": "Search ‘Westworld’ Could Be Another ‘Game of Thrones’-Type Hit, Time Warner Boss Says \nIn UBS talk, Jeff Bewkes also says pending merger with AT&T would be “good for both companies” Scott Collins   10:42 AM TheWrap \n“Westworld” already ranks among HBO’s biggest-ever hits, possibly even giving “Game of Thrones” a run for its money, according to Time Warner chief Jeff Bewkes. \n“Westworld” is “a big success,” Bewkes said Tuesday at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York. \nBewkes alluded to Sunday’s Season 1 finale of the sci-fi series about an amusement park populated with robots, saying the show “actually just finished, and had the biggest first year of any series, including ‘Game of Thrones.'” Also Read: Jeff Bewkes on Time Warner's Future Under AT&T: 'I'm Not Going Anywhere' \nSunday’s 90-minute closer for “Westworld” drew 2.2 million total viewers for the live telecast on the linear premium cable network, although live viewing in an on-demand world is a small piece of the puzzle. HBO estimates that across all platforms, “Westworld” is averaging 12 million total viewers. \n“Westworld” still has a ways to go before matching “GoT,” which across all platforms and showings has reached 23 million total viewers. But with “GoT” set to end after its eighth season — and with Netflix and Amazon pouring millions of dollars into program development — it’s become crucial for HBO, a Time Warner unit, to find its next tentpole drama series. \nMeanwhile, Bewkes was upbeat about the pending merger between Time Warner and AT&T, which he predicted would close by the end of 2017, “if not sooner.” Also Read: AT&T-Time Warner Deal: Jeff Bewkes Stays For Now, Peter Chernin Not Expected to Replace Him \nBewkes turned aside skepticism from some critics that the combination would bring more benefits for AT&T than for his company. \n“I think it’s good for both companies, and I’m not sure it’s that easy to predict whether it would be more for one or another,” he said. \nThe move would ultimately benefit consumers, Bewkes said, arguing that it would allow them to receive more of the content Time Warner makes under its various brands — including HBO and CNN — over more devices. \n“What we wanted, and we’ve been saying this for a long time, is we’ve been working on a lot of things to make the explosion and the number of and the increase in quality of TV programming relevant and available in all the different ways that consumers are wanting to get to this stuff,” Bewkes added. 14 Billion-Dollar Acquisitions Before AT&T-Time Warner (Photos) \nThink $85 billion is a lot of cash? Take a tour through the lurid amounts of money dropped on American media and content machines over the years. \n1999: Disney Buys ABC The alliance is such a potent brand that it's hard to imagine them as solo entities, but the $19.5 billion sale gave the Disney company an iconic TV brand to call its own. Handout \n1999: Clear Channel buys AMFM Inc The radio giant paid $20.6 billion for its rival AMFM, their 830 radio stations, 425,000 billboards and 19 TV stations per Forbes. Handout \n1999: Viacom Buys CBS Fifteen years ago, the media giant acquired the TV network for $34.1 billion. While the companies would split in 2006, always remember -- history repeats itself . Handout \n2000: Time Warner and AOL Merge It's often referred to as one of the most disastrous mergers in history. The $186.2 billion price tag seemed visionary at the time, but quickly devolved into a corporate culture way... and the of the dot-com collapse. Handout \n2006: Disney Buys Pixar In the first of a series of key moves from Disney CEO Bob Iger -- ones that would ensure long-term health and eventually see the company take record-breaking market share -- Steve Jobs was convinced to entrust the animation studio to them for a reported $7.4 billion. Handout \n2009: Disney Buys Marvel Iger's $4 billion purchase of the comic book studio changed the industry, secured Robert Downey Jr. as the highest paid actor in Hollywood and made a new constellation of stars and film franchises. Handout \n2012: Disney Buys Lucasfilm Bob Iger's hat trick was completed with a major coup in landing the \"Star Wars\" universe for $4 billion, which resulted in the No. 3 all-time top grossing film, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" YouTube \n2013: Comcast Buys Remaining Stake in NBC After purchasing a majority stake in 2011 for $30 billion, Comcast paid another $16.7 billion to wholly own the TV brand, film studio Universal and its California and Florida theme parks. Handout \n2013: Yahoo Buys Tumblr It's a relatively small price for a media acquisition, but spend-happy Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer raised a lot of eyebrows by paying $1 billion for the blogging platform Tumblr. Handout \n2014: Facebook Buys WhatApp While this is a straight-up tech acquisition, it's interesting to note that Facebook paid a staggering $22 billion for the European-based WhatsApp, a mobile application that lets users text for free over WiFi, to bolster their own messaging app. The company has repeatedly said it doesn't care to acquire content engines, but this signals a strong urge to level competition if they ever change their minds. Handout \n2015: Activision Blizzard Buys King Mobile The video game company literally spent $5.9 billion on fun and games. Mobile game company King counts the most successful app of all time, Candy Crush, and legacy social games like Bubble Witch in its stable. Now Activision gets to develop properties like a just-sold CBS game show based on Candy Crush. Handout \n2016: Comcast Buys Dreamworks After years of trying to offload his baby, Jeffrey Katzenberg fetched $3.8 billion for DWA and its respective franchises, like \"Kung Fu Panda.\" Handout \n2015: Dalian Wanda Buys Legendary Entertainment A production company fetching $3.5 billion in a sale was not just jaw-dropping, it was an airhorn that the Chinese invasion into Hollywood had begun . It's also currently the benchmark for what many call inflated valuation... but Wanda's pockets are as deep as their patience is long. Handout \n2016: Verizon Buys Yahoo In a major deal that’s yet to formally close , Verizon is ponying up $4.83 billion for Yahoo’s core business, which includes advertising, content, search and mobile division. Handout Next Slide 1 of 15 \nFrom Disney-ABC to Wanda and Legendary, a look back at major media deals with staggering price tags \nThink $85 billion is a lot of cash?

      "text": "Time Warner CEO: ‘Real Threat to the First Amendment’ Came from Dems, Not Trump by Josh Feldman | 2:07   \nThe chairman and CEO of Time Warner thinks all the talk about Donald Trump being a threat to the First Amendment is overblown. \nIn fact, according to Variety , not only did he completely dismiss the idea out of hand at a conference today, but he actually said that’s more an issue with the Democrats: \n“I think the threat to the First Amendment came more from the Democratic side,” said Bewkes, who argued that the reforms would “restrain multiple voices.” He suggested that the press didn’t cover that threat because they “lean” to left side of the political spectrum. “I think they viewed it charitably as something cleaning up money in politics,” said Bewkes. \nAnd as TheWrap notes in its report , Bewkes was specifically talking about Democrats’ views on campaign finance reform and opposition to Citizens United, saying the party “had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.” \nMost of the talk about politicians regulating free speech has been, of course, around Trump in the past year, given his comments about the press and loosening libel laws. \n[ image via screengrab ]",

      "title": "Time Warner CEO says Bill Simmons' HBO show was not canceled because of ratings and that he is now working on something better",
      "text": "HBO \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes says that Bill Simmons' short-lived HBO show did not flop and was not canceled because of poor ratings. Rather, HBO decided \"Any Given Wednesday,\" was not the best use of his talents and he is now working on something better.\nSpeaking with Business Insider's Henry Blodget on Tuesday, Bewkes was asked why Simmons' debut effort at HBO flopped. Bewkes disputed that assertion and explained that ratings for individual shows mean less for HBO than other networks because they are not relying on ad sales during specific time slots.  \n\"It didn't flop,\" Bewkes said. \"Remember, we don't care what the ratings are ... I will say to you, I did, that the 'Westworld' season was even bigger than 'The Game of Thrones,' but I also said, we don't make money out of that. That doesn't matter.\" \nSimmons' show averaged approximately 200,000 viewers during its run, with its audience size almost completely dependent on the popularity of the movie that aired in the time slot before. While it is a bit of an apples and oranges comparison, to put that into perspective, some of ESPN's more popular daily talk shows have audience sizes anywhere from 300,000-400,000 (for \"First Take\" on ESPN2) to 500,000-800,000 (for \"Pardon the Interruption,\" \"Around the Horn,\" and \"Highly Questionable\" on ESPN). \nBewkes went on to explain that at HBO, ratings for individual shows are less important than having an eclectic mix of voices that will appeal to a broad audience. In fact, he says HBO green-lights some shows knowing that they will not do well with ratings. Rather, it is more important that the audience have more choices. \n\"There are different shows that very few people watch, that we green-light knowing very few people are going to watch,\" Bewkes said. \"We want distinctive voices on the network so that whatever your interest is, you've got a few things on there that appeal to you.\" \nSo then why was Simmons' show cancelled? It sounds like they could have easily decided to keep rolling with \"Any Given Wednesday,\" but instead just decided that they could come up with a better way to take advantage of Simmons' talents. \n\"We could easily do a show with Bill, that we could tailor, he could do it, to make it kind of interesting every week and all of that,\" Bewkes said. \"As we talked to him about his vision, we're thinking we can do some other things ...  he's working on other things we think will be better and will be fairly noticeable, [better] than that show. We just thought that's not the best place to put his attention.\" \nBewkes would not say what those projects are. While most speculation is that the next project will be similar to the \"30 for 30\" documentaries Simmons worked on at ESPN, maybe his time in front of the camera at HBO is not done. \nNOW WATCH: Here's the diet and workout routine LeBron James uses to stay in insane shape \n",

      "title": "Bewkes: ‘We’re Here to Help’",
      "text": "Time Warner chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes said AT&T’s pending $108.7 billion merger to buy his company will drive advanced advertising for every network, not just his own. \n\nAt the UBS Media and Entertainment conference in New York, Bewkes said that there is a big opportunity in advanced advertising on the VOD platform. And he said he hopes that the AT&T merger, which counts targeted advertising as a big reason for the pairing, will help drive acceptance. \n\n“If you’re talking about VOD ads, it’s going to evolve differently,” Bewkes said. “In terms of load it probably should be less; it’s going to be taking the recent engagement and the tremendous loyalty it has. You need to get it targeted, you need to get it measured; it therefore can be more valuable and therefore it can be less interruptive, therefore people will watch through it. “We’ve been investing in that at Turner. We probably have the higher percentage of our ads in the more aggressive new advertising forms. We’re going to keep doing that. We hope the AT&T combination helps us with that. We hope it helps everybody. We want to foster competition in the ad business, which currently is getting fairly focused in two companies – Google and Facebook – and we think there is plenty of room for competition and therefore growth for us, so we’re going to go there. We’re here to help.” \n\nBewkes also gave a lengthy explanation as to why Time Warner still makes money on AT&T’s decision to price the HBO offering on its DirecTV Now over-the-top service at $5 per month, roughly one-third of the price other distributors charge for the service. Bewkes said that HBO still has a robust wholesale price – which he did not reveal – adding that charges to distributors vary based on the level of subscriber penetration for HBO service. So, a distributor that has 40% HBO penetration pays less than one with 20%, he said. \n\nHe added that offering HBO at a lower retail price is something Time Warner has wanted for years, but that distributors have tied other programming or services with flat price structures to the premium channel which has driven up charges. \n\n“We’ve always wanted, which is why we had to launch [HBO] Now a few years ago, to make HBO in a more affordable price range,” Bewkes said. “We welcome distributors making aggressive price offerings for HBO.” \n\nBewkes also seemed to dispute recent reports that its standalone HBO OTT service, HBO Now , was having difficulty growing subscribers. When UBS media analyst Doug Mitchelson, who was interviewing Bewkes, mentioned he thought a recent estimate that HBO Now had about 1 million subscribers was low, Bewkes responded, “me too.” \n\n“We didn’t hit the wall and we’re not building the wall,” Bewkes said. \n\nRegarding its cable networks, Bewkes said recent affiliate renewals for its Turner networks were “very robust.” And he added that CNN is expected to build on the momentum of 2016 into next year through its mix of domestic and international news, digital offerings and strong original shows, like Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown. \n\n“That combination, which is a pretty wide mission for CNN, has worked great and that’s why we are doing so well in earnings and we’ll do even better next year,” Bewkes said.

      "text": "  Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes Credit: Brendan Hoffman/Bloomberg News Most Popular \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes rebuked skepticism that a deal with AT&T will bring more benefits for AT&T than for his company during UBS's Media & Communications Conference on Tuesday. \n\"I think it's good for both companies,\" Mr. Bewkes said, adding that consumers will also benefit from the deal. \nMr. Bewkes said a merger with AT&T will allow consumers to access more high-quality content any way they want to watch. It will also improve the TV interface, allowing viewers to better find what they want to watch, share it and move around between networks and other streaming services. \nWhen it comes to advertising, Mr. Bewkes reiterated previous comments that the two companies will be able to deliver more relevant ads to the consumer that are less interruptive and more interesting, and ultimately, more valuable to marketers. \nMr. Bewkes said the hope is to foster competition in the advertising business, which has been increasingly focused on two companies -- Google and Facebook. \n\"We are not thinking of this just for Time Warner networks,\" Mr. Bewkes said. Ultimately, he wants what he calls other \"good networks\" to sit alongside Time Warner. \nMr. Bewkes said the merger, which he expects to close by the end of 2017, if not sooner, will motivate the industry to work together. \nMr. Bewkes also addressed reports that HBO's direct-to-consumer product HBO Now hasn't found traction with consumers and that it will be difficult for it to surpass 1 million users. \n\"We didn't hit the wall and we're not building a wall,\" Mr. Bewkes said. \nHe also provided a garbled explanation as to why AT&T is able to offer HBO for $5 per month as part of its new over-the-top service DirecTV Now, compared with around $14 per month it costs through a traditional pay-TV package. \n\"We have always wanted to make HBO in an affordable price range,\" Mr. Bewkes said. \n\"Westworld\" could be the premium cable network's next \"Game of Thrones.\" Mr. Bewkes said the sci-fi drama had the biggest first season of any series, including \"Game of Thrones.\" \nAnd over at CNN, Mr. Bewkes praised the network's news reporting and original series, while he attempted to downplay the presidential election's impact on the cable news network. \n\"We could say this year was an unusual year in news events, but that's not true, every year is,\" Mr. Bewkes said.

      "text": "TOP 5363613 \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said Tuesday that the Democratic Party posed a far greater threat to free speech than Donald Trump does. \n“The threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side [throughout the election],” Bewkes told Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget at a conference in New York. “There’s not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.” \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Blodget reminded Bewkes, who is a Democrat, that Trump had accused CNN — owned by Time Warner — of bias, and also threatened to sue numerous media outlets for libel. Bewkes dismissed the notion that Trump poses a threat to free speech. \n“I don’t think that’s a serious thing,” Bewkes said. “If anybody is going to change the First Amendment…remember, the Democratic party had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.” \nTime Warner is currently awaiting government approval of a deal that would allow the company to be acquired by AT&T for $85 billion — a deal Trump said he was originally against. Bewkes said he is hopeful the deal will be approved under the Trump administration. \n“I think when it becomes clear what we’re doing it will become clear to everyone that it will be pro-competitive, pro-consumer and improve competition in advertising.”",

      "text": "Finally, someone on the other side willing to step forward and call out Democrats and it’s refreshing!\nCEO of Time Warner is correct with his latest proclamation. Democrats have been anti-free speech formally for the last eight years. On University campuses, progressives have been openly hostile to free speech for longer. Internationally, Progressives and their Marxist cousins have been assaulting free speech and warping language for a hundred years.\nDemocrats were real free-speech threat of 2016 campaign, says Time Warner CEO https://t.co/ctq7ju5K0D \n— The Washington Times (@WashTimes) December 6, 2016 \n\nFrom Business Insider :\nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes told Business Insider’s Henry Blodget on Tuesday that the “real threat” to the First Amendment did not come from President-elect Donald Trump during the campaign, but rather from the Democratic Party.\nBewkes was speaking at Business Insider’s annual IGNITION conference, during which he was asked about Trump’s frequent campaign threats to open up libel laws.\nTrump has also set his sights on Bewkes’ media property, CNN, which he consistently ridiculed along the campaign trail and even after Election Day.\n“Do you worry about that at all?” Blodget asked.\nBewkes said he didn’t “think that’s a serious thing,” adding that “we should all worry” if someone were seeking to change the First Amendment. He suggested that came from the Democratic Party, which “had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.”\nConservative websites like ours are being attacked by the liberal media.

Bernie Sanders and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, vowed to engage in campaign finance reform following the election — a cause that has been bolstered in recent years by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. The 2010 ruling deemed that corporations and labor unions were people who could flex First Amendment rights in contributing to campaigns, and it led to the advent of so-called super PACs.\nAnyone who can think clearly and observe what has happened and is happening in America knows that it is Democrats who threaten every one of the first Ten Amendments, not just the First Amendment. Just look at who they nominate, and who their Presidents appoint. You don’t need any other proofs.\nTime Warner CEO says Democrats — not Trump — are ‘real threat’ to the First Amendment https://t.co/qHy3bPG1PZ via @tregp @theblaze \n— Females 4 Trump (@FemalesForTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\nIndeed \"Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes Says Democrats Were Bigger First Amendment Threat Than Trump\" https://t.co/DxZgfaZtpP \n— Tammy Bruce (@HeyTammyBruce) December 6, 2016 \n\nHelp support conservative news and views by sharing this post on Facebook and Twitter. \nDon’t forget to follow the Wayne Dupree Show social media accounts on Facebook , Google Plus , & Twitter . \nConservative websites like ours are being attacked by the liberal media.

      "title": "AT&T CEO: Time Warner Deal Would 'Disrupt' Cable TV Model",
      "text": "By John D. McKinnon\nAT&T Inc. Chairman Randall Stephenson plans to tell senators Wednesday his company's deal with Time Warner Inc. will \"disrupt\" the long-established cable TV model in ways that will benefit consumers, according to his prepared testimony.\n\"It would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive,\" Mr. Stephenson says in his prepared remarks, adding that the deal will create more competition for consumers while accelerating the next generation of advanced wireless broadband.\nAT&T and Time Warner executives are preparing to defend their proposed $85 billion merger Wednesday at a hearing of the Senate antitrust subcommittee even as they face a rapidly shifting political landscape buffeted by a wave of angry populism.\nUnder the proposed deal, AT&T hopes to use Time Warner's broad array of content, such as HBO, to anchor innovative new video services such as its online DirecTV Now.\nBut the merger deal has already raised concerns from the right and left and taken flak from President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized it on the campaign trail as too much concentration of power and promised to block it.\nTime Warner chief Jeff Bewkes, in his prepared testimony, will say the deal would allow his company to continue innovating in content as well as in consumer experiences, for example by adding more interactive features to video products.\nBut the giant deal is likely to face a barrage of questions from lawmakers, including over its potential impacts on consumers, other distributors and content producers, as well as over its sheer size.\nThe deal would combine AT&T, which has millions of pay-TV subscribers and wireless customers, with one of the nation's most prized media content companies. Time Warner includes HBO as well as the Warner Bros. studios, plus networks including CNN and TNT.\nThe proposal comes at a time when some lawmakers in both parties are expressing discomfort with concentration in some industries, including media and telecommunications.\nWhen Wednesday's hearing was announced, the antitrust subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), and its top Democrat, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, issued a joint statement saying that the deal \"would potentially raise significant antitrust issues\" which they promised to \"carefully examine.\"\nThe deal will be examined at length by antitrust enforcers, and the senators have no say in their final decision on approving the deal. Still, the lawmakers can reflect and contribute to the public mood, which polls -- and election outcomes -- suggest has grown more populist and anti-big business, as well as anti-big government, in recent years.\nMs. Klobuchar said in a statement on Tuesday that she is concerned the deal \"could be used to undermine competition at the distribution level, harm independent providers, and drive up prices for consumers.\"\nSome lawmakers also are concerned that the deal comes at a time when big broadband companies such as AT&T are beginning to find ways around the Obama administration's so-called net neutrality rules.\nThose rules require internet service providers to treat all content equally, without blocking or slowing. But several providers, including AT&T, are giving consumers big incentives to favor some video content by providing it without imposing data charges.\nWrite to John D. McKinnon at john.mckinnon@wsj.com\n 19:13 ET (00:13 ",

      "title": "Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes: Democrats, not Donald Trump, are the real ‘threat to the First Amendment’",
      "text": "share Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images Don’t worry about Donald Trump and the First Amendment, says Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes: He won’t harm it, despite a campaign promise to “open up” libel laws, and a tweet proposing to strip flag-burners of their citizenship. But Bewkes, who runs one of the world’s biggest media companies, says you should be worried about the Democratic Party, because its 2016 campaign posed a “threat to the First Amendment.” Speaking at Business Insider’s Ignition conference, Bewkes said Democrats “had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment ... in the guise of campaign finance reform.” That would “restrain multiple voices,” Bewkes told interviewer Henry Blodget. “And so I thought the threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side.” Bewkes was responding to a question from Blodget, who said Trump was “threatening to effectively change the First Amendment.” A Time Warner rep confirmed that Bewkes was referring to a line in the Democrats’ 2016 platform that called for “a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United.” Citizens United is the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that removed some limits on political giving for corporations, citing the First Amendment. Here’s a transcript of Blodget’s question and Bewkes’s response: Henry Blodget: But [Trump is] threatening to effectively change the First Amendment. He’s obviously got CNN in his sights. Are you worried about that at all? Jeff Bewkes: Nah, nah. I don’t think that’s a serious thing. We should all worry ... if anybody’s going to change the First Amendment — and remember the Democratic Party had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment. And they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform. And that was worrying me more. Because the press tends to miss that. Because they tend to lean that way, and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing, I think overly charitably, as something as cleaning up money in politics, when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices. And so I thought the threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side, more ... I think there’s not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side. Update: Here’s an addendum to Bewkes’s comment, supplied by a Time Warner rep: Jeff was in fact referencing Citizens United, which has come to mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. To the extent that people have interpreted the case to apply to campaign finance limits, the government has the ability to impose limits on political contributions, including those made by corporations. To be clear, he was actually talking about the court’s more narrow holding that all corporations, whether for profit or not-for-profit, have a First Amendment-protected right to produce and distribute programming of political importance during a presidential election. And that upholding the First Amendment rights of everyone to participate in a free, open and robust public debate during elections is more important to democracy than ever before. Here’s the video of Bewkes’ interview. The passage in question starts about the 1:24:55 mark: A few notes: Bewkes has traditionally donated to Democrats , and his company is in many ways a flag-bearer for the “coastal elite” Trump supporters supposedly despise: Its assets include HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. But Bewkes is more of a Big Media guy than he is a capital D Democrat: He’s also been opposed, for instance, to net neutrality rules Barack Obama’s administration has supported. Bewkes is going to be asking the Trump administration to sign off on a deal to sell his company to AT&T for about $86 billion . That doesn’t mean his comments aren’t sincere. (See above.) But if you need Washington’s help, it doesn’t hurt if you can tell the ruling party that you’re on its side. Bewkes’s stance will put him at odds with many of his employees. Like some of those journalists at CNN, for instance. Also, current HBO employees Jon Stewart and John Oliver, who combined to make this “Daily Show” classic in 2010: recode_divider",

He suggested that came from the Democratic Party, which \"had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.\" \n\"And that was worrying me more,\" Bewkes said.

      "text": "Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes was interviewed at a conference hosted by Business Insider Tuesday. Most of the conversation was about the development of on demand programming, advertising and other topics of concern to the CEO of a major media company. However, at one point the interviewer asked Bewkes, whose company owns CNN, how he felt about the spotlight turned on the news network by Donald Trump. Bewkes replied that he thought Democrats represented a greater threat to the First Amendment than the Republicans. He even added that the media tended to miss that because it was more likely to agree with the Democrats.\n“First of all the administration has had various disappointments in its evaluation of the press with all of the news outlets, pretty much,” Bewkes said. “So, yeah, at times they’ve mentioned CNN and we’ve noticed some of those mentions have been exaggerated by other media outlets…I don’t know why they would do that,” he added with a bit of sarcasm.\nBewkes went on to defend CNN and argued some of the Republican party’s dissatisfaction with the media were driven by having so many competing candidates in the field coming from different perspectives. “I think we’re going to see it on the Democratic side too,” Bewkes added.\nBut the interviewer pressed Bewkes saying, “But [Trump’s] threatening to effectively change the First Amendment. He’s obviously got CNN in his sights are you worried about that at all?”\n“Nah, I don’t think that’s a serious thing,” Bewkes replied. “We should all worry if anybody’s going to change the First Amendment and remember the Democratic Party had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment,” he said. “And they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform. And that was worrying me more because the press tends to miss that,” he added.\n“Because they tend to lean that way and they were supporting what they were viewing, I think, overly charitably as something in cleaning up money in politics when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices. And so I thought the threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side.” Bewkes concluded, “there’s not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.\nBewkes is referring to Democrats’ stated desire to overturn the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. That ruling, which was opposed by President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, arose after a conservative group tried to air a film critical of Hillary Clinton prior to the 2008 election. At the time the film was judged to violate the McCain-Feingold Act prohibiting political expenditures by groups. Eventually the Supreme Court ruled (5-4) that such expenditures aimed at influencing elections were covered by the First Amendment.\nThe discussion of the First Amendment starts at about 1:24:00.\n",

      "text": "Breitbart ^ | 12/0616 | JOEL B. POLLAK \nPosted on 12/06/2016 5:26:41 PM PST by Enlightened1 \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said Tuesday that the real threat to the First Amendment in the 2016 election had come from Democrats, not from Donald Trump  and that the media had largely missed the threat because of their own partisan bias. Speaking to the Business Insider IGNITION conference in New York City, Bewkes pointed out that the Democratic Party had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform. \nIndeed, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ran on an explicit pledge to change the First Amendment in order to overturn the Supreme Courts 2010 Citizens United ruling, which held that free speech extended to unions and corporations. \nThe Democratic Partys 2016 platform, adopted at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, pledged: Democrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Courts decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo. \nAnd as Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel pointed out in her book The Intimidation Game: How the Left is Silencing Free Speech, Clinton and her party had engaged in a variety of other practices aimed at silencing political rivals. \nIn contrast, Trump had an adversarial relationship with the press, and said that he would like to see American libel laws liberalized to make it harder for the media to publish inaccurate stories, but never threatened to change the First Amendment. \nBewkes told the Business Insider conference that the media had largely ignored Clintons threat to free speech: The press tends to miss that because they tend to lean that way, and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing  I think overly charitably  as something in cleaning up money in politics when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices. (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...",

      "text": "Robert Jonathan \nJeff Bewkes, the CEO of CNN parent Time Warner, claims that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press from government interference, is or was more in more danger from the Democrats than aggressive media critic/President-elect Donald Trump. \nTrump, the GOP standard-bearer who won an electoral college landslide that shocked the pollsters and the media pundits , has repeatedly bashed CNN ( among other mainstream news outlets ) for what he considers unfair, dishonest reporting, which the network vigorously disputes. \nTrump supporters have similarly accused what they have derisively nicknamed the “Clinton News Network” of liberal bias in the way it covered the presidential campaign and the post-election transition. \nAgainst this backdrop, when asked at the Business Insider -sponsored annual Ignition conference today in New York CIty whether he had concerns about the new president trying to impose regulatory constraints on CNN or by extension other media outlets through such efforts like expanded libel laws, Bewkes replied as follows, according to Recode . \n“I don’t think that’s a serious thing…remember the Democratic Party had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment. And they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform. And that was worrying me more. Because the press tends to miss that. Because they tend to lean that way, and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing, I think overly charitably, as something as cleaning up money in politics, when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices. And so I thought the threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic side, more… I think there’s not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.” Time Warner CEO: Democrats, not Donald Trump, are the real \"threat to the First Amendment\" https://t.co/dbzKnSrWVZ pic.twitter.com/tLPtb4Tl0g \n— Recode (@Recode) December 7, 2016 \nAccording to a Time Warner spokesperson, Bewkes was specifically referring to the Democrats’ stated objective to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case by constitutional amendment or perhaps through legislative or judicial action. \n“A 5-4 decision by the high court in 2010, Citizens United v. FEC struck down as unconstitutional a provision in federal law banning corporations and unions from ‘independent expenditures’ to weigh in on political campaigns,” the Washington Times noted . \n“Jeff was in fact referencing Citizens United, which has come to mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people,” the Time Warner rep explained later. “…To be clear, he was actually talking about the court’s more narrow holding that all corporations, whether for profit or not-for-profit, have a First Amendment-protected right to produce and distribute programming of political importance during a presidential election. And that upholding the First Amendment rights of everyone to participate in a free, open and robust public debate during elections is more important to democracy than ever before.” \nWith Trump having at least one appointment to the court to fill the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and with the GOP in control of Congress, it is unlikely that there will any changes to the Citizens United framework in the near term, however. \nRecode points out that Jeff Bewkes needs some help from the Trump administration insofar as approving the pending Time Warner acquisition by AT&T, in which the telecommunications giant plans to write a large check. \n“Bewkes has traditionally donated to Democrats, and his company is in many ways a flag-bearer for the ‘coastal elite’ Trump supporters supposedly despise: Its assets include HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. But Bewkes is more of a Big Media guy than he is a capital D Democrat: He’s also been opposed, for instance, to net neutrality rules Barack Obama’s administration has supported. Bewkes is going to be asking the Trump administration to sign off on a deal to sell his company to AT&T for about $86 billion. That doesn’t mean his comments aren’t sincere…But if you need Washington’s help, it doesn’t hurt if you can tell the ruling party that you’re on its side.” Democrats were a bigger threat to First Amendment than Trump, Jeff Bewkes says https://t.co/U5z5smPhPR OUR Constitution will be safe for now \n— Deplorable Linda G. (@GartrellLinda) December 6, 2016 \nAlthough Trump originally opposed the Time Warner-AT&T mega deal, Bewkes claimed at the conference forum that “As it becomes clear what we’re doing, it will be seen to be pro competitive, pro consumer,” Digiday noted . \n[Featured Image by Lionel Cironneau/AP Images]",

It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball.

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate AP News \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__",

      "text": "December 7, 2016 12:27 AM CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nThe CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. Related content",

It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate Marcy Gordon, Ap Business Writer   WASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. They can expect a skeptical audience. The CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. Other critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump , who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" Stephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. The deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \" Harry Potter \" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. The Justice Department , and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. Time Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. Because of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. But many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. Billionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks , is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. __ AP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Most Popular",

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate Posted: By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate Posted: By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer 43 min ago \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate 11:03 p.m. 11:03 p.m. 0 \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__",

They can expect a skeptical audience. The CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. Other critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump , who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" Stephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. The deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \" Harry Potter \" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. The Justice Department , and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. Time Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. Because of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. But many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. Billionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks , is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. __ AP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate   By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

They can expect a skeptical audience. The CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. Other critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump , who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" Stephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. The deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \" Harry Potter \" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. The Justice Department , and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. Time Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. Because of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. But many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. Billionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks , is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. __ AP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Today's Deals",

      "title": "AT&T CEO: Time Warner Deal Would 'Disrupt' Cable TV Model",
      "text": "By John D. McKinnon\nAT&T Inc. Chairman Randall Stephenson plans to tell senators Wednesday his company's deal with Time Warner Inc. will \"disrupt\" the long-established cable TV model in ways that will benefit consumers, according to his prepared testimony.\n\"It would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive,\" Mr. Stephenson says in his prepared remarks, adding that the deal will create more competition for consumers while accelerating the next generation of advanced wireless broadband.\nAT&T and Time Warner executives are preparing to defend their proposed $85 billion merger Wednesday at a hearing of the Senate antitrust subcommittee even as they face a rapidly shifting political landscape buffeted by a wave of angry populism.\nUnder the proposed deal, AT&T hopes to use Time Warner's broad array of content, such as HBO, to anchor innovative new video services such as its online DirecTV Now.\nBut the merger deal has already raised concerns from the right and left and taken flak from President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized it on the campaign trail as too much concentration of power and promised to block it.\nTime Warner chief Jeff Bewkes, in his prepared testimony, will say the deal would allow his company to continue innovating in content as well as in consumer experiences, for example by adding more interactive features to video products.\nBut the giant deal is likely to face a barrage of questions from lawmakers, including over its potential impacts on consumers, other distributors and content producers, as well as over its sheer size.\nThe deal would combine AT&T, which has millions of pay-TV subscribers and wireless customers, with one of the nation's most prized media content companies. Time Warner includes HBO as well as the Warner Bros. studios, plus networks including CNN and TNT.\nThe proposal comes at a time when some lawmakers in both parties are expressing discomfort with concentration in some industries, including media and telecommunications.\nWhen Wednesday's hearing was announced, the antitrust subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), and its top Democrat, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, issued a joint statement saying that the deal \"would potentially raise significant antitrust issues\" which they promised to \"carefully examine.\"\nThe deal will be examined at length by antitrust enforcers, and the senators have no say in their final decision on approving the deal. Still, the lawmakers can reflect and contribute to the public mood, which polls -- and election outcomes -- suggest has grown more populist and anti-big business, as well as anti-big government, in recent years.\nMs. Klobuchar said in a statement on Tuesday that she is concerned the deal \"could be used to undermine competition at the distribution level, harm independent providers, and drive up prices for consumers.\"\nSome lawmakers also are concerned that the deal comes at a time when big broadband companies such as AT&T are beginning to find ways around the Obama administration's so-called net neutrality rules.\nThose rules require internet service providers to treat all content equally, without blocking or slowing. But several providers, including AT&T, are giving consumers big incentives to favor some video content by providing it without imposing data charges.\nWrite to John D.

      "text": "  MARCY GORDON   Wednesday, December 7, 2016 \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T; and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T; and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal because it concentrates too much “power in the hands of too few.” \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump’s public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn’t have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T; gets that video to customers’ computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T; might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner’s programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner’s shows and movies - including “Game of Thrones” and the “Harry Potter” films - and AT&T;’s ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T; thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T; could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday’s hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.",

Mark Lennihan, File AP Photo 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nThe CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. Related content",

They can expect a skeptical audience. The CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. Other critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump , who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" Stephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. The deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \" Harry Potter \" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. The Justice Department , and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. Time Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. Because of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. But many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. Billionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks , is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. __ AP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.

It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs.

      "text": "Dec 7, 12:45 AM EST CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. They can expect a skeptical audience. The CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. Other critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" Stephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. The deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. The Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. Time Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. Because of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. But many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. Billionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. -- AP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.",

It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it.\nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers.\nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.\nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition.\nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor.\n__\nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate Wednesday Dec 7, 2016 at 6:00 AM Marcy Gordon,   \nWASHINGTON (AP) \" The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies \" including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films \" and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. About Us",

      "text": "Time Warner CEO: Democrats Threaten 1st Amendment, Not Trump \"The press tends to miss that.\" 12.6.2016 Paul Bois \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes won't be marching in lockstep with the leftist cry parade this coming inauguration of President Trump, and has scolded media for condemning the President-elect while ignoring the blatant threats Democrats made to the 1st Amendment. \nFrom Breitbart: Speaking to the Business Insider IGNITION conference in New York City, Bewkes pointed out that the Democratic Party 'had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.' Indeed, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton ran on an explicit pledge to change the First Amendment in order to overturn the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling, which held that free speech extended to unions and corporations. Not only did Hillary stand against Citizens United , but the Democratic Party also placed it into their platform for 2016. \"Democrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo,\" read the pledge. Bewkes also scolded the press for ignoring Hillary's threat to free speech. \"The press tends to miss that because they tend to lean that way, and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing — I think overly charitably — as something in cleaning up money in politics when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices,\" he said. \"There’s not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.\" President-elect Trump has come under fire more than once for allegedly threatening to curtail free speech, most especially, when he expressed desire to change American libel laws to make it harder for the press to publish inaccurate stories, though he never specifically threatened the 1st Amendment.

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer Updated 2 hrs ago ( … ) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Tags",

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer Updated 2 hrs ago \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.   \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Tags",

      "text": "Print An AT&T logo is seen at an AT&T store in New York City, October 23, 2016. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith ( Copyright Reuters 2016 ) \nAT&T Chairman Randall Stephenson plans to tell senators Wednesday his company's deal with Time Warner Inc. will \"disrupt\" the long-established cable TV model in ways that will benefit consumers, according to his prepared testimony. \nContinue Reading Below \n\"It would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive,\" Mr. Stephenson says in his prepared remarks, adding that the deal will create more competition for consumers while accelerating the next generation of advanced wireless broadband. \nAT&T and Time Warner executives are preparing to defend their proposed $85 billion merger Wednesday at a hearing of the Senate antitrust subcommittee even as they face a rapidly shifting political landscape buffeted by a wave of angry populism. \nUnder the proposed deal, AT&T hopes to use Time Warner's broad array of content, such as HBO, to anchor innovative new video services such as its online DirecTV Now. \nBut the merger deal has already raised concerns from the right and left and taken flak from President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized it on the campaign trail as too much concentration of power and promised to block it. \nTime Warner chief Jeff Bewkes, in his prepared testimony, will say the deal would allow his company to continue innovating in content as well as in consumer experiences, for example by adding more interactive features to video products. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nBut the giant deal is likely to face a barrage of questions from lawmakers, including over its potential impacts on consumers, other distributors and content producers, as well as over its sheer size. \nThe deal would combine AT&T, which has millions of pay-TV subscribers and wireless customers, with one of the nation's most prized media content companies. Time Warner includes HBO as well as the Warner Bros. studios, plus networks including CNN and TNT. \nThe proposal comes at a time when some lawmakers in both parties are expressing discomfort with concentration in some industries, including media and telecommunications. \nWhen Wednesday's hearing was announced, the antitrust subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), and its top Democrat, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, issued a joint statement saying that the deal \"would potentially raise significant antitrust issues\" which they promised to \"carefully examine.\" \nThe deal will be examined at length by antitrust enforcers, and the senators have no say in their final decision on approving the deal. Still, the lawmakers can reflect and contribute to the public mood, which polls -- and election outcomes -- suggest has grown more populist and anti-big business, as well as anti-big government, in recent years. \nMs. Klobuchar said in a statement on Tuesday that she is concerned the deal \"could be used to undermine competition at the distribution level, harm independent providers, and drive up prices for consumers.\" \nSome lawmakers also are concerned that the deal comes at a time when big broadband companies such as AT&T are beginning to find ways around the Obama administration's so-called net neutrality rules. \nThose rules require internet service providers to treat all content equally, without blocking or slowing. But several providers, including AT&T, are giving consumers big incentives to favor some video content by providing it without imposing data charges. \nWrite to John D.

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate MARCY GORDON, The Associated Press Published: December 6, 2016, 10:22 pm Updated: \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal because it concentrates too much “power in the hands of too few.” \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump’s public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn’t have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers’ computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner’s programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner’s shows and movies — including “Game of Thrones” and the “Harry Potter” films — and AT&T’s ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday’s hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post...",

The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. The CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016, before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. (AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, File) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal because it concentrates too much “power in the hands of too few.” \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump’s public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn’t have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers’ computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner’s programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner’s shows and movies — including “Game of Thrones” and the “Harry Potter” films — and AT&T’s ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday’s hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__",

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer Updated 4 hrs ago ( … ) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Tags",
