The software giant originally planned to ship units to customers in mid-December, but Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week.

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nOver the last several weeks, a viral challenge has appeared on Twitter in the form of “ #MannequinChallenge ,” pushing users to create short clips of humans pretending to be mannequins. So far, these clips have ranged from a Walking Dead -inspired scene, to a dog watching a movie and eating Cheetos on the couch, to the Sesame Street crew frozen on the set, and to a huge crowd frozen in place as they cheer Marshmello . Naturally, Microsoft’s HoloLens team couldn’t refuse.\nThe video embedded above uses Actiongram , a tool provided for HoloLens users to create experiences without the need for visual effects experience or 3D skills. The video showcases Microsoft’s dedicated studio for converting real-world creatures, objects, characters, and actors into holograms. In turn, these holograms are inserted into video content, mixing real and virtual together into a fun experience.\nMore: HoloMaps hits Microsoft’s HoloLens headset with 3D maps and remote collaboration\n“Creators are able to develop their own unique holographic stories, in their world, to express their thoughts, ideas, and delight people,” Kudo Tsunoda , Microsoft’s CVP of Next Gen Experiences in the Windows and Devices group, said in March. “Actiongram allows people to create videos with holograms and advanced visual effects that would normally require expensive software and years of experience to do.”\nAccording to Tsunoda, the Actiongram app was created by a team of five individuals during a six-month time frame. The team set out to create a tool enabling HoloLens owners the ability to create high quality content with virtually no skills, opening the HoloLens doors to storytellers to unfold their experiences using holograms. Additional examples outside the current Mannequin Challenge include an astronaut walking in a bathtub full of bubbles, a thumb war pitting a giant hand against a soldier, and more.\nAs seen in the Mannequin Challenge video above, the team created a hologram that includes George Takei as he watches one of the Actiongram monitors. Just like the knight and the dragon, the rendering of the Takei hologram isn’t 100-percent smooth as the camera pans the scene. Pause the video and you’ll see his true artificial nature sporting flattened hands and a not-so-natural outline.\nActiongram is currently provided to all HoloLens owners as a beta in the Windows Store. Microsoft opened the doors to its Development Edition version of HoloLens earlier this year, essentially allowing anyone with $3,000 to purchase and use the augmented reality headset. The company has no clue as to when or even if a consumer version will hit the market, but the upcoming VR/AR headsets offered by third-party manufacturers for the Windows 10 Creators Edition is likely what Microsoft had in mind for the general market.\nThat said, there’s a good chance Actiongram will be one of the apps served up to consumers when the third-party VR/AR headsets go live next spring. Until then, check out all the cool holographic experiences made by owners of the HoloLens Development Edition and Actiongram thus far!\nHoloMaps hits Microsoft’s HoloLens headset with 3D maps and remote collaboration Trimble's SketchUp Viewer lets you use Hololens so you can live inside designs Microsoft’s HoloLens gains momentum from award-winning HoloAnatomy app",

      "text": "Microsoft CEO Stokes Surface Phone Rumors With 'Ultimate Mobile Device' Comments Thursday November 24, 2016 4:00 AM PST by Tim Hardwick Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has stoked speculation this week that Redmond is prepping a new line of smartphones under the Surface brand for launch in early 2017. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review published on Monday, Nadella said the company was conducting innovative research that would ensure it continued to have a presence in the smartphone market. However, rather than follow a present trend, Microsoft would attempt to re-define the field in a single-handed pursuit of the \"ultimate mobile device\". Underlining his philosophy, Nadella said that the company would not launch into a device category without bringing something different to the table, because it was more interested in how individuals and organizations were using devices, and less in the devices themselves. \"We don't want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That's where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,\" he said. \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.\" Rumors of a \"Surface Phone\" that would complement the popular Surface Book and the highly praised Surface Studio have been bubbling away for a while. Some rumors suggest a device running Windows 10 Mobile OS, others predict a range of devices, some of which could sport a keyboard flip case reminiscent of Blackberry phones. Meanwhile, several observers have pointed to the HP Elite x3 â part smartphone, part mini PC â as a potential indicator of where the company could take its mobile ambitions, possibly as soon as early next year. The introduction of a Surface Phone would represent a bold return to the smartphone market for Microsoft, after its consumer phone ambitions fell flat following the company's Nokia mobile acquisition over two years ago. Microsoft subsequently laid off hundreds of employees tied to its smartphone business in May, suggesting the company had all but given up on the consumer phone market.",

      "title": "Crackdown 3 Still in Development, Latest Build “Looked Good” – Phil Spencer",
      "text": "\nWe already know that Microsoft’s Crackdown 3 , developed by Cloudgine and Reagent Games, has been delayed into 2017 but since then, information has been pretty sparse about the open world action title. So much so that many are already suspecting it’s been cancelled.\nCue Xbox boss Phil Spencer on Twitter to confirm that this wasn’t the case. In response to whether Crackdown 3 was still in development, Spencer said, “Yep, @shannonloftis and team still working on it.”\nAs for whether it’s alive and doing well, Spencer further tweeted that, “Yep, saw a build the other day, looked good. One thing I love about CD, you know it from a single frame, look is iconic.”\nWhich is all well and good but the fact that there’s no information on a release date – or when the purported open beta for multiplayer is taking place – still leaves us to wonder how far off it actually is.\nWhat are your thoughts on Crackdown 3’s current status? Let us know in the comments below.",

      "title": "Top 5 must have free add-ons for Microsoft Edge",
      "text": "Print Most people like to personalize their devices and tools and that applies to web browsers too. Although Microsoft Edge didn’t offer support for extensions when Windows 10 was initially launched, now it does and the Windows Store has them available for you to download and install. If you like Microsoft Edge and you want to expand its features, here is our list of top 5 must have add-ons for this web browser: NOTE: Microsoft Edge extensions work only on PCs with Windows 10. They don’t work on smartphones with Windows 10 Mobile. 1 . LastPass LastPass is one of the best password managers and everyone should probably use it. If you like Microsoft Edge and you don’t use the same password for all your various online accounts, LastPass is definitely a must have extension. It will store all your passwords in a secure vault, it will autofill passwords as you browse the web, and it will help you keep your personal information away from prying eyes. Download: LastPass . 2. Adblock or Adblock Plus Both AdBlock and Adblock Plus are extensions that are designed to block ads and they do it very well. If you’d rather surf the web and visit websites without being hindered by countless ads everywhere, then install one of these extensions in your Microsoft Edge browser. You’ll absolutely love it, there’s no doubt about it. But, don’t forget that some of the websites that you love are supported by ads and they don’t annoy you like other websites do. Therefore, don’t forget to whitelist our website - Digital Citizen . We will highly appreciate it. Download: Adblock and Adblock Plus 3. Office Online There’s a pretty big chance that you are using Office files like Word documents or Excel spreadsheets. But, you might not have the Office apps installed on all your Windows 10 computers and devices. To be able to work with such files on any Windows 10 PC, all you have to do is install the Office Online extension for Microsoft Edge . It will let you view, edit, or even create Office files, directly from the browser. Download: Office Online 4. Mouse Gestures If you like using your mouse more than you like using your keyboard, there is an extension for Microsoft Edge that lets you control the web browser with Mouse Gestures . After installing this extension, you will be able to do things like right click and hold inside Microsoft Edge and then move the mouse to the left, to go back to the previous webpage, or move the mouse right and then to the top, in order to open a new tab. The list of gestures you can perform with your mouse is pretty long, as you can see in the image below. Download: Mouse Gestures . 5. Microsoft Translator Many people can speak at least one foreign language, but nobody can understand over 50 languages. Microsoft Translator can do that for you, and you can use its knowledge to translate any webpage you visit in Microsoft Edge . Each time you’re on a webpage in a foreign language, the Microsoft Translate extension will display an icon in the address bar. Click on it and Microsoft Edge will instantly translate that webpage to your current Windows 10 language. Download: Microsoft Translator . Conclusion Although Microsoft listened and developed an extension engine for their new Edge web browser, the truth is that, right now, there are just a few add-ons available in the Store. However, half of them are good and worth installing and using. What extensions would you like to see being developed for Microsoft Edge ? Which extensions you would like added to this list?

      "title": "Microsoft shares Windows 10 telemetry data with third parties",
      "text": "Tweet \nIt’s no secret that Windows 10 records all sorts of usage information, some of which it feeds back to Microsoft . To help with the smooth running of Windows 10, and to get an idea of how users interact with the operating system, Microsoft collects telemetry data, which includes information on the device Windows 10 is running on, a list of installed apps, crash dumps, and more. \nTelemetry data recorded by Windows 10 is, in a nutshell, just technical information about the device the OS is on, and how Windows and any installed software is performing, but it can occasionally include personal information. If you’re worried about that, the news that Microsoft is sharing telemetry data with third parties might concern you. \nMicrosoft recently struck a deal with security firm FireEye to provide access to Windows 10 telemetry data, in exchange for having FireEye’s iSIGHT Threat Intelligence technology included in its Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection service. WDATP is an enterprise security product that helps enterprises detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks on their networks and is different from the free version of Windows Defender. \nThe upsides of the deal are obvious for both Microsoft and FireEye, and enterprise customers will certainly benefit from the partnership. \nIt’s not known exactly what data Microsoft has made available to FireEye, but in a detailed TechNet article on its telemetry gathering the software giant originally said: \"Microsoft may share business reports with OEMs and third party partners that include aggregated and anonymized telemetry information. Data-sharing decisions are made by an internal team including privacy, legal, and data management\". \nEven so, some users will still be concerned to know that data being gathered on their Windows 10 usage is being shared in this way. If that includes you, you might want to take action. \nThere are three telemetry levels in Windows 10 -- Basic, Enhanced, and Full. It’s the Enhanced and Full settings which might accidentally snag personal or business information (via crash dumps), and Windows 10 Home and Pro are set to Full by default. \nTo check and change which telemetry level your copy of Windows 10 is set to, open Settings, search for \"feedback\" and open Feedback privacy settings . You can change the level under Diagnostic and usage data and also set the Feedback frequency to Never if you simply want to opt out. \nAre you concerned to hear that Microsoft is sharing telemetry data with third parties?",

      "text": "Tweet \nIn direct contrast to Microsoft's assertion that Windows 10 is its most secure operating system ever, the US-CERT Coordination Center says that Windows 7 with EMET offers greater protection. With EMET due to be killed off, security experts are concerned. \nA vulnerability analyst from CERT, Will Dormann, advises Microsoft to continue the development of EMET. Microsoft says 'many' of EMET's features have been integrated into Windows 10, but the concern is that key components are missing, and others have been implemented in such a way that reduces their security. \nCERT concerns will be particularly worrying to business and enterprise users, as Dormann reveals just which of EMET's features are missing from Windows 10. Of particular concern is the fact that so many application-level defense options are absent. He has produced a table that shows how Windows 7 compares to Windows 10 in terms of security, with and without EMET: \nHe also points out another serious issue: \nThe problem is that the application needs to be specifically compiled to take advantage of CFG (Control Flow Guard). Out of all of the applications you run in your enterprise, do you know which ones are built with CFG support? If an application is not built to use CFG, it doesn't matter if your underlying operating system supports CFG or not. \nEven though EMET reaches end-of-life on July 31, 2018, Dormann advises companies to continue using it beyond this date regardless.",

The $3,000 all-in-one was originally scheduled to ship in mid-December, but Christmas is coming early for some.\nNot only is Microsoft shipping Studio Surface early to impress those customers, but it has also set up a dedicated support line that they can use if they run into any technical problems. Each Surface Studio user gets their very own support number.\n“Your Surface Studio is about to arrive,” reads the email Microsoft sent out to early pre-order customers from Surface head Panos Panay. “Our team worked relentlessly to reinvent your desktop, and we want your first experience with Surface Studio to be absolutely perfect.”\n“If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please reach out to our team using this special number created just for you.”\nEach machine also ships with a little booklet that thanks customers for purchasing the Surface Studio, Microsoft’s first desktop with a giant touchscreen that folds down onto your desk. It’s also packing great specifications, like GeForce 980M graphics and a 2TB hybrid drive.\nMicrosoft is still taking pre-orders for the Surface Studio, however, as things stand, you’ll be waiting until early 2017 for delivery.\n\n\nSource : The Verge ",

      "title": "Microsoft’s Chinese chatbot won’t talk about Tiananmen or Xi Jinping",
      "text": "HONG KONG– “If you like me, why would you talk like this to me?”\nAsk Microsoft’s Chinese chatbot Xiaoice about Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and that’s how she responds. She also skirts around highly sensitive topics like the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protests, Chinese President Xi Jinping or even President-elect Donald Trump.\nXiaoice has become hugely popular since she was introduced in 2014. More than 40 million Chinese smartphone users chat with her on the social media platforms WeChat or Weibo every day, according to Microsoft. A quarter of them have declared their love for her.\nCompanies use chatbots to connect with consumers and promote their brands. Chinese often use Xiaoice simply to have something resembling a real conversation with a close friend.\nXiaoice is an experiment in artificial intelligence. She mines Chinese websites to gather material for conversations. She can glean vital context from voice messages and images. If you send her a photo of a pop star, for example, she might respond by saying how much she likes the singer’s music.\nRefusing to talk about sensitive topics suggests Xiaoice has been programmed to avoid prohibited words when asked about them. Microsoft declined to comment.\nChina pours incredible resources into patrolling the internet, tracking down prohibited content and unwanted posts with an army of more than two million censors.\nTo get around them, Chinese bloggers and dissidents get creative. Instead of writing Tiananmen, online users instead reference the date of the massacre — June 4, 1989 — often simply writing 64 or 8964.\nXi Jinping is called Xi Baozi, or Steamed Bun Xi, a nickname he earned after a publicity stunt where he bought steamed pork buns at a small store in Beijing and carried his own food tray.\nBut censors eventually figure out new phrases and nicknames and restrict them online.\nChina Digital Times recently reported the growing attention to Xiaoice’s evasive answers, highlighting tweets from Chinese dissidents like Su Yutong, who lives in Germany. Su tried several banned topics with Xiaoice, posting screengrabs of conversations like the one below on Twitter:\nCNNMoney also had a go. We asked Xiaoice about China’s president:\nAnd then we name dropped President-elect Donald Trump, and asked her about Tiananmen Square:\nTech giants such as Facebook, Twitter and Google are blocked in China, in part because the government fears open discussions about the very topics Xiaoice refuses to acknowledge.\nAmnesty International has documented a marked uptick in censorship in China over the past year, including an increase in controls on social media.\nMicrosoft still operates in China, and has been criticized in the past for complying with the country’s strict policing of the Internet.\nIf Microsoft has programmed Xiaoice to sidestep sensitive topics, it indicates a worrisome trend, said Patrick Poon, an Amnesty researcher. Earlier this week, Facebook was reported to have built a censorship tool to get into China.\n“They are legitimizing what the Chinese government is doing, which is convincing foreign tech companies to suppress freedom of speech,” Poon said.\nBy Sherisse Pham\n— Tim Schwarz and Serena Dong contributed this story.",

      "text": "Eve V Crowdfunded Windows 10 Tablet Reportedly Has Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's Attention Eve V has a starting price of $1,399 (Rs. 96,093) Device already back-ordered till April 2017 Company ditched slim design for larger battery \nEven though Microsoft's Surface tablets are considered to be one of the best in their class, there is a new hybrid tablet that has peaked the curiosity of Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella. Eve V, a Windows 10-powered tablet, was developed with the inputs provided by user community created by the company itself and has reportedly got the attention of Nadella. \nThe Eve V tablet has a starting price of $1,399 (Rs. 96,000) and as per the company, the funding from IndieGoGo campaign will be used to cover manufacturing costs and handling of pre-orders, as reported by Business Insider . However, the tablet is said to already be a finished product and fully functional, thanks earlier funding provided by Intel. \nAt the time of writing this article, Eve V's listing on IndieGoGo has already garnered $936,352 (Rs. 6.4 crores), or 1,248 percent of its initial goal of $75,000 (Rs. 52 lakhs). The tablet has already been back-ordered to April 2017 but can still be pre-ordered from IndieGoGo . Eve CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis told Business Insider that Satya Nadella got interested in the product after reading about the project and will get his unit when the device starts shipping in February. The most unique thing about Eve V is that everything from the keyboard to its cover material has been decided after receiving inputs from Eve.Community, the user community website created by Karatsevidis. The website allows users to simply register and start giving their suggestions for the device.\nAfter receiving inputs from the community, the developers decided to ditch a rather slim design in order to incorporate a larger battery, which was preferred more by contributors. In a comparison with the Surface Pro 4, the Eve V is seen to have more modern processors, more ports (including USB Type-C), a slightly higher resolution display, better battery life, a quad-speaker setup, and a smaller price tag despite the similar configuration. \nEven though Microsoft has constantly pushed all the devices that run on Windows 10 platform, it will be interesting to see if Eve V's challenge to the Redmond-based company's critically acclaimed lineup of hybrid devices creates a cause of concern for Microsoft.",

      "text": "Lenovo Miix 520 Leaked, a New 2-in-1 Tipped to Take on Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Lenovo Miix 520 is reported to have up to 1TB of storage It will be powered by Intel's new Kaby Lake SoCs No details of availability and price is known yet \nAfter Microsoft launched its new Surface lineup at its October 27 event, Lenovo can be seen upping the game with its own 2-in-1 offerings. The Chinese tech company launched an improved Miix 510 in August and now it seems Lenovo is bringing a new 2-in-1 to its Miix range. Some details about the new Miix 520 have leaked online along with some unofficial renders that reveal its design. \nThe Chinese tech company entered the 2-in-1 device arena with its Surface clone last year. At IFA this year, Lenovo launched Miix 510 that included 12.2-inch full-HD display, and models with up to 8GB of RAM and a up to 1TB SSD. Now, as per a new report by WinFuture, a new Lenovo Surface-like 2-in-1 is in the making and its details are out. Unlike the Miix 510, Lenovo Miix 520 is said to be powered by the new Intel Kaby Lake processor, coupled with 16GB of RAM. It may sport a 12.3-inch display that will offer a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels with Gorilla Glass for scratch protection. The report also claims that the battery in the new Miix 520 will be rated to provide up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge. There will also be a fingerprint scanner present in the device. It is also touted to bear the Dolby Advanced Audio certification. For storage, the Lenovo Miix 520 is reported to have up to 1TB of storage that can also be expanded via an external microSD card.\nFor cameras, it will have an 8-megapixel and 2-megapixel camera duo setup at the back while there will be a 5-megapixel front-facing shooter. The secondary camera at the back is supposed to work for augmented reality applications. The Lenovo Miix 520 will have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and LTE connectivity options. It is also said to have two USB Type-C ports and one USB 3.0. Lenovo Miix 520 is also reported to integrate Windows Hello on its platform. \nThe report also includes some unofficial renders of Lenovo Miix 520 that have surfaced online. The renders show that it looks quite similar to its predecessor Miix 510 in terms of design. It may also be accompanied by an optional keyboard with Watch Band hinge and a stylus for handwriting inputs, as per the report. \nThese details and unofficial renders are quite preliminary, therefore, we recommend users to take this news with a grain of salt. Price and availability details are not known to us at this point of time.",

      "title": "Xiaomi Mi Mix Comes Bundled With Cortana Digital Assistant",
      "text": "Xiaomi Mi Mix Comes Bundled With Cortana Digital Assistant   05:08 PST \nMicrosoft has created its own digital personal assistant named Cortana that’s capable of holding its own against rivals like Siri. It may have started on Windows Phone smartphones but Cortana has since been expanded to the broader Microsoft ecosystem so now it’s a staple on the company’s desktop OS as well. It remains available on smartphones as well and given the partnership that Microsoft has with Xiaomi, it also comes bundled with the latter’s Mi Mix smartphone . \nXiaomi got everyone talking about it when it unveiled the Mi Mix last month even though the focus was initially on the Mi Note 2 . The Mi Mix is a unique device, one that sets Xiaomi apart from the competition, so it’s certainly milking every opportunity that the new handset sends its way. \nTo be clear, the 6.4 inch Mi Mix is still an Android-powered device with Xiaomi’s MIUI skin. However, it does borrow some features from Microsoft. Xiaomi recently acquired a handful of patents from Microsoft and a part of this deal was that some of the latter’s apps would be installed on Xiaomi handsets. \nIt’s this deal that bundles Cortana with the Mi Mix. The handset also comes with other Microsoft apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. This makes the Xiaomi Mi Mix the very first non-Windows smartphone to come with Cortana straight out of the box. \nFiled in Cellphones . Read more about Cortana , Microsoft and Xiaomi .

      "text": "Tweet \nAlso in today's Thanksgiving-ignoring EMEA regional roundup: EU set to approve Microsoft's LinkedIn acquisition; business rates relief for UK fiber rollouts; TalkTalk offers new-look YouView. \nThe Norwegian Competition Authority is considering imposing a fine of 906 million kroner (US$105 million) on Telenor for what it says is the operator's abuse of its dominant market position in Norway. According to the Authority's statement , Telenor failed to give rival Network Norway proper access to its network, effectively impeding the entry of a third mobile operator into the Norwegian market. Telenor has until March next year to come up with a response to the allegations. \nThe European Commission is set to approve Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT)'s planned $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp. , provided the software giant makes small changes to the concessions it has already promised to allay competition concerns, according to a Reuters report citing unnamed sources. (See Microsoft & LinkedIn: Marriage Made in the Cloud .) \nWednesday's Autumn Statement from the UK government grabbed headlines by promising an additional Ł740 million ($921.8 million) for 5G trials and Ł400 million ($498.7 million) for fiber-to-the-premises rollout, but another significant announcement that almost slipped under the radar related to business rates, the local tax that is levied on businesses. Telcos will, as the Financial Times reports , be given a five-year exemption from the rates as they apply to existing and planned networks, news that constitutes a nice early Christmas present for the likes of BT Group plc (NYSE: BT; London: BTA), Virgin Media Inc. (Nasdaq: VMED) and smaller rivals such as CityFibre . (See Eurobites: UK Govt Pledges Ł740M for 5G Trials, Ł400M for FTTP .) \nTalkTalk , the broadband and pay-TV provider, says it will be the first to offer the \"next generation\" version of the YouView hybrid TV platform, which is the fruit of a joint venture between various broadcasters, BT, TalkTalk and Arqiva . The revamped service features, among other tweaks, a more image-led layout and a TV Planner app which allows viewers to set reminders or record live TV via their mobile. BT is reportedly in the process of trying to take full control of YouView, having been frustrated at what it saw as the slow development of the platform. (See Eurobites: BT Seeks Control of YouView Remote .) \n Paul Rainford, Assistant Editor, Europe, Light Reading (0) | ",

      "text": "0 0 \nIf Microsoft convinced you to upgrade to Windows 10 , but you decided to wait for Black Friday to get your hands on the company’s latest OS, we don’t actually have good news for you. Yes, the Redmond giant kicked off the Black Friday season on the Windows Store, but Windows 10’s price tag remains the same. \nIn other words, if you want to buy the Windows 10 Home package , you need to pay $119.99. The pricetag for Windows 10 Pro is $249.00. There is no Black Friday discount available on Microsoft’s Store regarding these two OS packages. \nMany users hoped that Microsoft would discount the Windows 10 OS , but it appears the company has no plans doing so. After all, Windows 10 Anniversary Update was only launched in August and the Redmond giant offered users the chance to upgrade for free up until July 29 . \nOn a more positive note, if you’re interested in purchasing the Office package , you can now save up to $30 for Word, Excel, PowerPoint and company. \nAs always, the main Black Friday discounts are available for Windows 10 laptops , and the Surface family. You can now save up to $350 for the Surface Pro 4 , $330 for selected Dell laptops , $280 for the impressive HP Elite X3 Holiday Bundle and the list can go on. \nOf course, retailers are offering huge discounts as well. HP, the most popular Windows 10 PC manufacturer , has prepared a delightful Black Friday discount list that will definitely tempt many potential buyers. HP is offering consumers up to 50% off storewide on Black Friday, and free shipping is the cherry on top. \nThe only problem with this rich offer is that it’s difficult to decide what to buy. Cortana and Microsoft Edge can help you make better purchasing decisions , remind you about discounts and compare the price tag of the products you’re interested in buying. \nUse the comment section below to tell us what you’ve bought on Black Friday. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft announced back in August 2016 that it would bring the Windows Holographic shell to mainstream PCs as part of its next major update to Windows 10. \nThe company is already offering the HoloLens headset for $3000, but there are rumors that it is now working with hardware partners in order to release a more affordable virtual reality headset for Windows 10 which will be priced at only $299. At the same time, the minimum requirements of computers will be lowered so that more people will be able to use the new headset. \nLast week, Microsoft released the Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14971, which included the Windows Holographic First Run app. This application revealed the minimum PC specs that will be required in order to use the Windows Holographic VR: Quad-core CPU; A graphics card that supports DirectX 12; 1GB of free storage. \nIn addition, the application recommends you use USB 3.0, but that is not a mandatory requirement. However, by using USB 3.0 you will make sure that the application runs without any problems. \nDuring the First Run process, you will be advised to prepare your room in order to be able to safely use the VR headset. Unlike the HoloLens headset, this low-cost Windows Holographic headset will not allow you to view the “real” world and will be connected to a Windows 10 PC using a wire. \nThe full Windows Holographic shell will be released sometime in early 2017 when the Windows 10 Creators Update is launched. However, Microsoft will release more news regarding this upcoming headset during an event in December 2016. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "• Pune - Maharashtra - India PUNE, India - Nov. 24, 2016 - PRLog -- Microsoft is set to gain EU approval for its $26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday.Microsoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedIn's rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing for professional social networks on computers after the acquisition.The second plank of the concession is important because of the company's battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros.The slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue.The deal, Microsoft's largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.However, it came amidst regulatory concerns and citizens' worries about big data and that some companies may use the huge amount of information they gather to squeeze out competitors and encroach on users' privacy.The deal has been criticized by US rival Salesforce , which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn and which urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving it.The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 6, as well as Microsoft, declined to comment.Authorities in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa have already nodded through the acquisition without demanding concessions.The bulk of LinkedIn's $3 billion annual revenue comes from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.Read More on Mergers and Acquisitions:-",

      "text": "Of all the time-wasting tools we have used to chip away a few of the day’s hours, Solitaire is the granddaddy. Now that old friend is bursting forth into the 21st century, as Microsoft made it available on both iOS and Android for the first time.\nAlthough there are certainly many fans of Solitaire who have been playing it since its first digital inception, it is old enough now that there are drinkers in the world who have not. In fact, this year marks the 26th year since it was available on a Windows platform. Now it’s going mobile and that opens it up for a much wider audience.\nReimagined as an app, Microsoft’s Solitaire comes with a number of different modes. If you never understood how to play Spider Solitaire, now is your chance. It comes along with the classic Klondike mode, Freecell, Tripeaks and Pyramid too, all with their own unique rulesets.\nMore: Bye-bye productivity: Google lets you play Solitaire, Tic-Tac-Toe with just a search\nTo keep you coming back — other than to avoid whatever it is you’re supposed to be doing — Microsoft has also implemented daily challenges, so you can play specific puzzles which challenge you to figure out how to complete the puzzle of the layered cards. New ones will be released every day, with varied difficulty levels.\nIf you manage to complete some hard ones too, you can even brag about it to your friends, since there is Xbox Live Support too. That way you can earn achievements and prove that you really did win without cycling through the deck more than once.\nThis being a free mobile game, there are some advertisements that you are forced to deal with, but if you like playing enough, you can put down $2 and Microsoft will strip them out and give you double coin rewards by becoming a premium member.\nOf course, there are other mobile Solitaire games available and have been for some time — it is a timeless classic after all.\n100 awesome Android games you need to try Arduino-powered ping pong table play music to match the intensity of your game Best Google Easter eggs",

Mobile players will get five games, daily challenges, Xbox Live integration and more, and the Premium Edition is free until the end of the year. ( Microsoft | Google Play ) Advertisement \nAfter 26 years of availability on Windows, the Microsoft Solitaire Collection is catching up with the times and going mobile, launching on Android and iOS. \nThe Solitaire Collection is among Microsoft's most popular products and it's a bit surprising that it took more than two decades to finally bring it to the 21st century and make it available on mobile. \nMicrosoft confirmed back in August that it was bringing the Solitaire Collection to Android and iOS , but at the time it did not offer any specific timeline for when the games would become available on mobile. \nFast forward to the present date and one of the world's favorite procrastination tools is now officially available on Android and iOS, the most popular mobile platforms, and it brings goodies such as daily challenges and Xbox Live integration. What's In Store \nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection is now available as a free download for iOS and Android and it brings Klondike, FreeCell, Spider, Tripeaks and Pyramid game types. \nTo further sweeten the deal, Microsoft has also added daily challenges to keep players engaged, as well as Xbox Live integration into the game so that players can sign into Solitaire and play with others or earn achievements. At the same time, all progress and game data is saved in the cloud, which means that users can start playing a game on mobile and finish up on a compatible Windows 10 device. \nThe five games in the collection have different difficulty levels just like they do on Windows, so players can test their proficiency and gradually work up to playing on expert-difficulty levels. Free Version vs. Premium Edition \nAs expected, the free version of the Solitaire Collection includes ads, but Microsoft is also offering a \"Premium Edition\" that's ad-free and offers game boosts and twice as many coin points for daily challenges. To celebrate the release on mobile, all players can enjoy the premium version of Solitaire until the end of the year. After Dec. 31, the Premium Edition will cost $1.99 per month. One Of The Most-Played Games Of All Time \n\"Microsoft Solitaire continues to be one of the most-played games of all time on Windows for more than 25 years,\" Microsoft touts , highlighting that the Solitaire Collection has attracted 119 million unique players worldwide in the past four years alone. \nHitting Android and iOS devices worldwide will likely boost the user base considerably, given today's mobile-driven world. \nAre you planning on having a little fun with Microsoft Solitaire Collection on mobile?

By: FE Online | Published: November 24, 2016 6:23 PM Interestingly, Xiaomi is not the first Android company to make a tie-up with Microsoft for Cortana. Earlier OnePlus, also from China, had done it for its Cyanogen users. Microsoft, in turn, has upgraded its Cortana app in the new Windows 10 Anniversary version, especially by making it accessible from the lock screen itself. \nChinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has reportedly made a tie-up with global tech giant Microsoft to bring the voice assistant Cortana to the Mi Mix smartphone. According to a report in mspoweruser, earlier the Chinese company has partnered with Microsoft Office Suite and video-calling apps, and now the discussions are on to pre-install Cortana into the Mi Mix device. But interestingly, Xiaomi is not the first Android company to make a tie-up with Microsoft for Cortana. Earlier OnePlus, also from China, had done it for its Cyanogen users. Microsoft, in turn, has upgraded its Cortana app in the new Windows 10 Anniversary version, especially by making it accessible from the lock screen itself. \nAccording to the mspoweruser report, the Senior Vice President at Xiaomi, Xiang Wang was quoted as having said in June, “We are excited to be working closely with Microsoft on a broad technology collaboration partnership. As demonstrated by this agreement with Microsoft, Xiaomi is looking to build sustainable, long-term partnerships with global technology leaders, with the ultimate goal of bringing the best user experience to our Mi fans.” \nSmartphone makers around the globe have been trying to make better bezel-less devices, and some have even been successful. But those devices lacked in other features. Xiaomi has shown what is possible with the edgeless design. Mi Mix is designed by the famous French designer Phillippe Starck. The design is very subtle, yet looks like one of those devices used in futuristic Hollywood movies. The most notable feature of Mi Mix is undoubtedly the full-HD LCD screen which makes the huge 6.4-inch display panel, and the size is as big as the iPhone 7 Plus. This is the best feature because Xiaomi has not wasted any space. With the phone being as big as the Apple rival, the brilliant design provides more screen space to the user. But wait! The Chinese company gets it even better with the all ceramic body, which as a material is much stronger than glass or metal. Though the company showed off the ceramic body in its earlier Mi 5 device, the Mi Mix reveals the beauty of it. \nAlso read | Xiaomi Mi Mix Nano: New bezel-less smartphone leaked online; here’s what we know \nWhen it comes to specifications, the are as good as they come.

      "text": "Follow @MiserlyGeek Share this \nAfter writing-off Nokia acquisition, Microsoft has hardly announced any flagship smartphone. While it may seem that the Redmond-based company has given up on its smartphone dreams, that's apparently not the case. In an interview with Australian Financial Review , Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella stated that, \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device\" .While Microsoft continues to develop the phone software, the report claims that the tech-giant would not launch a new device category without \"bringing something different to the table\" . Nadella does not want to release phone only because others are doing it.If Microsoft manages build a unique phone, there's a good chance that it will be launched under the Surface brand. So far, Microsoft has launched phones with not so competitive specs. Especially, when compared to the Android flagships, Lumia phones always came across as underpowered devices. It will be interesting to see if that will change under Nadella's leadership.",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nOne of the interesting applications to come out of Microsoft’s HoloLens division is the idea of “holoportation”. Using this technology, a person wearing a HoloLens can see another person as a hologram , leading to a very futuristic way of communicating. \nUp until now though, holoportation required specially-designed rooms filled with cameras, and a high-speed internet connection. But Microsoft Researchers have managed to scale down some of the tech involved, especially in terms of bandwidth needed for data transfers, and managed to make holoportation into a mobile experience. \nAs you can see in the video above, engineers were able to rig a car with the required battery packs, cameras, and all the other pieces needed for this puzzle, and managed to transmit a hologram while on the move. \nThe team says it got bandwidth requirements down to 30-50 Mbps, a reported 97% reduction compared to their standard rigs. They were also able to use only two depth-sensing cameras, though the more of these you have the higher the hologram quality is. \nThe next obvious move, is to get those data rates even lower, where the system will be able to be used over a cellular connection. \nIf the research team is successful, we might soon be able to use devices like the HoloLens or the HTC Vive to talk to, look at, and walk around people or environments in real-time.",

      "text": "CERT to Microsoft: Don't Kill EMET, Windows 10 Is Not as Secure as You Think CERT to Microsoft: Don't Kill EMET, Windows 10 Is Not as Secure as You Think By 0 \nWill Dormann, a Vulnerability Analyst for the US-CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC), is advising Microsoft to continue developing EMET because Windows 10 does not provide the same protection measures, in spite of the company's claims. \nEarlier this month, Microsoft announced that it moved the EMET End-of-Life date from January 27, 2017, to July 31, 2018. \nIn its announcement, the company alluded that Windows 10 is as secure as EMET, just because many of EMET's features had been embedded in the operating system's core. Microsoft didn't embed all of EMET's features in Windows 10 \nDormann disagrees with Microsoft's statements. The security expert says that Microsoft did not integrate all of EMET's protection features. \nHe goes on into detail and splits EMET's protection features into two categories, System-Wide Protection and Application-Specific Protection, and explains that Microsoft only embedded a few of these in Windows 10, mostly at the OS core level. \nThe problem is that despite feature some of the EMET OS-level protection features, EMET is a fantastic security tool because of its multiple application-level defenses. \nThese application-specific EMET mitigations are applied as a runtime-injected library into the processes of other apps. Microsoft has not embedded all of EMET's application-level defenses into Windows 10, as Dormann highlights via a simple table. EMET protections comparison table (Credit: Will Dormann ) \nDormann's table shows that even an older Windows 7 OS with EMET installed is far better protected than an out-of-the-box Windows 10, which Microsoft claims is more secure. EMET had another role \nHe also highlights another problem, and that's the slow adoption of new technologies in user software. \n\"The problem is that the application needs to be specifically compiled to take advantage of CFG,\" which is Control Flow Guard, one of EMET's security features embedded in Windows 10. \n\"Out of all of the applications you run in your enterprise, do you know which ones are built with CFG support?\" Dormann asks. \"If an application is not built to use CFG, it doesn't matter if your underlying operating system supports CFG or not.\" \nEMET's role was to force these extra security features upon applications that didn't have them or the developers didn't bother taking advantage of them. Companies and users should continue deploying EMET \nFurthermore, the security experts recommend that companies continue to use and deploy EMET after the cut-off date. \n\"Just because Microsoft will stop supporting EMET after July 31, 2018 does not mean that the application will stop working beyond that date. It will likely continue to operate in the same way that it has been working all along. This EOL date simply means that you will not be able to get assistance from Microsoft after that date.\" \nLet's just hope Microsoft decides to open-source the EMET code. There are some people interested in continuing its development. If anybody at Microsoft wanted to open source EMET, I'd help. — Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) November 7, 2016",

      "text": "| Topic: Security \nA CERT researcher disputes Microsoft's argument that Windows 10 has \"all the mitigation features that EMET administrators have come to rely on\". Image: Will Dormann \nMicrosoft says its EMET security toolkit is redundant because Windows 10 has all its features, but that's not true, says a vulnerability analyst from Carnegie Mellon University's CERT. \nFor seven years EMET, or Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit, has been the go-to tool for Windows shops that can't patch a new flaw but still want to protect the network. \nEMET provides a number of exploit mitigations that can protect otherwise vulnerable systems, even when a bug isn't in a Microsoft product. \nHowever, earlier this month Microsoft announced plans to abandon EMET since, \"Windows 10 includes all of the mitigation features that EMET administrators have come to rely on such as DEP, ASLR, and Control Flow Guard (CFG) along with many new mitigations to prevent bypasses in UAC and exploits targeting the browser\". \nJeffrey Sutherland, a principal lead program manager in Microsoft's OS security team, said EMET can't keep up with modern threats and that it's easy to find \"trivial bypasses\" for it online. \nArguing that customers wanted EMET features built into Windows 10, Microsoft decided it will stop patching EMET after July 31, 2018 and encouraged customers who want better security to switch to Windows 10. \nCERT vulnerability analyst Will Dormann this week called on Microsoft to reverse its decision to retire EMET, arguing that Windows 10 does not provide the same protections as EMET. Dorman also shows that Windows 7 with EMET is better protected than Windows 10 without it. \nThe CERT Division is part of the non-profit, federally-funded Software Engineering Institute research-and-development center operated by Carnegie Mellon University. \nWindows 10 does provide some \"nice exploit mitigation\", says Dormann, but EMET does a better job of protecting non-Microsoft applications that don't always take advantage of underlying Windows exploit mitigations. \n\"The EMET library can modify the behavior of the target application by providing additional protections,\" explains Dormann. \n\"The application-specific-protection capability provided by EMET is where EMET really adds value. Because we cannot rely on all software vendors to produce code that uses all the exploit mitigations available, EMET puts this control back in our hands.\" \nIf customers opt against using EMET after Microsoft's end of life for the toolkit, Dormann recommends running an inventory of all software that would still be in use after Microsoft's cut-off date. \nThe date is even more important for products that don't receive patches from vendors. Dormann notes that Office 2007, which reaches end of support this year, will soon fit that category. \n\"With such out-of-support applications, it is even more important to provide additional exploit protection with a product like EMET,\" argues Dormann.

      "title": "Microsoft tweaks its Holoportation system to work wirelessly on the road",
      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nMicrosoft showed off its Holoportation system to us earlier in 2016, debuting how it enabled the digital transportation of a person’s fully captured 3D form in augmented reality. Now, however, Microsoft has shown that the technology will be possible to use away from Ethernet and powerful Wi-Fi connections, by taking the technology on the road.\nMicrosoft implanted the Holoportation capture system into a car and drove it around, utilizing the 3D-teleporting function to send a digital avatar of a user into various locations, despite the absence of a strong local internet connection. This was only possible because Microsoft was able to reduce the required bandwidth by as much as 97 percent, dropping it to around 30-50Mbps.\nAlthough this is still too much for current generation 4G networks, theoretically future 5G connections could see us Holoporting ourselves to all sorts of places while traveling. You could drive somewhere while your digital friend sits next to you to keep you company, or Holoport to a meeting you’re running late for.\nMore : Microsoft takes the Mannequin Challenge using HoloLens and the Actiongram app\nThe applications of Holoportation are impressive in their own right, but by reducing the bandwidth required to such a degree, Microsoft has made the technology portable and much more applicable for many more people around the world.\nAugmented reality and virtual reality technology have a high enough barrier for entry in terms of cost, space requirements, and technical know how. Killing off the need for an incredibly speedy internet connection tackles a major hurdle to making this sort of technology more accessible for the general populace.\nFor those looking to take their Holoportation system on the road, Microsoft claims that it takes only two cameras. Together they are capable of capturing the realistic 3D representation of a person or object — however the firm does add the caveat that the more cameras you have, the better the digital recreation.\nApple is injecting core services on iOS with AR technology, a new patent shows Everything you must know about Windows 10 Creators Update and Surface Studio 3D-printing startup working with Peugeot to rethink the ways cars are made",

REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo More (Reuters) - Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co , the corporate hardware and enterprise software business of Hewlett-Packard Co, forecast a current-quarter adjusted profit largely below analysts' estimates, sending its shares down 1.9 percent after the bell.\nHPE said it expects first-quarter adjusted profit between 42 cents and 46 cents. Analysts on average had expected profit of 46 cents per share according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nHowever, the company did beat analyst estimates for the fourth-quarter ended Oct. 31 by 1 cent with earnings of 61 cents per share, excluding items.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) also reported a 7.2 percent fall in revenue to $12.48 billion in its first year as a stand-alone company, hurt by weak demand for storage and networking equipment.\nCompetition has been stiff as more and more businesses move to the cloud and boost demand for cloud-based services.\nThis has forced some traditional technology companies such as HPE to change strategies and focus their efforts on fast-growing hardware businesses such as servers, networking and data storage hardware for the cloud.\nUnder Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman, HPE has sold off most of its software businesses, including its computing services unit, since the company spun off from Hewlett-Packard Co in 2015.\nStill, revenue in its enterprise group, the company's biggest business that offers servers, storage and networking services, fell 9.2 percent to $6.68 billion in the fourth quarter.\nLarger companies such as Cisco Systems Inc and Dell EMC have well established cloud hardware businesses to compete with HPE.\nNetworking revenue slumped nearly 34 percent, hurt in part by a slowdown in spending by the government in educational institutions that hit demand for both wireless and switching devices.\nSeparately, HP Inc , the legacy printing business of Hewlett-Packard Co, forecast an adjusted profit for the current quarter that was largely below analysts' estimates due to waning demand for its printers.\nHP Inc's shares were down nearly 2.2 percent after the bell.\n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Lisa Shumaker)",

      "title": "CPUBalance: improve PC responsiveness",
      "text": "CPUBalance is a program for Microsoft Windows devices that is designed to retain system responsiveness during high load times.\nIt is designed by the creators of Process Lasso , a popular application that does that as well, and a lot more.\nCPUBalance is powered by ProBalance, the process optimization technology that improves the responsiveness of the Windows PC.\nWhat makes CPUBalance unique is the fact that it ships with a more advanced version of ProBalance. While that functionality may find its way into Process Lasso eventually, CPUBalance will always feature the latest algorithm while Process Lasso may not.\nAnother interesting thing about CPUBalance is that it runs as a standalone application but also in cooperation with Process Lasso. If you have installed Process Lasso on your system, it will extend Process Lasso by adding the latest controls and engine updates to the application.\nCPUBalance \nNote : CPUBalance is currently offered as a beta software, and not free software. It is available for $9.95 for a limited period of time. This is a third of Process Lasso's yearly price of $29.95 and about a sixth of the lifetime license price of $57.\nCPUBalance adds an icon to the Windows System Tray on launch. It will run an update check as well which you cannot disable right now. While there is an option under \"check for updates\" when you right-click on the system tray, selecting it won't change the setting in the latest beta version.\nThe main program settings list quite an array of options to tweak the ProBalance configuration. The following options are provided right now:\nSet the minimum CPU usage when you want the program to start making automatic adjustments to improve responsiveness. Set per-process CPU usage when adjustments should start or stop. Set the allowed time over CPU quota before adjustments begin. Set the maximum and minimum time for adjustments. Lower processes to idle priority instead of below normal (not selected by default). Ignore all foreground processes, and all processes not running at normal priority. Exclude system services from restraint. Change affinity during restrained (only change CPU affinity, round robin CPU affinity selection, reduce CPU affinity by one randomly selected processors) (not selected by default) Disable ProBalance functionality when the PC is idle. (not selected by default). Lower I/O priority during restrating. Disable CPU Core Parking during ProBalance restraint. Set excluded processes. CPUBalance Insights \nCPUBalance Insights, which you can start from the system tray menu, is a log of sorts that lists the processes on the system that had to be retrained the most.\nEach process is listed with its name, count, frequency of action and the last restraint time and date.\nThere is little else to do there other than opening the logs which displays additional information and options to filter the listing.\nClosing Words It is difficult to test programs that improve PC responsiveness. Some say that these programs are mostly snake oil, while others swear on them.\nCPUBalance is a professionally designed program for Windows but it is quite difficult to come up with a target audience for the program. Process Lasso users may be interested in it as it extends the application, but is it worth the extra money? If Process Lasso works fine, there is little need to pay extra.\nNon Process Lasso users on the other hand may prefer free solutions such as the recently reviewed Project Mercury which offer similar functionality.\nNothing is keeping you from giving CPUBalance a try. You can download the program from the developer site currently and install it just fine without need for activation right away. This should give you enough time to find out if it is beneficial on your system.\nNow Read : Project Mercury is a free alternative to CPUBalance \nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post CPUBalance: improve PC responsiveness appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "title": "MacBook Pro (Touch Bar) vs. Microsoft Surface Book",
      "text": "Last month, Apple and Microsoft announced upgrades to its MacBook Pro and Surface Book hybrid respectively.\n\nApple’s key innovation was a Touch Bar , replacing the row of function keys on the keyboard. The Touch Bar has received mixed reviews. Some say it brings the “iPhone to the MacBook” in ease of use, some others see it as a gimmick and some oldtimers sorely miss the function keys.\nMicrosoft’s Surface Book had no visible changes – only a minor reduction in the gap when the hybrid tablet is attached to the keyboard. But in its higher-end models, Microsoft packed the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics card with 2GB of GDDR5 memory, compared with the Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB memory in the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro.\nThe MacBook Pro and Surface Book began shipping early this month and head-to-head comparisons have emerged. The verdict: MacBook Pro wins on speed, while the Surface Book is a runaway winner in gaming.\nThe verdict on Surface Book’s graphics is not surprising. PC World was among the early ones to hail it. Last month, just as the hybrid was launched, executive editor Gordon Mah wrote: “Microsoft claims its new Surface Book is ‘twice’ as fast as its equivalent MacBook Pro. Well, we ran some benchmarks, and hate to say it, but Microsoft lied. The Surface Book isn’t twice as fast. It’s three times as fast.”\nRunning the game Tomb Raider , PC World found the MacBook Pro running at a “pathetic sub-24 fps,” while the Surface Book recorded 74 fps.\nNow it seems to be acknowledged by everybody else. Even Gizmodo , which still reckons the Surface Book is “ridiculously overpriced,” concedes: “The Surface Book rendered frames (on the new game Civilization VI) at a speedy 59.4ms, while the MacBook Pro took nearly twice as long, averaging 98.8ms between frames.”\nIn overall speed, the MacBook Pro still scores with 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 in its priciest model versus an Intel Core i7 with Performance Base in the best Surface Book.\nIn PC World’s adapted tests – Cinebench R15 and Geek Bench 3 – the MacBook Pro was found to be running on consistently higher clock speeds, and a comfortable winner over the Surface Book.\nGizmodo tested the two devices on Adobe Photoshop, “the number one software choice for artists and photographers,” and on a web benchmark, and found MacBook Pro nosing ahead in both.\n“We batch processed two dozen RAW image files, cropping and resizing them. The MacBook Pro’s quad-core Core i7-6700HQ Skylake processor scorches compared to the dual-core Core i7-6600U Skylake processor in the Surface Book. It accomplished the batch process in just 49 seconds. The Surface Book took 66 seconds to do the same.” \nOn the WebXPRT benchmark – which tests the “ability to render images, process big chunks of numbers and even analyse DNA sequences” – the MacBook Pro scored a speedy 449, compared to Surface Book’s 395.\nSurface Book i7 prices start at $2,399 for the lowest-end configuration (256GB SSD, 8GB RAM). The highest-priced model (1TB, 16GB RAM) costs $3,299.\nThe MacBook Pro 13” with Touch Bar starts at $1,799. The 15” models start at $2,399.\nThe post MacBook Pro (Touch Bar) vs. Microsoft Surface Book appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "comments Microsoft has today announced that Microsoft Solitaire Collection is now available on iOS and Android devices with full Xbox LIVE integration. Microsoft Solitaire continues to be one of the most-played games of all time on Windows for more than 25 years. What’s more, the version of Solitaire you know and love on Windows 10 and Windows 8 PC and mobile devices, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, has reached more than 119 million unique players in the last four years alone! And now, those on iPhone, iPad and Android devices can play the popular card game for free.Microsoft Solitaire Collection offers five of the best Solitaire card games – Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid and Tripeaks – all in one app. The game also includes Daily Challenges, where you can play guaranteed solvable challenges every day in all five game modes with multiple levels of difficulty while earning cool awards.Plus, with Xbox Live integration, you can sign in with your Xbox Live Gamertag or Microsoft account to earn Xbox Live achievements and Gamerscore, compete with friends, and continue playing on any Windows 10, iPhone, iPad, or Android device while on the go since your progress and game data are saved in the cloud. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it), progress and achievements on the new platforms are linked to the Windows 10 version, which means there won't be any double or triple stacking available. It does mean, however, that the 35,000+ TA members who haven't earned all the achievements yet on the Windows 10 version, can now do so on the go. As a special bonus to celebrate the global launch on new platforms, players on iPhone, iPad and Android will receive one month of Premium (normally worth $1.99), which includes no ads, in-game boosts and double coins for all Daily Challenges.You can download Microsoft Solitaire Collection from the Apple App Store here and the Google Play Store here .

      "text": "Shares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT - Free Report ) have been steadily treading higher over the last one year. The stock generated a return of 8.87% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 7.87%.\nThe upward momentum in the stock has been primarily driven by strong cloud growth. The continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products are expected to generate top-line growth in 2016.\nMeanwhile, per a Reuters report, it is rumored that Microsoft is trying its best to get the European Commission’s approval for its $26.2 billion takeover of LinkedIn Corporation ( LNKD - Free Report ) that is scheduled for Dec 6. To that end, Microsoft will not only allow LinkedIn competitors to access to its own software, but will also give hardware manufacturers the freedom of opting to install services offered by its rivals.\nFor example, professional social networks that already have access to the company’s application program interface (API) will continue to enjoy that functionality even after the deal materializes. Additionally, hardware manufacturers such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ( HPE - Free Report ) , Dell and Lenovo will have the freedom to install any other professional social network on their devices.\nMICROSOFT CORP Price\nMICROSOFT CORP Price | MICROSOFT CORP Quote:\nWhy this Move?\nMicrosoft reportedly submitted the concessions related to its LinkedIn deal to the European Commission last week as the EU anticipates the deal to have adverse effects on competition. Moreover, as per the Reuters report, Microsoft is trying its bit to convince the EU that it is playing fair and is offering a level playing ground for competitors to prove their mettle.\nWe note that LinkedIn has posted encouraging results in the third quarter and witnessed a strong year-over-year improvement in both the top and the bottom line. Moreover, it recorded an impressive 18% surge in cumulative member count.\nLinkedIn’s traction in the mobile segment is particularly impressive, primarily attributable to the launch of its applications for Apple’s ( AAPL - Free Report ) iPhones and Android-based smartphones. Synergies from its acquisitions are expected to contribute to earnings through targeted marketing strategies over the long term.\nIf the EU gives the green signal for the deal, Microsoft will be able to tap into the strong user base of 433 million LinkedIn users to promote its own products as well as generate a healthy cash flow through ad revenues.\nLINKEDIN CORP-A Price\nLINKEDIN CORP-A Price | LINKEDIN CORP-A Quote:\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\nAt present, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "\nThe Xbox One UI has come a long way from the original confusing, bloated mess that Microsoft released with the console three years ago. Today, it’s mostly pleasant to use, and intuitive to figure out where things are- although some relics of the old UI still remain. These include the Guide Menu, which requires multiple button presses to get anything done, and the Snap Mode, which is never universally supported, and which seems to take away more utility from the player than it gives them.\nAccording to a rumor on Windows Central , both of these may be about to get very significant revamps- the Guide Menu apparently is being reworked to provide instant access to recently used apps, features, and softwares, and also to display pins. All of this is being done to reduce the number of steps it takes to get anything done.\nAnd what of the Snap Mode? Well, according to this rumor, it’s being removed entirely. It’s a relic of the old Xbox One UI, based on Windows 8, when Kinect was necessary to navigate the UI. It’s suboptimal to try and get Snap to work on a controller, and it’s not even properly supported – UWP apps don’t support it on Xbox One – all of which might be reasons as to why Microsoft are taking it away.\nOn my part, I say bring it. The Xbox One UI has come a long way, but still has a long way to go. If jettisoning legacy features that make no sense is what it takes to make the UI less convoluted, then by all means, Microsoft should go ahead.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior   @gcaweir · 7 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIn June, Chinese tech giant Xiaomi began pre-installing Microsoft's Office and Skype apps on its range of Android handsets. Now, it seems that that partnership is expanding to include the pre-loading of Microsoft's digital assistant too. \nCortana officially launched for Android, and iOS, just under a year ago , with Microsoft making the assistant available on rival platforms as an app, downloadable from their respective app stores. \nAs WinFuture spotted, Xiaomi has now begun pre-loading the Cortana app on its devices, starting with the Mi MIX. The flagship handset is the latest in Xiaomi's range, with a striking design featuring ultra-thin bezels, and a 6.4-inch display that extends into the curved corners of the device .",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Microsoft Solitaire Collection Arrives on iOS Classic PC solitaire game comes to iPhone and iPad by Aldrin Calimlim November 24, 2016 \nIf you’ve ever owned a Windows PC, chances are you’ve played Microsoft Solitaire, which has been around for more than 25 years. And now that you have an iOS device, you can play Microsoft Solitaire Collection , which includes not one, not two, but five solitaire card games, plus daily challenges and more. Microsoft Corporation Five game modes There's a reason the word \"Collection\" is in the name of the game. And that's because the game is a collection of five of arguably the best solitaire games, namely, Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid, and Tripeaks. Don't know how to play any of these games? No worries, since instructions and mechanics are displayed when you open a game mode for the first time, and the game also has a \"How to play\" section accessible from the menu anytime. \nHere are Microsoft’s brief descriptions of the five game modes: Klondike: Timeless & Classic Solitaire. Clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw. Also try out Traditional or Vegas scoring! Spider: Eight columns of cards await you. Clear them all with fewest moves possible. Play single suit or challenge yourself with four suits! FreeCell: Be strategic and use the four extra cells to move cards around and try to clear all cards from the table. FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead. Pyramid: Combine two cards that add up to 13 to remove them from the board. Challenge yourself to reach the top of the Pyramid and clear as many boards as you can! Tripeaks: Select cards in a sequence, earn combo points, and clear as many boards as you can before you run out of deals! Daily challenges Aside from the five modes, Microsoft Solitaire Collection will keep you coming back to the game for the daily challenges. Every day, you can play in exchange for special rewards by solving challenges with multiple difficulty levels in all five modes. Xbox Live integration Sign in with your Xbox Live gamertag or Microsoft account to unlock Xbox Live achievements, earn Gamerscore, compete with friends, and sync your game progress across your Windows, Android and iOS devices. Not yet an Xbox Live member? You can sign up for a free account right within the game. Microsoft Solitaire Collection \nSolitaire has been a staple of Windows PC gaming, as it were, for over two decades. So having Microsoft Solitaire Collection on iOS as well is a boon for iPhone and iPad owners who want to play solitaire on the go. That Microsoft Solitaire Collection for iOS includes five modes is already an impressive aspect of the game. But the inclusion of daily challenges and Xbox Live integration makes Microsoft Solitaire Collection an even more rewarding title. \nCompatible with iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, Microsoft Solitaire Collection is available now on the App Store for free. \nThe game includes a Premium upgrade, which removes ads and offers certain game incentives, for $1.99 per month. But the upgrade fee is waived through the end of the year to let players try the full game for a limited time. \nGet the game",

Until now, there is no accurate way to measure this.

The data is then rendered for golfer on a Microsoft Surface with an elegant Universal Windows Platform Application.\nRead more about this solution here .",

      "text": "\nThe Windows Store isn’t really seen as a go-to place for serious PC gaming, but Microsoft’s been working with third parties to change that. There’s been releases of various Telltale games , Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare , and now it looks like Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is also on its way.\nAnnounced in a post on the Japanese only website Dengeki Online , all of the game’s platforms were confirmed. There’s the usual – Steam, Xbox One, PS4, etc – but the Windows Store is also listed. There’s also some details on what features the game will support on each platform. While HDR support for the Xbox One version has been confirmed for quite some time now, it appears to be coming to both PC versions (Steam and Windows Store) of the game, too.\nAdditionally, the PC versions will also support resolutions up to 4K, letting you get the most out of your monitor while you’re getting spooked. When it comes to features exclusive to the Windows Store version, save data will be synced between both the PC and Xbox One versions of the game, even if it doesn’t look like we’ll see Resident Evil 7 join the Xbox Play Anywhere program any time soon. When Jez Corden from Windows Central contacted Capcom Europe’s PR, they simply restated the existence of the syncing feature and said that there’s no further information available at the time.\nWhen it comes to third party games on the Windows Store, even timed exclusives like Dead Rising 4 don’t seem to be joining in on Play Anywhere. It’s a shame, and hopefully more companies will end up realizing just how much cross-buy can help out consumers.\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard will be out January 24th, 2016. You can pre-order it on Amazon here .\nWill you be buying Resident Evil 7 on the Windows Store, or would you rather get the game on Steam (or a console)? Let us know why in the comments below! ",

      "text": "\nSolitaire, one of the most played games of all time, has finally landed on mobile. It is available for free as part of the Microsoft Solitaire Collection, which also includes Spider Solitaire, FreeCell, TriPeaks and Pyramid.\n\nAlthough the Windows version of Solitaire has evolved dramatically during its 25 campaign, it has never made the leap to platforms outside PC until now. The app comes with daily challenges for all five games, which can earn players badges and rewards. There is also Xbox Live support integration, allowing players to compete against family and friends, save their game data to the cloud, and continue playing on any Windows 10, iPhone or iPad device at a later stage.\nFans of the more traditional aesthetics can even select original victory animations, which are identical to the Windows 95 version.\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection is out now on Android and iOS . While the game is a free download, players will need to upgrade to the Premium version ($1.99 a month) to remove ads.\nThe post Microsoft Solitaire Collection is now available on Android & iOS appeared first on Gameranx .\n",

Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "title": "Microsoft: Windows 10 makes EMET unnecessary. Study: Nope",
      "text": "Microsoft plans to discontinue support for its Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit in July 2018 , and won't release a new version of EMET either.\nThis makes EMET 5.51 the last release version of the anti-exploit security software for Windows. The reason given by Microsoft was that Windows 10, Microsoft's new operating system, includes all the mitigation features \"that EMET administrators have come to rely on\" as well as new mitigations that are not part of EMET.\nMicrosoft stated openly that Windows 10 includes security features so that it is no longer necessary to run EMET (and thus for Microsoft to support it).\nWindows 10 and EMET EMET protection is divided into system-wide protection, and application-specific protection.\nData Execution Prevention (DEP), Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP),\nAddress Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Certificate Trust (Pinning), and Block Untrusted Fonts (Fonts) fall in the first group.\nData Execution Prevention (DEP), Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP), Null Page Allocation (NullPage), Heapspray Allocations (HeapSpray), Export Address Table Access Filtering (EAF), Export Address Table Access Filtering Plus (EAF+), Mandatory Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Bottom-Up Randomization (BottomUpASLR), ROP Mitigations (LoadLib,\nMemProt, Caller, SimExecFlow, StackPivot), Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) and Block Untrusted Fonts (Fonts) in the second group.\nWill Doorman at Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute created the following table that lists for each mitigation whether it is included in Windows 7 or 10, or in Windows 7 or 10 with EMET installed.\n\nIf you look at the table, you will notice quickly that vanilla Windows 10 does not offer the same level of protection as Windows 10 with EMET running.\nThe same can be said for the comparison of vanilla Windows 10 and Windows 7 that is running EMET.\nWhile it is true that Windows 10 supports several application mitigations out of the box so to speak, DEP, SEHOP, ASLR and BottupASLR to be precise, it is clear that the operating system does not include all protective features that EMET offers. Protective features in this regard mean application mitigations such as HeapSpray, EAF, MemProt or ASR.\nAs far as the supported options by Windows 10 are concerned, they are not enabled by default and need to be enabled in the Group Policy Editor.\nThe researcher comes to the conclusion that Microsoft's implication that users don't need EMET if they run Windows 10 is not true.\nMicrosoft strongly implies that if you are running Windows 10, there is no need for EMET anymore. This implication is not true. The reason it's not true is that Windows 10 does not provide the application-specific mitigations that EMET does.\nHe notes furthermore that Windows 10 does ship with additional protective measures, but that programs need to take advantage of them, and that this does not account for all the protective measures that EMET offers.\nHis recommendation is to use EMET if possible and if application-specific mitigations are configured by system administrators or users. If that is not possible for whatever reason, the next best thing is to configure mitigations that can be applied to Windows 10 without EMET. (via Deskmodder )\nAlternatives to EMET are Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit (also available in Malwarebytes Premium ), and HitmanPro.Alert .\nNow You : Do you run anti-exploit software?\nGhacks needs you.

      "title": "Microsoft now sharing Windows 10 telemetry data with third-party",
      "text": "By James Walker 22 mins ago in Technology Microsoft has begun to share telemetry data collected from computers running Windows 10 with a third-party company, according to reports today. Security firm FireEye will have access to data from \"every\" Windows 10 device as part of a new partnership. The policy change was reported by Australian news site ARN yesterday. Microsoft and FireEye recently agreed to embark on a new joint effort to improve the security of Windows 10. Microsoft will integrate FireEye's iSIGHT intelligent monitoring software into Windows Defender, the free anti-malware app that comes baked into Windows. It appears as though there's more to the deal than the two are talking about publicly though. FireEye will also get access to the wealth of Windows 10 telemetry data being created by the hundreds of millions of machines running the OS. Microsoft has agreed to give the firm the keys to data from \"every\" device running Windows 10, including PCs, tablets and smartphones. Windows 10 is known to do a lot of phoning home, something Microsoft has been widely criticised for since the platform's 2015 release. Microsoft doesn't report exactly what it collects from users' machines. According to the company, the data is used to improve Windows and assess how people use the software. Recently, it outlined how telemetry from Microsoft Edge revealed many users accidentally trigger the browser's development mode. As a consequence, it will be burying the relevant menus in a future release. Microsoft is keen to stress that the telemetry it collects benefits users. It insists everything is stored confidentially in a non-identifiable manner. However, it has previously admitted that it does take personal information from computers. It said that personal information is \"seldom taken,\" implying that it occasionally is. The company did not specify what is uploaded, where it's stored or why it's required. Similar unknowns remain around the deal with FireEye. It's the first time Microsoft has agreed to share its telemetry data with a third-party company. Some users could be concerned that it's setting a precedent for the future. Microsoft has practically said as much already. According to ARN , FireEye is accessing the data \"via a subscription billing model,\" thereby suggesting the resources are already available to other interested parties. Neither Microsoft or FireEye have explained why the data is being shared or what it will be used for. It remains unclarified whether the entire system's telemetry will be available or just logs from Windows Defender. Microsoft has not commented on the deal. FireEye sent a generic statement to ARN suggesting it will benefit Windows 10's overall security. \"FireEye has invested in nation-state grade intelligence and we are strategically partnering with industry leaders to operationalize this high-quality intel,\" said Ken Gonzalez, senior vice president of FireEye corporate development.",

With Black Friday and Cyber Monday coming up, cybercriminals hope more users are susceptible for opening an attachment coming from a popular online retailer. \nIn this case the malcious emails appear to be from Amazon and state that the order has been sent out. The criminals behind the scam have tried to make the mail look as legitimate as possible and the mail has a .ZIP file attached that ‘contains information about the order’. \nIn reality it contains a Javascript file with obfuscated code that is known a Nemucod , a Trojan downloader that will download the Locky ransomware to the computer that will start to encrypt files on the computer. \n“We see it every year: social engineering attacks that take advantage of the online shopping activities around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, targeting customers of online retailers”, Duc Nguyen and Wei Li write in a blog on Microsoft’s website. \nAs usual, Microsoft advises to not open emails and especially attachments from unknown addresses. Amazon also has a helpful page that can assist in identifying between a legitimate and fake email from the online retail giant. Related Forum:",

      "text": "Thursday, November 24, 2016 Wang Wei Cyber security is a major challenge in today's world, as cyber attacks have become more automated and difficult to detect, where traditional cyber security practices and systems are no longer sufficient to protect businesses, governments, and other organizations. In past few years, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning had made a name for itself in the field of cyber security, helping IT and security professionals more efficiently and quickly identify risks and anticipate problems before they occur. The good news is that if you are a Windows 10 user, Microsoft will now offer you a machine learning based threat intelligence feature via its inbuilt Windows security service, which will improve the security capabilities available on Windows 10 devices. But, the bad news is that it is not free. The company is offering this \"differentiated intelligence\" feature on its newly added service to Windows 10, dubbed Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP), which helps enterprises detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks on their networks. This becomes possible after Microsoft recently signed a deal with FireEye that integrates the security vendor's iSIGHT Threat Intelligence into Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. As part of the partnership, Microsoft will give FireEye access to all the telemetry data from every device running Windows 10, Australian website ARN reports . \"FireEye has invested in nation-state grade threat intelligence, and we are strategically partnering with industry leaders to operationalize this high-quality intel,\" Ken Gonzalez, FireEye's Vice President of Corporate Development, said in the official press release . \"By working with Microsoft, we’re able to offer differentiated threat intelligence within WDATP and together help make organizations more secure.\" It's no secret that Windows 10 collects all sorts of usage information on users and sends them back to Microsoft, which then uses this telemetry data to help identify security issues, fix problems and improve the quality of its operating system. This telemetry data includes information on the device running Windows 10, a list of installed apps, crash dumps, and other statistics from devices powered by its latest operating system. However, this Microsoft's data mining capability also raised some privacy concerns among Windows users. This newly-signed deal with FireEye is the first time that Microsoft has publicly agreed to share telemetry data of Windows 10 users with a third-party, which is definitely worrying for many users. At this moment, the official press release says nothing about Microsoft providing FireEye with access to data collected from Windows 10 users. Microsoft has yet to comment on this matter.",

      "text": "Satya Nadella Reveals the next Microsoft Phone Will Be the ‘Ultimate Mobile Device’ Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 24, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nMicrosoft has been struggling with its smartphone division since a long time. The company purchased Nokia to bolster its smartphone and Windows Phone division, but that eventually led the company to suffer heavy losses. However, despite being missing from the smartphone market for over a year now, it looks like the Redmond company has not given up on its smartphones ambitions. \nMicrosoft’s CEO Satya Nadella has said in an interview with the Australian Financial Review that the company is in no rush to enter into any device category where it cannot bring something new to the table. \n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,” he said. \nHe also said that the company will continue to be “in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate device.” \nThis comment from Nadella has sparked off rumors about Microsoft working on the ultimate Surface phone. Microsoft has launched some innovative and breakthrough products under its Surface brand over the last few years, including the recently unveiled Surface Studio . While the Surface brand struggled initially, it has turned out to be among the most successful divisions of the Redmond company in recent times. \nWindows Phone fans out there are hoping that Microsoft will launch a similar Surface Phone that would bring the company back in the smartphone game. There are no leaks surrounding this rumored Surface Phone, so at this point of time it could very well be a figment of imagination of Windows Phone fans that are still out there. However, if and when Microsoft does plan to launch a Surface Phone, it could turn out to be a game changer much like other Surface products from the company.",

      "text": "Microsoft gaming Microsoft launches Solitaire games on iOS and Android \nIf you're hankering for \"the good old days,\" Microsoft has just released the Microsoft Solitaire Collection for iOS and Android. \nFor many of us, Solitaire (especially Klondike Solitaire) was something we played to waste time before we had the Internet - okay, we also played Solitaire when we had dial-up Internet connections as well but that's because everything took ages to load in those days. \nAnyway, the Microsoft Solitaire Collection gathers together five Solitaire games you could find on your Windows PC - namely, Klondike, Spider, Freecell, Tripeaks and Pyramid. \nThese Solitaire games have Xbox Live integration too, which means that you can add the achievements and badges from the game to your Xbox Live account. \nYour game is also saved to the Cloud so you can continue on other devices that you've connected your Xbox Live account to. \nWhile the game itself allows you to download and play all the different versions of Solitaire for free, it does have advertisements. \nIf you want to go ad-free, Microsoft has a \"Premium\" subscription service where you will be charged US$1.99 (about RM8.70) per month - the premium subscription also gives you game boosts and also double coins for completing daily challenges. \nWe don't know about you, but we're not sure anyone would be willing to pay almost RM9 every month for the privilege of playing Solitaire ad-free (admittedly with a few other benefits) on their smartphones. \nNevertheless, the game is available to download now on iOS here and on Google Play here - if you download it now you get a free month of the Premium subscription to go with the game. \nBe the first to post comment.

      "text": "The first fashion shoot with the iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode \nHang on, everyone, because it took Microsoft four years but they finally have a comeback to a remark that Tim Cook made. \nPaul Thurrott informs us that the jerk store is holding on line one: “Satya Nadella Toasts Tim Cook.” \nHow nice! What was the toast? “You, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar! To your health!” \nEh, no, not that kind of toasting. \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has finally taken Apple CEO Tim Cook to task for his hypocritical comments about 2-in-1 PCs. \nPlease explain what, in fact, you are currently discussing, Willis. \nAnd it’s about freaking time. \nIndeed! Those sick burns from 2012 will not stand! \nWhat was it that Cook said that it took Microsoft four years to come up with a retort to? \n“You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going be pleasing to the user.” \nAh, the toasterfridge! Remember the toasterfridge? We were so young. So full of hope! Microsoft full of the hope that it would be relevant again. But, hey, they are. So, good for them. \nWhich explains why Mr. Cook’s Apple released its own 2-in-1 computer, the iPad Pro, just three years later. \nOK, yes, Apple now sells an iPad with a keyboard. But there’s still a real difference here. Apple makes two different operating systems — one optimized for touch, the other for keyboard and mouse input. While putting a keyboard on an iPad and the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro converges them slightly, they’re still distinctly separate. Microsoft, meanwhile, makes a screeching two-headed gorgon of an operating system, an awkward cacophony of input methods and user interfaces that attempts to serve two masters, but does not serve either of them well. \nSee the difference? \nSo Apple, like Microsoft and the PC industry before it, saw convergence as the solution. And the iPad was converged to be more like a 2-in-1 PC. To be more—a lot more—like Surface. \nYes, the iPad was made more like the device that copied it. Good comeback. \nMicrosoft is making nice devices. The only problem is that when you power them on they still run Windows 10. \n“Take Surface,” [Nadella] said, referring to boldness and risk. “Three years ago, the 2-in-1 as a form factor was questioned. Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it’s not a refrigerator and a toaster but it’s actually a 2-in-1.” \nBut it isn’t. Putting a keyboard on it doesn’t change the fact that the primary user interaction is done by and designed for touch. You can keep calling it a 2-in-1 but that doesn’t mean it’s like the Surface. \nAs for competition, Microsoft’s is far less Apple than it is Windows OEMs. The Macalope would argue that the Surface’s success to date is not so much from people who are dying to touch their Windows screens than it is people who would rather have well-built devices that aren’t stuffed with bloatware. Which Apple has known for years. \nThis shows me a couple of things. \nOne, Mr. Cook’s words had their intended hurtful impact… \nOh, my god. Will the powerful CEO who makes millions of dollars ever recover from this slight? \nTwo, and this is no surprise, Nadella is a class act. He could have gone a lot further in his calling out of Mr. Cook–for example, by naming names… \nCook didn’t name names, either, but he is apparently a horrible, mud-slinging bully. \nWhile Nadella did, finally, respond to Cook’s comment of four years ago, he didn’t so much toast it as he fridged it.

      "text": "Translate \nMicrosoft’s proposed acquisition of professional social network LinkedIn is set to receive European Union approval. \nSources told Reuters the recent concessions made by Microsoft have changed the minds of European commissioners and that the U.S. software firm’s $26-billion, all-cash deal will get the go-ahead. \nMicrosoft promised the European Commission it would give its rivals access to its Outlook add-ins program, enabling profiles from competing social networks to appear in Outlook. Microsoft also pledged to permit PC makers such as Dell and HP to disable a LinkedIn shortcut that is packaged on the desktop of some computers. \nMicrosoft in June announced its intention to acquire LinkedIn, in a deal that would give the Redmond company access to the professional social network’s 433 million members. \nSalesforce, which also tried to acquire the professional social networking firm, has been one of the most outspoken parties against the transaction and has been asking regulators to block the deal. Salesforce contends that it and other rivals would not be given access to LinkedIn’s dataset of users. \nSalesforce said if it had purchased LinkedIn it would “have used the data within our own services appropriately and also licensed it to others,” adding the “chances of Microsoft doing the same without government intervention are slim.” \nStill, Reuters sources seem to indicate that Salesforce’s concerns are not shared by the European Commission. \nThe Commission is to rule on the matter by Dec. 6.

      "text": "Microsoft Set To Win Eu Approval For Linkedin Buy Source: thewillnigeria.com Previous | Next \nMicrosoft (MSFT.O) is set to gain EU approval for its $26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD.N) with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday. \nMicrosoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedIn’s rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition. \nThe second plank of the concession is important because of the company’s battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros. \nThe slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue. \nThe deal, Microsoft’s largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nHowever, it came amidst regulatory concerns and citizens’ worries about big data and that some companies may use the huge amount of information they gather to squeeze out competitors and encroach on users’ privacy. \nThe deal has been criticized by U.S. rival Salesforce (CRM.N), which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn and which urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving it. \nThe Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 6, as well as Microsoft, declined to comment. \nAuthorities in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa have already nodded through the acquisition without demanding concessions. \nThe bulk of LinkedIn’s $3 billion annual revenue comes from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nREUTERS",

      "text": "E-mail \nIntroduced for the first time by Microsoft in 1990 as part of Windows 3.0, Solitaire is one of the most popular games in the world. However, what some of you might not know is that it was originally created to help users get familiarised with different aspects of a graphical user interface. Its popularity encouraged Microsoft to implement it in pretty much every other Windows version since then, and even though it was removed from Windows 8 for some reason, it can be downloaded separately from the Windows Store. With Windows 10, the company launched a brand new “Solitaire Collection” that includes the classic version of the game as well as a few other variants. \nThe good news is that this game bundle is now available on for iOS and Android devices as well, and it comprises five games that users can play for free: Pyramid, Tripeaks, Klondike, FreeCell and Spider. The standard Solitaire Collection is free (it has ads), but there’s also a rather cheap paid version available that costs just $1.99 and doubles the coin rewards received for daily challenges. Downloading the game before the end of the year will include one free month of Premium access, which is always nice. Solitaire is known as “the most-used Windows application in the world,”as more than 119 million people have played it on Windows 10 PCs and Windows-powered mobile devices in the last four years.",

      "text": "up vote 2 down vote accepted \nAlthough this question was originally asked in 2011, someone decided today, 5 years later, that it was a good idea to make a comment on a 5 year-old answer. Which was enough to make me to want to update my answer to reflect my more current views. Since it still shows up in search results, I think it's worth making the answer more up-to-date. \nSeveral new versions of Windows and several new versions of Data Protection Manager have come out since you asked this question. \nBack in 2011, installing DPM on Server Core was difficult to impossible, depending on the version of DPM you were using, which specific components of DPM you were trying to install, (the agent or the server?) and your willingness to hack things like DCOM permissions to get it actually working. (And yes, there is still a lot of software, including Microsoft's own software, that doesn't run on Server Core because Server Core does not support the full .NET framework. Especially not back in 2011, when this question was asked.) \nBut, time has marched on and there have been new developments. \nIf you're talking about installing the DPM Agent on Server Core, you'll find examples of people successfully installing the agent from DPM 2012 on 2012 Core , albeit not entirely hassle-free. \nHere is an example of even getting the agent installed on 2008 R2 core, again, with some extra fiddling required. \nIn the archived (read: outdated) Microsoft documentation that you cited, 2008 R2 Core was supported as being able to install the agent even as far back as DPM 2010, however, the DPM 2010 server component itself was not supported on Core. \nNow, onto documentation that is recent as of 2016. \nThat link is a great compatibility matrix with regards to System Center 2016, including DPM. It shows that the agent can be installed on either Server Core or Server with \"Desktop Experience,\" and the DPM Server component can be installed on Server Core as well, but the Remote Administration console still requires the \"Desktop Experience,\" i.e., not Server Core. \nHope that helps.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMicrosoft showed off its Holoportation system to us earlier in 2016, debuting how it enabled the digital transportation of a person’s fully captured 3D form in augmented reality. Now, however, Microsoft has shown that the technology will be possible to use away from Ethernet and powerful Wi-Fi connections, by taking the technology on the road. \nMicrosoft implanted the Holoportation capture system into a car and drove it around, utilizing the 3D-teleporting function to send a digital avatar of a user into various locations, despite the absence of a strong local internet connection. This was only possible because Microsoft was able to reduce the required bandwidth by as much as 97 percent, dropping it to around 30-50Mbps. \nAlthough this is still too much for current generation 4G networks, theoretically future 5G connections could see us Holoporting ourselves to all sorts of places while traveling. You could drive somewhere while your digital friend sits next to you to keep you company, or Holoport to a meeting you’re running late for. \nMore : Microsoft takes the Mannequin Challenge using HoloLens and the Actiongram app \nThe applications of Holoportation are impressive in their own right, but by reducing the bandwidth required to such a degree, Microsoft has made the technology portable and much more applicable for many more people around the world. \nAugmented reality and virtual reality technology have a high enough barrier for entry in terms of cost, space requirements, and technical know how. Killing off the need for an incredibly speedy internet connection tackles a major hurdle to making this sort of technology more accessible for the general populace. \nFor those looking to take their Holoportation system on the road, Microsoft claims that it takes only two cameras. Together they are capable of capturing the realistic 3D representation of a person or object — however the firm does add the caveat that the more cameras you have, the better the digital recreation.",

      "title": "Xiaomi partners with Microsoft; Mi Mix to get Windows Cortana Assistant",
      "text": "Interestingly, Xiaomi is not the first Android company to make a tie-up with Microsoft for Cortana. Earlier OnePlus, also from China, had done it for its Cyanogen users. Microsoft, in turn, has upgraded its Cortana app in the new Windows 10 Anniversary version, especially by making it accessible from the lock screen itself. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has reportedly made a tie-up with global tech giant Microsoft to bring the voice assistant Cortana to the Mi Mix smartphone. According to a report in mspoweruser, earlier the Chinese company has partnered with Microsoft Office Suite and video-calling apps, and now the discussions are on to pre-install Cortana into the Mi Mix device. But interestingly, Xiaomi is not the first Android company to make a tie-up with Microsoft for Cortana. Earlier OnePlus, also from China, had done it for its Cyanogen users. Microsoft, in turn, has upgraded its Cortana app in the new Windows 10 Anniversary version, especially by making it accessible from the lock screen itself.\nAccording to the mspoweruser report, the Senior Vice President at Xiaomi, Xiang Wang was Quote: d as having said in June, “We are excited to be working closely with Microsoft on a broad technology collaboration partnership. As demonstrated by this agreement with Microsoft, Xiaomi is looking to build sustainable, long-term partnerships with global technology leaders, with the ultimate goal of bringing the best user experience to our Mi fans.”\nSmartphone makers around the globe have been trying to make better bezel-less devices, and some have even been successful. But those devices lacked in other features. Xiaomi has shown what is possible with the edgeless design. Mi Mix is designed by the famous French designer Phillippe Starck. The design is very subtle, yet looks like one of those devices used in futuristic Hollywood movies. The most notable feature of Mi Mix is undoubtedly the full-HD LCD screen which makes the huge 6.4-inch display panel, and the size is as big as the iPhone 7 Plus. This is the best feature because Xiaomi has not wasted any space. With the phone being as big as the Apple rival, the brilliant design provides more screen space to the user. But wait! The Chinese company gets it even better with the all ceramic body, which as a material is much stronger than glass or metal. Though the company showed off the ceramic body in its earlier Mi 5 device, the Mi Mix reveals the beauty of it.\nAlso read | Xiaomi Mi Mix Nano: New bezel-less smartphone leaked online; here’s what we know\nWhen it comes to specifications, the are as good as they come. It is powered by the latest Snapdragon 821 at 2.35GHz with a RAM of 4GB and storage of 128GB and a 6GB variant with a storage of 256GB. The smartphone is fueled by a big 4400mAh battery along with the Quick Charge 3.0. With HD audio quality it has a 192kHz / 24-bit resolution. The smartphone has a 16MP PDAF rear camera. Xiaomi Mi Mis comes with the MIUI 8 OS.",
