Guest - 11 months ago https://youtu.be/TT4vbK1K1wo tells how to use a 4 wire. Works on mine. Guest - 11 months ago The thermostat works great, if you have a 5 wire setup. you have to have a 'common' wire to be able to provide the power to run the wifi. I only have 4 wires...and will be a pain to get a 5 wire string to it...so i'm gonna sell mine on ebay.Everything worked except the AC unit when using 4 wires...so take your old one off the wall first and look...or check at the air unit how many wires ya got. Guest - 11 months ago For the average user, so you don't have to get up to change the temperature. For advanced users you can potentially program and automate part of your home with this. upx1 (L9 Corporal) - 1 year ago Sold Out.PS - I like the Wifi capability. pacfolly (Freebie Lover) - 1 year ago Why would you need a WiFi thermostat?

By Dee DePass Star Tribune November 26, 2016 — 1:39pm Honeywell photos If Honeywell’s Vector Occupant app is successful, it will generate millions in new revenue, officials said. It is the company’s latest “Internet of Things” offering. Purchase: Order Reprint The office too cold? Too hot? Forgot your office ID badge? Don’t sweat it. Honeywell has an answer. The company’s new Vector Occupant app lets workers use their cellphones to change office temperatures or to gain access into locked buildings when they forget their ID cards at home. Honeywell says the app is a win because it quickly gives locked-out workers access to their office without needing to call for help or replace ID badges. Employees simply hold up their phone app to the black card readers instead of their plastic ID cards. The app helps ID the worker and only unlocks doors per the employer’s programming. The technology could eliminate the need for plastic ID cards and cut replacing or reprogramming costs. It’s also expected to beef up comfort, officials said. By pressing a button, the cloud-backed app lets employees alert facilities managers when a work area is too hot or cold. The managers then press a button to acknowledge the complaint and click others to remotely change temperature settings, without visiting floors to manually adjust thermostats. The integrated system also lets the managers identify temperature patterns. Right now, the app focuses on building access and comfort, but will eventually expand to help employees find their way around a building, officials said. Honeywell’s Himanshu Khurana said, “Reaction was very positive” to the new app. It took Honeywell less than a year and 40 software, IT and product development gurus in Golden Valley and Bangalore to bring the technology to market. There are competitors, but most are small and none are as heavily integrated as Honeywell, officials said. The app was developed with the help of the security-badge gurus at Texas-based HID Global. The system was initially tested using 200 Honeywell employees in Golden Valley. From there, it spread to six Honeywell buildings and then piloted at four customer sites in Chicago and London, and St. Paul and Centerville, Minn. Now it’s ready for sale and making its way around to trade shows around the world. The Vector Occupant app debuted in June at a trade show in London, and in the U.S. at another trade show in September. “Reaction was very positive” and prompted a flurry of inquiries from architects and building construction firms looking to bring the hottest technology to building managers and tenants,” said Himanshu Khurana, engineering director for Honeywell Building Solutions. The app also won inquiries from security experts wanting to make buildings secure while easing access for approved personnel. “People see a lot of innovation and focus around getting better security that can keep the bad guys out. But they don’t see enough innovation surrounding how to let good people get in easier,” he said. “We’re changing that.” The app is the latest “Internet of Things” offering from New Jersey-based Honeywell, a company known for its temperature control systems. Honeywell is increasingly monitoring and controlling building features with connected devices. If successful, the Vector Occupant app will generate millions in new revenue, officials said. In beta tests, users liked that smartphones require security codes, a security feature most employee ID badges don’t have. They also liked that the app can be quickly customized. “Buildings are alive and teeming with opportunities for users to interact with them — if you can make the right connections,” said John Rajchert, president of Honeywell Building Solutions unit. “Smartphones and apps continue to enhance our everyday lives, from allowing us to hail a cab to giving us direct insight into where we stand on a restaurant waiting list. We’re now applying these same concepts of insight and control to how one interacts with a building.” This summer, the 22,000-member Eagle Brook Church in Centerville and Lino Lakes beta-tested the app, which gave nearly 200 employees and church leaders access to six buildings and tracked the data. Tom Tulberg, the church’s information technology director, said the app helped. “One of the biggest challenges for us, having 200 people spread across multiple locations, is that everybody has to have a scanning card. And they break. And too often people forget their badge and need another one. Because we have separate buildings with access systems that are separate from one another, the cards have to be coded for every building,” Tulberg said. “So the Honeywell app is a means for us to have one central location where we can set up a user for access to any of our locations and control what portions of those buildings that they can get to.” Customer pricing will vary on building complexity and the number of employees using the app. On a per employee basis, it should be “significantly less than a cup of coffee,” Khurana said.",

      "text": "By: Research and Markets via PR Newswire  10 PM EST Research and Markets - Global Commercial Smoke Detector Market to Grow 4% by 2020 - Key Vendors are Honeywell, Siemens & Tyco \nDUBLIN , Nov 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- \nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"Global Commercial Smoke Detector Market 2016-2020\" report to their offering. \nThe report forecasts the global commercial smoke detector market to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% during the period 2016-2020.The report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. \nOne of latest trends in the market is integration of smoke detectors with building systems. Smoke detectors are being increasingly integrated with global building systems. The integration yields various operational and economic benefits. Some of the benefits include reduced cost of the overall systems, decreased energy use, and enhanced communication during emergency situations. The smoke detector industry is setting basic standards for dependability of smoke detection systems with other building systems. Various safety standards are being set to prevent any human error that may cause disconnection of smoke detectors. Systems are being developed to prioritize smoke detection systems in case of heavy protocol traffic in the building systems. Vendors like Honeywell provide customized integration-based solutions for safety systems. Honeywell's EBI integrates life safety solutions with other building management systems that allow the user to not only maintain more cost-effective control over increasingly complex facilities but also respond faster and more effectively to emergencies. \nAccording to the report, one of the primary drivers in the market is increased investment and growth in construction industry. Development in the construction industry gives a significant boost to the global commercial smoke detector market. Construction activities in the commercial sector have increased the demand for smoke detectors as they improve building safety, thus generating high revenue for the global commercial smoke detector market.

      "text": "Sign up for our Security newsletter ROLLE, Switzerland, Nov. 30 (UPI) -- Honeywell has been contracted to provide TALIN navigation equipment for the British Army's new AJAX armored fighting vehicles.\nTALIN is a laser-guided land navigation system that can be installed on military and commercial platforms. The devices weight roughly 13 pounds per unit, and can be installed in a variety of ways. Honeywell says the product is smaller and lighter than other competing navigation solutions.\n\"Over 15,000 Honeywell TALIN systems are deployed by land, air and sea on more than 60 military and commercial platforms worldwide,\" Honeywell senior OEM director Milind Ghanekar said in a press release . \"The British Army's AJAX program builds on our extensive experience with this highly precise navigation technology.\"\nBy receiving the contract, Honeywell joins General Dynamics in supporting the British Army's new fleet of AJAX armored fighting vehicles . Originally known as the Scout, military officials estimate the final product will weight between 38 and 42 tons, and will be armed with an L94A1 coaxial 7.62mm chain, and a PMRS weapon station.\nAdditional capabilities will include acoustic detectors, a laser warning system, and an electronic counter-measure system. Honeywell is confident their contributions will make the AJAX a formidable asset on the battlefield.\n\"Soldiers depend on technologies to provide unparalleled precision aboard their combat vehicles, as do workers using sensor platforms or mining equipment,\" Ghanekar added.\n Kratos announces final pre-production BQM-177A milestone Independent report recommends changes in U.K. shipbuilding Raytheon to provide missile warning systems for Taiwan",

      "text": " Honeywell\n- Honeywell technology being used to support reliable and safe operations on about 94,000 miles of pipelines globally, enough to circle the world nearly four times\n- TANAP pipeline will help meet European demand for natural gas\nISTANBUL, Turkey Honeywell (NYSE: HON) Process Solutions (HPS) announced it will provide an integrated control and safety system for the strategically important Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) in Turkey .\nThe system will ensure reliable and safe operations of compressor stations along the entire length of the pipeline. The Southern Gas Corridor is a critical part of the European Union's strategy to enhance its energy security. The TANAP system will be able to transport up to 31 billion cubic meters per year of Caspian and nearby regions' natural gas.\n\"Honeywell has a long history of working with critical energy projects in Turkey ,\" said Orhan Genis , president of Honeywell in Turkey and Central Asia . \"This important project will help to secure a supply of natural gas not only to this country but across Europe .\"\nThe 1,850-kilometer long TANAP will carry natural gas from Turkey's eastern border with Georgia to its western border with Greece . According to Eurogas, demand for natural gas in Europe will grow at about 2 percent a year through 2030.\n\"Honeywell's integrated solutions will enable TANAP to detect and resolve operational issues early, enhancing reliability for this important project,\" said Pieter Krynauw, vice president and general manager for HPS' Projects and Automation Solutions business. \"Honeywell provides automation controls and safety solutions for almost 94,000 miles of natural gas and liquid pipelines, including many of the world's longest systems.\"\nHoneywell will provide the project with fully integrated control and safety solution products, technology, engineering and support. It includes the distributed control system (DCS), emergency shutdown system (ESD), and an extensive fire and gas solution consisting of safety systems, fire alarm panels, and a full range of process and non-process area detectors and devices).\nHoneywell's system integrates all process control and safety systems and automation software under a single unified architecture at TANAP Stations. The system improves operators' visibility and situational awareness to detect, avoid and respond to incidents that could endanger people, the pipeline or the environment. It will also help TANAP provide uninterrupted supply through the pipeline.\nThe TANAP project employs some of Honeywell's leading technologies:\nExperion ® PKS (Process Knowledge System) advanced automation platform and software applications help improve business performance and peace of mind. Drawing on data from across the pipeline, Experion PKS helps operators make fast effective decisions to improve safety, reliability and efficiency. Safety Manager , Honeywell's safety solution, integrates process safety data, applications, system diagnostics and critical control strategies to detect and prevent dangerous conditions. As well as automatic, safe emergency shutdown, Safety Manager will also give TANAP tools for root-cause analysis to drive improved system performance.

      "text": "When key executives at Honeywell ( HON ) and Siemens ( SI ) attempt to identify candidates for divestitures and carve outs, simply put, they're looking for businesses that no longer fit within their massive portfolios.\nBusinesses that are either not accretive to earnings, or are actually dilutive to earnings, or are not driving cross-divisional synergies often become divestiture candidates, Siemens' Head of Americas M&A Kenneth Meyers said during The Deal Economy Event conference in New York on Thursday.\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article was originally published by The Deal, a sister publication of TheStreet that offers sophisticated insight and analysis on all types of deals, from inception to integration. Click here for a free trial.\nWitness Honeywell's September spinoff of its $1.3 billion-in-sales resins and chemicals business AdvanSix ( ASIX ) , which sources have called a cyclical commodity chemicals business with low growth.\nOn the other hand, selling also can be a bi-product of buying.\n\"Part of our divestiture strategy is ironically driven by acquisition,\" Meyers said. \"We make large acquisitions and there's always things we find later that don't really fit. The more we buy, the more we sell.\"\nTo be sure, acquisitions and divestitures go hand-in-hand for large industrial conglomerates like Siemens and Honeywell.\nIn mid-November, Siemens announced it acquired Mentor Graphics ( MENT ) for $4.5 billion one week after it said it would spin off its health care business, known as Healthineers.\nMeanwhile, in the past 15 years, Honeywell has made 95 acquisitions that have added $15 billion in revenue, while simultaneously divesting 65 businesses that shed about $8 billion in revenue of the conglomerate's balance sheet, Honeywell's Global Head of M&A Anne Madden said at the conference Thursday.\nAnd investors have rewarded them for that dual-approach strategy with a market value that has grown by almost 240% in the same timeframe.\n\"I think you have to be able to do both,\" Madden said. \"Because it's an organic animal, and you have to continue to watch what's coming in, what then needs to come out.\"\nBut identifying and constructing a proper carve out transaction, or even a full-on divestiture, is far from foolproof.\nThat's why it's important to actively review your portfolio on a regular basis, EY's global divestiture advisory services leader Paul Hammes said at The Deal Economy Event.\nIn a recent survey, Hammes said EY consistently found that companies that review their portfolios on a quarterly basis were much more likely to generate a sales price above expectations than those that review their portfolios annually.\nPractice does make perfect, Honeywell's Madden admitted, noting that the company has invented and copyrighted a system termed the \"Demise Curve\" to determine when a business is ripe for offering.",

For about six hours that followed, residents in the area were ordered to stay indoors, keep their windows closed, and turn off their air conditioners until the leak was stopped. \nThe class action lawsuit, filed in September, does not mention any physical injuries to the seven plaintiffs. The lawsuit alleges that Honeywell was responsible for the leak and that multiple factors contributed to it, including \"failing to properly handle and contain the hazardous and harmful substance,\" as well as allegedly \"employing untrained or poorly trained employees.\" \nThe plaintiffs are represented by Gonzales attorneys Kenneth Dupaty and Jeffrey Michael Heggelund. \nWAFB-TV received a subpoena Thursday, December 1 from attorneys representing the plaintiffs, requesting copies of our news reports of the incident. \nHoneywell issued the following statement to WAFB-TV late Thursday in which it says it will fight the lawsuit. \nHoneywell’s emergency response team at Geismar worked to immediately mitigate and stop this leak, and instructed employees of the site and two neighboring sites to shelter in place as a precaution. The flooded area is mainly on property owned by Honeywell and is uninhabited. We do not believe the leak posed a threat to people or the environment, and we are working to defend the lawsuit. ",

      "text": "The struggle with operational challenges by manufacturers has weighed down earnings of Honeywell Flour Plc. Chris Ugwu reports \n\nAs infrastructural deficit, particularly electricity supply and bad road network, continues to hit hard on manufacturers, prevailing macro-economic indicators subsequently point to a sector which is headed for collapse if adequate measures are not taken to arrest the situation. \nThis is because the cumulative effect of the scarcity of forex, falling oil prices, security challenges, the resurgence of restiveness in the Niger Delta and the continued depletion of foreign reserves have all continued to pose serious threats to businesses and social activities in the country. \nThe sector is also groaning under the pressure of increased cost and scarcity of the dollar, rising cost of raw materials, driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment, coupled with fiscal and monetary headwinds which have resulted in marked reduction in domestic output. \nMarket analysts believe the lingering weak inflow of forex into the economy and the consequent CBN policy measures suggest no near respite for the forex induced pressure. \nGiven headwinds such as weak demand on the back of a squeeze on household wallets, most consumer goods companies in Nigerian have continue to find it difficult to weather the storm. One of such companies negatively affected is Honeywell Flour Plc, which has seen continuous decline in profits. \nThe company began the year in an unimpressive note, which market watchers attributed to weak consumer demands, stiffer competition and lack of accessibility to key markets in the northern part of the country. \nMarket sentiments for the shares of Honeywell, one of Nigeria’s fast moving consumer goods companies listed on the floor of the Nigeria Stock Exchange, have also dwindled relatively due to challenging environment. \nThe share price, which closed at N1.46 per share in January 2016, recorded a dip in growth. At the close of transaction on Friday, the company’s share price stood at 98 kobo, representing a decline of 48 kobo or 32.87 per cent year to date. \nFinancials \nThe company began the year in the red with 38.74 per cent drop in profit after tax for the first quarter ended June 30, 2015. In a filing with the Nigerian Stock Exchange, it posted a profit after tax of N283 million during the first quarter of the year as against N462 million, indicating a drop of 38.74 per cent. \nPre –tax profit dropped by 32.64 per cent from N585 million during the comparable period of 2014 to N394 million in 2015, while revenue shed 2.98 per cent to N12.797 billion from N13.191 billion in 2014. \nHowever, investors got respite from the declining position in the Q3 as the company posted 53 per cent increase in profit after tax for the third quarter ended December 31, 2015. \nIt also recorded a profit after tax of N1.485 billion during the third quarter of the year as against N969 million, indicating a growth of 53 per cent. Pre -tax profit firmed up by 57 per cent from N1.226 billion during the comparable period of 2014 to N1.929 billion in 2015, while revenue added six per cent to N39.775 billion from N37.636 billion in 2014. \nExpectations by the shareholders that the profit margin witnessed in the third quarter ended December 31, 2015 would be sustained going forward were dashed as Honeywell ended the year in the negative with a record of N3.023 billion loss after tax for the full year ended March 31, 2016. \nAccording to report from NSE, it posted a loss after tax of N3.023 billion during the full year as against a profit after tax of N1.120 billion. Loss before tax stood at N2.869 billion during the comparable period of 2016 from a profit before tax of N1.434 billion in 2015. \nHowever, revenue added four per cent to N50.883 billion from N49.057 billion in 2015.Honeywell Flour Mills continued its decline in profit as it posted 57 per cent decrease in profit after tax for the second quarter ended September 30, 2016. \nThe company in a filing with the Nigerian Stock Exchange posted profit after tax of N389 million during the half year as against N903 million in 2015. \nProfit before tax stood at N482 million during the comparable period of 2016 from a profit before tax of N1.129 billion in 2015, accounting for a drop of 57 per cent. Revenue dropped marginally by three per cent to N3.255 billion from N3.357 billion in 2015. \nProfit on downswing \nThe Managing Director, Honeywell Flour Mills Plc, Mr. Lanre Jaiyeola, had in a statement, lamented the economic loss arising from the falling naira, the perennial chaotic traffic and debilitating condition of the roads leading in and out of Apapa. \nThe company statement attributed the challenging results to several factors including the Apapa traffic gridlock and declining infrastructure around the ports. “Roads leading to and from Apapa have effectively become car parks. \nTruck parking facilities around the ports that should have been completed years ago seem to have become abandoned projects. These problems have compromised our logistics efficiency by frustrating the prompt loading of products resulting in longer loading turnaround times and reduced stock turnover,” the statement reads. \nAccording to Jaiyeola, the company’s customers, suppli-ers, haulage partners and staff demonstrated great courage, loyalty and commitment during these challenging times. \nHe noted that it takes, on an average, eight hours for customers to access or exit the factory. “Added to these is a rise in dollar denominated input costs. Costs of wheat and spare parts have been rising because of the falling naira to forex rates. \nThese challenges, coupled with weakening macro-economy of the country, means it takes much longer to factor such cost increments into product prices,” he said. \nOutlook \nAddressing shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), the Chairman of the company, Dr. Oba Otudeko, said that the company’s board and management was able to manage the harsh operating environment in a manner that led to a financial result that is better than the industry average. \nOtudeko noted that the company continued to demonstrate strong fundamentals and the ability to withstand the increasing competitive operating conditions. \n“The expected focus on economic and infrastructural development by the new government would lead to moderation in inflation, improved domestic productive capacity, increase in autonomous income and improved demand. \nThis is expected to translate to improved performance for the company in 2016 and beyond,’’ he said. Otudeko said that acquisition of over 60 hectares of land within the Flowergate Industrial Scheme in Shagamu, Ogun State for strategic development marked a milestone in the history of the company. \n“From the greenfield location, we shall develop growth opportunities, which meet the yearning and demand of consumers, within and outside Nigeria for Honeywell brand of food and agro allied products. \nThe complex is an integrated facility to house all of the group’s food factories such that economy of scale can be achieved to drive down overall operating costs leading to the production of more affordable food products. \n“The site is planned to accommodate about 15 to 20 factories on about 80 per cent of land, while various support infrastructure will be situated across the remaining 20 per cent. \nThe site is strategically located along the route to the northern and eastern parts of the country, making it easier for nationwide distribution of our products,” he said. \nConclusion \nWith strategic expansion, it is hoped that the company will be out of the woods. However, as the high cost of operation adversely affects the real sector, it is important for the company to manage its cost base tightly to deliver moderate operating margins for growth and profitability.

      "text": "tweet Honeywell Flour Mills Plc’s integrated food complex in Sagamu, Ogun State will drive productivity in the company and boost shareholders’ value. The company, in a statement, said the structural expansion would help the company strengthen its operation and cushion the effects of the current economic challenges. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, recently visited the Honeywell foods and agro-allied industrial complex to inspect ongoing developments, where the Chairman of the company, Dr. Oba Otudeko, unveiled its transformation initiative to accelerate Nigeria’s quest for self-sufficiency in food production. The project, for which construction activities commenced in 2014, the company reiterated, would see Honeywell invest about N64bn to develop a world-class integrated facility where economies of scale and scope would be leveraged to drive down costs and provide Nigerians with more affordable food products. The company has commenced work on the first three phases of the complex – initially with the construction of a pasta plant; followed by a sorghum flour mill and an animal feed mill. “All factories will utilise local grains, tubers and oil seeds as raw materials to boost farming activities and agriculture in execution of Honeywell’s backward integration and import substitution strategy,” the company said. Following a detailed tour of the site, Osinbajo had commended Honeywell’s patriotic efforts at reducing food imports and creating employment in the all-important food manufacturing and agriculture sectors of the economy. He reiterated the Federal Government’s resolve to work with and support private sector players who demonstrated commitment to value addition and job creation in the economy.  ",

      "text": "Lebanon: 85 percent of population will have fiber optic service by 2017 Honeywell’s business aviation forecast sees 8,600 deliveries of new business jets valued at $255 billion through 2026 Honeywell’s business aviation forecast sees 8,600 deliveries of new business jets valued at $255 billion through 2026 2.5 5 Facebook   Honeywell \nThe business aviation industry continues to face a slow near-term pace of orders due to a slow-growth economic environment across many global markets along with many political uncertainties, according to the 25th annual Global Business Aviation Outlook released today by Honeywell. The Global Business Aviation Outlook forecasts up to 8,600 new business jet deliveries worth $255 billion from 2016 to 2026, which represents a 6 to 7 percent reduction from the values noted in the 2015 forecast. \n“We continue to see relatively slow economic growth projections in many mature business jet markets. While developed economies are generally faring better, commodities demand, foreign exchange and political uncertainties remain as concerns,” said Brian Sill, president, Commercial Aviation, Honeywell Aerospace. “These factors continue to affect near- term purchases, but the survey responses this year indicate there is improved interest in new aircraft acquisition in the medium term, particularly in the 2018–19 period. In the meantime, operators we surveyed this year indicated plans to increase usage of current aircraft modestly in the next 12 months, providing some welcome momentum to aftermarket activity, which has been flat recently.” \nKey global findings in the 2016 Honeywell outlook include: Deliveries of approximately 650 to 675 new jets in 2016, a low- to mid-single-digit percentage decline year over year. The pullback in deliveries expected in 2016 comes on the heels of a small increase in 2015 and is largely due to slower order rates for mature models and a stabilization in fractional-usage type of aircraft deliveries. 2017 deliveries are projected to be slightly lower, reflecting transitions to new models slated for late 2017 and 2018 service entry. Operators plan to make new jet purchases equivalent to about 27 percent of their fleets over the next five years as replacements or additions to their current fleet, an encouraging increase but one that is less than firm in timing. Of the total purchase plans for new business jets, 21 percent are intended to occur by the end of 2017, while 18 percent are scheduled for 2018 and 2019, respectively. Operators continue to focus on larger-cabin aircraft classes, ranging from super mid-size through ultralong-range and business liner, which are expected to account for more than 85 percent of all expenditures on new business jets in the next five years. The longer-range forecast through 2026 projects a 3 to 4 percent average annual growth rate despite the lower short-term outlook as new models and improved economic performance contribute to industry growth. Gains in five-year operator purchase plans are offset in the long-term forecastbased on changes in new program timing, slower economic growth projections, and political and currency uncertainties, resulting in a moderately lower overall outlook. \nBreakdown by Region \nBrazil, Russia, India, China (BRIC) – Continued improvements in Chinese and Russian purchase plans compared with last year, coupled with slight gains in the larger Brazilian survey outlook, drive improved BRIC results. BRIC industry purchase plans rebounded off 2015 lows, reaching just over 32 percent in this year’s survey. The 32 percent rate returns the BRIC composite to a rate exceeding the world purchase plan rate. These purchase plans would reverse several years of decline. Brazil remained a bright spot by recording the strongest new aircraft purchase plans in the survey from a major aircraft market, though overall buying plans rose only slightly year over year. The combined BRIC countries’ near-term demand profile has shifted somewhat later in the forecast period this year, with 38 percent of intended new jet purchases scheduled for the next two years. \nAsia Pacific – Despite ongoing regional tensions and government austerity initiatives, operator enthusiasm seems to be improving. Operators in Asia Pacific report new jet acquisition plans for 28 percent of their fleet over the next five years, roughly doubling from 2015 levels and reflecting optimism extending beyond the China market. Based on the improved level of purchase plans, Asia Pacific could garner up to a 6 percent share of global new jet demand over the next five years. Only 33 percent of Asian respondents plan to schedule their new purchases within the first two years of the five-year horizon. \nMiddle East and Africa – Improved purchase plans were reported, which was unexpected given only moderately improved oil prices and ongoing conflicts in parts of the region. The share of projected five-year global demand attributed to the Middle East and Africa recovered to just below its historical range of 4 to 7 percent this year. In the Middle East and Africa, 21 percent of respondents said they will replace or add to their fleet with a new jet purchase, up from 16 percent last year but still below the overall world average. Considerable strength was present in the oil-producing nations and South Africa. Operators responding to the survey seem to be looking past current regional concerns, with potential buyers in the region scheduling their purchases sooner in the next five-year window compared with last year, with 49 percent of purchases planned before 2019. These improved survey responses appear at odds with the obstinate nature of the issues facing the region. \nLatin America – 2016 results pulled back in line with the world average, but planned acquisitions remain more front-loaded than the world average. Slightly higher Brazilian purchase plans partially offset broader declines from other countries. Nearly 27 percent of the Latin America sample fleet is expected to be replaced or added to with new jet purchases — 2 to 3 points lower than last year’s survey. Some of the larger traditional markets in the region reset purchase plans to lower levels this year, particularly those linked strongly to commodities markets. Resilience in the Brazilian operator base helped offset some of the darker mood elsewhere in the region. With 47 to 48 percent of this region’s projected purchases planned to occur between 2016 and 2018, this indicates some potential deferral of purchases suggested last year for the 2015–2017 period, which was equally front-loaded. Based on the current purchase plan levels, Latin America’s 12 percent share of total projected demand slipped several points compared with a year ago. \nNorth America – New aircraft acquisition plans in North America are very important given the region’s size and the unsettled conditions elsewhere around the world. An estimated 65 percent of projected demand comes from North American operators, up 4 points from the 2015 survey. New jet purchase plan levels rose 5 points in North America, the industry’s largest market, and helped drive the world average up to 27 percent. Current plan levels are now in alignment with the averages of the 2008−2012 period. Though buying plan rates are just under the overall world average, the fleet and operator base have expanded, supporting solid demand levels. \nEurope – Despite operators still contending with sluggish growth and elevated political tensions, the uncertain effects of the Brexit vote, a refugee and migrant surge, and depreciated currencies, new jet purchase plans actually improved. Europe’s purchase expectations improved this year to 30 percent, in line with averages seen since 2009. Despite the improved new jet purchase plans. Europe’s share of estimated global five-year demand remained at 14 percent in the 2016 survey. This outcome is due in large part to the fact that the European fleet has not expanded in recent years. Many aircraft have migrated to other regions, resulting in an active fleet that is slightly lower despite an infusion of new jet deliveries. A comparison of the planned timing for European purchases indicates uneven proportions of demand in the next three years of the five-year window, with about 26 percent allocated through 2017 followed by a dip to 15 percent each in 2018 and 2019, suggesting a cautious approach to timing the replacement of expansion of the fleets with new acquisitions. \nUsed Jets and Flight Activity \nTurning to used jets and flight activity, over the course of the past year, the pace of flight activity has not recovered. On a positive note, operators responding to the 2016 survey report they plan to increase aircraft usage in the next 12 months to a modest extent. With respect to the used jet market: Roughly 10 percent of today’s fleet is up for resale, down from a high of nearly 16 percent in 2009 but up from the low point achieved last year. Current levels are still within a reasonable aggregate level in light of the past decade’s history, but inventory levels are trending up. Meanwhile, asking prices continue to drift lower. In 2016, the total number of recent model jets (less than 10 years old) listed for resale rose significantly to about 675 aircraft, excluding personal jets and business liners. In proportion to the level of overall listings, the share of recent model jets for sale has risen noticeably. Operator respondents reduced their used jet acquisition plans by about 8 points, equating to 24 percent of their fleets in the next five years. All regions’ used jet purchase plans fell. The decline in used jet purchase plans clearly aligns with the expansion of used inventory for sale and continued price pressure on used jets. Weaker used aircraft purchase plans may slow the pace of aircraft upgrades. \nMaking an Impact on Business Decisions \nThis annual outlook reflects topical operator concerns but also identifies longer-cycle trends that Honeywell uses in its own product decision process. The survey has helped identify opportunities for investments in flight-efficiency upgrades, expanded propulsion offerings, innovative safety products, services, upgrades and enhanced aircraft connectivity offerings. It also contributes to Honeywell’s business pursuit strategy and helps position Honeywell consistently on high-value platforms in growth sectors. \nMethodology \nHoneywell’s forecast methodology is based on multiple sources including, but not limited to, macroeconomic analyses, original equipment manufacturers’ production and development plans shared with the company, and expert deliberations from aerospace industry experts. Honeywell also utilizes information gathered from interviews conducted during the forecasting cycle with over 1,500 nonfractional business jet operators worldwide. The survey sample is representative of the entire industry in terms of geography, operation and fleet composition. This comprehensive approach provides Honeywell with unique insights into operator sentiments, preferences and concerns, and provides considerable insight into product development needs and opportunities.",

      "text": "DES PLAINES, Ill. , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that Delek Refining, Inc. will use a new Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based Connected Performance Services (CPS) offering to improve the performance of its refinery in Tyler, Texas .\nCPS is part of Honeywell's Connected Plant initiative, which leverages IIoT technologies and Honeywell UOP's services and domain expertise to improve a broad range of industrial operations from supply chain efficiency to asset optimization.\nDelek will use a CPS solution called Process Reliability Advisor to continuously analyze its process unit performance and detect anomalies, enabling refinery operators to quickly resolve problems and keep the unit operating at peak performance. CPS solutions use Honeywell UOP process and fault models, fed by current plant data, to provide key performance information and process recommendations.\n\"The Process Reliability Advisor leverages Honeywell UOP's deep troubleshooting experience and proprietary models to deliver detailed analysis and specific corrective recommendations days or months earlier than has ever been possible before,\" said Zak Alzein , vice president for Honeywell UOP's CPS business. \"This will allow Delek to avoid downtime and improve its operations.\"\nBy giving refineries, petrochemical and gas processing plants greater visibility into their operations, Process Reliability Advisor can identify and resolve problems that reduce plant efficiency and productivity. The service finds problems that often avoid detection and hamper production, leading to unplanned shutdowns for maintenance and repair that can cost plant operators millions of dollars per year in lost productivity.\n\"This offering can save a refinery millions of dollars a year, helping to improve its profitability,\" Alzein said. \"By bringing literally decades of experience to a refinery, Reliability Advisor can close the growing knowledge gap that is forming as these facilities become more complex and skilled personnel enter retirement.\"\nHoneywell UOP's CPS business also offers Process Optimization Advisor, which continuously monitors streaming plant data and applies Honeywell UOP process models and economic optimization, big-data analytics, and machine learning to drive a plant's full potential. \nDelek Refining, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Delek US Holdings, operates a 75,000 barrel per day refinery in Tyler, Texas , that primarily processes locally sourced light, sweet crude oils into a full range of refined products, including gasoline, diesel, jet fuels, liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas liquids. More than 93 percent of the Tyler refinery's production slate has been comprised of light, high-value products such as gasoline and distillate fuels.\nHoneywell UOP ( www.uop.com ) is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries. Honeywell UOP is part of Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group, which also includes Honeywell Process Solutions ( www.honeywellprocess.com ), a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation and services for the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, chemical and other industries. \nHoneywell ( www.honeywell.com ) is a Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing leader, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes, and industry; turbochargers; and performance materials.

The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.\nOne of latest trends in the market is focus on integrated mass notification solutions. Key vendors in the market are focusing on the introduction of integrated solutions. During emergencies, systems must do more than just giving signals to the people about the danger; facilities are beginning to upgrade their current system with voice communications, where a system should direct occupants on what to do and where to go with specific instructions for different types of emergencies.\nTo address a large population in an emergency, multiple communication systems, known as S-o-S (System of Systems), are being increasingly used. The different modes of communication are broadcasting emergency information over indoor or outdoor MNS that include e-mail and text messages, automated voice calls, computer pop-up alerts, and electronic signage.\nAccording to the report, one of the primary drivers in the market is increase in BYOD adoption. The BYOD trend is taking the corporate world by storm. The percentage of employees availing BYOD worldwide increased from 20% in 2010 to over 50% in 2015. It not only provides employees with greater flexibility for work but also enables organizations to save on costs related to providing equipment/devices to employees. The emergence of smartphones, laptops, and tablets has contributed to this concept. With increased use of these mobile devices, notifications can be sent regarding any dangerous situation to mobile devices through phones, emails, texts, or voice messages.\nFurther, the report states that one major challenge in the market is limited provision for personalized MNS. Businesses using manual notification or mass notification services, which provide notification or messages to a large number of people at the same time, are not keeping up with the requirements of today's new breed of enterprises.\nAnything that happens, even if it is the internal process in an organization must be resolved as fast as possible because it creates a business impact. While sending the voice or text message to many recipients can raise awareness initially, it does not initiate an organization's ability to take any action.

Key vendors in the market are focusing on the introduction of integrated solutions. During emergencies, systems must do more than just giving signals to the people about the danger; facilities are beginning to upgrade their current system with voice communications, where a system should direct occupants on what to do and where to go with specific instructions for different types of emergencies.\nTo address a large population in an emergency, multiple communication systems, known as S-o-S (System of Systems), are being increasingly used. The different modes of communication are broadcasting emergency information over indoor or outdoor MNS that include e-mail and text messages, automated voice calls, computer pop-up alerts, and electronic signage.\nAccording to the report, one of the primary drivers in the market is increase in BYOD adoption. The BYOD trend is taking the corporate world by storm. The percentage of employees availing BYOD worldwide increased from 20% in 2010 to over 50% in 2015. It not only provides employees with greater flexibility for work but also enables organizations to save on costs related to providing equipment/devices to employees. The emergence of smartphones, laptops, and tablets has contributed to this concept.

      "text": "Honeywell on Tuesday confirmed its pick of a mid-rise office building in Midtown Atlanta for a new software hub and the headquarters of its home and building technologies business.\nMorris Plains, N.J.-based Honeywell said in a news release that it has leased 62,000 square feet or two floors of 715 Peachtree Street, a building near the Fox Theatre that’s undergoing a significant overhaul by an ownership team led by Atlanta-based real estate firm Carter.\nThe building and Bank of America Plaza , the city’s tallest tower, were among the finalists for Honeywell’s offices when the company announced its decision in September to expand in Atlanta. In a news conference with Gov. Nathan Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed at the time, Honeywell officials announced plans to open a global software development center and move its home business to Atlanta in a move that is expected to create more than 800 high-paying jobs.\nHoneywell is a maker of thermostats, fire systems, smart building software, aerospace systems, wireless communications and products for energy exploration. Though known for hardware, Honeywell, like GE, has invested aggressively in software development and what’s known as the Internet of Things (IoT), or networked communication through the cloud of machines and sensors.\nThe company said it will invest $19 million in the new operations center.\nThe company said the building was selected in part thanks to its location near Georgia Tech and access to transit and Midtown’s amenities.\n“We are seeking the best of the best product software engineers from around the world to come to Atlanta,” Krishna Mikkilineni, Honeywell senior vice president of engineering, operations and IT said in the release. “At Honeywell, product software engineers have the opportunity to develop some of the world’s most sophisticated software- and digital-based products and solutions that play a major role in the IoT, helping airplanes, automobiles, buildings, homes, industrial plants, warehouses, and workers stay connected, safe, productive and secure.”",

      "text": "About autopilot systems An autopilot system is the major part of a vehicle management system and is used to command a vehicle without continuous supervision by human operator. It helps the operator in controlling and monitoring the vehicle. Autopilot systems are widely used in aviation, missiles (unmanned), spacecraft, and shipping industries. They consist of three major components including the programmer or mode selector, computer system, and actuator. A mode selector allows the pilot to program the autopilot system and helps in interacting with avionics system such as GPS and electronics system used to communicate or navigate multiple systems. The computer system receives the command from the programmer and transfers it to the actuator. The actuator is the motor that physically moves the vehicle. Autopilot systems enhance a pilot’s vehicle control capability and increases the cockpit efficiency by putting the vehicle into an auto-mode. It also reduces the overall operating costs.

      "text": "If Honeywell’s Vector Occupant app is successful, it will generate millions in new revenue, officials said. It is the company’s latest “Internet of Things” offering. (Honeywell)\nMINNEAPOLIS — The office too cold? Too hot? Forgot your office ID badge?\nDon’t sweat it. Honeywell has an answer. The company’s new Vector Occupant app lets workers use their cellphones to change office temperatures or to gain access into locked buildings when they forget their ID cards at home.\nHoneywell says the app is a win because it quickly gives locked-out workers access to their office without needing to call for help or replace ID badges. Employees simply hold up their phone app to the black card readers instead of their plastic ID cards. The app helps ID the worker and only unlocks doors per the employer’s programming.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading\nThe technology could eliminate the need for plastic ID cards and cut replacing or reprogramming costs. It’s also expected to beef up comfort, officials said.\nBy pressing a button, the cloud-backed app lets employees alert facilities managers when a work area is too hot or cold. The managers then press a button to acknowledge the complaint and click others to remotely change temperature settings, without visiting floors to manually adjust thermostats. The integrated system also lets the managers identify temperature patterns.\nRight now, the app focuses on building access and comfort, but will eventually expand to help employees find their way around a building, officials said.\nIt took Honeywell less than a year and 40 software, IT and product development gurus in suburban Minneapolis and Bangalore to bring the technology to market. There are competitors, but most are small and none are as heavily integrated as Honeywell, officials said.\nThe app was developed with the help of the security-badge gurus at Texas-based HID Global.\nThe system was initially tested using 200 Honeywell employees in outside the Twin Cities. From there, it spread to six Honeywell buildings and then piloted at four customer sites in Chicago and London, and St. Paul and Centerville, Minn. Now it’s ready for sale and making its way around to trade shows around the world.\nThe Vector Occupant app debuted in June at a trade show in London, and in the U.S. at another trade show in September.\n“Reaction was very positive” and prompted a flurry of inquiries from architects and building construction firms looking to bring the hottest technology to building managers and tenants,” said Himanshu Khurana, engineering director for Honeywell Building Solutions. The app also won inquiries from security experts wanting to make buildings secure while easing access for approved personnel.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading\n“People see a lot of innovation and focus around getting better security that can keep the bad guys out. But they don’t see enough innovation surrounding how to let good people get in easier,” he said. “We’re changing that.”\nThe app is the latest “Internet of Things” offering from New Jersey-based Honeywell, a company known for its temperature control systems. Honeywell is increasingly monitoring and controlling building features with connected devices.\nIf successful, the Vector Occupant app will generate millions in new revenue, officials said. In beta tests, users liked that smartphones require security codes, a security feature most employee ID badges don’t have. They also liked that the app can be quickly customized.\n“Buildings are alive and teeming with opportunities for users to interact with them — if you can make the right connections,” said John Rajchert, president of Honeywell Building Solutions unit. “Smartphones and apps continue to enhance our everyday lives, from allowing us to hail a cab to giving us direct insight into where we stand on a restaurant waiting list. We’re now applying these same concepts of insight and control to how one interacts with a building.”\nThis summer, the 22,000-member Eagle Brook Church in Minnesota beta-tested the app, which gave nearly 200 employees and church leaders access to six buildings and tracked the data. Tom Tulberg, the church’s information technology director, said the app helped.\n“One of the biggest challenges for us, having 200 people spread across multiple locations, is that everybody has to have a scanning card. And they break. And too often people forget their badge and need another one. Because we have separate buildings with access systems that are separate from one another, the cards have to be coded for every building,” Tulberg said. “So the Honeywell app is a means for us to have one central location where we can set up a user for access to any of our locations and control what portions of those buildings that they can get to.”\nCustomer pricing will vary on building complexity and the number of employees using the app. On a per employee basis, it should be “significantly less than a cup of coffee,” Khurana said.\n——\n©2016 Star Tribune (Minneapolis)\nVisit the Star Tribune (Minneapolis) at www.startribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",
