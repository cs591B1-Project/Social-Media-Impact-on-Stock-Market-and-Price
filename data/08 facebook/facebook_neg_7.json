      "text": "(Before It's News) Most people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nSome very alarming news has broken over the last 24 hours that third party presidential candidate Jill Stein was able to raise the millions needed (and then some), to be able to pay for the recount democrats are looking to use to stop Trump before he is ever sworn in on Inauguration Day.\nMany media outlets are reporting that Stein already has the money , and considering how easy that would be to verify, there is no reason to think she doesn’t. What could be debated, is how she raised the money so quickly, but does it really matter?\nAccording to Anonymous, who do you think provided the funds so quickly? None other than George Soros. This is one of the many political land mines I warned about when I said that voting may be over, but this election is far from finished yet.\nThis news is NOT to be taken lightly either. When you consider the tremendous amount of information We the People never would have known (and Trump probably wouldn’t have won without), that came from rogue hacking groups like Anonymous and WikiLeaks, this is a very serious development. Furthermore, since Jill Stein has the money, and since she is a third party who is requesting the recount, her request should be carried out.\nDo you really think Democrats and Soros would go through all this if they didn’t have the outcome already planned? In the following video, I review the developing news, explain why the claims of “Russian hacking” spawning the idea for the recount are total nonsense, but caution Trump supporters not to take this lightly at all. Remember, George Soros is connected to the voting machines in all three major states in question…\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE TOP STORIES OF THE WEEK IN THE NEWSLETTER HERE\nWWW.THELASTGREATSTAND.COM\nFOR MORE NEWS BY VOICE OF REASON CLICK HERE!\nFor those of you who are finally starting to realize there is major trouble on the horizon, largely as a result of the corruption within our own government and the 2016 election, the failure of the U.S. Dollar and Western banks, deteriorating conditions here domestically, or perhaps even because of nuclear tensions reaching all new heights, then I suggest you get your FREE GUIDE for how to survive Martial Law here , because if/when things begin to go south, by then it will be too late to do anything about it.\nFor anyone with no idea where to begin making preparations, a very good, and very inexpensive tool to teach you how and what you should be preparing, is a book called “Conquering the Collapse.” Since I’ve practically worn out my own iPad reading my copy, in the following link I provide you with a review of the book: Be Ready For Any Emergency – The Crucial Guide For Any Family’s Safety (Videos) . You can learn more about the coming crisis in the links at the bottom under the heading titled, “If nothing else, these links are essential.” The writing is on the wall everywhere… Begin preparing….\nConservative Daily Post writes:\nHacking Group “Anonymous” Has Issued A CHILLING Announcement\nSomething seriously bad is happening right now and it’s about to shift the face of democracy in the free world.\nGeorge Soros is well known by now for his donations to BLM and other extreme leftist groups, not to mention the millions he’s given Hillary.\nThings just went to code red though, because Jill Stein has just initiated a campaign to demand a recount of the vote.\nWhat is about to happen could possibly cause a civil war. Anonymous, the infamous group responsible for hacking multiple high-level officials and agencies, just made a grave announcement:\n“It’s over, folks.\nThey are absolutely taking this from Trump. If you were able to see these stories they already have prepared for us to start running next week, your jaw would hit the ground.\nThey are going to “find” that the results were indeed “hacked”. They have everything set in place, and have been ready to play this out for over a week.\nAll 3 states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania) are going to be reversed and awarded to Hillary Clinton. Speculations are in the midst of who is pulling the strings, but this is undoubtedly going to happen.\nStart preparing for the news to pour in, NOW.\nWhen Michigan is reversed, it will send a clear message of irreversible corruption; the state had only paper ballots. Furthermore, the votes have already been certified. The stringent program was designed specifically to defend against cyber attacks.”\nThere is already evidence that death threats were sent to multiple electors, but that didn’t work. Jill stein has already raised enough money to trigger a complete recount of the votes in Wisconsin—the other 2 states are even cheaper.\nThis is BAD News\nTrump may have taken Michigan, but it won’t matter. Jill Stein demanded a recount, and as a third party it will be carried out. The election WILL be rigged. January 20 th is literally 2 months away. Do you seriously think they are going to remain idle for 2 months?\nI’m a realist—I call it like it is and I don’t care who I offend. But, do not be mistaken. This is BAD news.\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nFREE DETAILED GUIDE TO SURVIVING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OR MARTIAL LAW HERE\nIt’s already happening. Multiple fake “computer experts” have stated there are “anomalies” in the vote that favor Trump. Who have they blamed? Russia, however we already know that narrative is FALSE, because Wikileaks was working WITH members of our own intelligence community who could no longer stand the corruption:\nU.S. Intelligence Stopped a Silent Obama/Clinton Coup; Now You’re Needed\nSo then what happened next? Jill Stein was able to push a recount order on these grounds. If foul play is “detected”, a recount can be initiated (even if the “foul play” is completely false and planned as a scapegoat to initiate the recount for Hillary).\nRogue Hacking Groups Like Anonymous And WikiLeaks Gave Us A TREMENDOUS Amount Of Factual Information During The Election Race. This Warning Is Not To Be Taken Lightly.\nBut wait a second. How is Jill Stein connected to Hillary and why would the recount benefit Clinton? The answer lies in a serious screw-up that became apparent when a bot was found in the donation system.\nGo to the fundraising website and see for yourself! The campaign was started literally yesterday and already has over $4,000,000 in donations!\nThis Is NO Coincidence. Do You Think A Man Who Has Spent BILLIONS Will Stop Now? The Media Is On His Side, Pushing The Entire Narrative!\nThat’s not the scary part though. What gives away the entire operation is the behavior of the donations. The funding came in at an absolutely perfect $160,000 per hour. That wouldn’t be odd, except the donations continued full speed through the middle of the night when all of America was asleep!\nJill Stein now has the money she needs to initiate the recount. Where did the funds come from? Soros. The mainstream media is pushing the narrative hard right now that the votes were hacked, even In Pennsylvania where that’s not even possible.\nFOR OTHER NEWS ON TROUBLE STIRRED UP AND FINANCED BY SOROS:\n100,000 Person Soros-Funded Group Pushing ‘Sanctuary Campus’ Anti-Trump Protests\nAttention: Expect Obama To Run Dangerously Wild Until Inauguration Day\nWhy Isn’t Obama Trying to Stop Planned BLM Chaos, Rioting, and Violence?\nGeorge Soros Is Leading Trump Directly Into a Violent No-Win Situation\nBlack Lives Matter Beats and Drags Old Man by Car Down Street for Voting Trump\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life .

Google, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter are all censoring the spread of this information, creating dissent and misinformation. To make things even worse, the establishment has launched a campaign against “fake news”, allowing the mainstream media to dictate reality for hundreds of millions of Americans who receive constant news!\nWE ALREADY KNOW STORIES OF HILLARY STILL LEADING THE POPULAR VOTE ARE FALSE:\nSorry Protestors: Looks Like Hillary Got Pummeled in the Popular Vote Too\nProof That Donald Trump Won the Popular Vote Too\nAttention: Expect Obama To Run Dangerously Wild Until Inauguration Day\nThis is BAD news people, and it’s about to get even worse. There is no reason they would be attempting to pull this stunt unless they had absolute certainty it would execute successfully.\nPlease spread word of what is about to come. I will continue to keep you informed, but you must join me in this fight and spread word. This news is being suppressed on literally every channel. We must fight back.\nAlex Cooper, CDP, Reports.\nThe Full Discussion Can Be Found At The_Donald .\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nFREE DETAILED GUIDE TO SURVIVING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OR MARTIAL LAW HERE\nMORE STORIES ABOUT SOROS’ INVOLVEMENT IN WESTERN POLITICS:\nGeorge Soros Is Leading Trump Directly Into a Violent No-Win Situation (Video)\nGeorge Soros’ Master Blueprint to Conquer the West Caught on Camera (Video)\nTop 10 Reasons to Fear the Hell Out of George Soros (Video)\nThe Clock Is Ticking Before the U.S. Devolves Into an Armed Revolt (Video)\nSoros Predicts Trump Wins Popular Vote, Claims “Hillary’s Win Already Done” (Video)\nLeaked Soros Memo Reveals Plan for Federally Controlled U.S. Police (Video)\nSoros’ Puppet Obama Going to do Exactly As He’s Told, and Sign Climate Change Treaty\nLeaked Docs Show How Soros Continues to Massively Reshape US Elections (Video)\nLeaked Memos Show Soros Responsible For Social Media Censorship (Video)\nShadow Government: WikiLeaks Exposes George Soros Controlling Clinton\nNew World Order Elites In Absolute Terror Of Gold Standard (Interview)\nSoros Funded BLM Promising Chaos at Both DNC and RNC Conventions\nSoros Paying Protesters (Who Admit it) $16 to Cause Chaos at Trump Rallies\nExposed: BLM Twisted Plans To Escalate Chaos Forcing Martial Law (Video)\nSoros Executes Major Brexit Gold Buy, European Union Teeters on Collapse (Video)\nC.I.A.

      "text": "Locky ransomware uses decoy image files to ambush Facebook, LinkedIn accounts Low-tech malware snares users via flaws in social networks' code to spread automatically. Nov 25, 2016 4:02 pm UTC Aurich Lawson reader comments 0 Share this story \nA low-tech but cunning malware program is worrying security researchers after it started spreading rapidly in the past week through a new attack vector: by forcibly exploiting vulnerabilities in Facebook and LinkedIn. \nAccording to the Israeli security firm Check Point , security flaws in the two social networks allow a maliciously coded image file to download itself to a user's computer. Users who notice the download, and who then access the file, cause malicious code to install \"Locky\" ransomware onto their computers. Further Reading “Locky” crypto-ransomware rides in on malicious Word document macro \nLocky has been around since early this year, and works by encrypting victims' files and demands a payment of around half a bitcoin (currently £294; $365) for the key. Previously, it had relied on a malicious macro in Word documents and spam e-mails, but Check Point says that in the past week there has been a \"massive spread of the Locky ransomware via social media, particularly in its Facebook-based campaign.\" \nCheck Point won't go into detail on how the exploit works until the vulnerability is patched by LinkedIn and Facebook. However, its researchers have claimed: \nThe attackers have built a new capability to embed malicious code into an image file and successfully upload it to the social media website. The attackers exploit a misconfiguration on the social media infrastructure to deliberately force their victims to download the image file. This results in infection of the users’ device as soon as the end-user clicks on the downloaded file. \nAs more people spend time on social networking sites, hackers have turned their focus to find a way in to these platforms. Cyber criminals understand these sites are usually 'white listed,' and for this reason, they are continually searching for new techniques to use social media as hosts for their malicious activities. Further Reading \nUsers are advised not to open any file that has automatically downloaded, especially any image file with an unusual extension such as SVG, JS, or HTA—though benign-looking images could exploit the way Windows hides file extensions by default. Locky \n\"When Locky encrypts a file it will rename the file to the format [unique_id][identifier].locky,\" wrote security researcher Lawrence Abrams in February. \"So when test.jpg is encrypted it would be renamed to something like F67091F1D24A922B1A7FC27E19A9D9BC.locky. The unique ID and other information will also be embedded into the end of the encrypted file.\" \nArs' own analysis at the time found that Locky's mechanics are pretty much like every other ransomware package currently floating around in malware marketplaces. It leaves a ransom note text file called \" _Locky_recover_instructions.txt \" in each directory that's been encrypted, pointing to servers on the Tor anonymising network (both via Tor directly and through Internet relays) where the victim can make payment, and changes the Windows background image to a graphic version of the same message. It also stores some of the data in the Windows Registry file under HKCUSoftwareLocky. \nArs has asked for comment from both Facebook and LinkedIn. \nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK Tom Mendelsohn Tom is Ars Technica UK's Contributing Sub Editor.

USA TODAY Opinion_Eileen Rivers Jimmy Fallon (Photo: Evan Agostini, Invision/AP) \nThe most baffling president-elect in U.S. history is making some of the most baffling choices for his administration. \nTake the consideration of former Texas governor Rick Perry to head the Department of Energy, a department that he once wanted to eliminate. Perhaps the fact that he couldn't remember that he wanted to eliminate it will bode well for him, according to late-night comic Seth Meyers. See which movie Meyers says reflects the possible choice in today's Punchlines, above. \nAnd Jimmy Fallon feels bad for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Donald Trump has tapped her for U.N. ambassador. What's the first thing she'll have to do?

      "text": "Facebook \n– President Muhammadu Buhari has promised that he will not allow the padding of the budget 2017 \n– “I am waiting for the 2017 budget to be brought to us in council. Any sign of padding anywhere, I will remove it.” \n– The president has also spoke on anti-corruption war, election violence, touched on the topics of agriculture and solid minerals exploitation \nReceiving in audience members of the Governance Support Group (GSG), led by Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, at state house, Abuja, Friday, the president said: “I am waiting for the 2017 budget to be brought to us in council. Any sign of padding anywhere, I will remove it.” \nPresident Buhari re-iterated that he had been in government since 1975, variously as governor, oil minister, head of state, and Chairman of the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF), “and never did I hear the word ‘padding’ till the 2016 budget.” \nHe promised that such would never happen again under his watch. \nThe president said the government stands by its tripod campaign promises of securing the country, reviving the economy, and fighting corruption, but lamented that some people are deliberately turning blind eyes to prevailing realities in the country. \n“They don’t want to reflect on the situation in which we are, economically. They want to live the same way; they simply want business as usual,” he said. On violence \nOn violence that attend rerun elections in the country, President Buhari stated: \n“I agonized over the elections in Kogi, Bayelsa and Rivers states. We should have passed the stage in which people are beheaded, and killed because of who occupies certain offices. \nIf we can’t guarantee decent elections, then we have no business being around. Edo State election was good, and I expect Ondo state election to be better.” On the anti-corruption \nSpeaking on the anti-corruption cases before the courts, the president said he believed the cleansing currently going on “will lead to a better judiciary. When people are sentenced, Nigerians will believe that we are serious.” \nPresident Buhari equally told his guests that the progress being made in agriculture and exploitation of solid minerals “gives a lot of hope,” adding: \n“Our grains go up to Central African Republic, to Burkina Faso, but they can’t buy all the grains harvested this year. And next season should be even better. \nWe will focus on other products like cocoa, palm oil, palm kernel, along with the grains. We can start exporting rice in 18 months, and we are getting fertilizers and pesticides in readiness for next year.” \nREAD ALSO: We are tired of passing budgets that are not implemented – Saraki \nSpeaking on behalf of members of GSG, Hon. Nwajiuba said the government had succeeded to a large extent on the security and anti-corruption fronts, adding that the group was positive that the economy would soon experience a turnaround, “as the government is working very hard in that direction.” \nThe group said the biggest constituency of the President was the poor and lowly, and thus recommended what it calls “a social re-armament of the poor.” \nWatch related video: \nThe report has been provided by Femi Adesina, the special adviser to the president on media and publicity, on Friday, Novermber 25.",

      "text": "Facebook \n– A chieftain of the APC, Mr Afolabi Olaposi, has been shot dead by unknown gunmen on his way home in Ondo state \n– The publicity secretary of the party, Mr Abayomi Adesanya, says the diseased was one of the leaders of the party in Igboroko Ward 1, in Owo in Ondo The Ondo governorship election is being contested by Akeredolu of the APC, Oke of the AD, Agunloye of the SDP and Jegede of the PDP. \nA chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) has been killed by unknown gunmen in Owo, Ondo state. \nREAD ALSO: Mimiko make DAMNING allegations against INEC \nMr Afolabi Olaposi was shot dead on his way home after attending a meeting of the party in preparation for the governorship election on Thursday night, November 24, according to a statement released the APC, Guardian reports. \nThe publicity secretary of the party in Ondo state, Mr Abayomi Adesanya, described the diseased as was one of the leaders of our party in Igboroko Ward 1, Owo. \nHe said the late politician was also an ardent supporter of our governorship candidate, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN). \n“He was a perfect gentleman who was committed to the development of the party in Owo and Ondo State in general. \n“The assailant also went to the house of Chief Jamiu Ekungba, an APC aspirant in the Sept. 3 Primary, and vandalised seven vehicles in his compound. \n“Ekungba was not to at home during the attack. \n“We believe those calling for the postponement of the election and threatening a repeat of 1983 violence were behind these dastardly acts. \n“We call on security agents in the state to fish out those behind these acts and ensure the protection of our people before, during and after the election,’’ Adesanya said. \nThe Independent National Electoral Commission has fixed Ondo governorship election for Saturday, Nov. 26. \nIn a related development, INEC has decided to appoint Kayode Soremekun as the returning officer for Saturday’s gubernatorial election in Ondo state, but the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the decision. \nSoremekun, who is the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University, Oye Ekiti, was the returning officer during September’s gubernatorial election in neighbouring Edo state, which the party’s candidate lost. \nThe PDP claimed Soremekun was a party to the alleged widespread rigging during the election won by the candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Godwin Obaseki.",

      "text": "Facebook \nA major protest has begun in Taraba state against the recent promotion and confirmation of Justice Adamu Paul Galumje of the Appeal Court, Sokoto division as one of the two new justices of the Supreme Court. \nThe people of Kurmi in Kurmi local government area of Taraba state say they are still in shock over the clearance of judge despite series of protests and petitions written against him to the Senate president, its committee on judiciary, human rights and legal matters, the National Judicial Council (NJC), the Department of State Security (DSS) and other agencies of government. Protest against judges \nThe spokespersons of the two ruling houses in the community, Ibrahim Ishaya Etsu and John Tobi Yarafa, said they were utterly surprised that “an individual with questionable character and who lacks integrity has been cleared to administer justice at the highest level. \n“What’s the hope for the common man with an individual who believes only in justice for the highest bidder? \n“The effort by the present administration to sanitise the judiciary will amount to exercise in futility with the likes of Justice Paul Adamu Galumje still on the bench.” \nIn a petition dated October 17, 2016 to the director-general of the DSS, the Ishaya Etsu/Tobi Yarafa chieftaincy family accused Galumje of abusing his office and allegedly offering bribe to the former acting governor of the state and a sitting senator, Alhaji Sani Danladi, to issue recognition certificate to someone not entitled to be king of the community. \nREAD ALSO: Justice Okon Abang is a DISGRACE to the judiciary – Fayose \nA part of the petition read: “Since May 2016, we wrote a petition to the National Judicial Council (NJC) complaining about Justice Adamu Paul Galumje using his position as a judge of Appeal Court, Sokoto division to pervert justice by manipulating the court process. \n“He also manipulated judgement to his favour in a matter we filed against him in matter where he manipulated his way to be the chairman of the Kingmakers where in a fact he is not a member of the Royal family in Kurmi Chiefdom.” \nThey further claimed that Justice Galumje induced the former acting governor of the state with the sum of N50 million to get his approval for his choice in the chieftaincy tussle. Justice Paul Adamu Galumje \nApart from that, the judge is said to have written a series of letters with his letter-headed paper to the former acting Governor Abubakar Sani now a senator on this same matter. \nThe community submitted a petition to the Senate committee on judiciary headed by David Umaru just after President Muhammadu Buhari, on October 6 nominated the judge. \n“We were surprised to read in some newspapers that the committee said they didn’t receive any petition against Justice Galumje. \n“Even the Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf, representing our district, Taraba Central, reinforced our petition to the Senate Committee and called their attention to it but the committee headed by Senator Umaru was hell-bent on clearing the judge.” \n“It will be an aberration to have such personality on the scared seat of the apex court based on Justice Galumje’s antecedents in perverting the course of justice, he is not a proper person for such position,” said Ishaya Etsu. \nREAD ALSO: PDP eulogises Goodluck Jonathan at 59 \nThe community accused the National Judicial Council (NJC) of being compromised by the immediate past Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Mahmud Mohammed, who also is from Taraba state. \nAccording to them, the former CJN cannot claim that he is not aware of the series of controversies around the person of Justice Galumj, adding that using his wealth and influence, he had oppressed the whole community. \n“For some time now, the once peaceful Kurmi community has known no peace following the imposition of someone not qualified for the throne as the king by the kingmakers in cohort with Justice Galumje,” the community alleged just as it has written another petition since Galumje is expected to be sworn-in next week. \nThe new petition comes in the form of an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari.",

The SUV driver, who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected from the vehicle. He was pronounced dead just after 6 a.m. at St. Joseph’s Hospital. (Photo: Arizona Department of Public Safety) \nOn the afternoon of Jan. 8, 2015, the driver of a black Hyundai sedan rear-ended another vehicle on Loop 101 near Broadway Road. An 84-year-old passenger in the sedan died of injuries from the impact. It was the first fatal accident on a Phoenix-area freeway that year. \nLess than a week later, during the afternoon of Jan. 14, the driver of a Chevrolet pickup tried to change lanes on Interstate 10 near 51st Avenue, sideswiping a Toyota sedan and ejecting a 56-year-old passenger from the car. The woman, who was not wearing a seat belt, died of her injuries. \nTen days later, on a Saturday night, a Chevrolet station wagon rear-ended a Toyota sedan in a five-car accident on I-10 near 16th Street. An 85-year-old passenger in the Toyota died. \nThese deaths are part of a string of fatal collisions that plague Maricopa County freeways. From 2013-15, a fatal freeway accident occurred in the Valley about every five days, leaving 207 people dead. \nFatalities on Arizona's urban freeways and interstates occurred at a rate 61 percent higher than the national average, according to 2013 Federal Highway Administration and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data. That average is determined by dividing the number of fatalities by the amount of miles driven on a particular roadway each year. \nOver the past three years, drivers and their passengers died on Valley freeways at every time of day, on every day of the week and on every major freeway. An Arizona Republic analysis of Arizona Department of Transportation collision data on Valley freeways from 2013-15 revealed some patterns: Most fatal crashes occurred in May, June and July. Fifty-two percent of fatal collisions occurred on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday. The hours of 4 a.m. and 11 p.m. had the most fatal crashes. Accidents involving just one vehicle are most common, making up about 42 percent of fatal wrecks. Of the 196 fatal accidents, 109 occurred on I-10 and I-17. Fatal incidents decreased significantly from 2013 to 2014, but increased slightly in 2015. \nStory continues below map. 2013-2015 fatal freeway crashes in Maricopa County Arizona ranks above the national average for fatal crashes on freeways, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Federal Highway Administration data. A review of Arizona Department of Transportation data showed that from 2013-2015, there were 196 fatal collisions on valley freeways, leaving 207 people dead. This map shows the locations of those fatal crashes. <!--iframe--> \nWhat do these trends reveal? Nothing, according to Arizona Department of Public Safety officials. \n\"There's just so many variables out there to come to some sort of reasonable certainty or conclusion,\" DPS Capt. Damon Cecil said. \nBut the crash data does show one recurring cause of fatal wrecks. \nIt wasn't road flaws. It wasn't the weather. \nIt was a human choice — or a sequence of choices — that separated life and death on Valley freeways. 'It will save your life' Facebook Posted!

It sounded like a gunshot, the woman told investigators. \nWhen DPS troopers arrived near the Loop 101 and U.S. 60 interchange 7 minutes later, the SUV was on its side. The driver and his girlfriend were trapped inside, and the three teenagers, who were ejected, lay in the middle of the freeway. \nThe driver was pronounced dead at the scene. His girlfriend was taken to the hospital with bruises and scrapes but was soon discharged. \nThe woman's daughter suffered severe head and torso injuries and died about an hour later at Maricopa Medical Center. The girl's best friend had a lacerated liver and two punctured lungs. The other teenage passenger fractured multiple facial bones, injured his eyes and bled internally. \nThe driver and his girlfriend wore seat belts, but the three backseat passengers did not, investigators determined. “You don’t know what’s going to happen. Some of these collisions and some of these fatalities, these people died and it wasn’t their fault. Something else caused the collision.” DPS Capt. Damon Cecil \nSeat-belt use would not have prevented the tire failure. It would not have stopped the vehicle from rolling and hitting a guard rail. But it may have kept the teenagers inside the vehicle during the crash, possibly saving one life and lessening the injuries of two others. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ejection from a vehicle in a crash is 30 times more likely for those not wearing a seat belt, and in crashes that are fatal, 75 percent of people ejected from a vehicle die. \nAbout half of the 207 people killed on Maricopa County freeways from 2013-15 did not use a safety device. \nDPS officials said increasing the use of seat belts is critical to combating the Valley's fatality rates. \n“You don’t know what’s going to happen. Some of these collisions and some of these fatalities, these people died and it wasn’t their fault. Something else caused the collision,\" Cecil said. \nArizonans used seat belts 86.6 percent of the time in 2015, which was lower than the national average of 88.5 percent, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \nNationally, seat-belt use has increased since 2000. But seat-belt use is lower in states such as Arizona, where troopers cannot pull someone over solely because they are not wearing a seat belt. \nIf troopers pull a vehicle over for another reason, they can cite drivers if front-seat passengers or anyone under 16 years old is not wearing a seat belt. Backseat passengers over 16 are not required to wear seat belts. \nBut they should, Cecil said. \n\"We have lost so many lives on Arizona highways because backseat passengers were not restrained and they get ejected from the vehicle in a collision. Occupant restraints, even though it may not be the law and they may not be required, it will save your life,\" Cecil said. A less safe mode of travel \nOn Jan. 18, 2014, about ten minutes before noon, a 56-year-old woman lost control of her maroon Harley Davidson motorcycle while attempting to navigate the curve on Interstate 10 near the Loop 202 exit in Phoenix. She was pronounced dead later that day at Maricopa County Medical Center. (Photo: Arizona Department of Public Safety) \nAs with seat belts, the law does not demand the use of helmets for motorcycle drivers and passengers. Using one may not prevent death due to the high rates of speed on freeways, but simply riding a motorcycle on a freeway increases the chances that a person will lose his or her life. \nOn Jan. 18, 2014, about 10 minutes before noon, a 56-year-old woman lost control of her maroon Harley-Davidson motorcycle while attempting to navigate the curve on I-10 near the Loop 202 exit. \nShe was in the HOV lane but drifted left across the yellow line and onto the shoulder where she hit a guard rail. Witnesses told DPS troopers that the woman flew off her bike and tumbled three times in the air before hitting a wooden pole and falling into the median. \nShe was pronounced dead at Maricopa Medical Center. \nAlthough motorcycles make up about 4 percent of all registered vehicles in the state, they were involved in 22 percent of fatal accidents on Maricopa County freeways from 2013-15. \n\"It's a big deal,\" said Mick Degan, chairman of the Arizona Motorcycle Safety and Awareness Foundation. He said almost all motorcycle riders know someone who died or has been seriously injured in a motorcycle crash. “A lot of motorcyclists will say, 'The reason I had a motorcycle accident is because of a car.' Well, a good percentage of the motorcycle accidents are because of the motorcycle rider.” Mick Degan, Arizona Motorcycle Safety and Awareness Foundation chairman \nDegan helped found the organization in 2011 after two of his friends died in motorcycle crashes, he said. \n\"I had a motorcycle business and rode as a hobby, but I was seeing too many people getting either injured or killed on motorcycles,\" Degan said. \nHe believes the main causes of motorcycle crashes are other drivers who don't see motorcycles, as well as riders who use alcohol or drugs, drive too fast or lack training. Degan said his group estimates that 40 percent of motorcycle riders don't have a motorcycle endorsement on their license. \n\"A lot of motorcyclists will say, 'The reason I had a motorcycle accident is because of a car,' \" Degan said. \"Well, a good percentage of the motorcycle accidents are because of the motorcycle rider.\" \nDegan's organization tries to educate drivers to be more aware of motorcyclists, but the focus is training courses for riders. \n\"I ride a motorcycle and I take a course about every two years. It's so easy to get into bad habits when you're out there riding,\" he said. \nAdditionally, Degan said he always wears a helmet, and encourages riders to buy \"good\" helmets — ones that are U.S. Department of Transportation compliant. But, he admits that when he was young, \"I thought it was cool not to ride with one,\" and he knows many riders who choose not to wear one. \nNationwide, 60.7 percent of motorcyclists used helmets that complied with federal standards in 2015, according to NHTSA. But in states that do not have a mandatory helmet law, like Arizona, the rate of use of such helmets was just 42.9 percent. \nSometimes, helmets are not enough to protect motorcyclists from severe injury on freeways, however. \nNHTSA estimates that helmets would have changed the outcome of about 37 percent of motorcycle-rider fatalities and 41 percent of passenger fatalities. \n\"On interstates where you’re doing 75 mph — you’re going very, very fast — and if you have a catastrophic equipment failure ... or even if someone doesn’t see you and cuts you off, it’s going to be devastating on your body,” Cecil said.

Olshaskie moved behind the car and followed it at 78 mph. A short while later, the Malibu revved to 89 mph. \nOlshaskie ticketed the driver for doing 85 mph and driving on a suspended license. He gave the driver a curbside lecture about the dangers of speeding and reckless driving, and impounded his car. \n\"He didn't even know how fast he was going. He never looked,\" Olshaskie said. “Drugs and alcohol play a role in it. Individuals not wearing their seat belts. People driving too fast. Those, in my opinion, are the three biggest factors in deaths on the freeway.” Highway Patrol Sgt. James Burton \nSpeeding ranks among the top factors that make the region's freeways dangerous, said Highway Patrol Sgt. James Burton. \nThe highest concentration of fatalities were on U.S. 60, Interstate 10 and Interstate 17, which are the busiest freeways in the Valley. But they share other similar features: They are straight and wide, and they are jammed during rush hours and loose otherwise. \nIn contrast, the turning and curvy Loop 101, Loop 202, Loop 303 and State Route 51 account for fewer fatalities per freeway mile. The difference, according to experts, is that during non-rush hours, drivers push speed and take greater chances on straight freeways because they appear safe. \nFatalities, however, spike during non-commuter hours, when the heavily used roads are less jammed, and vehicles can easily reach speeds of 80 mph or more. \nAlmost half of fatal collisions from 2013-15 involved a single vehicle. These accidents are caused by many factors, including equipment failure. When drivers cruise at high speeds, it is more difficult to recover from an unexpected issue like a tire blowout. \nPREVIOUSLY: 10 most accident-prone Valley intersections | Arizona's best, worst cities for driver safety \nDrivers traveling at those speeds have little hope for recovery should an unexpected hazard appear in the road or a vehicle malfunction occur and send the car into a barrier. \n\"Drugs and alcohol play a role in it. Individuals not wearing their seat belts. People driving too fast. Those, in my opinion, are the three biggest factors in deaths on the freeway,\" Burton said. Tough DUI laws, persistent problem Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Arizona is a no-tolerance state for DUIs, meaning you can be arrested with a blood-alcohol content higher than the legal limit of 0.08 percent. There are three types of DUIs, each taking into account BAC levels and other factors, such as a previous conviction or whether any minors were in the vehicle. The more serious the DUI, the more you can expect to pay.

Troopers found several empty bottles of alcohol in his vehicle, and a witness said Monroe, who was 33 years old at the time, appeared to \"stumble around\" when she got out of her car. She faces a manslaughter charge in Maricopa County Superior Court. \nDespite national and local efforts to quash drinking and driving — and some of the toughest DUI penalties in the nation — nearly 60 percent of fatal Valley freeway accidents from 2013-15 involved alcohol. “It's 2016, we've got Uber, we've got the light rail, we've got every other option but that one (drunk driving) and, unfortunately, that's the option that ends up in 60 percent of those fatalities.” Halley McIntyre, Arizona MADD programs manager \n\"It's 2016, we've got Uber, we've got the light rail, we've got every other option but that one and, unfortunately, that's the option that ends up in 60 percent of those fatalities. It's an incredibly unfortunate situation that we're facing here in the Valley,\" said Halley McIntyre, programs manager for Mothers Against Drunk Driving in Arizona. \nIn the past decade, drunken-driving fatalities have declined by about 30 percent nationally. But the numbers are still too high, McIntyre said. \nMcIntyre said she speaks to about 500 DUI offenders every month. When she shares stories about drunken drivers who caused fatal accidents, many offenders say, \" 'Well, I'm not a bad person, so that wouldn't happen to me, I just got a DUI.' \n\"I say, 'Look. Here's the deal: The people that end up causing these crashes weren't bad people either, but they made the same choice that you did.' I think that when people understand that it doesn't take a bad person to cause this crash, it just takes the bad decision, hopefully the numbers will go down,\" McIntyre said. \nMcIntyre said she recognizes that there are almost always multiple factors that contribute to fatal accidents, but many of those things, such as vehicle malfunctions or unexpected debris, are unavoidable. \n\"Even if there were a road hazard that you weren't anticipating, you're going to be much more able to deal with it much easier if you were in fact fully sober, fully coherent and fully able to pay attention to the road. \n\"You can't control the circumstances, you can only control your choices,\" McIntyre said. Distracted drivers a growing problem \nArizona Department of Public Safety Trooper Steven Jacobs takes notes while responding to an accident call on Interstate 10 on June 20, 2016 in Phoenix, Ariz. Someone dies on metro Phoenix freeways about once every four days. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) \nOn June 20, a dispatch message came across DPS Trooper Steven James' radio. A two-car accident was blocking the right lanes of eastbound I-10 just before 75th Avenue. \nWhen James arrived, he determined that the driver of a brand-new Cadillac was speeding when traffic suddenly slowed in front of him. He tried to stop and turn right, but lost control of his vehicle and hit a red pickup truck. Both drivers were uninjured, but their vehicles were disabled. \nThey were lucky. It was rush hour and speeds on I-10 were relatively low. \nAfter single-vehicle accidents, rear-end collisions were the most common type of fatal incident. Serious rear-end accidents can result in the ejection of the driver or passengers in the striking vehicle. \nNearly a quarter of the fatal accidents from 2013-15 were rear-end crashes. \nAnd the predominant cause of rear-end collisions are driver distractions, like cellphones or passengers, James said. \n\"(The driver of the Cadillac) was probably a distracted driver, but he's not going to say he was,\" James said. \nNationally, 3,179 people died and an estimated additional 431,000 others were injured in motor-vehicle crashes involving distracted driving in 2014, according to NHTSA. \nPREVIOUSLY: Deadly wrong-way crashes vexing Arizona officials \nThat number could be higher because of significant data limitations. DPS officials said they rely on individuals to self-report when they are distracted, and people often lie. \n“The only way we know if there’s a distraction is if we interview the driver or we have witnesses that can give us that information. Otherwise, we can say, yeah, it probably was a distraction, but we’re not going to put it down as a distracted driver unless we know for sure,\" Trooper Kameron Lee said. \nADOT began tracking distracted driving in 2014, but cellphone use was not listed as a distraction in any of the fatal freeway accidents in Maricopa County in 2014 or 2015. Troopers marked \"unknown\" in the distracted-driving column on the vast majority of fatal-collision reports. \nNumerous notable distracted-driving accidents on city streets and on freeways outside of Maricopa County have occurred. In May 2013, DPS Trooper Tim Huffman, 47, was killed near Yuma by a semitruck driver who was looking at pictures of provocatively dressed women on his phone, according to case files obtained by The Republic in 2013. \nThese incidents have led some cities, such as Phoenix, Tempe, Tucson and Flagstaff, to pass ordinances prohibiting texting while driving. But Arizona remains one of only two states that does not have have some form of statewide ban on texting while driving . DPS troopers can enforce city ordinances, but they usually do not, Cecil said. \nCellphone use is not the only distraction that concerns law-enforcement officers. In 2015, a passenger distraction was listed in one Maricopa County freeway fatality, and distractions from outside the vehicle were noted in three fatal accidents. \n“Obviously, mobile devices are significant. Passenger distractions, whether it’s a distraction from someone else in the vehicle or maybe a child in the backseat, but passenger distractions also are fairly common. Food, eating. ... Makeup, sometimes,” Cecil said. What can be done? \nArizona Department of Public Safety Trooper Robert Olshaskie makes a traffic stop on Interstate 17 on Friday, July 1, 2016, in Phoenix. (Photo: Ben Moffat/The Republic) \nAll of these factors are present in metro areas nationwide, but a question still remains: Why are drivers more likely to die on freeways in some states, like Arizona, than in others? \n\"I had 50 years of studying this stuff, and I still don't know that answer to that question. And I've studied it intensely,\" said David Hartgen, a Reason Foundation expert and author of a study published earlier this year that showed Arizona in the top 10 states for fatalities on state highways. \nHartgen said that each state, and each freeway system, is unique and every accident is unrelated, making it difficult to draw conclusions about causation. \n\"We don't know and we're probably not likely to figure it out,\" Hartgen said. \nWhat is known is that Arizona is notorious for lenient laws regarding most driver behaviors — excluding the state's DUI laws. \nSome people argue more laws won't alter the choices drivers make. But they have been successful in other states. \nFor example, states with laws that require motorcyclists be helmeted see a much larger contingent of riders wearing helmets. \nAlberto Gutier, director of the Arizona Governor's Office of Highway Safety and longtime Arizona politico, said decades ago there was a push to require helmets, but it was ultimately quashed by a barrage of riders who did not want the government dictating their motorcycle gear. \n\"Motorcycle helmets save lives and prevent serious injury in a crash,\" Gutier said, but he stressed that he was not pushing for a helmet law. “We want people to understand we really do care. ... If we go to a collision, let’s say it’s a rollover with an ejection ... that affects us, because we care. It makes us mad, because we know (the driver) would have survived that collision had she been wearing her seat belt, and that really takes a toll on us.” DPS Trooper Kameron Lee \nArizona's seat-belt rate is about 5 percentage points lower than the average rate in states that allow law-enforcement officers to pull someone over for not wearing a seat belt. \nDPS Trooper Lee said he tries to educate drivers about seat belts, even if he can't punish them. He said he often pulls beside another vehicle and taps his chest to encourage the driver to buckle up. They almost always do. \n“We want people to understand we really do care,” Lee said. “If we go to a collision, let’s say it’s a rollover with an ejection ... that affects us, because we care. It makes us mad, because we know (the driver) would have survived that collision had she been wearing her seat belt, and that really takes a toll on us.” \nThe Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine notes that typically, strong laws with strong enforcement change driver behavior — as with increased seat-belt use and decreased drunken driving. But there's one bad habit that appears will not be broken by law enforcement alone. \nResearchers have conducted numerous studies on the effectiveness of cellphone and texting bans, but results vary. \nThe Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine performed a review of 11 of these studies in 2014 and determined that bad data and difficult controls make it impossible to determine whether the laws are effective. \nIt is clear, however, that distracted driving frequently results in collisions — oftentimes fender-benders, but sometimes much more severe. \nEven without a ban, Gutier said troopers can still punish drivers for behaviors typically associated with distracted driving, such as veering into another lane or following another vehicle too closely. He said his office is currently funding a DPS program that encourages troopers to pay more attention to these bad driving habits. \n\"They can be cited, but in most cases (troopers) issue a warning,\" Gutier said. \"We're funding that program ... because that's a prevention strategy.\" More staffing, better cars \nArizona Department of Public Safety Trooper Steven Jacobs checks speeds of motorists on Interstate 10 on June 20, 2016 in Phoenix, Ariz. Someone dies on metro Phoenix freeways about once every four days. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) \nBut this program, and the other law-driven initiatives, requires an availability of troopers to make these preventive stops, which can be a luxury for the DPS. \nCecil said \"in a perfect world,\" his department would station two troopers per 10 lane-miles of freeway, but it is 25 percent short of that with 1.5 per 10 miles. \nEven with a fully staffed DPS and forceful laws, some drivers still would make life-ending choices. \nThat's why Eric Anderson, transportation director for the Maricopa Association of Governments, says he is excited for a future where many of those choices are taken away. \nFully autonomous vehicles may be years away, but cars already have automatic braking, blind-spot warnings and other new-age safety technology. Anderson said that as more new vehicles replace older ones, freeways across the country will see a decline in driver error. \n\"We'll probably still have accidents, but the severity of very serious injuries and fatalities may be reduced,\" Anderson said. 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2gpouzl TOP VIDEOS ",

(Photo: Tony Ding, Associated Press) \nThey will meet at midfield before The Game. Two close friends. The captains at Michigan and Ohio State. \nJake Butt, the tight end at Michigan. And Pat Elflein, the center at Ohio State. \n“Yeah, we are friends,” said Elfein, who went to high school with Butt in Pickerington, Ohio . “Friendship is bigger than football.” \nHe paused, coming to his senses. \n“But this week, it’s not. And he knows that. I’m sure he feels the exact same way. When it’s time to play, it’s time to play. Other than that, we are good friends.” \nOther than that -- that perfectly sums up this game that can stop two different states. \nThis is the biggest game of the year in college football -- in the regular season, at least. Ohio State is ranked No. 2 by the College Football Playoff committee, while Michigan is ranked No. 3. \nESPN is treating it like a mini Super Bowl . Wall-to-wall coverage. Endless breakdowns and analysis. \nBecause the ramifications are enormous. \nIf Ohio State wins, the Buckeyes will go straight to the College Football Playoff (assuming Penn State beats Michigan State). \nIf Michigan wins, the Wolverines will go straight to the Big Ten championship game in Indianapolis. \nOther than that -- this game still would be huge. It is the 113th meeting between the fierce rivals. \n“To be naive enough look at the College Football Playoff right now, that would be stupid, in my opinion,” Ohio State linebacker Joe Burger said. “This is all we care about, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. To look past that, after all the work we have put in, would be something that’s just not who we are.” \nThe game will be played in Columbus. (Quick fact: Michigan hasn’t won there since 2000.) \nAnd this game will feature a batch of players who were recruited by both schools. \nIn fact, cornerback Gareon Conley was going to Michigan. He was bleeding maize and blue until, well, he was offered by Ohio State. \nHe flipped his commitment . \n“I was young,” Conley said. “That was my first big offer, from (Michigan). I wanted to explore my options. When I came here (Ohio State), it felt like going from the same program to a better program of what I had already experienced, so I just stayed home.” \nDo you like Michigan? \n“Yeah, I respect everybody,” Conley said. \"But no, I don’t like them.\" \nOK. So there is a whole bunch of dislike between the two teams. But don’t mistake that for a lack of respect. \nAt its core, this rivalry is so great because both of these programs have been so great over such a long period of time, although Ohio State has won 11 of the last 12 games. \nA couple of years ago, after Ohio State quarterback J.T. Barrett went down with a broken ankle, Michigan quarterback Devin Gardner kneeled over him, offering him support. It was one of the classiest things I’ve ever seen. Photo: Michigan's Devin Gardner consoles J.T. Barrett \n“It was one of those things -- like I said, we might not like each other, but there is a respect aspect to it, absolutely,” Barrett said earlier this week. “Also, you don’t want to see anybody get hurt. ... He took time out to see how I was doing. That’s bigger than this rivalry, the aspect of caring about the players and the safety of them.” \nQuirky fact: When the Buckeyes beat the Wolverines, each player receives a charm of gold pants. \n“Those gold pants, when you actually win those for the first time, it’s a feeling like no other,” Ohio State linebacker Chris Worley said. “I’ve been fortunate to win three. I remember when I won the first one, and my mom wanted them. I was like, ‘You gotta wait. You aren’t getting these.’ I finally gave her a pair of my gold pants last year. It doesn’t just mean a lot to us, it means a lot to our families, too.” \nThis is Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh versus Ohio State coach Urban Meyer , who is undefeated against the Wolverines at OSU. \nHarbaugh versus Meyer is starting to feel a lot like Bo Schembechler versus Woody Hayes. \nNeither team is perfect. Both teams have proved to be less than invincible. \nMichigan, which lost to Iowa, comes into this game with some uncertainty , after quarterback Wilton Speight suffered a shoulder injury. His backup, John O’Korn, was underwhelming against Indiana. \nOhio State, which lost against Penn State, is coming off a closer-than-expected, 17-16 victory at Michigan State. \nSo the stage is set. The Game is here. The ramifications are enormous. \nAn entire season coming down to one game. \nJust like the old days.",

      "text": "Facebook blessings scam spreading this weekend By Kim Komando, Komando.com \nThis time of year, Facebook seems more like Scambook. Just a few days ago we warned you not to fall for the \"secret sisters gift exchange\" scam. This Facebook post asks you to purchase one gift for someone else at the cost of $10. In return, the scammer says that you will receive between six and 36 gifts for yourself. \nThe newest scam spreading on Facebook is the \"Blessings Loom.\" Sounds legitimate, who would not want to receive a blessing, right? Do a search on Facebook for Blessings Loom and you'll see a ton of results. \nThis is why I want to bring it your attention before it's too late for you. As a matter of fact, anytime I bring you news like this, it's always a good \nAs a matter of fact, anytime I bring you news like this, it's always a good idea to share this post on Facebook. Hopefully, together we can prevent others from being taken. How it works \nBy the Blessings Loom post on Facebook, you see an image. It shows a diagram that looks a lot like the image posted at the top of this article. The post tells you that you need to contribute money to a PayPal account. Usually, this is $100. \nThen, you need to recruit two other people to do the same. When the diagram is full of various people's names and they also have contributed the $100 and recruited two other people, you get your payout. You are promised $800 in return for your $100 investment. It's a Ponzi Scheme \nStay far away from this scam. These schemes are well-known for taking money and returning nothing. It's the classic stealing from Peter to pay Paul. If you do see this scam on Facebook, report the post. \nIf you are looking to make money online, I have tons of resources free here at Komando.com \nOr if you prefer, browse the Money Tips on my site.

Truckload of money reportedly arrive in Akure ahead of Ondo election \nAgbaje said INEC is aware that VIPs are in town for the Ondo election but the electoral body would not accept them going around with armed bodyguards during the election process. To be safe from arrest, he advised them to stay in their hotels. \n“We are aware that there are some VIP’s who have come into the state with their armed security men,” he said. \n“The security agencies have been alerted on the development, and we have told them to arrest any of such persons who attempt to act in breach of the electoral law. \n“We advise them to stay put in their hotels and not come out, or they will be arrested and dealt with appropriately,” Agbaje said. \nREAD ALSO: Postpone Ondo Election now, Governor Mimiko to INEC \nHe also warned electorates to help the security agents out so they can prevent VIPs from truncating election process. \n“The people should be alive to their responsibilities ,” he said. ”I believe that the voters will not allow them and should be able to speak out when they see such a thing.” \nMeanwhile, the Alliance for Democracy (AD) has warned INEC and security agencies against manipulating the results of the election in favour of any party, especially the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). \nSpeaking with reporters, in Akure, the Ondo state capital, the Director General of Olusola Oke campaign organization Bola Ilori said any attempt to manipulate the result of the election will be resisted by the good people of Ondo State, adding that the people of the state should be allowed to choose who rules them.",

      "text": "Jarek Tuszyński / CC-BY-SA-4.0 Like us on Facebook \nOn November 26, 1948, Edwin Land debuted his first \"Land Camera,\" dubbed the Model 95A. This was the first \"Polaroid camera,\" as we'd popularly know it—though camera nerds like me still talk about Land Cameras . Anyway, the 95A went on sale at the Jordan Marsh department store in Boston for $89.75. (That would be just over $900 in today's money.) \nLand had been inspired to create an instant-results photography system by his daughter, who asked him why she couldn't see the picture he had just taken of her. In those days, you had to develop the film using many steps (and plenty of chemicals), print it, and then your kid got to see the picture. It took Land and his team years to develop the instant self-developing film and cameras to go with it, but the system became a huge hit. \nMy favorite video about Polaroid cameras is this 10-minute documentary-slash-ad by Charles and Ray Eames. It focuses on the SX-70 model, introduced in 1972. Enjoy: \nFor more on the history of Polaroid and Edwin Land, check out this Boston.com slideshow . Polaroid did a lot of cool stuff before making cameras! Also interesting is this timeline (PDF link) of Polaroid inventions. \n(Image courtesy of Jarek Tuszyński , used under CC-BY-SA-4.0 license.)

      "text": "November 26, 2016 Aleksandra Atanasova \nWe all have those annoying Facebook friends who simply can’t stop posting selfies. As soon as they cross the threshold of a location, they create a check-in status and they never fail to inform us if they feel “excited” or “relaxed” there. Eventually, we block such people, but then again, aren’t we all like that at times? Psychologists warn that narcissistic, self-exposing behavior is on the rise nowadays, and many blame social media for this increase. A modern pandemic \nStudies show that the levels of subclinical narcissism - or the personality trait that all normal individuals possess to a certain degree - have increased worldwide since the 1970s. Self-esteem is rapidly rising, too - according to data published in the Review of General Psychology, 80% of American students scored higher in self-esteem in 2006 than the generation from 1988. Scientists have also found that today’s young people are more likely than older adults to have ever experienced Narcissistic Personality Disorder, or the clinical dimension of narcissism. \nCan we explain this sudden epidemic with the advent of social media? \nAs it turns out, narcissism is not a stable personality trait, but rather a manifestations dependent largely on the environment. For instance, media can influence whether we act as narcissists. A recent study showed that people exposed to narcissistic reality TV characters exhibit higher levels of narcissism immediately afterwards. \nOther data also supports this theory: a paper from 2011 found that teenagers who use Facebook more often show more narcissistic tendencies than their peers. Increased Facebook use is directly linked to narcissism in adults, too, indicate results from a self-report study published this August. \nSo, what turns social networks into incubators for self-absorbed individuals? Mirror, mirror \nThe reason lies in their nature. As psychologist Eric B. Weiser states - social networks may create or reinforce narcissistic tendencies because they serve primarily as self-promotional platforms. \nHowever, the opposite may also hold true - more narcissists will be active on social media as these platforms allow them to engage in exhibitionistic, attention-seeking, and self-promoting behaviors. \nLet’s also keep in mind that people with narcissistic characters need admiration from others. Their grandiose self-views thrive on easy-to-obtain social media endorsements such as likes, shares, or new followers. Furthermore, narcissists prefer superficial connections with other people, and are really bad at listening and expressing empathy - this again makes social networks a very tempting environment for them. How to spot a narcissist online? \nAlthough we all become narcissistic on social media, some remain more vocal then others in their self-expression. So how can you pick out narcissistic behaviors that go beyond the normal levels? \nThe first thing to pay attention to is their photos - people with narcissistic tendencies care very much about pictures. For example, they're more likely to wear expensive, flashy clothing on photos, and their general appearance reveals a lot of preparation. \nThese conclusions were made in a study that aimed to discover whether people can determine if others are narcissists just by looking at their photos. As part of the process, researchers identified 16 visual cues that reveal if a person in a photo is narcissistic, and all of those cues were related to narcissists’ desire to be the center of attention. For example, female narcissists tend to wear make-up and show cleavage more often than other women. Male narcissists are more likely to wear clothes that enhance their social status, and less likely to have sunglasses in photos. \nAs a rule, people with higher scores on narcissism are more motivated to select profile photos on Facebook that emphasize their attractiveness . This data comes from Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich. The research team analyzed the Facebook presence of 288 students and asked them about their motivation to choose particular images. \nSimilar results can be found in a more detailed paper that examined how narcissism is generally manifested on social media - the researchers coded the Facebook pages of 156 students according to criteria such as photos, activity on the platform, number of lines in the About section. A group of independent “observers” was then asked to view each Facebook profile and answer questions on the content. The findings showed that, indeed, participants with higher scores of narcissism post more attractive photos. Their images were also perceived as “more entertaining” by the external observers. \nThe study also discovered that narcissistic users have more Facebook friends than others, create more posts in general, and more self-promotional posts than informative ones in particular, while they also write longer descriptions in the About section of their pages. \nThe researchers linked the larger number of friends with the fact that narcissists prefer weak ties, or shallow connections, and like to win Facebook friends as trophies. Another possible explanation could be that narcissistic people are typically extroverted – according to a meta-analysis of 62 studies on social media and narcissism published recently, narcissists’ tend to have more friends and generate more content on social media may, in part, be linked to their extraversion. \nIf you assume that excessive posting on social media would also mean that narcissistic individuals spend more time on their smartphones, well, you are wrong - it turns out, surprisingly, that narcissists are less dependent on the touchscreen than others. A smartphone data-tracking study analyzed how much time people spent on mobile every day and found that participants with higher smartphone usage typically have lower scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory. According to the authors, this can be explained by the fact that people mostly use their smartphones for social interaction, which is exactly what narcissists avoid. Monitoring social media feeds of others or experiencing the fear of missing out (FOMO) are not typical for narcissism, but relate more to neuroticism. \nAnother form of proof that someone is narcissistic can be found in his or her writing style. Do they use “I”, “me” or “my” a lot? Do they swear? Researchers from University of Georgia did a linguistic analysis on individual Facebook pages based on the fact that narcissists tend to speak more about themselves and use more personal pronouns. However, when there were no first-person pronouns in the texts, narcissistic authors used other verbal tactics to attract attention to their content - they used more profane and antisocial terms. A linguistic analysis of 1000 Twitter accounts yielded similar results – people with higher levels of narcissism were found to use more words about anger and negative emotions and fewer words about social interaction. \nInterestingly, several studies have also found a connection between narcissism and cyberbullying. Although there are different opinions on what type of narcissism better predicts cyberbullying behavior, one thing is clear: people with an emphasized narcissistic trait often try to attract attention by using bad language or more direct verbal attacks. Selfies from around the globe \nA common characteristic for the social media presence of narcissists is an abundance of selfies. \nResults from a survey completed by 1200 US residents reveal that two dimensions of narcissism positively correlate with the frequency of posting selfies on social media. These are the \"Leadership/Authority\" type, attributed to individuals who seek power and authority over others, and the \"Exhibitionism/Grandiosity\" type, which reflects self-absorption, vanity, and attention-seeking. \nAnd There's more to that. Not only are narcissists more likely to produce selfies, the very act of taking selfies alone makes people more narcissistic. Results from a longitudinal study show an increase in the subsequent levels of narcissism in people who photograph themselves more often. \nAnother paper examined the relationship between narcissism and various types of selfie posting behaviors - posting solo selfies, selfies with a group, and editing selfies. The results indicate that narcissists post more solo selfies and edit their selfies more often than other people. \nLastly, thought-provoking data: researcher David G. Taylor from Sacred Heart University found that narcissistic people post more travel photos on Facebook. Certainly it doesn’t mean that they gallivant more. Travel images are a type of self-promoting content, and as such they are published with the idea to attract attention and enhance our social status. The most narcissistic platform… \nThere are more narcissistic users on Twitter than on Facebook, according to a study from 2013. Shawn Bergman and his colleagues analyzed posting behaviors and motivation for social media use of 500 students and found that college students who scored higher on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory preferred Twitter. This can be explained wby the fact that the platform encourages posting frequent updates and accumulating shallow, non-reciprocal relationships (followers), which are most likely desired by narcissists. \nHowever, the researchers acknowledge that the nature of the two platforms is different, and that Facebook also offers opportunity for self-promotion with features aimed at embellishing one’s personal Facebook page – for instance, changing the profile photo, filling out the About section, adding one’s interests, etc. The results from the study also show that Facebook is the preferred option for adults with narcissistic tendencies, while Twitter remains the platform of choice for younger narcissists. \nFaster growing visual platforms such as Instagram or Snapchat must also be considered. Instagram, for example, was found to attract younger audience with narcissistic tendencies, and the main motivation of narcissistic Instagram users was to appear “cool” in the eyes of their followers. In another study, 124 students filled out an online survey that measured both their levels of narcissism and their preference for specific social media platforms. Regular users of Snapchat and Instagram exhibited higher levels of the Exhibitionism/Grandiosity dimension of narcissism than users of Facebook and Twitter. Me, my cell phone and I \nWe're all narcissistic to some extent. In the digital zeitgeist, self-exposure has become an easy way to communicate, which many of us embrace. Ironically, however, people create polished online versions of themselves with the aim to attract others, and harvest just the opposite results. \nThe truth is that narcissistic content is perceived unfavorably by social media users. A recent study collected status updates from 316 Facebook pages and presented them as screenshots to a group of people. To ensure objectivity, details like profile photos, names, and other page information were blurred. The observers were asked to evaluate the status updates based on criteria such as likeability, successfulness, and likelihood of being friends with the author of the status. \nThe results showed that people who posted narcissistic status updates (e. g. ‘‘Purging my friends list. Good luck making the cut’’) were perceived as less likeable, less successful, and less worthy of friendship than those who posted less narcissistic or neutral status updates (e. g. ‘‘I know everything will be okay. Nobody can bring me down’’). \nSo, think twice before you humblebrag about a new job or upload another selfie. Instead, maybr link to a cat video: it'll certainly provoke more honest likes. \nThe vector images used to create the visuals above are from Pixabay.com . Many thanks to all the authors.

Furthermore, narcissists prefer superficial connections with other people, and are really bad at listening and expressing empathy - this again makes social networks a very tempting environment for them.\nHow to spot a narcissist online? Although we all become narcissistic on social media, some remain more vocal then others in their self-expression. So how can you pick out narcissistic behaviors that go beyond the normal levels?\nThe first thing to pay attention to is their photos - people with narcissistic tendencies care very much about pictures. For example, they're more likely to wear expensive, flashy clothing on photos, and their general appearance reveals a lot of preparation.\nThese conclusions were made in a study that aimed to discover whether people can determine if others are narcissists just by looking at their photos. As part of the process, researchers identified 16 visual cues that reveal if a person in a photo is narcissistic, and all of those cues were related to narcissists’ desire to be the center of attention. For example, female narcissists tend to wear make-up and show cleavage more often than other women. Male narcissists are more likely to wear clothes that enhance their social status, and less likely to have sunglasses in photos.\nAs a rule, people with higher scores on narcissism are more motivated to select profile photos on Facebook that emphasize their attractiveness . This data comes from Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich. The research team analyzed the Facebook presence of 288 students and asked them about their motivation to choose particular images.\nSimilar results can be found in a more detailed paper that examined how narcissism is generally manifested on social media - the researchers coded the Facebook pages of 156 students according to criteria such as photos, activity on the platform, number of lines in the About section. A group of independent “observers” was then asked to view each Facebook profile and answer questions on the content. The findings showed that, indeed, participants with higher scores of narcissism post more attractive photos. Their images were also perceived as “more entertaining” by the external observers.\nThe study also discovered that narcissistic users have more Facebook friends than others, create more posts in general, and more self-promotional posts than informative ones in particular, while they also write longer descriptions in the About section of their pages.\nThe researchers linked the larger number of friends with the fact that narcissists prefer weak ties, or shallow connections, and like to win Facebook friends as trophies. Another possible explanation could be that narcissistic people are typically extroverted – according to a meta-analysis of 62 studies on social media and narcissism published recently, narcissists’ tend to have more friends and generate more content on social media may, in part, be linked to their extraversion.\nIf you assume that excessive posting on social media would also mean that narcissistic individuals spend more time on their smartphones, well, you are wrong - it turns out, surprisingly, that narcissists are less dependent on the touchscreen than others. A smartphone data-tracking study analyzed how much time people spent on mobile every day and found that participants with higher smartphone usage typically have lower scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory. According to the authors, this can be explained by the fact that people mostly use their smartphones for social interaction, which is exactly what narcissists avoid. Monitoring social media feeds of others or experiencing the fear of missing out (FOMO) are not typical for narcissism, but relate more to neuroticism.\nAnother form of proof that someone is narcissistic can be found in his or her writing style. Do they use “I”, “me” or “my” a lot? Do they swear? Researchers from University of Georgia did a linguistic analysis on individual Facebook pages based on the fact that narcissists tend to speak more about themselves and use more personal pronouns. However, when there were no first-person pronouns in the texts, narcissistic authors used other verbal tactics to attract attention to their content - they used more profane and antisocial terms. A linguistic analysis of 1000 Twitter accounts yielded similar results – people with higher levels of narcissism were found to use more words about anger and negative emotions and fewer words about social interaction.\nInterestingly, several studies have also found a connection between narcissism and cyberbullying. Although there are different opinions on what type of narcissism better predicts cyberbullying behavior, one thing is clear: people with an emphasized narcissistic trait often try to attract attention by using bad language or more direct verbal attacks.\nSelfies from around the globe A common characteristic for the social media presence of narcissists is an abundance of selfies.\nResults from a survey completed by 1200 US residents reveal that two dimensions of narcissism positively correlate with the frequency of posting selfies on social media. These are the \"Leadership/Authority\" type, attributed to individuals who seek power and authority over others, and the \"Exhibitionism/Grandiosity\" type, which reflects self-absorption, vanity, and attention-seeking.\nAnd There's more to that. Not only are narcissists more likely to produce selfies, the very act of taking selfies alone makes people more narcissistic. Results from a longitudinal study show an increase in the subsequent levels of narcissism in people who photograph themselves more often.\nAnother paper examined the relationship between narcissism and various types of selfie posting behaviors - posting solo selfies, selfies with a group, and editing selfies. The results indicate that narcissists post more solo selfies and edit their selfies more often than other people.\nLastly, thought-provoking data: researcher David G. Taylor from Sacred Heart University found that narcissistic people post more travel photos on Facebook. Certainly it doesn’t mean that they gallivant more. Travel images are a type of self-promoting content, and as such they are published with the idea to attract attention and enhance our social status.\nThe most narcissistic platform… There are more narcissistic users on Twitter than on Facebook, according to a study from 2013. Shawn Bergman and his colleagues analyzed posting behaviors and motivation for social media use of 500 students and found that college students who scored higher on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory preferred Twitter. This can be explained wby the fact that the platform encourages posting frequent updates and accumulating shallow, non-reciprocal relationships (followers), which are most likely desired by narcissists.\nHowever, the researchers acknowledge that the nature of the two platforms is different, and that Facebook also offers opportunity for self-promotion with features aimed at embellishing one’s personal Facebook page – for instance, changing the profile photo, filling out the About section, adding one’s interests, etc. The results from the study also show that Facebook is the preferred option for adults with narcissistic tendencies, while Twitter remains the platform of choice for younger narcissists.\nFaster growing visual platforms such as Instagram or Snapchat must also be considered. Instagram, for example, was found to attract younger audience with narcissistic tendencies, and the main motivation of narcissistic Instagram users was to appear “cool” in the eyes of their followers. In another study, 124 students filled out an online survey that measured both their levels of narcissism and their preference for specific social media platforms. Regular users of Snapchat and Instagram exhibited higher levels of the Exhibitionism/Grandiosity dimension of narcissism than users of Facebook and Twitter.\nMe, my cell phone and I We're all narcissistic to some extent. In the digital zeitgeist, self-exposure has become an easy way to communicate, which many of us embrace. Ironically, however, people create polished online versions of themselves with the aim to attract others, and harvest just the opposite results.\nThe truth is that narcissistic content is perceived unfavorably by social media users. A recent study collected status updates from 316 Facebook pages and presented them as screenshots to a group of people. To ensure objectivity, details like profile photos, names, and other page information were blurred. The observers were asked to evaluate the status updates based on criteria such as likeability, successfulness, and likelihood of being friends with the author of the status.\nThe results showed that people who posted narcissistic status updates (e. g. ‘‘Purging my friends list. Good luck making the cut’’) were perceived as less likeable, less successful, and less worthy of friendship than those who posted less narcissistic or neutral status updates (e. g. ‘‘I know everything will be okay. Nobody can bring me down’’).\nSo, think twice before you humblebrag about a new job or upload another selfie. Instead, maybr link to a cat video: it'll certainly provoke more honest likes.\nThe vector images used to create the visuals above are from Pixabay.com . Many thanks to all the authors.",

      "text": "Machine learning can fix Twitter, Facebook, and maybe even America Posted Black   Quitting Twitter is easy — I’ve done it a hundred times. Someone called it “a clown car that drove into a gold mine,” and like all clown cars, Twitter makes the passengers get out once in awhile. If I go back, it’s because I’m addicted. The tight news cycle, tweetstorms, gossip mongers, insight, argument, factoids, snark and one-liners. For an information junkie, that little bubble is hard to resist. But Twitter — and Facebook, for that matter — is desperately broken in ways that alienate users, spread hate and endanger us as a species. The elections have revealed how broken they are better than anything else could have. First, let’s talk about what’s broken. One set of problems are the collisions between unlike users, and the offense, outrage, and remorse that follow. Another, much larger set of problems arise from the falsehood, hate and lies that go viral on social media, and their electoral consequences. These two sets of problems are interrelated. We’re getting too much trolling and not enough facts: we need to screen out one and let in the other. The right filters can address both problems. People who have left Twitter in the last year, at least temporarily, include Leslie Jones of the Ghostbusters remake, the British comic Stephen Fry , and Marc Andreessen of A16Z. Other notable recent departures include Zelda Williams , who was attacked after the suicide of her father Robin. That’s right: She was attacked on Twitter after the suicide of her father. They sent her fake mortuary photos of him. That’s an example of the first problem. Offense and Open Communities A lot of people, especially in San Francisco, think that open communities are great and that social media should be all about connecting people. But not everybody should be connected. Umberto Eco said that television gave us the village idiot so that we could feel superior, while the Internet gave us the village idiot as a source of truth. Nobody wants to argue with the village idiot, let alone millions of them. On Twitter, you have to block them one at a time. That’s a lot of work, and by then it’s too late. Their trolling idiocy has infected your life. Their work is done before the rules can be enforced. Perfectly open communities always go sour. You need filters. Every functional community has them. And that’s where machine learning comes in. The natural-language processing to detect trolls, racism and insults isn’t hard, and Tweets as a data genre have been analyzed to death . We can build filters that work. (If you want to know how, you should read about neural nets and deep learning .) Deep learning is setting new records in accuracy for a lot of difficult problems, including image and voice recognition. It will achieve similar gains with text classification using algorithms like Word2vec and Doc2vec. If you can detect trolls, you can protect the people they’re trolling by muting or putting a warning over the trolls’ posts. Twitter could even figure out who likes a few threats of violence now and then and personalize the masking. Personally, I go on Twitter to learn new things and hear new voices. But there have been some interesting studies from liberal scholars that certain kinds of diversity can hurt civic life and erode trust. At the very least, it’s something that online communities should pay attention to, if they want to keep people coming back. There’s a radical openness to Twitter, which is cool some of the time, and uncool other times. It’s the uncool times that stick with you. You can’t unsee morgue shots of your father, like those that were Tweeted at Zelda. Twitter can do something about it, and they should. They already have a way of screening out porn . Why don’t they do the same thing with ethnic slurs, death threats and other kinds of trolling? Just draw a curtain over them. After a while, people will figure out that they don’t really want to see what someone said, if Twitter masks it. And their day will be better. And they will keep using Twitter. Tweeting to the Choir in a Post-Fact Bubble “A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.” Winston Churchill said that. With social media, a lie probably circles the world a couple times… The algorithms of platforms such as Facebook and Twitter may not shield us from hate, but they do encourage the spread of emotion-rich content among like-minded people, especially when that content triggers outrage. The more shares a post gets, the more it will be promoted to similar individuals because Facebook et al optimizes for engagement, period. Unfortunately, a lot of that content is false, and its popularity has consequences. One of the main problems with U.S. politics is a yearslong shift away from facts and science . It’s the replacement of a reality-based community , as formulated in the years of George W. Bush, with a platform of wishful thinking … backed by nukes. That’s problematic for a lot of different reasons, notably the way it breaks our ability to understand cause and effect, trade, war and indifferent nature. It’s particularly harmful to how we relate to each other. Because facts are something that can unite very disparate people, while beliefs are endlessly divergent. Without them; bubbles all the way down. We live in an age of self-reinforcing beliefs, and the reinforcement of groupthink happens in a feedback loop with the media, especially social media. We need to stop the flow of hate and lies and help the spread of facts, because words matter. What do I mean by lies? I mean this fake news . And the weird way Macedonian teenagers pumped out disinformation about Trump during this election cycle. Not only are our social media channels filled with garbage, but Americans are being gamed by foreigners. It should be illegal, but even if it’s not against the law, it’s something tech companies could control, if they wanted to… They can control it because we now have the ability to detect hidden patterns in text to — say — identify a book’s true author. (The pseudonymous author Elena Ferrante was outed by a statistical textual analysis of her work before an investigative journalist doxed her this year.) Just like Google can build a highly accurate spam filter to keep you from wasting time on the pleas of Nigerian princes, deep learning can classify text by many measures, including its degree of factuality, falsehood or truthiness. Just like Google can build a highly accurate spam filter to keep you from wasting time on the pleas of Nigerian princes, deep learning can classify text by many measures, including its degree of factuality, falsehood or truthiness. Algorithms can do that because we know how to “vectorize” text. That is, we can turn any text into a column of numbers, and those are called neural embeddings. It’s a simple, yet unlikely, translation to represent language in numbers. Doing that makes natural language computer-readable. Then we can perform powerful mathematical operations on text to detect patterns and similarities, make predictions and apply categories to it. Those categories might be: “probably false” or “probably true.” And once we know the likelihood of a text’s factualness, we can decide how far it should spread. We have fact-checkers at organizations like Snopes , Politifact or Media Matters applying judgments to news stories already. Those could be turned into labeled datasets to train algorithms to categorize text they’ve never seen before. If that’s not neutral enough, Facebook could build its own team of fact-checkers. The real question is, do the tech companies want to control it? Mark Zuckerberg is still thinking about that one. Facebook and Twitter flattered themselves that they played a role in the Arab Spring , but Zuckerberg said this weekend that it’s a “ pretty crazy idea ” that fake news on Facebook affected this tight election. You can’t have it both ways. A smug, amoral response from the people at the top of powerful tech companies isn’t what we need. They have a responsibility to the public, to the species and to themselves to promote the facts and to mute the hate and lies, even if that responsibility is not enshrined in law. Not least because Mark Zuckerberg is Jewish, and Donald Trump rode a wave of anti-Semitism and white nationalism to power. It doesn’t matter how you identify when they start handing out the yellow stars. While media endorsements meant diddly squat this election cycle, the way that media and social media promoted false stories week after week to increase their eyeballs and mindshare had a huge effect. This presidential election tipped on a couple percentage points in a few key states. Or to be precise, 107,330 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania handed America to Trump. That’s the equivalent of the population in Boulder, Colorado; West Palm Beach, Florida; or Daly City, California. Do you think Comey’s untimely announcements , the months of Russian hacking , or Wisconsin’s vote-suppressing ID laws might have accounted for a town’s worth of ballots? If so, why wouldn’t the algorithms of a powerful social media platform used by tens of millions of US voters? Broadcast media spent much more airtime covering the non-scandal of Hillary’s emails as it did covering the issues, or her policies, and social media amplified instead of remedied that distortion. Some great journalists wrote some great stories this year. They reported on Trump’s mafia connections , his virtually non-existent philanthropy , and his extensive ties to Russia . But those stories didn’t have legs. They never reached the larger audience that needed to hear them most, because we have become polarized. We go looking for opinions that agree with ours. Each of us needs some windows opened onto the disagreeable facts and inconvenient truths that will slap us in the face no matter what we wish for. The tech platforms powering social media can help reconcile us with reality in many quiet ways, or they can join the indifferent and venal attention merchants that ushered a conman , a bigot and a sexual predator into the White House for the sake of an earnings report. Until then, what we read on Twitter and Facebook will add nothing to our understanding of the world. It will just be our own breath backing up on us. And on that note, I think I need a Tic Tac.",

That was one of the reasons we knew, when he joined the band at 14, that they would be a successful band.\"\n\"We're doing this for a lad that was the kind of person you'd want in your group of friends because he was just such a great lad.\"\n– Rob McCoy - talking to the Manchester Evening News Last updated Sat 26 Nov 2016 Inspiral Carpets Craig Gill",

      "text": "Ceola Waddell (Photo: Facebook, Cynthia Mumba Farr ) More One man’s attempt to build his home — his castle — underneath the 110 freeway is helping to highlight the growing issue of homelessness in Los Angeles. Ceola Waddell, Jr., a 59-year-old man who only wound up underneath the freeway some six months ago, has been gathering massive attention to his splendorous attempts to create a respectable living environment. “I still don’t get it, what’s so fascinating about this place,” Waddell told the Los Angeles Times. “I decided I wanted to live like everybody else, make me something nice that I wanted to come home to.” As he begins a video tour of his facilities with “you have now entered my man cave,” one can quickly can see that a home he “wanted to come home to” means a place adorned with zebra-stripe slipcovers, a nonfunctional porcelain toilet (that reportedly gives him access to the sewer), a refrigerator doubling as a “jacuzzi,” and a guest room that he rents out for $25 per week, among other amenities. Waddell’s homebuilding efforts — he calls his compound Paradise Lane — apparently flew under the radar, relevant to the city’s ongoing efforts to clean up and correct the current crisis of homelessness . But word began to spread about Waddell’s exterior design skills, with people stopping by to take selfies with him, culminating in the aforementioned video tour that went viral on Facebook. Soon after that notoriety was achieved, the Los Angeles city officials began to make efforts to dismantle Waddell’s digs, with safety and sanitation issues being paramount. A sanitation spokeswoman told the Los Angeles times that “workers removed a refrigerator with an ‘abundance of rotting food,’ ‘explosive materials’ and other unhealthy items.” Homelessness has grown in huge proportions in recent years in the Los Angeles area. According to the U.S. Housing and Urban Development department, more than a third of the country’s homeless live in California . And while the nation’s overall homeless population has remained relatively flat in recent years, the homeless population in Los Angeles has grown 55% since 2013. Days after the city dismantled his handiwork, Waddell pulled together more scraps and material to start afresh. “I refuse to let the city beat me down to what they think a homeless person’s profile is, living on cardboard,” he told the Times. “This should be a landmark.”",

      "text": "Hilary Duff Just Got the Most Flattering Kind of Bangs By Facebook PHOTO: GC Images \nWhile we were all living out the American dream of consuming multiple plates of turkey and napping off our food comas, Hilary Duff took the plunge and got bangs. \nThe wispy, just-past-your-brows fringe seems to be the celeb hairstyle du jour lately: Rihanna work, work, worked 'em on her Anti World Tour this summer. Then Lucy Hale sported a temporary version for a photo shoot in September, followed soon after by fellow faux-fringe wearer Jenna Dewan Tatum . \nIt's not clear yet whether Duff's are the real deal or a well done clip-in version, but judging by the photo she posted earlier today (in which the bangs are still featured), it seems she's sticking with this particular style for at least a little while longer. As she should. The look is super flattering.

      "text": "Zuckerberg promises Facebook action over fake news \nMr Zuckerberg detailed plans to identify untrue stories and, in his words, disrupt the economics of fake news by making sure that it did not benefit from advertising. \nOf course Facebook is trying to apply a new technology solution to an age-old problem, hoping it can come up with an algorithm which will sift truth from falsehood. \nWe used to think that was a job for editors, so maybe journalists need to take a long hard look at their own profession before being too sniffy about the ethics of social media firms. Image copyright BBC/kevin foy Image caption Facebook says it is \"spending time understanding and learning more\" about China \nBut Mr Zuckerberg's change of heart seemed to show that he now realises he is an extremely powerful editor - and that with this comes weighty responsibilities as well as huge power. \nBut earlier this week up popped a story in my Facebook feed. \"Facebook worked on special software so it could potentially accommodate censorship demands in China,\" it said. \nSurely fake, I thought - would a company dedicated to truth really be developing a tool which would allow the Chinese authorities to suppress it? But then I saw the report was from the venerable New York Times and Facebook was not denying it, merely saying that it was \"spending time understanding and learning more\" about China. \nWe know that Mr Zuckerberg does have a deep interest in China - he has been learning Mandarin after all. \nAnd Facebook is not alone among Western technology firms in wrestling with the dilemma of wanting access to this lucrative market while holding on to some of their values of free expression. \nThe same can be said of a few media organisations - 20 years ago Rupert Murdoch opted not to publish a book critical of China at a time when his satellite TV empire was trying to expand there. \nI am not entirely sure that Mark Zuckerberg would like the comparison, but in many ways he is shaping up to be the Murdoch of the next 20 years. A global media tycoon, with great sway over how we understand our world. \nAnd one with commercial incentives to shape the news to suit all sorts of different views of what is truth and what is fake. \nThe World This Week is on BBC World Service Radio and available as a podcast.",

(Photo: Ron Chenoy, USA TODAY Sports) \nBOULDER, Colo. — Ninth-ranked Colorado won the Pac-12 South title with a 27-22 win over No. 20 Utah thanks to a senior-laden defense that forced two huge fumbles by Utes star running back Joe Williams. Cornerback Chidobe Awuzie also had a touchdown-saving tackle after a 93-yard kickoff return. \nThe Buffaloes (11-2, 8-1, No. 9 CFP) will face fifth-ranked Washington in the conference championship next weekend. \nThe Utes (8-4, 5-4) pulled to 27-22 on Demari Simpkins' 7-yard TD catch with 1:34 remaining that capped an 80-yard drive that included two fourth-down conversions and was done largely without Williams, who hobbled off for the second time with an apparent shoulder injury. \nThe two-point conversion toss by Troy Williams was incomplete, and the Utes' onside kick failed when Kabion Ento recovered for Colorado, which ran out the clock to complete its worst-to-first revival in one of college football's biggest comeback stories in recent years. \nThousands among the crowd of 52,301, the first sellout at Folsom Field since 2008, ignored the public address announcer's plea to wait a minute before storming the field. \nLinebacker Kenneth Olugbode scooped up Joe Williams' second fumble and returned it 10 yards for a TD that made it 27-16 early in the fourth quarter. \nIn the third quarter, Awuzie recovered when Williams fumbled at the Colorado 2 after a 12-yard gain. \nLiufau's 6-yard TD toss to Shay Fields on the final play of the third quarter was the senior's 60th, tying Cody Hawkins' school record and breaking a 13-13 tie. \nKyle Fulks returned the ensuing kickoff 93 yards but a diving Awuzie knocked Fulks out of bounds at the 3, a tackle that proved pivotal when the Utes had to settle for a field goal that made it 20-16. College football's Week 13 winners and losers The takeaway \nUtah: The Utes had another fine season but they lost three of their last four games with close defeats at home to Washington and Oregon before losing in Boulder for the first time since Sept. 28, 1957. \nColorado: The Buffaloes roll into the Pac-12 title game on the strength of their first six-game winning streak since 1996, their first 10-2 record since 2001 and their first undefeated record at home since 1994. Up next \nUtah: Despite a second straight loss, the Utes await another bowl bid, their 11th in 14 seasons under coach Kyle Whittingham. \nColorado: The Buffaloes will face Washington in the Pac-12 championship game next Friday in Santa Clara, Calif. \nBEST OF WEEK 13 A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

      "text": "A woman may have been posting to Facebook minutes before she crashed her car and died.\nCourtney Ann Sanford, 32, was driving on Business 85 in High Point, North Carolina on Thursday morning when her car crossed the median and crashed head-on into a truck, reports  Fox 13 News .  Sanford was killed in the crash; the truck driver survived.\nFriends and family of Sanford alerted investigators about a Facebook post she made around the same time as the crash.\n“The Facebook text happened at 8:33. We got the call on the wreck at 8:34,” said High Point police department Lt. Chris Weisner.\nThe Facebook post read: “The Happy Song makes me so HAPPY.”\n“In a matter of seconds, a life was over just so she could notify some friends that she was happy,” says Weisner.\n\nInvestigators also found by tracing Sanford’s online activity that morning that she had been taking selfies while driving and posting them, reports  WGHP Fox 8 .\n“As sad as it is, it is a grim reminder for everyone… you just have to pay attention while you are in the car,” reminds Weisner.\n",

The two are standing with their heads bowed outside the open door of a car.\nThe woman, Kim Muyaka, posted the photo to Facebook with the following caption, according to WWBT:\nWhen God say move! God is not the Author of confusion ..All I felt when I touch and agreed with him is fear he was shaking but y'all...Violence is not the answer...Bible say pray w/o Ceasing I pray that God will cover this Police Officer .::and use his hands not to hurt or harm but to protect the citizens! The post has gone viral with over 17,000 shares and 460 likes.\nIn the wake of the shooting, people across the country have reportedly delivered flowers, coffee, pizza and cakes to their local police departments. They have also called and sent social media messages to police officers to express their support and thanks.\nMany others stopped to chat with officers on the street and offered hugs.\n\"It's just been amazing,\" Dustin Dwight, a spokesman for Louisiana State Police Troop L, told The Times-Picayune on July 8, the AP reported. \"Our guys can't go out this morning without getting stopped by people wanting to thank them.\"\n",

Himani mentioned that when she refused to back her with her complaint against the driver, the woman abused her as well.\nEven though the driver apologised to Himani and requested her to take another ride due to the situation, Himani went to the police station to make sure that the driver wasn’t wronged, since the woman even made false accusations.",

      "text": "YouTube Like us on Facebook In 1976, millions of people saw Network and laughed bitterly at its exaggerated, satirical story of a TV news department’s quest for ratings. In 2016, you watch the movie and realize it’s not a satire anymore. Every outrageous thing it predicts has happened. Was screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky a prophet? Did director Sidney Lumet have a crystal ball? Probably not. At any rate, never mind how mad you are, sit down and take these behind-the-scenes details about one of Hollywood’s most timeless satires, which was released 40 years ago today. 1. THE MOVIE GETS LIGHTER AS IT GETS DARKER (IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING). On the DVD commentary, director Sidney Lumet points out a strategy that he and cinematographer Owen Roizman used to subtly underscore the movie’s themes. In the beginning, scenes that require anything more than natural light get only the bare minimum: dim lights in a barroom, for example. That’s to emphasize the news being independent, unconcerned about beauty, not “showy.” But as the characters become corrupted, we see more and more artificial lighting, as if the movie itself is becoming vain about its appearance. “Even the camera got corrupted as the movie went on,” Lumet said. 2. PETER FINCH GOT THE PART BY READING A NEWSPAPER. Lumet was convinced he needed an American actor to play the unhinged TV news anchor. Peter Finch, though a fine actor, was inconveniently British. To prove to Lumet that he could get the accent right, he recorded himself reading an entire issue of The New York Times . 3. THEY USED A REAL TV STATION FOR THE NEWS SEQUENCES—IN CANADA. The whole film was shot in real offices, apartments, etc., rather than on studio sets, mostly in New York. But for the scenes in the TV control room and Howard Beale’s news show, Lumet and company had to go to Toronto, as there were no TV stations closer that could rent themselves out for the two weeks Lumet needed. (There may have been opposition due to the nature of the film, too.) 4. SHOOTING ON LOCATION MEANT THEY HAD TO FAKE SOME RAIN. The network offices in the film were real upper-floor offices in a Manhattan skyscraper. The un-fakeable view of a real city outside the windows gave the movie authenticity ... but it also meant the weather in the movie was dictated by the weather in real life. That’s why there’s a scene where we see Howard Beale walking in the rain and entering the UBS building soaking wet: it had been raining days earlier when they filmed an office scene that took place right before this one, so they had to use rain machines to make it match. 5. IT RESULTED IN THE FIRST POSTHUMOUS OSCAR FOR A PERFORMER. Peter Finch’s trophy for Best Actor was awarded 10 weeks after his death, and accepted by his widow, Eletha Finch. Several other posthumous Oscars had been won before, but Finch’s was the first in an acting category. (It remained the only one until Heath Ledger’s Best Supporting Actor win for The Dark Knight .) 6. IT ALSO GAVE US THE SHORTEST OSCAR-WINNING PERFORMANCE. Beatrice Straight, who plays William Holden’s wife, won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress despite appearing onscreen for barely five minutes, almost all of which is in one (very good) scene. Shorter performances have been nominated, but she holds the record among winners. 7. THE WRITER’S IDEAL CAST INCLUDED WALTER MATTHAU, CANDICE BERGEN, AND CARY GRANT. Paddy Chayefsky’s notes indicated his dream choices, with a few candidates for each major role. As Schumacher, eventually played by William Holden, Chayefsky envisioned Walter Matthau or Gene Hackman. In the Faye Dunaway role, he liked Candice Bergen, Ellen Burstyn, or Natalie Wood. And as the ranting TV newsman Howard Beale (played by Peter Finch), he wanted Cary Grant, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, or Paul Newman (to whom he wrote a letter telling him he was one of “a very small handful of actors” he thought were right for the part). 8. THERE WERE PROMOTIONAL BUMPER STICKERS. An R-rated adult satire of TV news doesn’t sound like the sort of movie that would have promotional bumper stickers, but Network did. They read “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore,” and MGM distributed 80,000 of them. 9. WALTER CRONKITE’S DAUGHTER IS IN IT. Kathy Cronkite, whose father is mentioned by name in the film and could be considered one of its satirical targets, plays Mary Ann Gifford, the Patty Hearst-like revolutionary figure that Faye Dunaway wants to make a reality show about. Ms. Cronkite had done some acting, with small roles in a couple of films, but the added irony of casting her in Network undoubtedly helped Lumet make the decision. 10. THE DIRECTOR TOLD FAYE DUNAWAY TO VIOLATE A BASIC RULE OF ACTING. Lumet hadn’t worked with Dunaway before, but he knew she was a dedicated perfectionist (to use one of the politer terms people have used to describe working with her). She’d want to dive deep into the character of Diana Christensen and really understand what makes her tick. Lumet headed her off at the pass. When they met to discuss it, he said, “I know the first thing you’re going to ask me. ‘Where’s her vulnerability?’ Don’t ask it. She has none. If you try to sneak it in, I’ll get rid of it in the editing room.” Dunaway understood what Lumet wanted: as a satirical figure, it was OK if Diana wasn’t quite realistically human. 11. DUNAWAY AND HOLDEN HAD WORKED TOGETHER BEFORE—AND DIDN’T LIKE THE EXPERIENCE. Network ’s romantic subplot, with the middle-aged and married Schumacher falling in love with the much younger Diana, would be tricky to pull off anyway. Making it riskier was the fact that Holden loathed Dunaway for her behavior on the set of The Towering Inferno , in which they had both appeared. How was it going to work now that they had to play lovers? As it turned out, everyone behaved professionally. Holden got along well enough with Dunaway, and she said of Holden, “I found him a very sane, lovely man.” Additional Sources : Mad as Hell: The Making of Network and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies , Dave Itzkoff",

      "text": "Israel fire spreads to social media, ignites hate in hashtag war Israel Police released on Sunday a Bedouin activist who was arrested on suspicion of inciting to arson because of a satirical Facebook post he wrote. Anas Abudaabes, 29, an activist from the southern Bedouin town of Rahat, was arrested Thursday after he posted two Facebook posts that were critical of Arabs who see the fires plaguing Israel as punishment for a bill that seeks to silence mosque loudspeakers . Abudaabes says the police mistranslated one of his posts, reaching the mistaken conclusion that he encouraged on Arabs to set fires. The police's decision to release Abudaabes came only a few hours after they had asked the Be'er Sheva District Court to deny his appeal of a lower court decision. In a hearing on Saturday, the court ruled Abudaabes could be held in detention until Monday. After the court ruling on Sunday, the police obtained further material about Abudaabes' Facebook posts, including responses that showed others understood his posts to be satirical, which lead to his being freed on bail. Under the terms of his release, Abudaabes, who was freed on bail, will remain under house arrest for five days and will not be allowed to use Facebook for 15 days. \"The police should stop using Google Translate,\" Knesset member Osama Saadia (Joint List), who accompanied Abudaabes in court in Be'er Sheva, said, adding that they made a mountain out of a molehill. A police spokesman said they have completed the investigation concerning Abudaabes and have passed the file on to the prosecution. The police said they will continue to act against violence, including incitement to violence on social media networks. ",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nBIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nAccording to Yahoo! News, Chinese media gave favorable tidings concerning President-elect Donald Trump Tuesday following a phone call between Trump and the President of China, Xi Jinping.\nChinese media reportedly hailed Trump’s rise to power as the beginning of a possible “reshaping” of Sino-American relations.\nThe president and president-elect spoke Monday, and the conversation was described as “diplomatically impeccable and has bolstered optimism over bilateral relations in the next four years,” according to the Chinese newspaper Global Times.\n“Trump is probably the very American leader who will make strides in reshaping major-power relations in a pragmatic manner,” the paper continued.\nThis comes as a stark contrast to what the mainstream media would have us believe. It does not appear that we have any kind of trade war on the horizon.\nOne of the major contentions about Trump that many voters had voiced during his campaign was his rhetoric concerning China; he has gone so far in the past as to call the economic giant America’s enemy.\nThe New York Times published a transcript of a Trump foreign policy speech given in April 2016 in which Trump asserted that “(w)e have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don’t understand it.”\nThat’s bold talk for anyone who is now having civil conversations with China’s head of state, but perhaps the Chinese appreciate strength and straightforwardness. Regardless of past rhetoric, it at least appears that China is willing to deal with the president-elect.\nPlease share this on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about China’s reaction to our incoming president!\nWhat do you think of China’s reaction to Trump?

By: FE Online | Published: November 28, 2016 11:26 AM When Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugged CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook headquarters in California. (PTI) \nSocial media major, Facebook says that it is trying to bring affordable internet connections in India, especially for the rural regions. According to a PTI report, after the company received a lot of criticism regarding violation of net neutrality in Free Basics, it will now bring a new method to deploy Wi-Fi in order to provide the internet in remote areas of the country. According to their Internet.org page, Facebook Express Wi-Fi is live in India and ‘working with carriers, internet service providers, and local entrepreneurs to help expand connectivity to underserved locations around the world.’ It also said that other parts of the world will get it too. \nThe interesting thing to note is that Facebook has not said anything yet on whether the Wi-Fi will have curbed access, just like its Free Basics program or will there be no bias among websites. Express Wi-Fi comes with the aim that it wants to support local entrepreneurs, by proving good internet connections to them so that they use it to connect. It said, “Express Wifi empowers local entrepreneurs to help provide quality internet access to their neighbours and make a steady income. Working with local internet service providers or mobile operators, they’re able to use software provided by Facebook to connect their communities.” \nAlso read | Facebook might apologise and pay you $15; find out why \nA Facebook spokesperson told PTI, “We focus on building a sustainable economic model for all stakeholders involved so that local retailer entrepreneurs, ISPs, operators and Facebook can continue to invest in and operate lasting connectivity. We believe a sustainable economic model is the one which can scale to bring all of India online.” There is no information yet, about the places and partners in the project. \nAlso read | Is Facebook responsible for Donald Trump becoming the President? Here’s how it influenced the US election results \nFacebook, which had removed the Free Basics programme in India, early this year, have been running it in many other countries. Facebook took the decision after receiving severe criticism that the Free Basics service was against the principles of net neutrality. Recently, the social media giant has been under fire where people have accused it of promoting fake news and eventually influencing the US Presidential elections.

      "text": "When Prime Minister Narendra Modi hugged CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook headquarters in California. (PTI) Social media major, Facebook says that it is trying to bring affordable internet connections in India, especially for the rural regions. According to a PTI report, after the company received a lot of criticism regarding violation of net neutrality in Free Basics, it will now bring a new method to deploy Wi-Fi in order to provide the internet in remote areas of the country. According to their Internet.org page, Facebook Express Wi-Fi is live in India and ‘working with carriers, internet service providers, and local entrepreneurs to help expand connectivity to underserved locations around the world.’ It also said that other parts of the world will get it too.\nThe interesting thing to note is that Facebook has not said anything yet on whether the Wi-Fi will have curbed access, just like its Free Basics program or will there be no bias among websites. Express Wi-Fi comes with the aim that it wants to support local entrepreneurs, by proving good internet connections to them so that they use it to connect. It said, “Express Wifi empowers local entrepreneurs to help provide quality internet access to their neighbours and make a steady income. Working with local internet service providers or mobile operators, they’re able to use software provided by Facebook to connect their communities.”\nAlso read | Facebook might apologise and pay you $15; find out why\nA Facebook spokesperson told PTI, “We focus on building a sustainable economic model for all stakeholders involved so that local retailer entrepreneurs, ISPs, operators and Facebook can continue to invest in and operate lasting connectivity. We believe a sustainable economic model is the one which can scale to bring all of India online.” There is no information yet, about the places and partners in the project.\nAlso read | Is Facebook responsible for Donald Trump becoming the President? Here’s how it influenced the US election results\nFacebook, which had removed the Free Basics programme in India, early this year, have been running it in many other countries. Facebook took the decision after receiving severe criticism that the Free Basics service was against the principles of net neutrality. Recently, the social media giant has been under fire where people have accused it of promoting fake news and eventually influencing the US Presidential elections.",

      "text": "Google goals let you apply these powerful analytics to your Facebook ad spend to track the return on investment for your ads. Set Up Your Google Goal \nTo get started setting up a Google goal, head over to your Google Analytics account and sign into the website you want to track ads for . Then click the Admin tab at the top of the page. In your Google Analytics, click the Admin tab to start setting up a Google goal to calculate the ROI of your Facebook ad. \nOnce you click Admin, you’ll see three headings on the page: Account, Property, and View. Under View, click the Goals option . On the Admin tab in Google Analytics, look for the View section and then click the Goals option below that. \nNext, click on the red New Goal button , shown here: In Google Analytics, click the red New Goal button to start setting up a goal to track the ROI for your Facebook ad. \nThe following image shows the first group of options you’ll see after you click on New Goal. You’ll choose from these options to customize your goal . Scroll all the way down to the bottom and click the Custom radio button . Then click Continue . Scroll to the bottom of the Goal Setup options in Google Analytics and click the Custom radio button. When you’re finished, click the Continue button. \nNext, you’ll need to tell Google Analytics what you want to track . For example, suppose you’re running a Facebook ad for a blog post you’ve written. You’d click the Destination radio button because you want Google to track conversions from your Facebook ad all the way to a conversion or thank-you page. After you choose a goal type and enter a name for your goal , click the Continue button . When you set up a goal for your Facebook ad in Google Analytics, typically you’ll ask Google to track conversions through to a thank-you page. \nNow you’re ready for the next step for setting up your goal. In the example, you’ve asked Google to track a destination page. Your full URL is https://domain.com/free-resource-thank-you-page/. Because you’ve already set up Google Analytics tracking on that page, Google doesn’t need the entire address. In the Destination Equals To field, just type in the last part of the URL of the page after the “.com” (/free-resource-thank-you-page/), as shown below. In the Destination field for your goal in Google Analytics, type in the URL for your destination. Include the part of the URL that is after “.com.” \nUnder the Destination field for this step, you’ll notice a few additional options you can use to further customize your goal . Here’s a quick rundown of what you can do with them. \nCreate a Value for Your Goal \nGoogle Analytics lets you set a monetary value for everyone who completes your goal . If the lifetime value of a customer is $127, for example, and your cost per lead on your Facebook ad was $5 per lead, you just made $122 directly from your Facebook ad! \nCreate a Path or Funnel From Your Facebook Ad \nFor the example goal, suppose you set the Funnel option to On and you want to track the path people clicking on your Facebook ad would take from the ad all the way to your thank-you page. Here’s what the path might look like: People click on your Facebook ad. They land on your blog article . They like the article so much that they click on a link to join your free resource vault. After opting in, they land on your thank-you page, which triggers your destination goal. After you type in the destination for your goal in Google Analytics, you also have the option to assign a monetary value to the conversion and set up a path or funnel from your Facebook ad. \nNow you’ll know your Facebook ad worked and sent you a qualified customer from a particular path. Keep in mind that when you’re just starting out with Google goals , you may want to leave out the optional monetary and funnel parts of your goal and just focus on the destination thank-you page . There will be plenty of time later to explore these options once you have a few goals under your belt. \nFinish making all of your selections to set up your goal, click Save , and let Google Analytics start working its magic on your goal. After your Facebook ad is up and running for a few days (ideally), you can check back on your goals to see how they’re converting for you. To do this, go back to your goals page inside of Google Analytics and see how your ad has converted over the previous week. \nConclusion \nGoogle Analytics lets you set up goals to track the ROI of your Facebook ads so you’ll know if your ad spend is paying off for you. Implementing this simple strategy can help you save money on your next Facebook ad campaign. \nWhat do you think? Will you consider setting up goals in Google Analytics to track the ROI of your Facebook ads? Please share your thoughts in the comments below.

      "text": "Modal Trigger A Facebook post from Space World advertising the attraction. Photo: Facebook \nTOKYO — An amusement park in western Japan sparked an uproar after it displayed about 5,000 dead fish in the ice at a skating rink, forcing the park to close the attraction. \nSpace World received a flood of criticism on social media after opening the rink on Nov. 12. It was closed Sunday. \nAbout 25 different kinds of fish could be seen under the 820-foot -long ice circuit. The park in the city of Kitakyushu opened the “Ice Aquarium” as an “attraction never heard about.” \nJapanese broadcaster NHK showed the fish frozen in ice on a blue floor, so it looked like they were swimming below the ice. Some formed a school to spell out “HELLO” or make an arrow-shaped sign in the ice. \nThe general manager of Space World, Toshimi Takeda, said many critical messages were posted on social media, some condemning the concept as abusing living things. \nTakeda said that the fish in the ice had been intended “to give the feel of the ocean to the ice skating rink,” and that the amusement park is “extremely remorseful to have invoked such unpleasant feelings.” \nSpace World said the fish were purchased from a fish market, and were dead before the water was frozen. The operator plans to hold a memorial service for the fish once they’re taken out of the ice. Share this: ",

      "text": "Muyo via Wikimedia Commons // CC BY-SA 4.0 Like us on Facebook \nOn November 8, a huge sinkhole swallowed part of an intersection in Fukuoka, Japan, creating a hole in the street almost 100 feet wide and 50 feet deep. While the hole was repaired and the street reopened about a week later, it has begun sinking yet again, according to Mashable . \nThe city’s mayor, Soichiro Takashima, initially said that after the two-day filling period, the new road was 30 times stronger than it had been before the sinkhole appeared. The hole was probably caused by underground construction work on a subway line extension. \nAt 1:45 a.m. on Saturday, November 26, police closed the rebuilt section of road near the city’s Hakata railway station because it began sinking again, sagging by about 2.8 inches. No one was injured, nor were there any gas leaks or power outages reported, and the road was reopened to traffic by 5:30 a.m. \nAccording to The Japan Times , the joint venture responsible for the subway construction warned that sagging could occur again, and promised to close the road if it sank by more than an inch. On his Facebook page , the mayor pledged that officials would keep monitoring the height of the street for further sinkage; in another Facebook post , he also apologized for not warning citizens of the possibility of the road dropping again.",

Trump won Texas by around 9 percentage points and captured 290 overall electoral votes to Hillary Clinton’s 232. \nState electors meet in Austin and in state capitals nationwide next month to vote for president, and will also vote then on Sisneros’ replacement. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Facebook \nGovernor Ayo Fayose of Ekiti State recently flagged of the construction of a Federal Government road that runs through his state and attracted hilarious comments for throwing shades at the FG. \nGovernor Ayo Fayose flagged off the construction of the Efon-Aramoko-Igede-Ado Road, and decided to subtly shade the Federal Government, whose responsibility it was to take care of the road. \nHe had a sign board set up which read: \n“This is a neglected federal road, but in the overall interest of the Ekiti people, I will fix it. However, somebody must tell the Federal Government to be responsible.” Fayose shades the federal government with this sign post \nSince the picture of the sign went viral, people have taken to social media to say how they feel about it. See some comments below: \nShafi’u Bala: “ Who neglected the road? for how long has the road been neglected? why didn’t you place this symbol during corrupt president? your state is d next target, APC fire on, after that magu will invite you to tell the world how you got your gubernatorial campaign funds.” \nChristopher John: “The time wey plenty money dey una just dey busy dey loot left, right and center instead of developing infrastructure, na now wey money no dey u get mouth to talk. Nonsense” \nPAY ATTENTION: Get all the latest gossips on NAIJ Gossip App \nOkwudili Ezenwegbu: “Fayose the more you do all theses things the more well meaning Nigerians will hate you. It’s only fools and gullible ones that can’t see the childishness in you.” \nJimoh Abdullateef: “ I wonder how ekiti state people voted this fool as their governor. Why don’t he put this during Jonathan administration? And is he The first governor to repair FG roads? And he forgot to indicate that FG will later settle the state government” \nAmbima Likita:” Stupid political gimmicks. No state in Nigeria is not having one or two neglected federal roads. Some states have fixed it quietly and you are there trying to score a political point with it. Tell that to those in Ekiti” \nUthman Idris: ” Rubbish…. You have no respect for FG at all……if I where d president I will block ur allocation n see weda u will have mouth to talk, I pity Ekiti people” \nBernard Dave: “ Na today d road spoil? Dis guy is a clown..” \nWhat do you think?",

      "text": "Facebook \n– A major confession is coming from some of the suspected fraudsters arrested by officials of the Rapid Response Squad \n– They were arrested in different parts of the state with Superintendent Dolapo Badmos expressing optimism that Lagos would be free of crime \nOfficers of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos state Police Command have arrested four suspects for allegedly defrauding residents of the state. \nFour suspects were arrested by the RRS operatives in three separate incidents of fraud in Maryland, Ojodu Berger and Ajegunle, according to the RRS. Two of the suspects \nKenneth Umukoro, 36; Uba Utokcha, 41; Joseph Onuoha, 40 and Ikechukwu Okeke, 25, reportedly confessed to taking part in the crime when interrogated at the RRS headquarters. \nThe four suspects are currently at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Panti. \nA victim, whose name was given Ibeh Chiwenu said she was going to Ojodu-Berger from Ojota when Kenneth Umukoro, driving a metallic colour Toyota Camry, 1997 model with the registration number SMK 886 DK, stopped at the bus stop to pick her. \nREAD ALSO: BEWARE! Top 11 crime areas in Lagos \nChiwendu said: “As he drove along, he picked another passenger on Kudirat Abiola Way. We were still on Kudirat Abiola Way when the new passenger started a conversation on something like French language with the driver… The driver now pleaded that he wanted to take the new passenger to Customs’ Office on Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, where his goods were seized. \n“It was here that their story changed and I became the subject of their manipulation in connivance with a custom agent and a pastor.” \nShe explained further: “Under the pretext that the four of us assist the man whose goods were trapped with the custom over export duties, they brainwashed me into releasing my ATM card, led me to withdraw the last N9,000 from my account…. After this, the pastor prayed for me and told me to go home and get more money that my family kept at home. \nREAD ALSO: Yoruba, Egun youths clash in Lagos \n“All these happened last week. Today, Thursday, my husband and I were standing at the Maryland Bus Stop. I saw the same Toyota Camry with same number plate and a new driver, but beside him was the former driver that lured me into fraud, pretending to be a passenger. I alerted RRS officers stationed in Maryland and they arrested them.” \nTwo of the suspects, Joseph Onuoha and Ikechukwu Okeke, were reportedly arrested in separate circumstances. \nOnuaha reportedly confessed that he belonged to a fraud syndicate led by one man simply identified as Toronto, adding that their leader, who is now at large, trained over 40 of them to go out daily in search of those to defraud. One of the suspects \n“When we hit jackpot, we share it into five parts. Toronto takes two parts. Two of us in a team share two and we would share the remaining part to others. \n“Presently, our office in Ajegunle has been busted by the police. Toronto as I was told has relocated to somewhere in Surulere. Whenever we have issues with the police, he comes around to secure our bail,” Onuoha said.",

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter LANSING, Mich. (AP) – President-elect Donald Trump has won Michigan’s 16 electoral votes. The Board of State Canvassers certified Trump’s 10,704-vote victory on Monday, nearly three weeks after the election. The two-tenths of a percentage point margin out of nearly 4.8 million votes is the closest presidential race in Michigan in more than 75 years. Trump’s win in Michigan gives the Republican 306 electoral votes to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 232. Trump is the first Republican presidential nominee to win Michigan since 1988. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is expected to ask for a recount. She has until Wednesday. Trump would have seven days to file objections to her request. (© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "SEND EMAIL Students in Independence Hall, a lecture hall at Ohio State, after being told not to leave the classroom during the active shooter situation on OSU’s campus this morning. (Kaylin Kavanaugh) \nFacebook activated its Safety Check feature Monday morning after an attacker on the Ohio State University campus left at least seven injured. \nThis year alone Facebook has activated Safety Check dozens of times, according to the company . And since June 2016, when Facebook expanded the ability for communities to activate a Safety Check, they say it has been triggered “hundreds of times.” \nThis appears to be the first time Facebook has activated a safety check in response to an attack on a U.S. college campus. USA TODAY College has reached out to Facebook to confirm whether that is the case. \nThe safety check, entitled “The Violent Incident in Columbus, Ohio,” allows those in the area to mark themselves “safe,”“unsafe” or “outside the affected area” with the click of a button. Users can also invite friends to mark their safety status. \nAround 10 a.m. Nov. 28, the OSU emergency message system released an alert notifying students of an active shooter situation and urging them to shelter in place. That order stayed active until about 11:30 a.m. when university police lifted it, saying that the “scene was secure.” Classes were canceled on the Columbus campus for the rest of the day. \nLocal media outlets, including the USA TODAY Network newspaper the Cincinnati Enquirer , reported that a suspect had died. Other reports said the suspect had wielded a machete and a gun . \nThe Safety Check feature was introduced in October 2014, and its first major deployment came in April 2015 after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Nepal. The feature was used again just over a year ago during the November 2015 Paris, France terrorist attacks — the first one in response to a non-natural disaster — and in March 2016, during reports of a terrorist bombing at an airport and train station in Brussels, Belgium. \nThe check-in was deployed for the first time in the United States in June 2016 during the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and again in October 2016 for Hurricane Matthew. A community-activated alert went out after violent protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, in September 2016. \nIn an Oct. 27 update from Facebook, the company announced it was testing a way for communities to deploy the Safety Check more widely. \n“When an incident occurs and enough people in the area start talking about it on Facebook, they receive a message asking them if they are okay. They can then mark themselves safe and invite friends to use Safety Check as well. If lots of people start marking themselves safe, Facebook may turn on Safety Check more widely,” the announcement stated. \nDillon Mitchell, a senior studying film at Ohio State University, marked himself safe through the feature, after many family members reached out to him about the reports of an attack on his campus. He says he received a Facebook notification that one of his friends had checked in, and Facebook prompted him to check in as well. He says it “seemed like a no brainer to bring loved ones a small sense of relief.” \n“I was in my apartment because I had yet to leave for classes thankfully,” Mitchell told USA TODAY College via Facebook. “Family members kept calling me, and friends on other campuses were checking in, so I thought the Facebook system would be the easiest way to reach everyone who might be worried about me. Likewise, I wanted to let my friends across campus know I was safe as well as feed into the precedent of letting people know you’re safe as soon as possible.” Sophia Tulp is an Ithaca College student and a USA TODAY College digital producer.",

      "text": "Rebus token © The Foundling Museum Like us on Facebook \nThe basket hanging on the gate at London's Foundling Hospital served a sad purpose: Mothers could place their babies inside the basket and slip away into the night. But most of the children brought to the hospital—a children's home where England's poorest kids were brought for a chance at care their parents could not provide—weren't completely anonymous. Though they were given a new name when they were brought inside, most were left with a tiny token of some kind—a piece of property parents could use to identify themselves if they were ever able to take their children back. \nThis token is one of the more unique specimens of the thousands of such artifacts left at the Foundling Hospital over the years. These days, the hospital has been turned into a museum , and its token collection showcases the inventiveness and anguish of the destitute children's desperate parents. \nThe Foundling Hospital opened its doors in 1741 . It wasn't a \"hospital\" in the traditional sense: Rather, the word hospital indicated the hospitality and charity poor children would find inside. The tokens left with children date from the early days of the hospital, when parents could leave their kids there no questions asked. \nKids who entered the Foundling Hospital didn't stay inside the building. Rather, they were baptized, given new names, and sent to wet nurses or \"nurse mothers\" who took care of the children in the country. When they turned 5 , they returned to the hospital, where they received an education. Wet nurses could return to visit their surrogate children, but birth mothers could not. \nWorkers at the hospital carefully recorded the clothing and identifying markers left with every child who entered. At first, many children were left with a small scrap of fabric (the parent would take the other half and the halves could be joined together again if they reunited). But over time, that practice was discontinued, and many parents left tokens with their children instead. They would attach notes and all kinds of markers, from pennies that were engraved with names and dates to more complicated puzzles like these. \nThe heartbreaking rebus on this token shows a child in a Moses basket—a universal symbol for a child who was given up. The rebus spells out \"I want relief\" and has the child's date of birth. It's a creative gesture that shows as much about the parents' inventiveness as the plight of their child. \n\"It is quite remarkable that the parent(s) of the child admitted with this coin went to the trouble of having it engraved with this despairing message,\" Emma Yandle of The Foundling Museum told mental_floss via email. Today, the coin is on display at the Foundling Museum. The hospital collected over 18,000 such tokens in the first 50 years of its existence. \nThe Foundling Hospital eventually became a charity that operates to this day—an example of some of the earliest attempts to help children in an age without foster care or social services. But though the tokens left in the hospital are seen as fascinating artifacts of a bygone era today, they also have a more anguished meaning. Tragically, the fact that the token still exists means that the child was never reunited with its birth parents.  ",

It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\n“I have a very dear sister in the Lord who sent me a picture of some writing that appeared in the sky over her home some months ago. It looked like some type of Hebrew letters. When trying to match it up with Hebrew, all we could come up with was judgment and war, but we left it alone to wait upon the Lord for further instruction.\n“Recently, she sent the picture to me again and immediately I picked up on it in my spirit. Here is what the Lord transcribed as the meaning in the sky.” — Bette Stevens\nGod is warning people all over the world that we have reached a point of no return and that it is time to repent and prepare. The question many people have is, “When?” No one knows. However, the Bible does tell us that we will know the season. Many people are hearing “VERY SOON!” in their spirit and we do know that we are in that season.\nIn the article, Bette went on to say:\nI went into a vision and as I did, I saw a hand appear and just as clearly write the words, which I am going to bring forth now. In part, it is a warning to a very influential world leader whose name I am not allowed to release yet. Here are the words interpreted into English:\n“We will meet at the battle of Armageddon.\nWe will meet at the battle of Armageddon.\nWe will meet at the battle of Armageddon.”\nThis was written three times distinctively.\nStevens goes on to warn that God specifically said:\n“Tell My people the wrath of the Lamb has come. Then I heard the voice of the Lord say, the nation of America, the church of America has polluted My name, My gospel, with debauchery, compromise, mammon, power, greed, and corruption. Have I not brought you where you are? I am the one and only true God. No one comes before Me nor after Me. My Father has given Me all power and authority over all people ,tribes, tongues, and nations.”\nHe then said, “Come and see.”\nStevens says she was awakened immediately and then taken in a vision to see the armies of both God and Satan preparing for battle.\nShe explained, “This was given to me briefly to see. Then I heard, “Bow Satan! I saw Satan hesitate with a lot of reluctance, a lot of reluctance. Then again I heard the words, “Bow Satan.” Then I saw Satan bow down and that was the end of the vision.\nShe says she was reminded once again about our spiritual birthright and our inheritance. “Do not throw it away. Do not carelessly hand it over to Satan. The Lord reminds us, we enter the kingdom as a little child, wearing garments without spots or wrinkles.”\nStevens added, “ Then He said to me three times, This is non-negotiable. This is non-negotiable. This is non-negotiable. ”\nI agree with Bette Stevens when she states that, “the hour is late and the time is now. Bible prophecy is rapidly moving forward. God is warning like never before, loud and clear. The call is going forward, don’t be found wanting. Don’t be found without your garments. Don’t let loose of your inherited birthright or your crown.”\nCHECK OUT LYN LEAHZ ON YOUTUBE AND SUBSCRIBE TODAY—CLICK HERE NOW!\nFEATURE VIDEO Above Top Secret Nuclear Expert & Former USAF Captain Reveals Shocking Information!\nWAR!

      "title": "This pre-K teacher’s aide got busted for writing an insanely racist Facebook post",
      "text": "By Rafi Schwartz \nAn employee working for the Rochester, NY, public school district has been fired after having written a mind bogglingly offensive Facebook post featuring racial epithets, vulgarity, and bigoted stereotypes. \nThe woman, identified by the Democrat and Chronicle as Cassandra Sutton, had been contracted through the TES Staffing agency as a substitute pre-K paraprofessional at the Children’s School of Rochester. She’d begun working at the school this fall, after spending last year working at Lincoln Park School 44. While her Facebook profile appears to have been locked, or taken down, screenshots of Sutton’s offensive post have begun circulating online. \n“Caught a nigger!!” Sutton wrote in one, adding, “Ahem, I mean decent African american male armed & hiding behind the shed in my neighbors back yard.” \n“Hmmm,” she later mused. “I wonder why I don’t ever see white males committing crimes on my street.” \nAfter commenting on having caught “hood rat niggers” attempting to burgle her neighbors vehicle, Sutton ended her screed by telling readers “#IfYouroffendedSuchABagofDicks” and “#BlackPeopleAreFineNiggersArentBIGDifference.” \nProblematic spelling and grammar (especially for a teacher) aside, Sutton’s racist comments garnered a swift and unforgiving response from school officials. \n“She was immediately terminated as soon as we saw the posting,” Principal Jay Piper told the D&C . “We pride ourselves on our diversity. They were very offensive and hurtful remarks.” A representative from TES also confirmed to the paper that Sutton was no longer employed at their staffing agency. \nSutton did not return requests from the media for comment. \n“The school district informed TES that this person should not report on Monday and will not be allowed to work in any district school in the future,” the Rochester City School District said in a statement provided to WXXI News “Comments like the ones posted are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by anyone who works with District students.” \nAccording to the most recent data from the Department of Education, from the 2013–2014 school year, more than one-third of the Children’s School of Rochester’s nearly 300 students were black.

      "text": "Kate Middleton Will Be Played by Charlotte Riley in a New Film About the Royal Family By Facebook PHOTO: Yui Mok - WPA Pool/Getty Images \nIf the smashing success of Netflix’s newest historical drama [The Crown] (http://www.glamour.com/about/the-crown) has proven anything, it’s that we commoners can’t get enough of the monarchy . For those left with a bit of royal drama withdrawal after binging the series, there’s no need to fear. A new glimpse into the life of England’s most powerful family will soon be on your screens thanks to the BBC2. \nAccording to a report from the BBC , the network has commissioned writer Mike Bartlett to adapt his award-winning play King Charles III into a television movie. The plot imagines Prince Charles' turbulent accession to the throne following the death of the Queen and the chaos that ensues after he refuses to sign a controversial bill. \nSo, who will be playing the parts of the royal family's most famous members? It was announced that actor Tim Pigott-Smith, who portrayed Charles on both the West End and Broadway, will be reprising his role, while actress Charlotte Riley has been chosen to play Kate Middleton . The British actor, famous for her roles in London Has Fallen and Peaky Blinders , is excited about getting the chance to portray the Duchess of Cambridge. Facebook PHOTO: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images \n\"It's such a unique project,\" she told the BBC. \"To be both modern and rich in verse and to play someone who is real but yet totally re-imagined for this story is an exciting prospect for an actor.\" \nGiven how widely adored Middleton and her style are among Brits and Americans alike, Riley certainly has he work cut out for her. But the 34-year-old wife of Tom Hardy doesn't seem to let the challenge diminish her excitement. \"Kate Middleton is a really interesting woman, particularly within the context of this play, and it is a challenge I am really looking forward to,\" Riley said. \nWhile no official release date has been set, production is set to start filming now that all the roles have been cast. Hopefully Riley and her take on Kate Middleton won't disappoint! Keywords:",

The statement, ripe with sentiment, was seen as being far too light on a man responsible for the death of many. \n\"It is with deep sorrow that I learned today of the death of Cuba's longest serving President,\" reads the beginning of the statement. \n\"Fidel Castro was a larger than life leader who served his people for almost half a century. A legendary revolutionary and orator, Mr. Castro made significant improvements to the education and healthcare of his island nation.\" \nIn response, a Trudeau Eulogies hashtag arose on Twitter, which saw people making up glowing statements for dictators like Pol Pot and Stalin and famous villains like Darth Vader . \n\"Controversy followed Jeffrey Dahmer but he helped cast a new light on the limits of low carb diets,\" tweeted out Jonah Goldberg, an editor at the National Review. \nGoldberg's joke was retweeted over 1,200 times—it was just one of many. Failed presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both tweeted out their disapproval, with Rubio calling Trudeau's statement \"shameful and embarrassing.\" \nSince the initial statement both Trudeau and Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale have walked back the seemingly glowing description of Castro. \nNow, it is actually the norm for the Governor General to attend in the Prime Minister's place, as they don't usually go to the funerals of world leaders unless it's an exceptional circumstance as was the case of the funerals for Nelson Mandela, Margaret Thatcher and Shimon Peres. \nThat said, there certainly exists a connection between the former Cuban leader and the Trudeau family. In 1976 Pierre Trudeau was the first major world leader to visit the island nation after the US embargo and in 2000, Fidel Castro was an honorary pallbearer at Pierre Trudeau's funeral. \nCastro's funeral will take place on Sunday as the final act in nine days of mourning in the country. \nFollow Mack Lamoureux on Twitter Share",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nIf you’re familiar with boys’ tears, you’ve probably heard of Valfré . \nThe colorful phone case, shaped like a carton of milk (straw and all) was an Instagram-selfie hit, after being picked up by mega retailers like Nordstrom and Nylon.com. \nBut before that, it was just another sketch from 29-year-old Ilse Valfré, designer, artist and mastermind behind the Valfré brand . Valfré \nIn 2010, Valfré pulled the ever-popular Millennial move and quit her job as a Montessori school teacher to move back home with her parents and pursue art full time. \nWith just $200, she started her website that showcased two sketches per day, which she’d then link back to her social media accounts. Three years later, she started the Valfré brand, complete with clothing, art prints, accessories and, of course, phone cases. Valfré \nFor Valfré, working in anything besides art just “wasn’t an option,” which definitely helped her stay motivated throughout the growth of her business. \nBut if you feel stuck in your creative endeavors, she has a few tips on how to get out of a rut and put your goals back on track, no matter what stage of life you’re in. 1. If things aren’t working, go back to the drawing board. \nIf you believe you have a great idea, Valfré says the first thing you need to do is build up your social media following so people take your commitment seriously. \n“I used to send emails to everyone and no one responded. I realized I had to redo my plan,” she says. “I thought, if no one wants to work with me, I have to get better.” \nBy posting consistently on Facebook, slowly over the course of two years, 100 views turned into 1,000 views, and it continued to grow from there. \nPeople want to see what makes you worth spending time and energy on, and if you show you can naturally build a fanbase, you can demonstrate you have a clear understanding of audience demand. \nThis is what makes investors realize you’re serious about your project. 2. Use what makes you unique. \nValfré was born and raised in Tijuana, Mexico. Her father worked for the government, had a passion for imaginative conspiracy theories and actually met up regularly with a group of friends to discuss UFO findings. \nThese spacey vibes definitely show up in her art, where her collection of characters feature star-shaped freckles, bodies that morph into snakes and dreamy sayings, like “all pretty girls have dark secrets.” Valfré \nTry to figure out what traits only you have, and see if you can use them to your advantage. 3. Make a trend work for you. \nWhen something becomes trendy, it loses the spark that once made it original. \nIt’s safe to say the Kardashians have officially killed the choker trend, but when everyone jumps on a bandwagon, you need to be able to look ahead. \nWhat makes a trend like chokers work for so many successful women in fashion is their ability to put a personal spin on it. \nValfré designs variations of the choker trend, like bow chokers and zipper pleather chokers. Other female bloggers used the accessibility of the trend and applied it to other items such as bandanas. \nIf you’re frustrated by a current trend, try taking it to the next level and putting a personal spin on it. 4. Embrace the current culture. \nGrowing up, Valfré admired the honest and raw work of Frida Kahlo, but today, honesty looks a bit different. Valfré’s sketches of girls are honest in ways that relate to the social media generation. \nToday, honesty can be as simple and relatable as not wanting to go out on a Friday night. Valfré draws girls in all sorts of situations that Millennial girls can relate to — from being upset over a guy to hanging out with your friends on your phones to do some “anti-socializing.” \nFind a new way to express something so many people are already feeling and talking about. 5. Spend time outside your bubble. \nWhen you’re a powerful female, critics like to hone in on the “female” aspect of your success. Though Valfré admits she hasn’t experienced direct sexism or racism, she credits this to her Los Angeles bubble, where creative people are everywhere. Valfré \nAlthough living in a bubble can sometimes be a great stress reliever and shield you from the realities of the rest of the world, it can also be one of the easiest ways to get yourself into a rut. \nIf you’re feeling like you haven’t experienced anything new or different in a while, try to get out and experience something new. An outside perspective was seriously missing from so many Americans’ points of view this year. \nIf you’re feeling frustrated, try getting to know a new way of thinking. 6. Make your vulnerability your biggest inspiration. \nMany women are left feeling stunned and frustrated after the recent election of Donald Trump. \nBeing from Mexico, Valfré is familiar with election upsets, where they cast ballots every six years, and don’t always have the most progressive thinkers. \n“If you want other people to change, we have to start with ourselves,” she says. “It’s four years. Take that time to grow as a person, work hard to understand others and be kind. Connect all that frustration into a nice art form because life without art would just be very boring.” \nWhen you’re feeling vulnerable is the best time to try something new. “If what you go for doesn’t work out, at the very least you’re going to learn something from it,” she says. “In every dark time, you have to see the brightness in it and work to improve yourself.” This Girl Doesn't Need Drugs To Have Fun To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video 7. The only career advice you need \nValfré’s first investor liked her plan to expand into clothing, but wanted to strictly put her sketches on t-shirts. She was already designing original clothes for the girls she was drawing, and she knew she could tap into a wider market. \n“Be persistent and stubborn,” she says. “Don’t walk around like you know everything, and find someone you admire and learn from them.” \nFor all things Valfré, be sure to check our her website . \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.

Eleven people were taken to the hospital, but all are expected to recover. The rampage was ended shortly after it began when Artan was shot and killed by a police officer. \nNow, we know the identity of this hero officer: his name is Alan Horujko, and he likely saved dozens of lives today.",

      "text": "Baby Dies of Vicks VapoRub Poisoning? Scold Medicine A viral Facebook post claimed that a baby died in his sleep after his mother applied Vicks VapoRub to soothe his fever, but we found no evidence the incident occurred. \nClaim: A Mexican mother's young son was recently poisoned by topical application of Vicks VapoRub. unproven \nWHAT'S TRUE: In 1988, an infant of unknown nationality died after ingesting 5ml of camphorated oil. \nWHAT'S FALSE: We found no recorded deaths in or outside the United States attributed to topical application of Vicks VapoRub. Example: [ Collected via e-mail, November 2016 ] \nMexican woman applies Vicks Vapo Rub to infant and it results in the infants death. \"\"The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.\"\" States \"\"Vicks should not be used on children under 3\"\". \nOrigin: In November 2016, numerous blog posts claimed a baby died of camphor poisoning after his mother applied Vicks VapoRub to treat a fever: \nA Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby. \nWhen she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him. \nShe rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him. \nShe was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing. \nShe carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours. \nThe medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory tract, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment. \nThe appended image was not the baby that purportedly died from an overdose of topically applied Vicks VapoRub, but a stock photograph . We found no news articles from November 2016 (or any other time period) indicating that a child had died due to topical use of the remedy. \nA 2001 study indicated one child of unknown nationality died after ingesting 5ml of camphorated oil (not a topical solution of Vicks): \nThe clinical effects of camphorated oil are gastrointestinal irritation and central nervous system (CNS) depression. Symptoms usually begin within 5 to 10 min of ingestion, and peak within 90 min. The death of a small child occurred after the ingestion of 5 mL of camphorated oil[.] \nA study published in 2009 demonstrated the respiratory inflammation mentioned in the viral article, but not in human babies: \nTo confirm that the menthol-containing rub was responsible for the patient's respiratory stress, researchers tested the product on ferrets. Indeed, they found that exposure to VapoRub increased mucous production, thereby causing inflammation in the rodents' airways. \nAs of January 2009, no mentions were made of any deaths due to the use of Vicks VapoRub (though opinions were mixed on its safety): \nAccording to Procter & Gamble spokesperson David Bernens, the market surveillance data obtained by the makers of Vicks does not coincide with the findings of this report. Bernens said they see only about three adverse events per one million units of Vicks VapoRub sold. \n\"For generations Vicks has been shown to be safe and effective if used in accordance with the instructions on the bottle,\" Bernens said. \"Animal findings have unknown clinical relevance, and the safety of Vicks VapoRub has been shown in multiple clinical trials in over 1,000 children who were studied, ranging in age from one month old to 12 years old.\" \nOther doctors said the study may even cause VapoRub to be lumped in with other cough and cold medications that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) deemed unsafe for children under the age of 2. \nAccording to Dr. Diane Pappas, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, this study confirms that Vicks VapoRub, too, \"should not be used in children under the age of two.\" \nThe only documented cases remotely related to the claim that a baby in Mexico died due to topical application of Vicks VapoRub did not match the details of the viral posts. We found no recorded deaths specifically attributed to topical application of Vicks VapoRub.   28 November 2016 sources: \nFlaman, Zorina et. al. \"Unintentional Exposure Of Young Children To Camphor And Eucalyptus Oils.\" Paediatrics & Child Health .

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \n“Imagine a future where technology is built on our values, not our screen time.” \nThis is the overall message of the insanely inspirational and downright poetic video above, which shows us that while our apps are generally made to improve our lives, they also tether us down in order to keep us glued to our screen for as long as possible. \nCase in point? I just checked my iPhone screen three times while writing that sentence. Nope, I didn’t have any notifications: no texts, no Facebook messages, no new snaps. I just missed that sweet glow, I guess. \nWell, if it were up to the Time Well Spent movement, we’d be able to use our mobile devices in a way that would make us put our phones back into our pockets as fast as humanly possible (unless it’s a Note 7, in which case toss that sucker into Mount Doom where it belongs). \nIf you’re anything like me, most of your downtime is spent swiping through potential dates on Tinder, religiously checking your Facebook for those ego-boosting likes and devouring people’s stories on Snapchat with your ever-so hungry eyes. \nThe Time Well Spent movement wants you and me to get all that time back. Giphy \nGood questions! \nOn the topic of where he sees this non-profit movement, that’s focused on “aligning technology with our humanity,” taking us in the years to come, co-founder Tristan Harris said, \nOn a day-to-day basis, that would range to an infinite number of possibilities… systems could help us spend more time with the people we care about, help us communicate well, provide us with news that’s based in truth, educational, and applicable to our growth, lives, and values, instead of whatever would get the most clicks likes and shares… and on and on to all aspects of our lives. \nIn an interview with The Atlantic , Tristan advocated finding a better way to rate apps based on how they actually improve our lives IRL, saying, \nThere needs to be new ratings, new criteria, new design standards, new certification standards. There is a way to design based not on addiction. \nSpeaking as someone who used to play Word Scramble to the point where I was dreaming about creating different words from a Boggle-like assortment of letters, I can relate to how easy it is to get addicted to an app or game. \nIn an interview with Elite Daily over email, Tristan not only confirmed that there is a group of apps that make us devoted followers quickly, he also explained that are certain surprise time-drainers that do just the same. He added, \nSocial networks, mobile gaming, and dating apps lean heavily on systems that get us hooked, but in the attention economy, even meditation apps are competing for our time with similar tactics. \nIt’s time to find a way to start living our lives unfettered to our screens. And I for one am extremely inspired to start. Who’s with me? \n ",

America! Stop interfering with other countries, especially the Muslim Ummah,” the post reads according to NBC News . “We are not weak. We are not weak, remember that.”\nThe post was published minutes before the beginning of Artan’s rampage, which left 11 people injured. Authorities are investigating his Facebook page to see if the incident was a terrorism attack, according to CNN .\n“If you want us Muslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks, then make peace,” the post reads. “We will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims.”\nA law enforcement official told NBC News investigators they were also trying to determine whether Artan had problems in his personal life or if there was something that had pushed him over the edge.\nArtan, 20, was a Somali refugee who was in the U.S. as a legal permanent resident. Authorities have not yet determined a motive for the attack and the investigation is ongoing.\nArtan left his birth country with his family in 2007, lived in Pakistan for a time and then came to the U.S. in 2014.\nThe incident began Monday morning when the suspect drove a vehicle into several people on campus before leaving the car and slashing victims with a knife.\nAbout 11 people were hospitalized, according to CNN, with one in critical condition. Artan was killed by OSU Police Officer Alan Horujko , 28, who shot him less than one minute after the attack began.",

      "text": "View this image ›\nGetty Images\nID: 10069103 The last time Facebook tried to bring free internet access to millions of unconnected people in India, it didn’t go so well . Now, the world’s largest social network is back for round two. Its brand new program to bring internet access to rural India called Express WiFI is now live after months of testing in remote parts of the country, according to the program’s website .\n“We are working with carriers, internet service providers, and local entrepreneurs to help expand connectivity to underserved locations around the world,” says the website.\nUnlike its controversial Free Basics program where Facebook tied up with cellphone carriers and allowed people to access a limited selection of websites and services for free, Express WiFi lets users access the entire internet for a small fee — alleviating any potential net neutrality concerns. Users can buy affordable data packs in the form of digital vouchers to access internet on the Express WiFi network.\nFacebook declined to say how much internet access under the program would cost, but notes on its website that its “working with local internet providers or mobile operators” who are able to use “software provided by Facebook to connect their communities.”\n“We are currently working with ISP and operator partners to test Express WiFi with public deployments in multiple pilot sites,” a Facebook spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. “This solution empowers ISPs, operators, and local entrepreneur retailers to offer quality internet access to their village, town or region.”\nAccording to previous reports , at least one of the ISPs that Facebook may have partnered with for the Express WiFi program is India’s state-owned RailTel, which provides internet access through fiber that runs alongside the country’s dense network of railway tracks. Earlier this year, Google partnered with RailTel to bring free WiFi to over 50 railway stations in India.\nFacebook did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ questions about the program, including exactly which parts of the country is it available in and what the timeframe is for a nationwide rollout. However, Facebook does note on the program’s website that Express WiFi will be available in more countries soon.\nWith millions of people still unconnected to the internet and smartphone penetration in the low hundreds of the millions, internet companies like Facebook and Google see India as their next battleground for growth.\nGoogle’s Project Loon, which uses giant solar-powered balloons floating in space to beam down internet to places where getting online is nearly impossible, has been stuck in with Indian regulators for months. The company recently announced Google Station, a new initiative to let cafes, malls, and small businesses set up public WiFi easily. Facebook’s Free Basics program was shut down by Indian regulators in February on the grounds that it violated net neutrality.",

      "title": "Facebook reminds Filipino users: Stay safe",
      "text": "Philippine Daily Inquirer / 02:31   \nThe Philippines has 54 million Facebook users. And it’s still growing. \nWith growth comes the need to ensure that the social media mammoth remains a fun and safe place to connect with friends. This prompted Facebook to underscore its commitment to privacy, safety and security by conducting media workshops across the country, including in Manila, Davao, and Cebu. \nMia Garlick, head of security of Facebook Asia-Pacific, said it is important that users know how to protect their account and curate their own feeds. ADVERTISEMENT \nHere’s a rundown of what you can do to create a safe space online, as told by the Facebook team: Use the “Safety Center” – Facebook’s new feature called Safety Center includes step-by-step videos to help people stay in control of their own accounts. It’s currently available in 50 languages, including Tagalog. In here, you can customize how you want your profile to look like for your family, friends, and acquaintances. Facebook’s Bullying Prevention Hub is available for everyone — The hub, developed with the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, provides tools and guidance on how to prevent and address cyberbullying. Teens, parents, and even educators will find the hub useful in addressing any kinds of abuses online. Use the extensive controls – Despite the many controls offered by Facebook, not everyone knows how to use them. Don’t forget that you can choose the audience for anything you share through the use of Activity Log. For page owners, there are Page moderation tools that will enable you to filter profanity, block certain keywords, and even hide or delete comments. Facebook also offers the option of establishing a legacy contact, wherein a trusted family member or friend can manage your account when you pass away. Turn on secure browsing — By enabling this feature, Facebook will encrypt all activities where possible, making it harder for anyone else to access your Facebook information without your permission. We have community standards — Remember that you can block , unfollow , or unfriend someone who you think is posting disagreeable or disturbing content in your timeline. Garlick reminds netizens that we create our own feeds, and we have the power to create an online environment that we want to have. When all else fails, report content — The social network team works 24 hours a day and seven times a week to review reports and remove content themselves. Don’t forget to document social media abuse. One can also report a friend struggling with suicidal thoughts , and the global team will be more than willing to help. \nWe are all tired of hearing this over and over again, but it is important to underscore the need to have strong passwords . Facebook discourages netizens to use a universal password in all their social media accounts. This will prevent hackers to completely evade your privacy and safety. \nLastly, there are things not meant for everybody. This is why Facebook offers encrypted messages. These secret conversations enable users to set a timer to control the length of time each message we send remains visible within the conversation. Facebook recommends encrypting bank details, intimate photos, and other private content. \n#StaySafe, everyone!",

      "text": "YouTube and Facebook 's support for 360-degree photos and video has sparked mainstream consumer interest in broadcasting your life in this format.\nBut most 360-degree cameras on the market require a little bit of tech knowhow, whether it's pairing with your phone successfully, or figuring out how to get the media onto the internet.\nThe LyfieEye is a new, tiny plug-in camera from Santa Clara startup eCapture, that promises to lower the barrier as far as possible.\nSEE ALSO: Stunning 360-degree 'Planet Earth II' videos will cheer you up\nFor one, it plugs straight into your phone. This means no batteries to charge, and no finicky Bluetooth pairing.\nAt around $150, it's also one of the more affordable options.\nImage: victoria ho/mashable\nDuring a hands-on demo, we were impressed that the stitching between the two front and back cameras appeared reasonably seamless. Its HD picture quality isn't as sharp as some of the higher-end competitors, however, but will be sufficient for a Facebook Live.\nThe LyfieEye app shows a live view of what the camera's filming, and allows you to compress and post your creations directly to your social network of choice when you're done.\nThe app also allows you to trim your videos, but a future update may allow you to limit the scope of filming from the current 360-degrees to a narrower view, said Sherwayn Tan, eCapture's vice president. \"Sometimes you want to film everything but yourself if you're camera shy,\" he said.\nThe only disappointment? The LyfieEye is Android-only. Tan explained that Apple has more stringent requirements for third party hardware, especially for those that draw power from the device. It would be several more hoops to jump through for the camera to be compliant with iPhones, so eCapture decided to just focus on Android.\nThe first batch of LyfieEyes are boxed and ready to ship to its Kickstarter backers. The company's crowdfunded campaign raised $53,957 — twice of its $25,000 goal.\nThe camera is also available for order online , and eCapture is considering eventually putting it on retail shelves in cities in Asia and North America.\nImage: victoria ho/mashable\nThe LyfieEye represents the first commercialised product for eCapture, which also has offices in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nTan said it's interested in developing 3D depth-sensing photo technology in future. While the scene is still nascent, there could be early demand from the design industry for cameras that allow you to digitally model an object, so you can 3D print a replica instantly.",

By Katie Mettler November 29 at 4:53 AM Follow @kemettler Abdul Razak Artan was shot and killed after an attack on the Ohio State University campus in Columbus, Ohio. He is shown in this undated photograph from The Lantern. (Kevin Stankiewicz via The Lantern) \nJust minutes before an 18-year-old Somali college student used a car and butcher knife to attack people on the Ohio State University campus Monday morning, he said in a Facebook post that he’d reached a “boiling point” and was “sick and tired” of seeing Muslims around the globe “killed and tortured,” law enforcement officials told CNN and NBC . \nThe post said the U.S. should stop “interfering” in the Muslim world and referenced “lone wolf” attacks. \nThe post appeared to be on the Facebook page of the alleged attacker, Ohio State student Abdul Razak Ali Artan, and has since been disabled, reported ABC News . The Post could not independently confirm the story. \nOn Twitter, CNN’s Jake Tapper shared the full text of the post , which he said law enforcement officials confirmed was connected to Artan. \nIt began with a general denunciation of violence against Muslims “everywhere,” then referenced specifically the Rohingya Muslim community in Burma, who have been long-persecuted and are denied citizenship and basic rights. While the struggles of the Rohingya Muslims receive little publicity in the U.S., their situation has attracted more attention in recent weeks, as the Post’s Annie Gowen reported. Thousands of them have been fleeing into the forests and neighboring Bangladesh on the heels of a brutal military crackdown that followed a terrorist attack on police posts Oct. 9, allegedly carried out by Rohingya militants. \nThis week, a United Nations refugee agency official told the BBC that Burmese troops were “killing men, shooting them, slaughtering children, raping women, burning and looting houses, forcing these people to cross the river” into Bangladesh. \nThe official claimed the government’s goal was “ethnic cleansing of the Muslim minority.” \n“Seeing my fellow Muslims being tortured, raped and killed in Burma led to a boiling point,” the Facebook post on Artan’s page reads, according to CNN. “I can’t take it anymore.” [ “I can’t take it anymore” — Ohio State attacker said abuses of Burma’s Muslims led to “boiling point” ] \nThe U.S. Department of State has been critical of the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and the U.S. Ambassador to Burma visited the region in early November. \nEven so, the Facebook post from Artan’s page also seems to call on America to “stop interfering” with the Muslim world. \n“We are not weak,” it says. ” . . . remember that.” \nThe post also references “lone wolf attacks,” and says the only way to stop them is for the United States to make peace, through a pact or treaty, with “Dawla in al sham,” which translates roughly to the Islamic State. The original name for ISIS in Arabic is Al-Dawla Al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham, which translates to the Islamic State of Iraq, and Syria and the wider surrounding area. \n“By Allah, we will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims,” the post continues. “You will not celebrate or enjoy any holiday.” \nThe post’s intended audience then seems to shift to other Muslims. It calls any Muslim who disapproves of the writer’s “actions” a “sleeper cell, waiting for a signal” and calls upon the community to follow “our hero” Anwar Al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011. Videos recorded by Al-Awlaki before he died have been cited by numerous radicalized Muslims who went on to plan or carry out terrorist attacks, including the Boston Marathon bombing and the massacre at the satirical French newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, reported the New York Times. \nIt ends with a criticism of western media, asserting that if the prophet Muhammad were alive today he’d be labeled a terrorist. \nLaw enforcement officials told CNN they were investigating the Facebook post. Law enforcement official tells @ShimonPro this is text from a Facebook post believed to be by suspect in OSU attack pic.twitter.com/31S6MPjNTu \n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) November 29, 2016 \nIf it was written by Artan, the media critique at the end of the post matches a similar, less-harsh analysis he offered the student newspaper at Ohio State when it profiled him three months ago at the beginning of the school year. He said he’d just transferred from a community college, where there were rooms for Muslims like him to pray. At Ohio State, he felt overwhelmed. \nHe told the student newspaper: \n“This place is huge, and I don’t even know where to pray. I wanted to pray in the open, but I was kind of scared with everything going on in the media. I’m a Muslim, it’s not what the media portrays me to be. If people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don’t know what they’re going to think, what’s going to happen. But, I don’t blame them. It’s the media that put that picture in their heads to they’re just going to have it and it, it’s going to make them feel uncomfortable. I was kind of scared right now. But I just did it. I relied on God. I went over to the corner and just prayed.” \nVideo footage of Artan’s spring graduation from the community college, where he earned an associate of arts degree, shows a jovial student bounding across stage to receive his degree. Neighbors and the owner of the home where Artan lived with his mother and siblings described the teen as friendly, quiet and respectful. Artan had told one woman he went to the mosque daily. \nLaw enforcement officials have yet to say if the attack Monday morning, which sent 11 people to hospitals and left Artan dead, was related to terrorism, but added they weren’t ruling it out. \nThat didn’t stop some Ohio political leaders from stepping into what the Columbus Dispatch characterized as “ rhetorical land mines. ” \nAfter Artan was identified as a Muslim and Somali refugee who spent a short time in Pakistan, State Treasurer Josh Mandel, who is expected to run for the U.S. Senate in 2018, tweeted: “Looks like Radical Islamic terror came to my alma mater today. So sad what happened at OSU. We must remain vigilant against Radical Islam.” Looks like Radical Islamic terror came to my alma mater today. So sad what happened at OSU. We must remain vigilant against Radical Islam. \n— Josh Mandel (@JoshMandelOhio) November 28, 2016 \nMichael Premo, chief of staff for the Ohio Senate Democrats, quoted Mandel’s tweet and criticized his language: “Looks like knee-jerk islamophobia came to my state today. So sad what @JoshMandelOhio said. We must remain vigilant against prejudice.” Looks like knee-jerk islamophobia came to my state today. So sad what @JoshMandelOhio said. We must remain vigilant against prejudice. https://t.co/o5S3TZynPh \n— (((Michael Premo))) (@MichaelTPremo) November 28, 2016 \nSamantha Schmidt and Annie Gowen contributed to this report. \nMore from Morning Mix",

      "text": "Fined €3,000 each for racist Facebook posts Convictions believed to be first related to social media posts The Facebook post that caught the police's eye. The post by Mr Pisani is marked in red. Photo: Facebook \nTwo men were fined €3,000 each today after admitting in court to having posted Facebook posts that amounted to racial hatred. \nThe two men are believed to be the first people ever convicted for inciting racial hatred through posts on social media. \nEric Cuschieri and Christopher Pisani are expected to appeal the penalty. \nThe two men posted the comments under a Facebook post showing a man lying in a hospital bed at Mater Dei Hospital. The post was uploaded in February 2015 to a group called Daqshekk għall-immigrazzjoni llegali f'Malta ['No more illegal immigration to Malta']. \nIt read: \"This black is taking a Maltese spot at Mater Dei Hospital, paid for by you and me and personally meeting with ministers.\" \nComments beneath the post ranged from the inane - \"LOL LOL LOL\" - to anger towards politicians and outright racism. \nMr Cuschieri wrote that he would \"put acid in his [the patient's] drip\" while Mr Pisani urged people to \"burn him\". One of the offending comments posted by Mr Cuschieri is marked in red. Photo: Facebook \nOther people suggested \"cutting his wire\" or \"pulling the ***king pluck [sic] out\" and burning the man's bed sheets. \n\"The courts sent a very clear message today,\" said Integra Foundation director Maria Pisani. \"Inciting racial hatred online is a crime, and I am very happy that police took action and prosecuted.\" \nPolice have historically been reluctant to press charges related to comments posted on social media due to concerns that it could be hard to prove that the person commenting was actually the social network account holder. \nNevertheless, police arraigned a man who works as a prison warden at Corradino Correctional Facility on similar charges last February, after the man posted \"I hope its [sic] burning with them inside\" beneath a Facebook post about a refugee shelter being burnt in Sweden. \nThe man was acquitted on a technicality, because his comment was directed towards people living overseas. \nExisting racial hatred laws date back to 2002 and only apply to comments directed to people in Malta. In delivering his judgement, magistrate Aaron Bugeja had said his hands were tied and that it was up to parliament to update the law. \nThree weeks later, Justice Minister Owen Bonnici said that the government would seek to update racial hatred laws to ensure that they did not only cover comments directed to people in Malta. « Maltese pupils improve their maths and science competences, study shows Two badly scalded in abattoir accident » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=60650148801&n=51635ff5' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=60650148801&n=51635ff5' border='0' alt=''/> </a> Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=300x250,_highlighted|300x250&campaign=0&cb=98053101543&n=8206936e' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=300x250,_highlighted|300x250&campaign=0&cb=98053101543&n=8206936e' border='0' alt=''/> </a>",

      "title": "World’s Oldest Person Turns 117. Her Secret? Raw Eggs",
      "text": "Like us on Facebook \n\"My word, I’m as old as the hills.\" \nBack in May, that was 116-year-old Emma Morano’s response to learning that the Guinness World Record for World’s Oldest Living Person had been passed on to her following the death of previous record-holder, Susannah Mushatt Jones . Today, Morano—the last living person who was born in the 19th century—is celebrating yet another milestone: her 117th birthday. \nWhile other centenarians have attributed their longevity to everything from exercise to lack of exercise, Morano’s secret to a long life is pretty straightforward: two raw eggs a day. Morano, who was born in the village of Civiasco in northern Italy on November 29, 1899, has made a practice of eating raw eggs for nearly a century, ever since she was diagnosed with anemia at the age of 20. She also suggests eating a bit of minced meat regularly, and only has milk for dinner. \nOf course, genetics can't be overlooked: though Morano, the oldest of eight children, has outlived all of her siblings, several of her sisters lived to see their 100th birthdays (and her mother passed away at the age of 91). \nStill, even Carlo Bava—Morano's doctor of nearly 30 years—seems baffled. \"Emma has always eaten very few vegetables, very little fruit,\" he said . \"When I met her, she ate three eggs per day, two raw in the morning and then an omelette at noon, and chicken at dinner.\" Yet somehow, says Bava, she seems to be \"eternal.\" \nThough Morano is only about three months older than Jamaica-born Violet Brown —the world's second oldest living person, who will celebrate her 117th birthday on March 10—Morano remains \" the world's last living link to the 19th century .\"  ",

      "text": "The Louisiana Senate Race Is the Last Chance for Democrats to Score a Victory This Year By Facebook CQ-Roll Call,Inc. A Foster Campbell win, however slim, could ensure Republicans lose the 51 seats they need to control the Senate. And who knows? Kookier things have already happened. \nWait, I thought the election was over and humanity is doomed? It mostly is. (And we probably are.) But Louisiana’s voting system is a little different: Multiple candidates from any party can all run on the Election Day ballot, but if no one gets more than 50 percent of the vote, then the top two go to a runoff. It is, to use a technical term, a free-for-all. \nWhat that means is that the election isn’t really over until the last vote on December 10. \nSo who’s running? Democrat Foster Campbell, a 69-year-old cattle farmer and public commissioner, and Republican John Kennedy, the state treasurer. Whoever wins will be the deciding factor in how well Senate Democrats can block Republican steamrolling. \nBut the Republicans already have the majority in the Senate. How can this make a difference? Despite a net loss of seats, the Republicans hung on to control of the Senate with 51 seats. Democrats have a better shot at opposing Trump’s more disastrous-seeming policies and D-list appointees if they need fewer Republicans to side against a Trump White House. If the split is 51 Republicans to 49 Democrats and independents, then all they need is a few Republicans to jump ship (some, like Rand Paul and John McCain, have already said they plan to oppose Trump on matters of war and torture). \nIt also helps to get Democrats one more vote away from a tie, which would just be broken by the vice president. In this case, that’s Mike Pence, the smooth-talking theater fan who doesn’t look favorably on rights for non-straight, non-Christian, non-penis-wielding people. \nHow close is the race? Going by the polls, Kennedy has a wide, double-digit lead over the Democrat . That said, fund-raising has surged for Campbell since the election, and the Republican National Committee has been setting up offices to work for Kennedy. (Elsewhere on this site, Jay Willis eloquently makes the case that concerned liberals should put their money toward Campbell’s campaign instead of Jill Stein’s recount.) There are some hiccups, though. \nSuch as? Turnout for these runoffs is even lower than Election Day turnout, so if the Democrats can take advantage of organization and desperation, Campbell may pull it off. And the other potential wrinkle to think about is, well, Campbell has a better shot at winning than Trump did. It’s 2016, so polls don’t matter. \nWasn’t this the race where a Klansman candidate just started yelling at a debate? Yeah, nutjob former Grand Wizard and current desperate cheerleader for the alt-right David Duke was in the race for Senate, but he didn’t do very hot. (Can’t imagine why.) He got the 5 percent needed in the polls to make the debate, but that’s exactly where his numbers stayed come the election. \nThis isn’t the first time voters told him to piss off: Duke ran for governor in 1991 and lost with less than 40 percent of the vote to Edwin Edwards, a former governor who had been plagued by corruption charges. Back then corruption seemed less bad than being a white nationalist, so, you know, times change.",

      "text": "Games are officially becoming part of Messenger.\nFacebook is adding a suite of new \"Instant Games\" to its messaging app, the company announced Tuesday. The games include well-known titles like Pac-Man , Space Invaders and Words With Friends as well as games from indie developers.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook is testing its Snapchat-like 'Messenger Day' in Australia\nRolling out now in 30 countries, you can find the games under the game controller icon. Once you start a game in a chat, others in the conversation will see that you played and can try to beat your score.\nFacebook has dubbed them \"Instant Games\" because they load almost instantaneously (you don't need to download a separate app or complete any other steps before you start playing.)\nImage: facebook\nFor now, the feature includes a handful of games from a mix of developers. But the company says it plans to open up its game-specific platform to more parties in the future. Most of the games aren't competitive in and of themselves, but the hope is that automatic score sharing will help boost engagement as friends try to outdo each other.\nWhile in many ways games seem like the next logical step for the steadily growing Messenger ecosystem, mini web-based games aren't necessarily what most people want in an app that is still primarily used for text chats. Yet Facebook's head of Messenger, David Marcus, says the success of previous experiments proved games could have a place in the app.\n\"We now know that gaming can be a popular thing on Messenger based on our little experiments with soccer and basketball,\" Marcus tells Mashable. Messenger's first game, a simple but addictive basketball game , has been played more than a billion times since it launched in March, according to the company.\nBONUS: People read their first Facebook post and it gets really awkward",

      "text": "Facebook \nClassic games like \"Pac-Man,\" \"Space Invaders,\" and \"Galaga\" are coming to Facebook. \nOn Tuesday, the social network announced Instant Games, its most aggressive push into the world of gaming since \"FarmVille\" peaked in popularity on Facebook years ago. \nGame makers are now able to make lightweight, HTML5 versions of their titles that are playable within Messenger and Facebook's News Feed. Facebook has already signed on a handful of prominent game studios to participate in the closed beta, including Konami and Zynga's \"Words with Friends.\" \nOpening the floodgates to more games is partly a response to the high engagement Facebook saw with basketball and soccer games it's already tested in the Messenger app, according to the company's director of games partnerships, Leo Olebe. \n\"People have put games inside of messaging platforms before,\" he said in a recent interview with Business Insider. \"Facebook has not. And it’s really exciting for us to do it in a way that can engage people on the Messenger platform.\" \nA new gaming tab in Messenger will let people invite their friends to compete in score-based games and through leaderboards. A dedicated Instant Games tab will also exist on Facebook's website, although the company expects people to discover games mainly through recommendations from their friends in the News Feed. \nInstant Games are available in 30 countries and work in Facebook's iPhone and Android apps. The same games that are playable in Messenger are playable in the News Feed and the main Facebook app. Facebook's 'awakening' to games \nFacebook \nFacebook hasn't been thought of as a destination for gaming in a long time. Instant Games represents \"a resurgence and an awakening to the opportunity games\" for the company, according to Olebe. \nFacebook has made two recent pushes into becoming a destination for gamers that have yet to show significant results. One of those pushes came in June when Facebook challenged Amazon's Twitch by letting people live stream gameplay from Blizzard titles like \"Hearthstone\" and \"Overwatch.\" \nOlebe wouldn't say how many people have streamed games on Facebook or the total number of hours streamed, and the company hasn't partnered with other game makers beyond Blizzard. 1.7 million people broadcasted game streams every month on Twitch last year. \nFacebook is also attempting to take on Valve's Steam with its own storefront for Windows PCs called Gameroom . Olebe announced Gameroom earlier this month. He declined to share any early usage numbers but said that developers are excited about selling their games through the platform. \nFacebook \nFor now, gaming represents only 15% of the time spent on Facebook's website, Olebe said. And while Instant Games aren't able to monetize with in-app purchases yet, they could one day contribute to the $2.5 billion business that games reaped on Facebook in 2015. \nFacebook has largely missed the transition of causal gaming from desktop PCs to mobile phones in recent years, but it hopes to regain lost ground with Instant Games. \n\"The total number of people in the world who now identify themselves as gamers has grown exponentially,\" Olebe said. \"We’re totally hip to that idea and we want to make it as easy as possible to engage with the games that they love.\" Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

      "text": "Under pressure from German lawmakers, Facebook this week deleted a controversial image titled “Jews Among Us,” which showed the location of more than 70 Jewish-owned institutions and businesses.\nThe image was posted on Facebook by a Neo-Nazi group to mark the 78th anniversary of a night of anti-Semitic violence known as the Kristallnacht, and was reported earlier this month by the Jerusalem Post . The appearance of the map soon led to threats against a Berlin man whose restaurant appeared on it, according to the New York Times , which reported the man began receiving anonymous calls saying “I hate Jews.”\nThe restaurant owner, Yorai Feinberg, said he did not report the incident to Facebook fb , claiming that he thought the social network would not take action based on his previous attempts to call out anti-Semitic material.\nAfter people called attention to the map, Facebook did not immediately take action and instead concluded it fell within the company’s internal guidelines on free speech. The situation then turned into another stand-off between the company and the German government, which have clashed in the past over how to apply Germany’s strict laws against hate speech.\nSign up for Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nUltimately, Facebook removed both the map and the entire page of the Neo-Nazi group who had published it.\n\"We recognize that this is a work in progress,\" Richard Allen, Facebook's director of policy in Europe, told the Times . \"It was hate speech, and it should have been taken down.\"\nThe map incident comes at a time when Facebook is wrestling with how to address the enormous influence the company wields over the media, and how to apply the so-called “community guidelines” it uses to decide what users may publish.\nIn September, for instance, Facebook came under widespread criticism after it elected to censor an iconic Vietnam war photograph, presumably because it deemed the photo indecent. (Facebook later reversed its decision.)\nIn the case of the “Jews Among Us” map, Facebook could frame its decision as a legal one, arguing the company had no choice but to remove the map because it was illegal under German law. But in other countries, which have broader free speech laws, Facebook would likely face a dilemma over whether to use its own internal policies to delete controversial postings like the map.",

      "text": "Social Media Were you locked out of your account? Facebook apologizes Facebook tells some users, 'Your account is temporarily locked' and directs them to go through a security checkpoint, where they are asked to review recent activity Published 12:53 AM, November 30, 2016 Updated 1:04 AM, November 30, 2016 \n  Several Facebook users were locked out of their accounts recently, and speculations surfaced – among them, possible attempts to hijack or take down accounts. \nThe Facebook account of journalist Inday Varona was also blocked on Monday, November 28. \nOn November 25, Facebook user Jan Belmonte, an alumnus of the Ateneo de Manila University and a former Rappler employee, was able to collect a list of hundreds of students and alumni who were notified about suspicious activity on their accounts. \nBelmonte, whose tips on Internet security went viral and was reported on by several local news organizations last week, cited \" simple explanations \" on the incident: \nAccording to Belmonte, the accounts he listed had several things in common: they were owned by university students in Metro Manila, and at least once, they had all posted against the burial of the late president Ferdinand Marcos at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. \nThe extent of the lockout varied. After receiving a prompt that said \"Your account is temporarily locked\", the users were asked to go through a checkpoint, where Facebook asked them to review their recent activity. \nSome users were able to regain access after this step, while some were completely barred. \nThey were real people using real names, who had to create new accounts, Belmonte said. \nOn November 19, a few days before the hacking incidents, a Facebook page called \"Duterte Cyber Warriors\" announced they have a \"DCW mobile offensive tool\" that can monitor wi-fi and cellphone traffic within tens of feet to disrupt the communication of people joining the anti-Marcos rally . \nOn   however, the group asked why they were blamed for the alleged \"hacking\", saying that the lockouts could have been caused by malware, a bug, or \"incorrect posts\" that were reported en masse by other users. \nFacebook's apology",

They aren’t turn-based, though. The competition is more about comparing scores than simultaneous play.\nThe message thread shows what game you’ve played, who else in the thread has played, and you and your opponents’ scores. You can play in a message thread with more than one person.\nAfter each round, you can also swipe right for an already-taken screenshot of your score, mark it up with a sliding color finger brush, and send it to the people in the message thread.\nView this image ›\nFacebook\nID: 10069091 You don’t have to open a separate app to play. The games are webpages that open within Messenger.\nFacebook first got the idea for the feature when it debuted a single game during March Madness 2016 called “Basketball.” You can still play it by sending a basketball emoji and double tapping it.\nView this image ›\nBlake Montgomery\nID: 10068218 Andrea Vaccari, a Messenger product manager, said that at the time Basketball launched, his team wasn’t considering the idea of building more games in the app. They were more interested in engaging basketball fans.\nThen, he said, people played the game a billion times.\n“The success caught us by surprise,” he told BuzzFeed News, “Then we started to think about games as a way to keep in touch. With games, you may not have something to say, as with a photo or a message, but you can play together.”\nVaccari said he hopes the feature will make gaming less isolating: “Most consoles and other mobile games build games and sprinkle social on top. We built a game on top of social.”\nThe games are built with the mobile experience in mind, but they’re also available on the desktop version, messenger.com . They’ll open in a vertical window like they would on a phone.\nSound too familiar? Don’t worry. Your mom won’t be able to start a FarmVille game with you on Messenger. The classic Facebook desktop game, which accrued millions of users and hundreds of millions of notifications to people who may not have wanted them, won’t be part of the Messenger gaming platform.\n“We learned our lesson,” Vaccari said.\nYou can only challenge people within message threads, and Messenger only displays messages from friends — unless you accept strangers’ requests. You can also abandon or mute message threads you want to avoid. That means no mass requests like when FarmVille was at the height of its popularity.",

      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg's posts about fake news and the US election have disappeared",
      "text": "Two important posts from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on his company’s role in the US presidential election and news dissemination have disappeared from his timeline as of Tuesday morning. It’s currently unclear if this is due to an error, change in privacy settings, or whether they were intentionally removed. \nThe first is Zuckerberg’s November 12th post that offered his thoughts on “Facebook and the election.” ( Cached via Google at this link. ) The Verge and countless other news outlets covered Zuckerberg’s update, in which he insisted “more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic.” But he went on to admit “there is more we can do” to prevent hoaxes and false news stories from spreading across the massive social network. The original URL for that post now leads to a “page not found” error.\nA week later on November 19th, Zuckerberg published another update to his timeline outlining the company’s plan to combat fake news by listing a series of improvements (stronger detection of hoaxes, better reporting tools, warnings for articles flagged as false, etc.) that Facebook is actively working on. That Zuckerberg post can still be seen via the Internet Archive , but has also gone missing from his timeline. Again, the original URL now leads to an error . \nThe Verge has reached out to Facebook for comment on why these posts are no longer publicly visible on the CEO’s page. Two other posts pertaining to the election — one a photo of Zuckerberg and his daughter Max , and the other a video in which he controversially said it was “pretty crazy” to believe bogus news on Facebook influenced voters — remain on his timeline.\nThe missing posts are included in their entirety below.\nNovember 12th:\nI want to share some thoughts on Facebook and the election.\nOur goal is to give every person a voice. We believe deeply in people. Assuming that people understand what is important in their lives and that they can express those views has driven not only our community, but democracy overall. Sometimes when people use their voice though, they say things that seem wrong and they support people you disagree with.\nAfter the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading. These are very important questions and I care deeply about getting them right. I want to do my best to explain what we know here.\nOf all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\nThat said, we don't want any hoaxes on Facebook. Our goal is to show people the content they will find most meaningful, and people want accurate news. We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further.\nThis is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully though. Identifying the \"truth\" is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\nAs we continue our research, we are committed to always updating you on how News Feed evolves. We hope to have more to share soon, although this work often takes longer than we'd like in order to confirm changes we make won't introduce unintended side effects or bias into the system. If you're interested in following our updates, I encourage you to follow our News Feed FYI here: http://bit.ly/2frNWo2 .\nOverall, I am proud of our role giving people a voice in this election. We helped more than 2 million people register to vote, and based on our estimates we got a similar number of people to vote who might have stayed home otherwise. We helped millions of people connect with candidates so they could hear from them directly and be better informed. Most importantly, we gave tens of millions of people tools to share billions of posts and reactions about this election. A lot of that dialog may not have happened without Facebook.\nThis has been a historic election and it has been very painful for many people. Still, I think it's important to try to understand the perspective of people on the other side. In my experience, people are good, and even if you may not feel that way today, believing in people leads to better results over the long term.\nNovember 19th:\nA lot of you have asked what we're doing about misinformation, so I wanted to give an update.\nThe bottom line is: we take misinformation seriously. Our goal is to connect people with the stories they find most meaningful, and we know people want accurate information. We've been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously. We've made significant progress, but there is more work to be done.\nHistorically, we have relied on our community to help us understand what is fake and what is not. Anyone on Facebook can report any link as false, and we use signals from those reports along with a number of others -- like people sharing links to myth-busting sites such as Snopes -- to understand which stories we can confidently classify as misinformation. Similar to clickbait, spam and scams, we penalize this content in News Feed so it's much less likely to spread.\nThe problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically. We believe in giving people a voice, which means erring on the side of letting people share what they want whenever possible. We need to be careful not to discourage sharing of opinions or to mistakenly restrict accurate content. We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.\nWhile the percentage of misinformation is relatively small, we have much more work ahead on our roadmap. Normally we wouldn't share specifics about our work in progress, but given the importance of these issues and the amount of interest in this topic, I want to outline some of the projects we already have underway:\n- Stronger detection. The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves.\n- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster.\n- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more.\n- Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them.\n- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed.\n- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection.\n- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them.\nSome of these ideas will work well, and some will not. But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right.",

      "text": "NASA Like us on Facebook \nThe zero-G lifestyle does funny things to our bodily fluids. That’s the conclusion of one recent study, which may have found a reason for a common space travelers’ malady. The researchers presented their results [ PDF ] at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. \nIf we’re going to start sending humans to Mars and other distant destinations, we’re going to need to know if we can survive the trip. So astronauts are an incredible scientific resource, not only for what they do while in space, but also for what they experience . Living in orbit can shrink astronauts’ hearts and stretch their spines. It can also damage their ability to see: Numerous travelers who left Earth with 20/20 vision have returned to find they need glasses just to read or drive. \n\"People initially didn't know what to make of it, and by 2010 there was growing concern as it became apparent that some of the astronauts had severe structural changes that were not fully reversible upon return to earth,” lead author Noam Alperin of the University of Miami said in a statement. \nScientists call the phenomenon visual impairment intracranial pressure, or VIIP. The name is slightly misleading in its certainty. Researchers think the eye problems are the result of increased pressure inside astronauts’ heads, but they haven’t really been sure. \nAlperin and his colleagues wondered if the problem might not be liquid—cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), to be precise. CSF is a crucial component of healthy brain and body function. It surrounds our brains and spinal cords and acts kind of like amniotic fluid in the womb, ensuring a flow of nutrients and removing waste. CSF is also somewhat adaptable and responds to changes in the position and angle of your body and head. It’s a good system, and it works. \nAt least where there’s gravity. The research team scanned the brains and eyeballs of seven different astronauts both before and after long stints aboard the International Space Station (ISS). They compared those scans with results from another nine astronauts who had only been on the ISS briefly. \nThere could be no doubt about it—longer stays in space were messing with the astronauts’ eyes. Their eyes were more flattened; their optic nerves showed more swelling; and, most interestingly, they had higher volumes of CSF in their eye sockets and in the CSF-producing part of the brain. The higher the CSF volume, the more trouble an astronaut had seeing. \n\"The research provides, for the first time, quantitative evidence obtained from short- and long-duration astronauts pointing to the primary and direct role of the CSF in the globe deformations seen in astronauts with visual impairment syndrome,\" Alperin said. \nIdentifying the source of the problem is the first step to correcting it. Alperin and NASA are now working to simulate the conditions that cause VIIP so they can figure out how to protect astronauts’ eyes in the future. More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "Ohio State attacker Abdul Artan ranted on Facebook about ‘sleeper cell,’ lone wolf attacks Ohio state attacker ranted about Muslim 'sleeper cell' NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, November 29, 2016, 1:08 PM \nThe Somali-born Ohio State student who rammed his car into a crowd before attacking them with a butcher knife ranted on Facebook about a “sleeper cell” in Muslim communities, a law enforcement source said Tuesday. \nAbdul Razak Ali Artan warned about Muslims he described as belonging to “a sleeper cell, waiting for a signal.” \nIf the U.S. wanted “Muslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks, then make peace with ‘dawla in al sham,’” a term for ISIS, Artan wrote, the source told the Associated Press. Abdul Razak Ali Artan ranted on Facebook about sleeper cells and lone wolf attacks. (Kevin Stankiewicz/AP) \nArtan specifically protested the killing of Muslims in Burma, where a UN official last week said a Muslim minority group was suffering violence tantamount to ethnic cleansing at the state’s hands. Ohio State University campus attack \n“We are not weak. We are not weak, remember that,” Artan wrote. \nAs Ohio State students returned to class Tuesday, investigators continued trying to determine whether the attack that injured 11 people was an act of terror. Police were investigating Artan’s home for evidence pointing to a motive in the car-and-knife that left 11 injured. (John Minchillo/AP) \nArtan plowed his car onto a sidewalk and into a group of pedestrians before 10 a.m. He then began slashing people with a butcher knife before a campus police officer shot him dead. \nMost of the victims were hurt by the car while two were stabbed, officials said. One victim had a fractured skull. Four remained hospitalized Tuesday. Artan graduated from Columbus State Community College in Ohio on May 19. (CSCC via YouTube) \nArtan was born in Somalia and was a legal permanent U.S. resident, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. He came to the United States in 2014 as the child of a refugee. \nHe had been living in Pakistan from 2007 to 2014. It is not uncommon for refugees to go to a third-party country before being permanently resettled. Police fatally shot Artan shortly after his rampage began. (HANDOUT/REUTERS) \nSeth Harris, 32, who lives a few doors down from Artan in Columbus, was struggling to believe his neighbor carried out the attack. \n\"I'm shocked that this happened,\" said Harris, an Army veteran and prison guard. \"I'm shocked that it turned out to be my neighbor ... I wouldn't expect him to do something like this.\" Ohio State students hold hands and pray at an on-campus vigil Monday. (PAUL VERNON/AFP/Getty Images) \nColumbus is home to 50,000 Somali refugees, the second-largest population in the U.S. \nHarris said he wasn’t comfortable with the change. \n“Nothing has made me question my safety, but it has made me question my ability to mesh well here,” Harris said. \nFollowing the attack local Islamic leaders were joined by other faiths in denouncing the violence. \nColumbus City Council President Zach Klein called the attack “an isolated incident.” Blame should be on the attacker, Klein said, not the diverse Muslim and Somali communities from which he came. \nCandace Goforth Desantis reporting in Columbus, Ohio \nWith News Wire Services",

      "text": "Chaloner Woods // Getty Like us on Facebook \nThe sandwich, a.k.a. foodstuff delivered inside a bread vehicle, is a timeless classic. The formula is open to endless interpretations, like lobster rolls, deep-fried Fluffernutter sandwiches , and donut grilled cheeses . In 1909, diners were arguably more creative with what they put between two slices of bread than they are today. The Up-To-Date Sandwich Book: 400 Ways to Make a Sandwich breaks the sandwich down into its seven main categories: fish, egg, salad, meat, cheese, nut, and sweet. No matter what you choose for filling, the turn-of-the-century publication emphasizes the importance of starting with good bread. A product “at least one day old” is preferred. 1. APPLE AND GRAPE SANDWICH \nA sandwich can be so many things—a snack, a dessert, a weird salad you eat with your hands. This dish is a great example of all of the above. Start by chopping up apple, celery, and white grapes and toss the ingredients together with French dressing. Spread your mixture on thin slices of buttered white bread to make your sandwich. 2. OYSTER SANDWICH \nLike oysters on the half-shell, the shellfish in this sandwich are garnished simply with oil, lemon juice, and Tabasco sauce. Mix together these ingredients with finely chopped raw oysters and serve on thinly-sliced white bread—add a lettuce leaf for some extra crunch. 3. HOT HAM NUMBER TWO \nThe book’s second take on a hot ham sandwich is reminiscent of a Monte Cristo. After spreading minced ham onto buttered bread, assemble the sandwiches and cut them into triangles. Dip the sandwich points into a mixture of beaten eggs, milk, and salt and cook them up on a hot griddle. Once the sandwiches have been fried French toast-style, serve with a slice of roasted tomato. 4. LEMON SANDWICH \nNot many recipes feature whole lemon slices as the star ingredient. After removing the rind from the slices, dust them with powdered sugar and stack between buttered slices of white bread that have been cut into circles. A candied cherry on top will hopefully help to reduce the pucker-factor. 5. DAIRY SANDWICH \nThe dairy sandwich stays true to its name: The simple recipe asks you to spread fresh butter onto thin slices of Swiss and press the cheese together. There’s no mention of bread, suggesting this is literally meant to be a butter sandwich served between two slices of cheese. Unfortunately for sandwich purists, the protein-in-place-of-bread-theme has only gained traction in the last 100 years. 6. LOBSTER AND CAVIAR SANDWICH \nSandwiches aren’t typically associated with fine dining, but even luxurious ingredients like lobster and caviar can shine between bread. For this recipe, spread caviar onto lightly buttered bread and sprinkle with lemon juice. Spoon minced lobster meat on top and cover with the second slice of bread. Serve over a lettuce leaf—ideally on the beach with some chilled wine to wash it down. 7. OLIVE AND NUT SANDWICH \nUnlike peanut and jelly, olive and nut never caught on as a popular pairing. This recipe calls for sandwich builders to finely chop olives with English walnuts and combine the ingredients together with mayonnaise. Served on buttered brown bread, the mixture makes for a light sandwich that’s big on texture. 8. FARMER SANDWICH \nPork chops and applesauce are commonly seen together on the dinner plate. Here they come together on a sandwich to make a savory-sweet lunch item. You can put this one together by layering thinly sliced cold, roast pork onto white bread and topping it with applesauce. Cap it with the second slice of bread and dig in. 9. TOMATO AND HORSERADISH SANDWICH \nHere’s another curious food combination that’s failed to stand the test of time. To assemble a tomato and horseradish sandwich, start by sprinkling thin tomato slices with salt. Combine a half cup of horseradish with two tablespoons of mayonnaise and spread the mixture onto pieces of buttered white bread. Place the tomato slices between the bread and enjoy your meal while clearing out your sinuses at the same time. 10. CALF’S LIVER AND BACON SANDWICH \nIf you’re not a fan of calf’s liver, perhaps the addition of bacon will change your perspective. Take the well-done liver and chop it up fine with crisp slices of bacon. Season with salt, pepper, and ketchup and serve with a lettuce leaf between buttered graham or white bread. 11. EASTER SANDWICH \nWhether or not you make it for Easter, this recipe should be saved for special occasions. Dip a crisp lettuce leaf in mayonnaise and lay that on a slice of buttered white bread. Fill the lettuce with slices of cold hard-boiled egg and sprinkle with salt and pepper. After the sandwich has been cut into squares, tie them up with “lavender baby ribbon” and present your guests with the world’s most adorable finger food—just remind them to remove the ribbon before taking a bite. 12. ASPIC JELLY SANDWICH \nNo list of early 20th century recipes would be complete without aspic. This retro delicacy is made by mixing gelatin and meat stock to create a savory JELLO mold. To prepare it for a sandwich, soak two ounces of gelatin in one cup of chicken stock until soft. Pour in three more cups of chicken stock that have been seasoned with cloves, parsley, celery, mace, salt, and pepper. Strain the liquid into a dish and mix in shredded chicken before refrigerating. Once the gelatin has set, cut it into “fancy shapes” and serve on buttered wheat bread. More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "Remember back in the early days of Facebook when every other person was sending you Farmville notifications and updates?\nIt got annoying, sure, but the frequency of those notifications underlined just how addictive those games were, till the switch to mobile eventually saw Facebook lose out in the casual gaming market. But now, The Social Network may have found an even more addictive way to get back in – from today, Facebook users will be able to load and play a whole new set of games within Messenger and Facebook’s News Feed.\nStraight away you can see the potential. The new Instant Games don’t require any additional downloads and load within seconds. You can almost foresee your productivity being sucked away as you get locked into a competition to beat your friends’ high scores.\nTo access the new games in Messenger, you click on the new controller icon at the bottom of any message thread.\nThis then creates a high scores leaderboard of all of those people in the message thread – if you access a game within a group conversation, for example, you can go head-to-head with all of the group participants.\nEach participant plays the game independently, competing over top scores, as opposed to being turn based – the games are built in HTML5 and designed to load quickly, so there’s no capacity to save and come back later.\nOn News Feed, users can also recommend and share games which can be played instantly. Facebook’s also adding a new dedicated Instant Games bookmark where you can view and instantly replay all the games you’ve previously played across both platforms.\nThus far, the most impressive element users have noted is the speed – the games and scores load within seconds, making it very easy to register a quick top score in Pac Man and challenge your friends to beat it.\nAs noted, Facebook once dominated this type of casual gaming – back in 2008, Facebook was earning $1 million p.a. from in-game purchases. And while games are still played on Facebook, the dominance of mobile games like Angry Birds and Clash of Clans eventually took over much of that casual gaming market, and Facebook was never able to develop their own mobile games approach. Messenger games look set to change that – with more than a billion users , Messenger is already the key messaging platform of choice for many, and the quick, competitive nature of Instant Games will make it an easy option to switch to whenever you have a free moment on the train or in a waiting room.\nAnd if you’re wondering whether people are interested in playing games in Messenger, Facebook says that its recent test of a simple basketball game within Messenger was played more than 1.2 billion times , well more than they’d expected.\nAll the signs point to Instant Games being a popular addition, and the variety of games on offer will also make it even more enticing – there’s a total of 17 games to choose from in the initial Instant Games release.\nNo doubt at least some of those awaken your childhood memories.\nIn terms of monetization, the new Instant Games won’t feature ads and won’t allow in-game payments. This is in-line with Facebook’s normal three-stage approach to monetization – the first step is to build a product that people love, which is then followed by facilitating business behaviours. The concern, of course, is that this will provide less incentive for game developers to use the platform, as opposed to guiding people back to their own properties where that can generate ad dollars, but Facebook’s Head of Messenger David Marcus has told TechCrunch that they’re committed to helping developers monetize their apps, with new options set to come early in the new year.\nThis will likely come in the form of new levels and tools, though how, exactly, they’ll be built into the lightweight HTML5 experience is yet to be seen.\nFacebook’s making a bigger push into the gaming market – earlier this month, they introduced the new Facebook Gameroom for desktop, their attempt to take on Valve’s Steam for a share of the lucrative PC gaming market. And considering the global gaming market is expected to reach close to $100 billion this year , it’s not hard to see why Facebook - with its huge platform reach – would be looking to tap into that growth.\nAnd one last thing – Facebook says they’re confident people won’t get inundated with innane notifications and updates this time around. They’ve learned their lessons – you can hit up Instant Games without too much concerns about annoying your friends.\nThe launch could be perfect timing too, with the work year winding down for many.\nSay goodbye to whatever free time you had left.",

      "text": "Facebook mistakenly removes Zuckerberg's posts on fake news by Seth Fiegerman @sfiegerman November 29, 2016: 3:01 PM ET How tech companies can fight fake news Facebook accidentally removed the wrong kind of fake news stories. \nTwo recent posts from CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressing the controversy over fake news spreading on Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) were briefly deleted on Tuesday. The posts re-appeared after media outlets called attention to the matter. \nIn one post from November 12, Zuckerberg tried to play down concerns about the impact of fake news on the election. \n\"More than 99% of what people see is authentic,\" he wrote. \nIn the second post from November 19, Zuckerberg laid out steps Facebook planned for cracking down on the spread of misinformation. \nFacebook told CNNMoney the posts were \"removed by mistake,\" along with eight others from Zuckerberg. \nRelated: Facebook is well aware that it can influence elections \n\"This was caused by an error in one of our systems and the posts have now been restored,\" Jay Nancarrow, a spokesperson for Facebook, said in a statement. \"Mark's account was not compromised, and he stands behind the words in his posts.\" \nFacebook has repeatedly attributed the removal of sensitive content to bugs and errors. Nancarrow did not provide additional detail on what caused the latest error. \nZuckerberg and Facebook have come under fire this month for not doing more to address the rise of fake news in the lead-up to the election. \n\"The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,\" Zuckerberg said in the post from November 19. \"We do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties.   3:01 PM ET",

Five survived. A professional soccer team from southern Brazil heading to a championship game was on the plane. (Nov. 29) AP Fans of Chapecoense gather at the Arena Conda to mourn following a plane crash that killed 76 people. (Photo: Fernando Bizerra Jr., EPA) \nThe moments of silence by some of the world’s biggest clubs were touching. So, too, the expressions of sorrow and solidarity by superstars Neymar and Lionel Messi. No doubt there will eventually be a memorial where respects can be paid years, even generations, from now. \nBut the most fitting tribute to Brazil’s Chapecoense soccer team came from its opponent. Atletico Nacional said it considers Chapecoense the Copa Sudamericana champion, and requested that South American soccer authorities do the same. \n\"The accident involving our soccer brothers from Chapecoense will impact us for the rest of our lives and will leave an indelible imprint on Latin American and world soccer,” Atletico Nacional said in its statement Tuesday asking CONMEBOL to award the Copa Sudamericana title to Chapecoense. \nA title won’t bring back the 75 people who died late Monday night when the plane carrying Chapecoense, its traveling party and several media members crashed into the Colombian mountains. It won’t erase the grief and pain of those left behind, either. Chapecoense has been forever scarred and nothing, certainly not something as trivial as a tournament title, can change that. Brazilian club Chapecoense aboard plane that crashed was becoming more popular \nThat isn’t the point, however. Awarding Chapecoense the title of South America’s second-largest tournament is a way to show respect for the players who had defied conventional soccer wisdom and support for the fans who cheered them. \nChapecoense is not a traditional powerhouse. It represents an agricultural city of 210,000 some 800 miles south of Rio de Janeiro. The club has only been in existence since 1973, and was playing in Brazil’s second division just four years ago. \nBut to the growing delight of fans around the continent, Chapecoense had risen to challenge the elite in both Brazilian and South American soccer. Though it currently sits in ninth place, 25 points behind Palmeiras, just managing to avoid relegation in its first three seasons in the top division is a feat. \nSo far this season, it has draws against Brazilian elites Palmeiras, Flamengo and Corinthians, as well as a victory against Internacional. And it reached the finals of the Copa Sudamericana – akin to the Europa League – by knocking off Argentina’s San Lorenzo, best known as Pope Francis’ team, and seven-time Colombian champion Junior. \nAt a time when Brazil is struggling with economic and political crises and CONMEBOL has been rocked by corruption allegations, Chapecoense’s success was a feel-good story everyone could cheer. Watch the video of the team giddily celebrating after advancing to the Copa Sudamericana final, and it’s impossible not to smile at its delight. \nTo have it end on a fog-shrouded mountain makes the tragedy all the more unspeakable. \n“Before boarding, they said they were seeking to turn their dream into reality,” Chapecoense chairman Plínio David de Nes Filho said, according to the New York Times . \n“This morning, that dream is over.” Professional sports leagues have disaster plans in place \nSadly, this is not soccer’s first experience with such horror. Torino’s entire team was killed when its plane crashed in May 1949 on the way back to Italy from an exhibition in Lisbon. Nine years later, some of England’s best players were killed when a plane carrying Manchester United crashed on takeoff in February 1958. \nAnd in 1993, the plane carrying Zambia’s national team to a World Cup qualifier in Senegal crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. \n“Our thoughts and our prayers are with everyone that is affected by the tragedy,” Kalusha Bwalya, who was Zambia’s captain in 1993 but was spared because he was on a different flight, said on Twitter before retweeting a series of Tweets about the crash. Our thoughts and our prayers are with everyone that is affected by the tragedy in #Colombia with #Chapecoence — Kalusha Bwalya (@KalushaPBwalya) November 29, 2016 \nThose heartfelt sentiments, while providing some measure of comfort, often feel woefully inadequate at a time like this. There is a wish to do more, to let those grieving know their heartbreak will not be forgotten. \nAwarding Chapecoense the Copa Sudamericana title might seem like a small gesture, all things considered. But it would immortalize the team in a way even a permanent memorial cannot. Every time the tournament is played from now on, Chapecoense will be a part of it. \nThe players of Chapecoense did something extraordinary in their too-short lives, defying expectations and delighting everyone who watched them do it. Let that, rather than the horrible way in which they died, be their legacy. \nContributing: Jorge L. Ortiz \nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour . Facebook",

      "title": "Scientists Reveal the Secrets of the Capuchin Catacomb Mummies",
      "text": "filed under: archaeology , science , Stones Bones and Wrecks Like us on Facebook \nThe stone stairway that leads down into the Capuchin Catacombs in Palermo, Sicily, might at first offer relief from the Mediterranean heat—until you see the corpses, all 1800 of them, lining the rock-cut walls. \nThe mummies’ clothes chronicle a few centuries of fashion choices. You can see virgins wearing flower crowns and slain soldiers in uniform. Some of the bodies still have desiccated skin over their hands and faces. Some lie on shelves, while others are propped up vertically, their mouths contorted in what looks like a scream. Biological anthropologist Dario Piombino-Mascali assures me these tortured expressions had nothing to do with the emotional state of the deceased; it’s just a natural effect of decay. \nThe Catholic crypt, which dates back to the end of the 16th century, was built in southern Italy at a time when many friars, church-going elites, and later middle-class people were turned into relics after death, not buried underground. The crypt has long been a religious site and morbid tourist attraction. But only recently has it also become a place for serious science, thanks to Sicily native Piombino-Mascali, who convinced the friars who live next door to let him study the collection. “I wanted to do something for the place where I was born, and also because we have so many,” Piombino-Mascali tells mental_floss . “I thought it was about time to study them properly and to obtain firsthand information on them.” \nAs part of his Sicily Mummy Project , which started in 2007, Piombino-Mascali and his colleagues have examined hundreds of mummies scattered across the island. By looking for subtle traces of life, from the pollen in mummified feces to the gunk on mummies’ teeth, they’ve reconstructed the health, diet, and even social status of long-dead individuals—all while managing to preserve the corpses. \nPiombino-Mascali is, of course, not the first scientist to be interested in mummies: In the 19th century, European scholars caught up in “Egyptomania” commonly examined mummies via dissection, much like they might have conducted autopsies on the newly deceased. The practice was so fascinating to the public that “ mummy unwrapping parties ” became popular in Victorian England. Today, scientists are considerably more careful with their specimens. Less destructive investigation techniques, such as advanced imaging technologies, preserve the specimens being studied. Piombino-Mascali says he even saves the dust that’s cleaned off his mummies to learn more about the creatures like mites that might live in Sicilian crypts. \nTo see inside corpses without using a scalpel, archaeologists have used X-rays since 1896, when, only a few months after X-rays were discovered, a German physicist X-rayed Egyptian mummies at the Physical Society of Frankfurt. But with the advent of DNA testing, what researchers can learn from mummies—and the cultures they came from—has ballooned. Researchers, for example, have found stomach parasites and even a predisposition for heart disease in Ötzi the Iceman , a frozen mummy found in the Alps. And analyzing the hair of Chilean mummies recently proved that people were consuming nicotine in the Andes at least 2000 years ago. \nThe Sicily Mummy Project takes advantage of this newly expanded tool kit to study what may be the largest collection of mummies in the world, yielding new insights about life for a historical cross-section of the upper and middle class in Italy. Overall, most of the mummies showed signs of a good diet, high in animal products like meat, dairy, and seafood. In hair samples from the Capuchin Catacombs, the researchers found traces of ethyl glucuronide, a byproduct of alcohol consumption. The results of these mummy drug tests suggest that, yes, wine—one of Sicily’s most important agricultural products today—was indeed an important part of the local diet. (But not for kids. None of the hair samples from six child mummies bore evidence of underage drinking.) \nThe good life had some downsides; among the mummies examined from the town of Savoca, for example, the researchers found cases of a skeletal disease called DISH and gout, conditions that could be linked to a protein-rich diet. In another recently published study , the Sicily Mummy team focused on the corpse of an unidentified adult male who died in his 40s and was interred at the “Sepulcher of the Priests\" at a church in Piraino sometime between the late 18th and mid 19th century. \nThis priest had a severe whipworm infection at the time of his death and was likely suffering from myeloma (a type of cancer), as well as residual symptoms from a lung infection. His body wasn’t entirely intact, which allowed the team to pry a sample of fossilized poop—technically known as a coprolite—from an opening in the mummy’s abdomen. In the feces, they found wheat pollen and chaff, suggesting he ate bread and pasta before he died. He had also ingested pollen from Polygala vulgaris , or common milkwort. This plant has been consumed as a tea for medicinal purposes in other parts of the world, and its active compounds include anti-tumor agents; the researchers speculate perhaps milkwort may have been part of this man’s cancer treatment. \nIn addition to insights on historical medicinal treatments, the Sicily Mummy Project has also helped reveal what happened after cures failed. Mummification was common in southern Italy up until the 19th century, when it was largely outlawed for hygienic reasons. The team’s survey of corpses confirmed that most of Sicily’s mummies were created by “spontaneous desiccation.” There’s a conspicuously empty—and repulsively named—chamber at the Capuchin Catacombs called the “draining room,” where dead bodies were once laid out over terracotta pipes or basins to dry out over the course of a year. After bodily fluids had naturally drained from the corpses, they would be washed with vinegar and dressed for display. For Italian Catholics, the passage to the afterlife could be a long, gradual process, mirrored by the material transformation of the corpse. \n“This practice of draining the bodies seems to be like a physical representation of purgatory, which was a very popular concept in Catholic Italy,” Piombino-Mascali says. \nHowever, other corpses in Sicily were artificially mummified after death. The Capuchin Catacombs’ most famous resident, Rosalia Lombardo, a 2-year-old girl who died of pneumonia in 1920, has earned the nickname “Sleeping Beauty” because of her pristine mummification; in 2009, Piombino-Mascali discovered a handwritten record of the chemical mix her embalmer used. \nHis team also found some less conspicuous cases of intentional mummification in the crypt. For example, they used a digital X-ray to scan the whole body of a man who, based on his clothing, looked like he died in the mid to late 19th century. They found that his arteries were full of a metallic substance, suggesting that he had been injected with an embalming fluid like arsenic and mercury. “The perfect distribution of the embalming fluid, especially into the peripheral parts of the body, demonstrates the high quality of the embalmer’s workmanship at the time,” the researchers wrote. \nBut having a scientist’s perspective on the mummies doesn’t mean Piombino-Mascali has a cold view of his specimens. The opposite might be true. Several times he scolded tourists for taking pictures in defiance of the “No Photos” signs tacked to walls. Because the crypt is a religious site, the friars who maintain it are extremely strict about prohibiting photos and video. \nIn the crypts, it can be easy to forget that you’re standing in the final resting place of real people, some of whom died not so long ago. Piombino-Mascali is careful in his treatment of the mummies because he knows they’re at risk—humidity and salt deposits introduce microbes that can colonize the corpses . In Palermo, the team has taken tiny samples of the mummies’ skin, muscle, hair, bones, and even clothes to identify the bacteria and fungi that are speeding up the corpses’ degradation. They hope that they’ll be able to recommend research-informed conservation methods so that the mummies remain in their remarkable state for many more years—and so scientists of the future, using even more sophisticated tools, can study them. \nAll images courtesy of the Sicily Mummy Project More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "That's the face of a MPP who throws a sweet ass party. Photo via Facebook You only get sworn in as the youngest ever MPP in Ontario's history once. So, it's the perfect time to par-tay and, according to Ontario PC party leader Patrick Brown, that's just what Sam Oosterhoff, the first year university student turned MPP, is going to do. Oosterhoff is so committed that his swearing-in be a big deal that he had to push back the actual date he was supposed to be sworn in so his political party could throw him a worthy rager. (Politicians call this a 'swearing-in celebration.') You know what they say about social conservatives knowing how to party. Oosterhoff's swearing-in is going to be the most rootin'-tootin', gosh-darn, hunky-dory time that a swell home-schooled 19-year-old elected politician who lives with his parents ever did see. Boy howdy! When asked about the future banger by the Toronto Star Ontario PC party leader Patrick Brown spilled the juicy details. \"It's a special occasion to have a celebration of a 19-year-old, it's making history, and so Sam is planning a much larger swearing-in ceremony,\" he said. \"I understand it will be very soon.\" Hot-diggity-damn, that's going to be one heck of a shindig. Hell, Oosterhoff was so busy (presumably) filling up the balloon effigies of Kathleen Wynne and abortionists with helium that he had to push back being sworn in. It was expected that he would be sworn in on Monday alongside the other newly elected MPP, Nathalie Des Rosiers, but it was pushed back. Des Rosiers, for her part, showed up—like a social outcast without a future banger in her honour would—to her scheduled swearing-in on Monday. But lo, a conspiracy! Critics are saying that Oosterhoff, a staunch social conservative who has described himself as \"100 percent pro-life,\" may have had his swearing-in date pushed back so he would miss the debate and vote for Bill 28 — which passed . Bill 28 makes it easier for homosexual couples to have children. During the campaign, Brown was accused of muzzling Oosterhoff and his socially conservative beliefs. The third reading for the All Families Are Equal Act was on Tuesday, it updates Ontario's parentage and birth registration rules and changes the language to be as gender neutral as possible. On Twitter, Oosterhoff tweeted that he would be joining his co-workers Wednesday. So, on the other side of the coin, the decision may very well be less Superbad and more House of Cards and while Oosterhoff didn't get to vote on Bill-28 at the very least he still gets to have his sweet-ass banger.

      "text": "November 29, 2016 Andrew Hutchinson \nRemember back in the early days of Facebook when every other person was sending you Farmville notifications and updates? \nIt got annoying, sure, but the frequency of those notifications underlined just how addictive those games were, till the switch to mobile eventually saw Facebook lose out in the casual gaming market. But now, The Social Network may have found an even more addictive way to get back in – from today, Facebook users will be able to load and play a whole new set of games within Messenger and Facebook’s News Feed. \nStraight away you can see the potential. The new Instant Games don’t require any additional downloads and load within seconds. You can almost foresee your productivity being sucked away as you get locked into a competition to beat your friends’ high scores. \nTo access the new games in Messenger, you click on the new controller icon at the bottom of any message thread. \nThis then creates a high scores leaderboard of all of those people in the message thread – if you access a game within a group conversation, for example, you can go head-to-head with all of the group participants. \nEach participant plays the game independently, competing over top scores, as opposed to being turn based – the games are built in HTML5 and designed to load quickly, so there’s no capacity to save and come back later. \nOn News Feed, users can also recommend and share games which can be played instantly. Facebook’s also adding a new dedicated Instant Games bookmark where you can view and instantly replay all the games you’ve previously played across both platforms. \nThus far, the most impressive element users have noted is the speed – the games and scores load within seconds, making it very easy to register a quick top score in Pac Man and challenge your friends to beat it. \nAs noted, Facebook once dominated this type of casual gaming – back in 2008, Facebook was earning $1 million p.a. from in-game purchases. And while games are still played on Facebook, the dominance of mobile games like Angry Birds and Clash of Clans eventually took over much of that casual gaming market, and Facebook was never able to develop their own mobile games approach. Messenger games look set to change that – with more than a billion users , Messenger is already the key messaging platform of choice for many, and the quick, competitive nature of Instant Games will make it an easy option to switch to whenever you have a free moment on the train or in a waiting room. \nAnd if you’re wondering whether people are interested in playing games in Messenger, Facebook says that its recent test of a simple basketball game within Messenger was played more than 1.2 billion times , well more than they’d expected. \nAll the signs point to Instant Games being a popular addition, and the variety of games on offer will also make it even more enticing – there’s a total of 17 games to choose from in the initial Instant Games release. \nNo doubt at least some of those awaken your childhood memories. \nIn terms of monetization, the new Instant Games won’t feature ads and won’t allow in-game payments. This is in-line with Facebook’s normal three-stage approach to monetization – the first step is to build a product that people love, which is then followed by facilitating business behaviours. The concern, of course, is that this will provide less incentive for game developers to use the platform, as opposed to guiding people back to their own properties where that can generate ad dollars, but Facebook’s Head of Messenger David Marcus has told TechCrunch that they’re committed to helping developers monetize their apps, with new options set to come early in the new year. \nThis will likely come in the form of new levels and tools, though how, exactly, they’ll be built into the lightweight HTML5 experience is yet to be seen. \nFacebook’s making a bigger push into the gaming market – earlier this month, they introduced the new Facebook Gameroom for desktop, their attempt to take on Valve’s Steam for a share of the lucrative PC gaming market. And considering the global gaming market is expected to reach close to $100 billion this year , it’s not hard to see why Facebook - with its huge platform reach – would be looking to tap into that growth. \nAnd one last thing – Facebook says they’re confident people won’t get inundated with innane notifications and updates this time around. They’ve learned their lessons – you can hit up Instant Games without too much concerns about annoying your friends. \nThe launch could be perfect timing too, with the work year winding down for many. \nSay goodbye to whatever free time you had left.

      "text": "When Lori Goler joined Facebook eight years ago to lead its recruiting efforts, the social networking giant wasn't quite a giant yet.\nBack then, Facebook fb had around 500 workers and was small enough that the company didn’t have regular employee performance reviews. But as Goler got to personally know more employees she discovered that many workers didn't know how they were performing, leaving them feeling rudderless.\nRecounting her first days as Facebook's top recruiter, Goler explained Tuesday at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Next Gen Summi t in Laguna Niguel, Calif. how she learned the importance of performance reviews.\n\"I feel everyday like I could get fired,\" Goler recalled some workers saying before the reviews. \"I never get any feedback.\"\nSubscribe to the Broadsheet , Fortune's daily newsletter on the world's most powerful women. \nNow, Facebook has regular employee reviews, but the goal is not to focus on \"poor performers,\" she explained. Instead, it's to get to know what skills and tastes workers have and how to ensure that they are doing the type of work they want to do.\nAnd while many traditional businesses struggle to accommodate the needs of so-called millennials, whose more cavalier ways of working can seem counter-intuitive or downright annoying to management, Facebook is trying to learn how to handle the needs of the next wave of young workers.\nThis next generation, with many future workers still in school, are used to living in worlds where they have their own personal devices and \"personalized feeds\" that give them the content they want from apps like Instagram and Facebook, she said. These people will enter the workforce and expect work to cater to their needs, Goler explained.\nGoler said Facebook is trying to accommodate millennials and its younger predecessor by talking to each worker and figuring out how their individual skills can be used to make a more personalized career path, not something more traditional and cookie cutter-like.",

      "text": "November 29, 2016 by Lilandra Ra Leave a Comment I said on my Facebook right before the election I don’t unfriend over politics. At the time, I had unfriended 16 people half of whom were spammers for sunglasses or something. But after years on FB, blogging, and Youtube I am tired of the same sort of blowhard derailing conversations. Alt-Right messaging has become rampant on the internet In fact, in my community of there are many atheists that are a part of the larger Alt Right community. The Alt-Right community has a good portion of trolls. They successfully derailed concerns about Donald Trump’s blatant misogyny, racism, and sexual abuse by projecting faults on to Hillary Clinton. Though she has faults they are not the same as Trump’s –not even close. When it’s not about dialogue Though I have been wrong myself, I am an ex-Creationist, it isn’t simply that they are wrong. I have erred too often on assuming good faith. Trolling is often the more likely explanation. Perhaps even, unintentionally allowing someone to derail the conversation. In effect, using my space as a platform for their misinformation and sometimes even disinformation. People who didn’t come to your space to be reasoned with . People who were often not even friends with me on FB. I have seen these people openly tag each other to join in. Non-friends and some pseudo-friends especially dominating the discussion are a sign of dogpiling. When it’s time to part ways However, I am still friends with people that are not helping to move equality forward. Even sometimes in small ways whether intentionally or not because they have bought poorly reasoned ideas. The kicker is how unreasonable some are in discussions and derailing conversations with often Alt-Right talking points recycled often from Right Wing Propaganda. Let’s have a look at how far the rabbit hole goes Although not typical trolls, paid Russian troll s are defending Trump. And our homegrown Alt-Right trolls are plentiful and well evidenced. Look at the cesspool of disinformation that is Breitbart. Look at how their head troll Steve Bannon now is Trump’s Chief’s advisor. Who should we blame for Alt-Right Politics? I am fed up after this election which couldn’t have been a more blatant display of racism and misogyny after being gaslit for years that these aren’t really problems. And still, these same talking heads including ostensible liberals who want to blame minority identity politics and have us understand white identity politics as the cause for the whitelash in this election. How about for once maybe understanding minorities’ problems that have been institutionalized in our government? And how about asking people to stop blaming and hectoring people for others’ ignorant and abusive behavior lashing out at them rather than the source of their problems? And while these people are expressing concern , how about using their platform to ask questions of whites that have scapegoated blacks, Latino/a/x s, and immigrants for their problems to examine the source of their problems? Like perhaps, their Republican Governors and Legislatures that have cut taxes and good paying jobs for tax cuts for the wealthy? The real reason people are unfriended \nAnyways, bad faith actors have exhausted and abused my patience. For example, a bad faith actor calling me a racist for pointing out systemic racism. I have no time and patience anymore with the willfully ignorant. I still have patience for the reasonable and misguided or people that can convince me I am wrong in a respectful, good faith manner. The decision to stop engaging and giving my platform to unreasonable people and trolls with repellant Alt-Right ideas is not ultimately about politics. As Jennifer Sullivan succinctly wrote about in The Huffington Post: \n\n“Why are people unfriending others over politics?” \nIf I had a nickel for every time I’ve heard (or read) that question these past few months, I’d have enough money to bail out the Trump Taj Mahal. \nThe individuals posing this query usually chalk the decision up to a lack of maturity. To an abject refusal to entertain countervailing beliefs. To a matter of mere partisanship. \nAnd you know what I have to say to those people? \nEnough. \nNo, really. Enough. \nI am so tired of people feigning shock and outrage over others not wanting to remain friends with those who are directly or indirectly fueling discrimination. Reject Unreason Unreasonable creationists, who close down discussions, have convinced us as atheists that we should never even block someone who is blatantly insulting you or venting vile hatred. Like calling blacks the n-word in common sections, for example. However, I would say that we don’t have to give the same respect to unreasonable ideas than reasonable ones. At the end of the day, that is how to deal with the hatred this election brought out –by rejecting it. Especially after how unreason reigned in this election.",

      "text": "Will take action against those forwarding jokes about Demonetization on WhatsApp and Facebook: Finance Minister 30, Nov 2016 By @jurnoleast \nNew Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today announced that anyone found forwarding jokes on Demonetization that attempts to mock Govt’s effort to tackle the menace of black money will face strict action. \nThe FM’s statement came after it was reported that around 80% of WhatsApp forwards were jokes on demonetization and similar numbers for Facebook too, which the Govt thinks trivializes the entire exercise. \nWhile addressing the media the Finance Minister said, “Since the time PM made the announcement, we have observed an increase in number of WhatsApp forwards on demonetization. Most of them are silly jokes. These jokes are now a bigger problem than black money itself.” \nWhile commenting on the role of media he said, “Media needs to act responsibly. It has come to our notice that some satire sites like FakingNews are mocking demonetization and almost 90% of their articles published in the last week are around the note ban. We respect their freedom of expression, but they are clearly crossing the line.” \nMany believe that the Govt’s move of curbing joke forwards would boomerang and in a way give a chance to critics to corner the Govt once again. \nRahul Gandhi expressed his resentment and said, “ WhatsApp par log mujhe pappu kehkar mera mazak udate hai. Lekin mai kuch nahi bolta. Tab sarkaar ko takleef nahi hoti. Modiji ko iska bhi jawab dena hoga Parliament mein .” \nMamata Bannerjee, who earlier attacked the PM and threatened to throw him out of politics, too the opportunity and lashed out at the Govt. \n“ Jonta ko kitna tokleef ho raha hai. Yeh dikhta nahi hai sorkaar ko. WhatsApp jokes se problem ho raha hai? Hum isko oppose korega, chhodega nahi, pokodke rokhega ,” she said while addressing a rally in Kolkata. \nNot just the TMC, other opposition parties too have criticized Govt’s highhandedness and have declared that they will not let the Parliament function for the rest of the winter session. \n“These boring Parliament session were made bearable by the joke forwards that we used to get on WhatsApp. Now Govt wants to ban that too. What is the point in attending winter session then?,” questioned an opposition MP who didn’t wish to be named.",

Photo from Facebook SAN FRANCISCO, US – Facebook on Tuesday, Nov 29, unveiled \"Instant Games\" allowing users of the world's biggest social network to play from its Messenger application or directly on their news feeds.\nThe new games effort could be a step toward eventually monetizing Messenger, which now has more than one billion users. \n\"This new games experience allows people to easily discover, share, and play games without having to install new apps,\" said Facebook product manager Alissa Ju in a blog post announcing the initiative. \nInstant Games is launching in 30 countries with 17 titles available including Pac-Man from Bandai Namco, Taito's Space Invaders , Zynga's Words with Friends and King Digital's Shuffle Cats Mini. PAC-MAN. Screengrab from Facebook \nWhile Facebook has previously been home to \"social\" games like Zynga's FarmVille , this effort aims at smartphone users and also works with Messenger, its fast-growing communications platform. \n\"The primary way that we expect people to be interacting with Instant Games is through Messenger, especially at first,\" said Leo Olebe, director of global games partnerships at Facebook. \nOlebe said the initiative is the first time games will be \"a platform inside of Messenger\" and the first time Facebook has directly put games on mobile devices. \nThe concept is similar to that of \"Instant Articles,\" which allows faster loading of news stories by hosting them on the powerful servers of Facebook instead of linking to a separate news site. \nWhile Facebook ad revenues have been surging, the company has warned its ad growth is likely to slow, but Olebe nevertheless said there will be no immediate effort to draw revenue from the games. (Read: Facebook overtakes media giants' U.S. ad revenues – report ) \n\"Right now it's still early in the process, monetization will come later down the road,\" he said, adding that Facebook wants \"to drive the engagement in the overall experience.\" \nInstant Games will allow users to invite others and share results and scores, but has controls to prevent people from getting overwhelmed with requests to play. \n\"The games are not designed to reward people for getting an increasing number of folks to play,\" he said. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Facebook’s Top HR Executive On Millennials and Performance Reviews \nWhen Lori Goler joined Facebook eight years ago to lead its recruiting efforts, the social networking giant wasn’t quite a giant yet. \nBack then, Facebook fb had around 500 workers and was small enough that the company didn’t have regular employee performance reviews. But as Goler got to personally know more employees she discovered that many workers didn’t know how they were performing, leaving them feeling rudderless. \nRecounting her first days as Facebook’s top recruiter, Goler explained Tuesday at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Next Gen Summi t in Laguna Niguel, Calif. how she learned the importance of performance reviews. \n“I feel everyday like I could get fired,” Goler recalled some workers saying before the reviews. “I never get any feedback.” Subscribe to the Broadsheet , Fortune’s daily newsletter on the world’s most powerful women. \nNow, Facebook has regular employee reviews, but the goal is not to focus on “poor performers,” she explained. Instead, it’s to get to know what skills and tastes workers have and how to ensure that they are doing the type of work they want to do. \nAnd while many traditional businesses struggle to accommodate the needs of so-called millennials, whose more cavalier ways of working can seem counter-intuitive or downright annoying to management, Facebook is trying to learn how to handle the needs of the next wave of young workers. \nThis next generation, with many future workers still in school, are used to living in worlds where they have their own personal devices and “personalized feeds” that give them the content they want from apps like Instagram and Facebook, she said. These people will enter the workforce and expect work to cater to their needs, Goler explained. \nGoler said Facebook is trying to accommodate millennials and its younger predecessor by talking to each worker and figuring out how their individual skills can be used to make a more personalized career path, not something more traditional and cookie cutter-like.",

Facebook told Prisma: “Your app streams video from a mobile device camera, which can already be done through the Facebook app. The Live Video API is meant to let people publish live video content from other sources such as professional cameras, multi-camera setups, games or screencasts.” \nYet in an FAQ on the Facebook Live site for developers Facebook does not explicitly say streaming from smartphone cameras is prohibited — although it does flag up other types of camera, such as standalone cameras and drones, as examples of its preferred use-case for the API. \nThe FAQ also says the API can be used to apply special effects to video — which you could argue describes Prisma’s style transfer feature. \nOne rather salient detail in this story is that Facebook is in the midst of rolling out its own style transfer filter feature — which it previewed in October , the day before Prisma showed off its style transfer preview on a Facebook Live broadcast. \nSo Facebook evidently does not want Prisma cannibalizing its push into Prisma-style style transfer. \nThe Russian startup popularized the current craze for style transfer, after launching their app in June — initially offering a series of art filters that could be applied to photos. This quickly went viral on Instagram as users shared arty-looking selfies created with Prisma. By October, the app had racked up more than 70 million downloads, and the team added support for video . \n“We were trying to fix the issue but Facebook has a strong policy, they only let broadcast to different cameras, drones. Our app is no drone or camera. So this means we cannot do it,” says Prisma’s Aram Airapetyan, discussing what happened when Facebook cut off its access to the Live API earlier this month. \nDespite being blocked on Facebook’s platform, Airapetyan says Prisma still has “big plans for live”. “The fact that we can do it is great and we’ll probably give users an opportunity to stream to different websites,” he tells TechCrunch. \nWhile the future of Prisma’s live video support remains up in the air at this point, the team’s current priority is working on a social-focused release, pegged for mid December. \n“The priority is the social feature coming soon. But after we launch it, we’ll seriously consider giving our users an alternative for live,” adds Airapetyan. \nAt the time of writing Facebook had not responded to a request for comment on its reasons for booting Prisma out of its livestreaming walled garden. 0",

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 30, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print CLEVELAND, OH - NOVEMBER 27, 2016: Quarterback Eli Manning #10 of the New York Giants wipes his face as he walks onto the field during a game against the Cleveland Browns on November 27, 2016 at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. New York won 27-13. (Photo by: Nick Cammett/Diamond Images/Getty Imges) \nSterling Shepard has been one of the top rookie receivers this season for the New York Giants. He's second among rookies with five touchdowns and 476 yards, while also ranking third in receptions with 44. He's put up those numbers despite not recording a single catch on Sunday against the Browns.\nIn fact, he wasn't even targeted once, the first time that's happened in his career. his previous low was four in his NFL debut.\nEli Manning is obviously responsible for getting Shepard the ball, and he was sorry for not making that happen on Sunday.\nMore from FoxSports Delanie Walker is ready for the Titans' bye week | PROCast Peter King: 'Full speed ahead' for Cardinals Fantasy Football: Week 13 waiver wire targets Whitlock 1-on-1: Chris Spielman says Kap can say whatever he wants if he wins | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF \"I apologized for not getting him a catch,\" Manning said, via the New York Daily News . \"We need to get him involved. We need to get him catches. It's kind of the way the day went on some things. He's done a good job all year. We've got to make sure we're getting him involved in the offense.\" \nManning clearly felt bad about putting a big, fat zero on Shepard's stat sheet, but the rookie didn't need an apology to make it right. He understands that the game dictates where the ball goes oftentimes.\n\"I didn't want him to apologize to me,\" Shepard said. \"That's just the way it goes sometimes.\" \nSo long as the Giants are winning, all is well. No receiver is going to complain about being blanked in the reception column if New York gets a victory. Or at least no receiver should make a fuss about it.",
