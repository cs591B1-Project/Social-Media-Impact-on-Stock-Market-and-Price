      "text": "Prime would likely expand to some 200 countries and territories in a direct challenge to Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service. Amazon is set to challenge Netflix worldwide with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service featuring its remake of the BBC's global hit \"Top Gear.\"\nAmazon Prime Video is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Prime would likely expand to some 200 countries and territories in a direct challenge to Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service.\nAmazon's take on \"Top Gear,\" called \"The Grand Tour,\" made its Prime debut Thursday in the existing markets including Britain and the United States -- to rapturous reviews from the UK press. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos tweeted that the global rollout of \"The Grand Tour\" would come in December.\nIts colorful main host, Jeremy Clarkson, was dropped from the madcap BBC show after he punched a producer in March. The BBC came back with a rebooted version featuring new presenters including British broadcaster Chris Evans, but he quit after only one series following downbeat reviews of the program, which has 350 million viewers per week in 170 countries. Amazon seized on the opportunity of hiring Clarkson and his two co-presenters to use the motoring show as a flagship product for its global ambitions.\n\"It's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere,\" Clarkson tweeted. \"Amazon has gone global.\"\nHow the show will be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service.\n\"We don't have anything else to announce,\" beyond Bezos' announcement, an Amazon spokeswoman told AFP.\nEyes on Netflix\nNetflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over its own growth. The company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter -- most of them from outside the United States -- and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers.\nOf that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company is gaining momentum as a global TV feed. For the current quarter Netflix forecast a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US. The service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including \"Stranger Things\" and \"Narcos,\" with helping draw customers.\nThe earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street.\nThe on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\"\nOffering originals\nNetflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion (7 billion euros) -- more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit.\nNetflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion. Original Amazon productions \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" won prestigious Emmy Awards in the US. Prime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store, which has moved dramatically beyond its early days as a bookseller.\nAmazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38 percent from a year earlier.",

      "text": "The 2016 Guide to Amazon Sponsored Products \nTactics and Insights for Third-Party Sellers to Advance their Advertising Strategy Amazon Enhanced Brand Content Now Available to Third Party Sellers Posted by Tara Johnson on November 17, 2016 in Amazon \nAmazon is now offering Enhanced Brand Content (EBC) , a version of A+ detail pages for Third Party Brand Sellers at no additional cost, for a limited period of time. \nEnhanced Brand Content , also known as EBC was first spotted by CPC Strategy’s Marketplace Channel Analyst – Jordan Gisch (as seen below): \n\n\nThe feature (commonly referred to as A+ tool ) enables Brand Owner sellers to modify the product description field of their branded ASINs. EBC allows 3Ps to describe their product features in a different way by including a unique brand story , enhanced images , and text placements. \nEBC can also be used to answer the most common customer questions by providing relevant product details that help drive more rapid purchase decisions and may reduce the likelihood of having products returned. \nAccording to Amazon, adding EBC to your product detail pages may result in higher conversion rates , increased traffic , and increased sales when used effectively. \nAs seen in the template screenshot below, Enhanced Brand Content offers different module types in comparison with A+ Content for Vendors (which you can learn more about in our recent blog post ). \n\n\nEBC is open to sellers who have been approved as brand owners through Amazon’s Brand Registry process . Once approved as a brand owner, sellers will qualify to add EBC to ASINs that are part of their approved brand catalog, but cannot add content to ASINs that are not part of their brand. How will Enhanced Brand Content (EBC) Impact Amazon’s Third Party Brand Sellers? \n“One of the most immediate impacts that Enhanced Brand Content will have for 3P Sellers in the Brand Registry program is the benefit to paid advertising conversion rates,” Pat Petriello , Head of Marketplace Strategy at CPC Strategy said. \n“Take, for example, a 3P brand manufacturer selling high quality premium sunglasses and advertising through Sponsored Products during the holiday season. With Enhanced Brand Content, that Seller has increased ability to showcase the unique value proposition of their products such as polarization, mirroring, contrast, transition, lens treatments, and so on.” \n“They will also have the option to differentiate their brand from that of their competitors by communicating their brand story through the Enhanced Brand Content fields.” \n“As a result, this Seller will be able to turn more of their advertising clicks into conversions , effectively increasing the ROAS on their ad spend and reducing ACOS.” \n“With increased advertising spend over the holiday shopping season, the ability to maximize the return through Enhanced Brand Content is a real win for 3P brands .” What Third Party Brand Sellers Should Know About Enhanced Brand Content (EBC): Accessibility & Requirements \nThis tool is currently open to Brand Registered sellers , so you must register your brand with Amazon Brand Registry . Brand Registry is not open for media, video, digital, or book categories. Amazon is rolling out the new feature over a period of time, so it’s likely not all eligible Sellers are seeing this immediately (stay tuned). Fees / Cost \nThe tool is currently in a promotional free period where sellers will not be charged a fee. When a fee is implemented – a seller’s existing content will remain on the detail page. We anticipate Amazon EBC will not be free forever & sellers are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunity sooner rather than later. Submission \nEBC submissions will either be published or rejected with necessary revisions outlined in the rejection reason within 7 days of submission ; however, most content is processed within 2 days. \nYou can publish content to all ASINs that you own as a Global Catalog Identifier (GCID) registered brand owner, and have an offer for. If the ASIN has ever had a contribution published by a retail vendor, the content will not be published. Amazon’s system currently allows sellers to have 20 pending submissions at one time . \nPro-Tip: Amazon EBC does not allow HTML content. Video \nAt this time, Amazon does not have self­-service access to video uploads , but as an agency – we anticipate that feature will be coming soon. Any new features will be announced to all registered brand owners so ensure your brand is registered to receive these updates. \nPro-Tip: Keep in mind EBC is not the same as Amazon Business Enhanced Content. Amazon Business Enhanced Content tool lets you upload separate file documents to the detail page. The EBC tool lets you enhance your product description with additional rich media assets. Violations \nIf 3Ps include the following type of content, it will result in violations and will lead to a rejection by Amazon’s system: \n1. Referencing your company as a seller or distributor, or providing any company contact information. 2. Mention of competitor’s products or seller authorization such as “product only sold by authorized resellers,” etc. 3. Pricing or promotion information such as “cheapest widget on Amazon” etc. 4. Information about shipping details such as “Free shipping”, “shipping timelines”, etc. 5. Use of copyright, trademark, or registered symbols in the text or images. 6. Boastful comments such as “top selling product,” “hottest item,” “#1 Selling item”. 7. Time sensitive product information: “on sale now” or “best new product of the year”. 8. Information about customer reviews from Amazon or any other site. 9. Adding editorial or 3rd party quotes from external sources such as magazines and television shows. 10. Blurry or low quality images or images containing unreadable text. 11. Lifestyle images not showing the product. Brand images used to tell the “Brand Story” are not required to contain the product. 12. Content that duplicates many of the images from the main image block on the detail page. 13. Any warranties or guarantees of any form. 14. Images or text that attempts to mimic Amazon logos, detail page headings or details. 15. Logos from brands or organizations other than your own, or multiple brand logos on an image. 16. Web links or language attempting to redirect to other sites inside or outside of Amazon (including your other products). 17. Grammatical errors, punctuation errors, misspellings, strings of all caps text, or abusing font features – Bold and Italics are only intended to be used to highlight headings or a few select words. 18. Any mention of products being used for criminal activity. 19. Any violations to category requirements or Selling on Amazon policies. \nFor more on Enhanced Brand Content, email tara@cpcstrategy.com",

      "text": "Pin Shares 3 Amazon launched Amazon Prime subscription service in India in July this year and stated that the Prime Video service will hit country soon. Now, it looks like Amazon is all set to launch its video streaming service globally to take on Netflix. Amazon Prime Video is currently available in only five countries, the U.S, UK, Germany, Austria and Japan. At present, only one show “The Grand Tour”, the remake of popular British motor show Top Gear is available for streaming. Meanwhile, promoting the show, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has dropped a heavy hint that the Prime Video service will be expanded globally in more than 200 countries including India next month. In September, Amazon teamed up with Dharma Productions to stream films and upcoming new releases. The company has also partnered with Vishesh Films. Amazon also singed a deal with SS Rajamouli, Graphic India and Arka Mediaworks for a multi-episode animated series titled – Baahubali: The Lost Legends based on the popular movie Baahubali, which will premiere first on Amazon Prime Video India in 2017. Netflix debuted the Indian market at the beginning of this year along with 128 other countries at a starting price of Rs. 500 for the US-based popular TV shows and movies. Amazon Prime Video subscription for a year is available at just $79 instead of $99 only for today in the U.S. Amazon is slowly expanding its services worldwide, giving a tough competition to other video streaming services, especially Netflix. It will be interesting to see how Amazon Prime Video kicks off when it will be launched globally in December. Stay tuned for more updates!",

      "text": "Amazon Launches Alexa-Only Pre-Black Friday Deals  19 PST \nAlexa is Amazon’s voice assistant platform and we know that they are looking to push it to as many users as they can. Given that Google Now/Google Assistant, Siri, and Cortana have had a head start, we can understand Amazon’s urge. Now it seems that Amazon is trying to get users to use Alexa as much as possible by announcing Alexa-only pre-Black Friday deals. \nBasically if you own the Echo, Echo Dot, Tap, Fire TV or the Fire HD tablet, which are devices that have Alexa integrated into them, you will be able to ask the voice assistant to list you what deals are available. Note that these are exclusive to Prime members and only available through Alexa, which means if you are a Prime member but don’t own an Alexa-capable device and vice versa, you won’t be able to take part in it. \nSome of the deals that Alexa will list includes getting an Amazon Tap for $79 which is $50 off the regular price. It’s a bit ironic that you need an Echo/Tap device with Alexa to qualify for this, but in case you ever needed one more unit, it’s there. There will also be discounts off the Sphero Star Wars BB-8 droid, the Philips Hue LED Start Kit, and limited edition Beyerdynamic headphones. \nFiled in General > Shopping .

      "text": "How the FCC fast-tracked its journey to the cloud \nYou would think that Amazon Web Services would have chilled out in the month before its big Re:Invent conference. After all, that show, which takes place at the end of November, is when the cloud provider typically shows off a bonanza of new products and features. \nBut Christmas has come early in October, at least for people who are looking to run hybrid cloud deployments with AWS. Here's the rundown of important news you may have missed. VMware and Amazon team up \nThe big bombshell for the month was a partnership between AWS and VMware . The latter company is going to launch a managed service that will make it easy for users to migrate workloads from on-premises hardware to the public cloud and back again, using VMware's vSphere management software. \nIt's a move that will also make it easier for businesses to try out hybrid cloud configurations with a single control plane that administrators are already familiar with from managing their current infrastructure. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy looked like a cat who had just swallowed a canary sitting on stage next to VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger during a San Francisco press event to announce the partnership. But both men seemed like they got something important out of the deal. Amazon gets a hybrid cloud strategy, while VMware gets a way to easily integrate its products with a leading cloud provider — and probably make a whole bunch of money in the process. \nRight now, it's in closed beta, expected to launch next year. A new service helps move workloads to the cloud \nBut what if you don't want to use VMware's managed service? AWS has a Server Migration Service that's supposed to help lift and shift workloads. To use it, administrators install a connector that will analyze their virtualized server environment and collect information about the instances they’re using. \nAfter that, they can use the AWS Management Console to replicate those instances up to the cloud as Amazon Machine Images stored in the AWS Elastic Block Store service. After that, admins can spin up what should be a replica of the same instance running on-premises in AWS. The x1.16xlarge arrives for big, but not huge workloads \nSometimes, you just need a stupendously massive hunk of compute power. That's what the x1.32xlarge instance offers -- 128 virtual CPU cores, 1952GiB of RAM and 2 1920GB SSDs. (1 GiB is roughly equivalent to 1.074GB.) \nIt's among the most expensive compute instances Amazon offers and has been useful for customers looking to run applications like SAP HANA. \nBut what about customers who want half the power? Amazon's swooping in with the appropriately named x1.16xlarge , which sports (you guessed it) 64 vCPU cores, 976GiB of RAM, and one 1920GB SSD. It's priced at half the cost of its larger sibling. \nBoth of those instance types are also now available in Amazon's Mumbai, Seoul and US GovCloud regions, in addition to the seven other regions worldwide that also run x1 instances. AWS opens for business in Ohio \nGeographic expansion is the name of the game for cloud providers, and AWS pushed its data center footprint forward with the launch of a new US-East region based in Ohio . It's part of a one-two punch of cloud regions available in the eastern part of America, alongside Amazon's longstanding US-East region based in Virginia. \nAt launch, the region supports a wide variety of AWS services, including EC2, Elastic Block Store, Aurora, DynamoDB, Snowball, Kinesis and Lambda. Netflix's former architect goes to work at its preferred cloud provider \nAdrian Cockroft made a name for himself as a Cloud Architect at Netflix and then as a Technical Fellow at Battery Ventures. The soft-spoken Brit was a fixture at cloud conferences, and he's now been pulled into Amazon's orbit as its VP of Cloud Infrastructure. \nAWS CTO Werner Vogels said in a blog post that Cockroft will be working with product teams, consulting with customers about their cloud architecture, and helping out open-source communities.

Amazon is a major presence in online retail overseas, with the United Kingdom, German and Japan being its largest non-U.S. markets. (Photo: Michel spingler, AP) \nQ: I heard that I could set up my own online store for products that someone else is selling on Amazon. Is that a real thing? \nA: You are probably talking about the Amazon Associates program. You sign up for the program, you create a blog or website, and then you help market products sold on Amazon. It’s free to join, and you make a percentage of the final sale. Ideally, you will vet the products that are being sold. My son recently purchased a pair of counterfeit sneakers on Amazon. Be careful selecting products to promote. Click here for a list of counterfeit products found for sale on Amazon . \nQ: For the past few months, I’ve noticed those “Public Record Search” ads everywhere. I think I live a boring life, but should I be concerned? \nA: What these sites do is quickly search and aggregate public records. You can find rap sheets, marriage certificates, previous addresses, and many other bits of information that most folks prefer not to volunteer. Most people have no reason to pay for a subscription, but these sites can be helpful when you’re suspicious of someone you don’t know very well. Before you pay, do your own research. Click here for seven ways to do a free background check online . \nQ: I’m a web designer, and I’ve always worked full-time for specific companies. I was thinking of offering my services for a freelance site like Fiverr, but I’m intimidated. Do these really work? \nA: Freelancing is adventurous and scary, and the only way to start is to dive in. Keep in mind sites like Fiverr connect contractors and clients who would never have met in years past, and many of the reviews have been good. Provided you have a non-binding contract that permits side-gigs, this could be a fun and lucrative move. But prepare yourself: Freelancing is a lot of work, especially if you’re used to being a full-time employee, and there aren’t many safety nets. Be choosy about your projects; freelancers get taken advantage of all the time. If you do decide to get another full-time position, click here for ten tech skills that are actually worth listing on your resume . \nQ: I recently posted a Craigslist ad for my motorcycle. But I’ve been getting all these messages accusing me of being a scammer. What did I do wrong? \nA: I would have to see the ad to be sure, but many listings raise red flags, even when they’re legitimate. Just remember that Craigslist is crawling with misleading advertisers, so people are on high alert. If you’re selling something, make sure to have a clear, high-res photograph. Include as much relevant information as you can such as year, make, and model, plus the vehicle’s mileage and the condition. I do not recommend listing your phone number or email address, but make sure the “reply” button is working. Try to imitate a listing for a motorcycle that you would trust. And if you’ve done all these things, remember that Craigslist attracts a lot of trolls, too. \nQ: I finally terminated my contract with a telephone service provider. The experience was miserable and I never want to see another contract. What are my options? \nA: Service providers have begun phasing out contracts, which is a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, there are no strict rules, no automatic renewals, and no elaborate termination steps. Then again, some people have to buy their expensive smartphones outright, where once they were heavily discounted. Until recently, your only options were to pay in advance with companies like T-Mobile or Cricket. These services have improved considerably in recent years and include a wide range of smartphones, although the services are usually geared toward short-term or low-income customers. The newest trend is for companies to lease expensive phones to their customers. Click here to figure out whether you should buy or rent your next phone . \nHave a question you need answered?

      "text": "Amazon Web Services is bringing on five new solar farms to help power its massive cloud data centers. The new solar facilities, all in Virginia, will bring 180 megawatts of power onto the grid by the end of next year, the company announced late Thursday. Those new facilities, along with Amazon’s existing plants, are expected to provide 580 megawatts hours (MWh) of energy annually.\nFour of the farms are rated at 20 megawatts in capacity, while the fifth is a 100-megawatt facility. They are scattered across several Virginia counties. Why this state? For one thing, Amazon’s amzn largest and oldest, data center farm is located outside of Washington D.C. in Virginia.\nFor context, 100 megawatts of electricity could power nearly 19,000 homes for a year.\nAmazon amzn already fields an existing 80-megawatt facility in Virginia. Developers Virginia Solar LLC and Community Energy Solar worked on the projects and will own and operate them in conjunction with Richmond-based Dominion Resources \nRunning massive data centers packed with servers, storage, and networking--even if the equipment sports the most energy-efficient designs--takes lots of power, which is why Amazon, Microsoft msft , Facebook fb , Apple aapl and others are always on the lookout for renewable, sustainable power sources (and are eager to publicize them.)\nFor more on solar power, watch \nA few years ago, Amazon and other tech powers took some, er, heat a few years from Greenpeace for not doing enough to cultivate sustainable energy or for disclosing exactly how much power they use in their data centers. In 2014, AWS committed to using renewable energy for 100% of its power needs , although it did not set any deadline for that goal.\nLast month, the company said it expects to exceed another goal--40% renewable energy by the end of this year and 50% by the end of 2017.\nAmazon says it has signed contracts for more renewable energy capacity this year than any U.S. company. Microsoft, which just days ago announced its biggest wind energy commitment ever , is second on that list.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nCombined, Amazon’s six solar farms are expected to generate more than 580,000 MWh of energy per year which, the company claims, makes it the largest corporate backer of solar projects east of the Mississippi.\nIn its statement, AWS said it has backed 10 renewable energy projects in the United States that will deliver 2.6 MWh of electricity to the grid that powers data center farms in Ohio and Virginia. That’s enough to power 240,000 homes, the company said.\nAmazon also will start operating a 280-megawatt wind farm in North Carolina by the end of this year.\n ",

      "title": "Amazon taps merchants for warehouse space",
      "text": "Amazon.com Inc. is turning to merchants who sell on its marketplace for extra warehouse space, a less-costly way to expand inventory available for quick delivery.\nInventory available for delivery within two business days expanded by 6 million items under the Seller Fulfilled Prime program, the company announced Thursday. Amazon earlier this year introduced the program, which lets independent merchants sell goods on Amazon as “Prime Eligible” even if Amazon isn’t handling packaging and delivery.\nIt’s the latest sign the world’s biggest online retailer can’t build facilities quickly enough to meet demand for an ever-expanding assortment of goods that customers want delivered fast and free. Warehouse capacity issues and the cost of new facilities helped increase Amazon’s spending on order fulfillment 34 percent in the third quarter. The big expenses caused the Seattle-based company to miss analysts’ profit projections, driving down shares 8.8 percent since the results were reported Oct. 27.\nAmazon’s revenue is projected to increase 28 percent to $137 billion this year, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The growth prompted the company to accelerate its warehouse building spree, with more than 15 fulfillment centers opening in California, Texas, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida that will collectively employ more than 12,000 workers.\nIn addition to adding capacity, Amazon introduced Seller Fulfilled Prime to take advantage of the warehouse space of its merchant partners. Amazon sells its own inventory as well as products owned by merchants who give the company a cut of each sale.\n",

      "text": "Amazon will stream original series The Grand Tour, hosted by Jeremy Clarkson and his former Top Gear on-air colleagues James May and Richard Hammond, in more than 20 countries, even though its video services are currently only available in a few markets.\nClarkson & Co. unveiled the news in a YouTube video on Wednesday, ahead of the show's Friday launch to Amazon Prime subscribers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan.\nThey said they received an Amazon package and letter saying the show will become available in more than 200 countries in the coming weeks. \"When the GT launches worldwide, everyone will be able to catch up on the show … to date and then get a brand new episode every Friday on Amazon,\" the letter said.\nThe company didn't immediately explain if the show will be an early experiment for rolling out its video service globally or if such a global launch, similar to Netflix's at the start of the year, was imminent. Asked about a possible global launch, a representative reiterated that The Grand Tour would stream in more than 200 countries, but added: \"We don't have anything else to announce.\"\n\"Amazon is committed to bringing Prime members programming that is unique and exciting,\" said Conrad Riggs, head of unscripted for Amazon Originals. \"We are thrilled to bring back together the world's beloved hosting team of Clarkson, Hammond and May for extraordinary adventures that can only be seen on Amazon Prime Video.\"\nRead more: Former 'Top Gear' Hosts' Amazon Series Gets Launch Date",

      "title": "Huawei MediaPad tablets available on Amazon before 2016 ends",
      "text": "If you live Stateside and have only been waiting for the latest MediaPad tablets, good news because the MediaPad M3, T1 7.0, and T1 10.0 models are readily available from Amazon. The top e-commerce website is bringing Huawei’s newest Android tablets with great specs and affordable price tags.\nPerhaps that most anticipated among the products ready is the MediaPad M3 that boasts of an 8.4-inch display screen, 2500 x 1600 pixel resolution, octa-core processor, 4GB RAM, 32GB onboard storage, and a 5100mAh battery. For only $299, you will receive this device with a metal body build, four speakers, and a fingerprint scanner. Tablet runs Emotion UI 4.1 and Android 6.0 Marshmallow.\nApart from the M3, there’s also the Huawei M2 and the MediaPad T1 models both schedule to be released before 2016 ends. The $349 M2 comes equipped with a 10.1-inch screen, 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution, HiSilicon Kirin 930 processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB onboard storage, 13MP primary camera, 5MP selfie shooter, and a 6600mAh battery.Unfortunately, this one only runs based on Emotion UI 3.1 Android 5.1 Lollipop.\nThe Huawei MediaPad T1 has two variants: a 7-inch and 9-6 inch models. The two are priced at $99 and $159, respectively. They’re low-powered and only runs Android 4.4 KitKat so we can’t say either one is recommended.\nVIA: Amazon",

      "text": "The Grand Tour/Amazon \nOn Friday, November 18, Amazon is giving a 20% discount off its wildly popular Prime service, which gives free two-day shipping, as well as access to a library of video and music.\nPrime usually costs $99 dollars per year, but on Friday starting at 12:00 a.m. ET and ending at 11:59 p.m. PT, it will cost $79 for the year for new members.\nThe promotion coincides with the release of \"The Grand Tour,\" Amazon's new blockbuster  Jeremy Clarkson show, which even got a nod from competitor Netflix in its latest earnings report. \nHere's a quick summary of some of the best Prime perks: \nFree two-day shipping. Access to Prime Video, which houses \"t housands of movies and TV shows.\" These include both licensed titles and Amazon's original series like \"Transparent,\" \"The Man in the High Castle,\" \"Mozart in the Jungle,\" and so on. Access to Prime Music, which lets you stream \"more than two million\" songs. Photo storage via Prime Photos. Access to a library of ebooks via Prime Reading. While many people love Prime for the two-day shipping, Amazon has recently made a big commitment to supercharging its video offerings.\nAmazon is doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said in the most recent earnings call.  Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion. \nIt's also shelling out a whopping $160 million for a  new mafia drama starring Robert De Niro, who is snagging  $850,000 per episode, according to The Hollywood Reporter . \nAdditional reporting by Eugene Kim.  \nNOW WATCH: Here's what happens inside one of the most prestigious chocolate laboratories in the world \n",

      "title": "Amazon Spreads Its Tentacles Far Beyond 'World's Biggest Bookstore'",
      "text": "Amazon Spreads Its Tentacles Far Beyond 'World's Biggest Bookstore' (Dennis Nishi) Reprints \nA little more than 10 years ago, Amazon.com ( AMZN ) unveiled a service that business customers embraced because it saved them money, letting them pay only for the computing power and storage capacity they actually used, hosted on computers they didn't own but accessed via the internet. \nThis early experiment in cloud computing is now called Amazon Web Services. With more than 1 million users per month, AWS is expected to surpass $13 billion in 2016 sales. That puts it in a similar league in size and growth to all of Amazon in its first 11 years. \nAnd its parent company? This year, revenue will likely come in near $145 billion, and Amazon is reaching into new businesses of all kinds to keep its sales and share price growing. \nIn his letter to shareholders in April, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wrote that Amazon — which originally billed itself merely as \"the world's biggest bookstore\" — wants to be \"an invention machine.\" And so it's full throttle in such fields as delivery services (including deliveries via drones), computerized warehouses, online video and music services, tablets, personal digital assistants, and no doubt more arenas besides e-commerce and cloud services. Even physical stores are now part of the plan. \n\"Amazon is doing a marvelous job at becoming a bigger and bigger part of daily lives,\" Trip Miller, managing partner of hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, which holds a position in Amazon, told IBD. \"They want to be a one-stop shop for consumers. (They are) making it less likely customers will switch to another service.\" \nWinning big new markets is by no means assured, and Amazon's spending on its far-flung initiatives is immense, which already has created earnings disappointments. But Amazon's growth record so far speaks for itself. As Bezos put it, 20 years ago he was driving some boxes to the post office and thinking about forklifts. In a letter to shareholders a year later, Bezos wrote that online bookselling, and e-commerce in general, \"should prove to be a very large market.\" It did. \nThe No. 1 online seller posted revenue of $107 billion last year, 22 years after its founding, hitting the $100 billion mark quicker than any company. Its stock has surged roughly 320% over the past five years — and more than 1,900% in the last 10 years vs. 60% for the S&P 500. IBD'S TAKE: With a big jump over the past two years, Amazon.com shares took up residence on IBD Leaderboard , an exclusive list of the very top stocks near or at buy points. But the stock Leaders can change fast. Amazon fell 16% from Oct. 6, its all-time high, though Nov. 14, and it's off the board, at least for now. Investors should keep daily track of Leaderboard. \nBezos has said that both Amazon and AWS \"were planted as tiny seeds.\" Not every seedling will grow into a redwood, but Bezos says the goal for each seedling is annual sales of at least $1 billion. \nAWS leads its field though it faces a horde of big-name rivals that quickly caught on to Amazon's move, led by Microsoft ( MSFT ), IBM ( IBM ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ). \"Amazon Web Services is a major reason to own the stock,\" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which holds a position in Amazon. \nWhile Amazon shows a willingness to boldly experiment, some efforts have flopped. The biggest flop might be the Amazon Fire smartphone, now off the market. Echo, Alexa And The Digital Butler Business \nOther efforts produced unexpected hits, like the Echo — an in-home, voice-activated digital butler that plays music, reads books and provides traffic and weather, among other things. Teamed with Alexa, its voice and brains, the Echo smart speaker has grabbed a post position in the race to give the world the best and smartest digital assistant , another battle that pits tech's giants. \nAmazon won't say, but analysts estimate it's already sold some 4 million Echo speakers, at prices ranging from about $100 to $200. It's a product that further cements a user's attachment to Amazon. \n\"Amazon is not a simple company; there's a lot of moving parts,\" Synovus Trust's Morgan said. \"I still feel strong about what they are doing.\" \nThose parts include retail. Amazon reportedly plans to open dozens of small retail storefronts in shopping malls over the next year to showcase its hardware such as the Kindle and Echo. \nThe first Amazon physical bookstore opened last year in Seattle. Amazon has since opened bookstores in San Diego and Portland, Ore., with another one coming in Chicago. The bookstores also sell its hardware, reflecting Amazon's ongoing drive to reach consumers through a variety of channels. \nIt's also pushing deeper into the grocery business , which it entered in 2007 with the launch of the grocery delivery service Amazon Fresh. \n\"Groceries are a key part of our offerings to customers and we're playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs,\" Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said during the company's Q3 earnings conference call. \nAmazon plans to develop convenience stores as well as curbside pickup locations, the Wall Street Journal has reported , citing people familiar with the matter. Amazon apparently will let customers order groceries online and pick them up at a company facility, which could add billions in revenue , says Pacific Crest Securities, posing an increasing threat to No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart ( WMT ). Amazon Takes Aim At FedEx, UPS \nAnalysts also expect Amazon to become a force in the shipping business, competing with the likes of FedEx ( FDX ) and UPS ( UPS ). The company has announced the purchase of a fleet of trucks to ferry goods between its fulfillment centers. And Amazon has an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s from Air Transport Services Group ( ATSG ) to expedite delivery of goods. \n\"They're not afraid to invest and go outside the box,\" said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify Investments, which holds Amazon stock. \"And almost all of their initiatives have been very supportive of its core online retail focus.\" Amazon in August unveiled its first branded cargo plane, as the company builds its own air transportation network. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) \nOf its many ventures, Amazon Prime might be its biggest success. Launched in 2005, for $79 a year the loyalty program gave users free two-day shipping. The perks have steadily risen. The price, too, has risen, but just once, to $99 in 2014. \nAmazon Prime perks now include free access to Amazon streaming videos and commercial free music, free photo storage, free same-day shipping in 27 metro areas, exclusives on select offerings and more. Prime members spend on average about $2,500 a year on Amazon, vs. $550 for non-Prime members, according to Morgan Stanley data. \nAmazon won't say how many Prime members it has, but the figure is near 65 million members in the U.S., according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. \n\"Amazon loves to connect with customers in as many ways as possible,\" said Amplify's Magoon, \"and in that process they are creating a protective moat.\" Earnings Focus Not An Amazon Thing \nThese investments come with a cost. Amazon has been far from a profit-making machine. In 2014, in fact, it lost 52 cents a share despite revenue of nearly $89 billion. For the recent Q3, EPS tripled from the year-earlier quarter to 52 cents, but that missed Wall Street expectations by 26 cents. Amazon shares fell 5% the next day. Its EPS outlook for the current quarter also missed analyst expectations.\nIn Q3 operating expenses jumped 28% to $32.14 billion, with fulfillment and shipping costs jumping 34% to $4.34 billion as the company focused on improving its shipping times. \nIt opened 18 product fulfillment centers in the third quarter and will add a total of 26 fulfillment centers this year. The expansion is its biggest in four years, growing warehouse square footage by 30%, vs. a 20% increase in 2015. \nMoreover, Amazon says its investments in video content and related marketing expenses will nearly double in the second half of 2016 vs. the year-earlier period. \n\"So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment,\" said Olsavsky in the conference call. He said Amazon is also adding a lot of resources to Echo, as well as to expansion in India and in AWS. Analyst Price Targets For Amazon \nThe investments, says the company, will attract and retain more customers. Analysts at times grumble, but they generally agree. \n\"Seeing the large opportunities ahead, Amazon has decided to enter another large investment cycle, and strong investment is expected to continue in Q4,\" wrote Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, in a research note. \"We believe that this will better enable the company to produce strong top-line growth.\" \nSeyrafi rates Amazon stock outperform and has a price target of 875. Some analyst price targets go as high as 1000. Amazon is trading above 750. \n\"We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience,\" Olsavsky said on the Oct. 27 earnings call. \"We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient (and) as profitable as possible, while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line.\" \nRELATED:",

      "text": "print \nA scene from \"The Grand Tour.\" The Grand Tour/Amazon \nOn Friday, November 18, Amazon is giving a 20% discount off its wildly popular Prime service, which gives free two-day shipping, as well as access to a library of video and music. \nPrime usually costs $99 dollars per year, but on Friday starting at 12:00 a.m. ET and ending at 11:59 p.m. PT, it will cost $79 for the year for new members. \nThe promotion coincides with the release of \"The Grand Tour,\" Amazon's new blockbuster Jeremy Clarkson show, which even got a nod from competitor Netflix in its latest earnings report. \nHere's a quick summary of some of the best Prime perks: Free two-day shipping. Access to Prime Video, which houses \"t housands of movies and TV shows.\" These include both licensed titles and Amazon's original series like \"Transparent,\" \"The Man in the High Castle,\" \"Mozart in the Jungle,\" and so on. Access to Prime Music, which lets you stream \"more than two million\" songs. Photo storage via Prime Photos. Access to a library of ebooks via Prime Reading. \nWhile many people love Prime for the two-day shipping, Amazon has recently made a big commitment to supercharging its video offerings. \nAmazon is doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said in the most recent earnings call. Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion. \nIt's also shelling out a whopping $160 million for a new mafia drama starring Robert De Niro, who is snagging $850,000 per episode, according to The Hollywood Reporter . \nAdditional reporting by Eugene Kim. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": " 45   \nMILAN (Nov 18): Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with US internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online at prices up to a third cheaper than available elsewhere. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models — the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that online customers will be able to buy vehicles at a price that is up to a third cheaper than other available promotions. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97% still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalise their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. Related Articles",

      "title": "Amazon Takes Its Netflix Rivalry Global With 'Grand Tour'",
      "text": "Amazon ( AMZN ) said Thursday that it will expand its video streaming to more than 200 countries, ratcheting up the competition with Netflix ( NFLX ).\nAmazon, which currently streams only in a few markets, announced on its website that it would launch \"The Grand Tour\" worldwide in December.\n\"The Grand Tour launches in the UK, US, Germany, Austria and Japan this Friday, 18 November. In December, the show will premiere in 200 countries and territories around the world, exclusively on Amazon.\"\nCEO Jeff Bezos also tweeted about the global launch.\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016\nNetflix airs in some 190 countries, with China the only major holdout.\nThe global reach comes with complications. Amazon may only have the rights to air third-party content in specific markets, and would have to extra to expand. That provides yet another incentive for Amazon and rivals to develop in-house programming. Also, outside of rich nations, users may lack the high-speed broadband or the income to get streaming TV.\nStill, the move shows that Netflix continues to lose its special status. Once the only major streaming service provider, it faces growing competition at home from Amazon and Hulu, which plans to launch a live streaming TV service in 2017, in addition to its original and third-party content.\nHulu is co-owned by Walt Disney ( DIS ), NBCUniversal parent Comcast ( CMCSA ), 21st Century Fox ( FOXA ) and Time Warner ( TWX ). Time Warner owns HBO, and has agreed to a takeover by AT&T ( T ), which recently acquired DirecTV.\nAnd those media and entertainment giants are moving aggressively to a digital world.\nNetflix, which was up slightly, closed down 0.1% on the stock market today after the Amazon news spread. Amazon rose 1.3%, as its continues to rally after finding support near its 200-day line on Monday.",

      "text": "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online at prices up to a third cheaper than available elsewhere. \nInitially, only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models--the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy’s biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n“The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world’s seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that online customers will be able to buy vehicles at a price that is up to a third cheaper than other available promotions. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97% still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. ",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nRafi Letzter/Tech Insider\nOn Friday, November 18, Amazon is slashing the price of a Prime membership by $20. Regular Insider Picks readers know we're big fans of Amazon Prime . We use it for everything .\nPrime normally costs $99 dollars per year, but on Friday starting at 12:00 a.m. ET and ending at 11:59 p.m. PT, it will cost $79 for the year for new members .\nWhile the deal is happening as a promotion for Prime Video’s new show “The Grand Tour” starring “Top Gear” presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, there's really no better time to sign up for Prime than right now, as the two biggest shopping holidays of the year are fast approaching.\nChances are, if you've made a few purchases through Amazon before, you know the basic perks of becoming an Amazon Prime member :\nFor a yearly fee, you get free two-day shipping and early access to lightning deals and other Amazon discounts. If you’re a regular Amazon shopper, that annual fee is a solid investment that will not only give you early access to this month's Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, but also make your future shopping experiences more pleasant.\nBelow, we’ve detailed some of the lesser-known perks to being a Prime member. You can check out the details of this one-day-only offer here .\nView As: One Page Slides Free same-day shipping Amazon As mentioned above, one of the most well known perks of being a Prime member is that you get free two-day shipping on all purchases. What you may not know is that in some cities, you'll have access to free same-day delivery .\nSame-day delivery is currently available in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Fresno, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Louisville, Milwaukee, Nashville, New York City, North & Central New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh, Richmond, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle/Tacoma, Stockton, Tampa Bay Area, Tucson, and Washington, D.C., with more cities to be added to the list soon.\nAnd if you're not lucky enough to live in one of those cities, two-day delivery is still pretty good.\nPrime Now Amazon If same-day delivery isn't fast enough for you, and you live in one of the metro areas listed below, Prime members also have access to the Prime Now app , which provides free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items, and the option of one-hour delivery if you want to pay a flat fee of $7.99.\nWhether you're in need of gifts, groceries, or meal delivery, Prime Now can get your goods to your door faster than ever before.\nPrime Now is currently available in Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles & Orange County, Miami, Minneapolis & St. Paul, Nashville, New York City, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh, Richmond, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle & Eastside, and Virginia Beach.\nPrime Video Amazon Prime Video is one of the fastest growing aspects of Amazon Prime. The streaming service is making a play to compete with the likes of Netflix and Hulu, and is doing a good job at it judging by the past two years of awards seasons. With Emmy-winning original series \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" on its roster, in addition to a large library of shows and movies, Prime Video is quickly becoming a must-have for anyone who has cut their cable cord.\nShowtime and Starz at a discount Amazon/Screenshot In addition to access to Prime Video, being a Prime member also gives you the opportunity to subscribe to some premium channels at a discount , including Starz and Showtime . With more and more networks switching to the \"a la carte\" method of subscription, it's likely that an even wider array of channels will soon be available.\nPrime Music Amazon/Screenshot For anyone not yet committed to Spotify or Tidal, or are simply tired of paying that monthly subscription cost, Prime Music provides a cheaper alternative. While their library is a bit smaller than the aforementioned services, it's still a sizable catalog that will contain most of what you are looking for. If you're not a diehard music fan and simply need a way to get tunes on your devices, Prime Music can help you save that monthly fee you're sending to Spotify every month.\nKindle Lending Library Amazon Amazon Prime also gives you access to the Kindle Lending Library , allowing you to rent one book for free every month. It's a great way to keep your reading list fresh without breaking the bank.\nPrime Reading Amazon One of the newest perks of being a Prime member is Prime Reading. . While the Kindle Lending Library is great, if you don't have a Kindle you're sort of left out of the reading party. Prime Reading makes a wide selection of books, magazines, and short stories available to all Prime members without the use of a Kindle device. Instead, you can simply download the Kindle app to whichever tablet or phone you have and get right to reading.\nPrime Audible Channels Amazon Not only will your Prime membership give you plenty to read, with the new Audible Channels feature, it also will give you access to a ton of short-form storytelling and audiobooks through the Audible app. Whether you're looking for short fiction, news, comedy, conversations, or classic novels read by the likes of Scarlett Johansson and Elijah Wood, you're sure to find something here to fill your earbuds during your next commute .\nBig discounts on the latest video games Amazon Another great additional deal for Prime members is a 20% discount on all new video games for the first two weeks of their release, as well as any preorders you might make. If you're an avid gamer, you might make back the $99 Prime subscription with discounts here alone.\nPrime Pantry Amazon/Screenshot Prime Pantry will deliver groceries and household goods straight to your door, saving you from the struggle of a weekly trip to the store. Fill up your box online and pay a flat rate of $5.99 per box.\nUnlimited photo storage Amazon Yet another one of the lesser known features of a Prime membership: unlimited photo storage . If you like to take as many photos as your digital camera can allow and are a bit of a photography hoarder (don't worry, you're not alone), Prime will give you access to Amazon cloud storage , where you'll be able to upload photos from your phone or computer and be able to access them whenever you want.\nSave $20 on your year-long subscription to Amazon Prime here. Or start your free month here.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

      "text": "MILAN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online at prices up to a third cheaper than available elsewhere.\nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L.\nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to.\n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference.\nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that online customers will be able to buy vehicles at a price that is up to a third cheaper than other available promotions.\nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer.\nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalise their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. (Reporting by Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "title": "Amazon’s ‘The Grand Tour’ Leaves ‘Top Gear’ in the Dust, British TV Critics Say",
      "text": "Courtesy of Amazon  57AM PT \n“ The Grand Tour ,” the new auto show from the former hosts of “ Top Gear ,” Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, premiered on Amazon Prime Video Friday, and the British press love it. \nThe Guardian’s Sam Wollaston acknowledged that the big-budget — reported to be £160 million ($197 million) across 36 episodes, or $5.5 million an episode – is up on the screen. \nHe marvels at the opening sequence, in which a “Mad Max” convoy of cars, trucks and bikes travels across the California desert to a surreal concert. “It is, undeniably, a brilliant beautiful spectacle,” Wollaston says. \nThe spectacle and new format points (such as replacing The Stig with The American as the test driver) aside, the core appeal that made the BBC’s “Top Gear” the most watched reality show in the world, remains. “It’s all utterly familiar,” he says. “You can pour something into a different container, but it still tastes the same. And, like it or not, this tastes of Clarkson, Hammond and May.” \nThe same questionable humor and aversion to political correctness that got the three guys into hot water at the BBC is evident here. The new test track is shaped like the Ebola virus, so it’s called the Eboladrome. Referring to the itinerant nature of show, Clarkson says: “We’re going to be like Gypsies. Only the cars we drive are going to be insured.” \nClarkson is unrepentant. He comments, “It’s very unlikely I’m going to be fired now, because we’re on the internet, which means I could pleasure a horse.” \nThe Daily Telegraph’s Ed Power too focuses on the strange marriage of Hollywood-style production values and British middle-aged male banter. “The real question was whether Clarkson, May and Hammond could reprise the chemistry that made ‘Top Gear’ an international sensation,” Power writes. The answer is an emphatic “yes.” “From a Hollywood introduction to three wrinkly blokes trading good-natured insults, ‘The Grand Tour’ was certainly covering all its bases.” \nPower goes on to point out that the hosts have not forgotten that “The Grand Tour” is at heart a show about motor vehicles, with the first episode including a trip to Portugal for a race between a Porsche 918, a McLaren P1 and a Ferrari LaFerrari. \nAs with all British papers, the Telegraph refers at length to the rivalry with the BBC’s revamped “Top Gear,” generally considered a failure under new hosts Chris Evans, who quit after one season, and Matt LeBlanc, who remains. “Petrolheads can rejoice. The BBC may wonder how Matt LeBlanc and whoever joins him next year can possibly compete,” the Telegraph concludes. \nThe Sun’s Dan Wootton is awestruck, and again focuses on the twin charms of top-notch production values and boyish banter. \n“A £160 million investment has made ‘The Grand Tour’ one of the most exhilarating TV series ever — and I don’t even like cars,” he writes. Wootton reassures the audience that despite the glitz, the grumpy old men remain unreconstructed. “If you thought the trademark banter that made ‘Top Gear’ such a phenomenon was gone for good, there was no need to worry,” he says. “Within seconds of taking the stage, the put-downs begin flying with Hammond describing Clarkson as ‘a shaved ape in a shirt.’” \nDespite the high-octane elements, “guns, explosions, super yachts, madcap stunts …. dramatic crashes, a sinking ship and Hammond being dangled from a chopper,” Wootton concludes, “the one thing that really matters is Clarkson being reunited with his two mates on screen.” \nJim Shelley for the Daily Mail questions whether the show is really “new,” unless you were labeling it the “new ‘Top Gear.’” \n“It was ‘vintage Top Gear’ too, ‘a futuristic Top Gear’ (‘Top Gear filmed in 4K’), ‘the American Top Gear,’ and more like ‘the Return of Top Gear’ than Chris Evans’ recent horrible, hollow, imitation of the original,” Shelley writes. \nHe underscores the similarities with the BBC show, “the same juvenile obsession with speed, same outlandish (stupid) stunts, exotic locations, banter with the audience, race-track and test driver…” \nRather than lambasting the hosts for this, he applauds them. “They were canny and confident enough to resist the temptation of being different for the sake of it, contenting themselves with being themselves instead,” he writes. \nShelley concludes that the departure from the BBC, and the period of rest that followed has been for the best. “After all that time away it was good to see them back – not necessarily where they belonged but bigger, better, and more badly behaved than ever.” Filed Under:",

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | November 18, 2016 : 10:45 PM MYT Translated by Google Translator: Translated by Google Translator: \nMILAN (Nov 18): Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with US internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online at prices up to a third cheaper than available elsewhere. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models — the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that online customers will be able to buy vehicles at a price that is up to a third cheaper than other available promotions. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97% still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalise their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. Related Articles",

      "text": "Alexa offers steep, exclusive deals in Amazon's first 'voice shopping weekend' Amazon kicking off holiday shopping with an Alexa-powered, shop-by-voice weekend. Contributor, TechHive | November 18, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Michael Brown 36% off NETGEAR AC750 WiFi Range Extender - Deal Alert \nAmazon is getting a jump on the holiday shopping craze with an all-Alexa weekend. The online retailer just announced its first “voice shopping weekend.” Prime members can use an Amazon Echo , Echo Dot, Amazon Tap , Amazon Fire HD tablet, or Amazon Fire TV to ask, “Alexa, what are your deals?” \nAlexa will then tell you about Amazon’s deals for that day. If you like what you hear, you can then tell Alexa to order the item. \nThe sale begins on Friday, November 18 and lasts through November 21. Amazon says there will be more Alexa-only deals throughout the holidays. Anyone who wants to can peruse the deals on Amazon’s website , but ordering the items at the sale price requires a Prime membership and an Alexa-enabled device. Amazon says shopping with Alexa also requires Prime members to have 1-click enabled. Mentioned in this article Amazon Echo Dot (2nd generation) View on Amazon It's a win-win: The least-expensive digital voice assistant you can put in your smart home is also one of the best. But add a speaker if you want it to play music. \nThe story behind the story: While Alexa’s deals sounds great, careful shoppers will want to beware especially when Amazon’s intelligent assistant is offering discounts on big ticket items. One current deal, for example, is $80 off a 32-inch Samsung 1080p TV—okay, the deal is actually $78 off but who’s counting? Anyway, that sounds like a good deal, and checking out that Samsung model on Amazon and other sites shows that it usually sells for about $197. Prime members using this particular Alexa deal, meanwhile, can get it for $119. Not bad for a budget-priced television, but that’s just one deal. It pays to check \nBefore buying large items it’s always best to see just how good the deal really is. Most of these deals will still be there a few minutes later so there’s no rush. All you need to do is check the model on Amazon’s Alexa deals page and see what the price is on other sites. Amazon is usually pretty good about sale prices, but we're entering Black Friday territory, where many discounts are anything but. \nIf you’re a Prime member wishing for an Alexa device, Amazon has a second reason to start using its digital assistant. AT&T announced it will support sending text messages from an Amazon Echo device such as our favorite the Echo Dot .

      "text": "print A scene from \"The Grand Tour.\" The Grand Tour/Amazon \nOn Friday, November 18, Amazon is giving a 20% discount off its wildly popular Prime service , which gives free two-day shipping, as well as access to a library of video and music. \nPrime usually costs $99 dollars per year, but on Friday starting at 12:00 a.m. ET and ending at 11:59 p.m. PT, it will cost $79 for the year for new members . \nThe promotion coincides with the release of \"The Grand Tour,\" Amazon's new blockbuster Jeremy Clarkson show, which even got a nod from competitor Netflix in its latest earnings report. \nHere's a quick summary of some of the best Prime perks: Free two-day shipping. Access to Prime Video, which houses \"t housands of movies and TV shows.\" These include both licensed titles and Amazon's original series like \"Transparent,\" \"The Man in the High Castle,\" \"Mozart in the Jungle,\" and so on. Access to Prime Music, which lets you stream \"more than two million\" songs. Photo storage via Prime Photos. Access to a library of ebooks via Prime Reading. \nWhile many people love Prime for the two-day shipping, Amazon has recently made a big commitment to supercharging its video offerings. \nAmazon is doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said in the most recent earnings call. Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion. \nIt's also shelling out a whopping $160 million for a new mafia drama starring Robert De Niro, who is snagging $850,000 per episode, according to The Hollywood Reporter . \nAdditional reporting by Eugene Kim. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": "0 Amazon & Fiat Amazon \nFiat e Amazon siglano un accordo che consentirà agli utenti di \"acquistare\" una vettura della casa italiana sul noto sito di e-commerce. Il virgolettato è d'obbligo perché in realtà non stiamo parlando di un vero e proprio acquisto attraverso la piattaforma online ma di una serie di promozioni raggiungibile esclusivamente attraverso la piattaforma online. L'acquisto della vettura deve essere sempre formalizzato presso un concessionario . \nL'auto la compro online? \nIn cosa consiste effettivamente questo accordo tra Amazon e Fiat? L'utente accedendo al pagina Amazon online dedicata ha la possibilità di opzionare una serie di vetture del gruppo Fiat. Le vetture presenti su Amazon e aderenti all'offerta sono le seguenti: Fiat 500 , Fiat 500 Cabrio, Fiat 500 L e Fiat Panda . Il cliente, una volta scelta una vettura tra quelle sopra indicate ha la possibilità di acquistare un \"pacchetto\"- la definizione specifica è Welcome Kit- che costa 180,00 euro . Il cliente inserendo nel carrello il Welcome kit non acquista direttamente la vettura bensì l'accesso ad una promozione e al relativo sconto. \nLEGGI ANCHE: Recensione Nuova Fiat 500: piccoli cambiamenti per un'icona inossidabile [VIDEO] \nUna volta inserito nel carrello questo pacchetto il Servizio Clienti di Amazon contatterà il cliente per individuare il Concessionario Fiat presso cui finalizzare l’acquisto dell’autovettura prescelta e, ovviamente, concordare i termini di consegna. Successivamente il cliente verrà a sua volta contattato dal concessionario individuato il quale fisserà un appuntamento presso lo showroom. Sulle vetture opzionate su Amazon c'è la possibilità di attivare un finanziamento previsto da FCA Bank. \nQuanto si risparmia? \nAcquistando una delle auto Fiat online si ha diritto ad uno sconto che va dal 15 al 33%. Ad esempio su una 500 Lounge 1.2 69 cv si ha la possibilità di risparmiare il 28% portandosi a casa la vettura a 11.480 euro invece di 16mila. \nwelcome kit Amazon | Screenshot \nSu una 500 L in allestimento Lounge si risparmia invece il 15% : il prezzo passa da 25.500 euro a 21.730. \nWelcome Kit 500 L Amazon | Screenshot \nPerché Fiat e Amazon hanno deciso di collaborare? \nSecondo i dati diffusi dalle due aziende il 50% degli italiani che si dichiarano disponibili a comprare un'automobile online, il 97% chiede comunque di poter ritirare l'auto in concessionaria. Quindi da questo punto di vista l'accordo tra Fiat e Amazon può essere considerato valido. In realtà però Fiat non è la prima azienda ad attraccare su Amazon. Abbiamo infatti visto che Citroën ha permesso agli utenti di prenotare una prova della nuova C3 attraverso Amazon Prime, mandando auto e driver direttamente a casa. Ma se vogliamo Mercedes ha fatto anche di più sotto questo punto di vista perché qualche mese fa un utente ha acquistato online una Smart attraverso lo store dedicato smartFORstore.it. \nInsomma è il segno evidente che qualcosa sta cambiando. Gli utenti prima di acquistare si informano sul web che quindi diventa un grosso vettore opportunamente sfruttabile. Amazon è lo store online più noto ed i recenti accordi ribadiscono che c'è tanto interesse verso l'e-commerce di prodotti come le auto che fino a qualche anno fa erano esclusivo appannaggio dei concessionari. \nIl concessionario, o dealer, deve quindi far fronte a queste nuove esigenze. Difficilmente l'e-commerce soppianterà la vendita \"face to face\" delle auto ma siamo certi che una piattaforma come Amazon offra delle enormi potenzialità per le case costruttrici di auto.",

The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click.\n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)\n ",

      "text": "WHAT: A pre-Black Friday and Christmas ad for Amazon Prime.\nWHO: Amazon, Joint London \nWHY WE CARE: Just two elderly men, clearly old acquaintances, having a catch up over a cup of tea. As they creakily stand up after their warm and friendly chat, they smile ruefully over their now less than athletic bodies. So far, so normal. Except these are not any old men, one is a Christian vicar and the other, a Muslim imam. The two-minute ad goes on to show each man using the Amazon Prime app to order identical kneepads as a gift for the other, to soften the wear and tear their religious duties cause. There’s no dialogue because the film needs none to convey its message of, as Amazon puts it in a statement, \"selflessness and thinking of other people\".\nThe ad will run in the U.K., USA, Canada, Germany and Austria, and is timely, to say the least. In the wake of the Brexit vote and the Presidential election, both the U.K. and the USA have seen a rise in anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim incidents. While the film fits perfectly with Amazon’s previous ads for its Prime service, which are all along the lines of thoughtfulness and fixing a problem for someone else, the context of an interfaith friendship is striking in its simplicity and carries the inescapable subtext that we are all, essentially, the same.\nAmazon founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, a man not prone to excessive tweeting, posted that he was \"very proud\" of the team behind the ad. The lead characters are played by real-life religious leaders; Gary Bradley, vicar at St Mary&apos;s and Paddington Green in London and Zubier Mohammad, principal of the Muslim School Oadby in Leicester, U.K.",

      "text": "Fiat Chrysler teams up with Amazon to sell cars online Reuters ADVERTISEMENT \nMILAN (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online at prices up to a third cheaper than available elsewhere. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that online customers will be able to buy vehicles at a price that is up to a third cheaper than other available promotions. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. \n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",

      "text": "0 Amazon & Fiat Amazon \nFiat e Amazon siglano un accordo che consentirà agli utenti di \"acquistare\" una vettura della casa italiana sul noto sito di e-commerce. Il virgolettato è d'obbligo perché in realtà non stiamo parlando di un vero e proprio acquisto attraverso la piattaforma online ma di una serie di promozioni raggiungibile esclusivamente attraverso la piattaforma online. L'acquisto della vettura deve essere sempre formalizzato presso un concessionario . \nL'auto la compro online? \nIn cosa consiste effettivamente questo accordo tra Amazon e Fiat? L'utente accedendo al pagina Amazon online dedicata ha la possibilità di opzionare una serie di vetture del gruppo Fiat. Le vetture presenti su Amazon e aderenti all'offerta sono le seguenti: Fiat 500 , Fiat 500 Cabrio, Fiat 500 L e Fiat Panda . Il cliente, una volta scelta una vettura tra quelle sopra indicate ha la possibilità di acquistare un \"pacchetto\"- la definizione specifica è Welcome Kit- che costa 180,00 euro . Il cliente inserendo nel carrello il Welcome kit non acquista direttamente la vettura bensì l'accesso ad una promozione e al relativo sconto. \nLEGGI ANCHE: Recensione Nuova Fiat 500: piccoli cambiamenti per un'icona inossidabile [VIDEO] \nUna volta inserito nel carrello questo pacchetto il Servizio Clienti di Amazon contatterà il cliente per individuare il Concessionario Fiat presso cui finalizzare l’acquisto dell’autovettura prescelta e, ovviamente, concordare i termini di consegna. Successivamente il cliente verrà a sua volta contattato dal concessionario individuato il quale fisserà un appuntamento presso lo showroom. Sulle vetture opzionate su Amazon c'è la possibilità di attivare un finanziamento previsto da FCA Bank. \nQuanto si risparmia? \nAcquistando una delle auto Fiat online si ha diritto ad uno sconto che va dal 15 al 33%. Ad esempio su una 500 Lounge 1.2 69 cv si ha la possibilità di risparmiare il 28% portandosi a casa la vettura a 11.480 euro invece di 16mila. \nwelcome kit Amazon | Screenshot \nSu una 500 L in allestimento Lounge si risparmia invece il 15% : il prezzo passa da 25.500 euro a 21.730. \nWelcome Kit 500 L Amazon | Screenshot \nPerché Fiat e Amazon hanno deciso di collaborare? \nSecondo i dati diffusi dalle due aziende il 50% degli italiani che si dichiarano disponibili a comprare un'automobile online, il 97% chiede comunque di poter ritirare l'auto in concessionaria. Quindi da questo punto di vista l'accordo tra Fiat e Amazon può essere considerato valido. In realtà però Fiat non è la prima azienda ad attraccare su Amazon. Abbiamo infatti visto che Citroën ha permesso agli utenti di prenotare una prova della nuova C3 attraverso Amazon Prime, mandando auto e driver direttamente a casa. Ma se vogliamo Mercedes ha fatto anche di più sotto questo punto di vista perché qualche mese fa un utente ha acquistato online una Smart attraverso lo store dedicato smartFORstore.it. \nInsomma è il segno evidente che qualcosa sta cambiando. Gli utenti prima di acquistare si informano sul web che quindi diventa un grosso vettore opportunamente sfruttabile. Amazon è lo store online più noto ed i recenti accordi ribadiscono che c'è tanto interesse verso l'e-commerce di prodotti come le auto che fino a qualche anno fa erano esclusivo appannaggio dei concessionari. \nIl concessionario, o dealer, deve quindi far fronte a queste nuove esigenze. Difficilmente l'e-commerce soppianterà la vendita \"face to face\" delle auto ma siamo certi che una piattaforma come Amazon offra delle enormi potenzialità per le case costruttrici di auto.",

(PRNewsFoto/Innovative Solar Systems, LLC) \nWASHINGTON — Amazon intends to power its massive, global network of data centers with 100 percent renewable energy, and an extended partnership with Dominion Virginia Power’s parent company, will put it one big step closer to that goal. \nAmazon Web Services will buy the power produced by two of the largest solar farms in the mid-Atlantic that Dominion will develop, as well as several others Dominion will own in five Virginia counties. Amazon Web Services will purchase the power generated through Dominion subsidiary Dominion Energy Inc. \nThe new solar facilities will enter service in late 2017. \nDominion will add a total of 180 megawatts of solar generating capacity as part of the expanded partnership. It will expand the output of Dominion’s eight-state solar fleet to 1,400 megawatts, including 434 megawatts in Virginia and North Carolina. \nDominion also says it intends to bring at least 500 megawatts of solar generating capacity in the two states online by 2020. \nLate last month, an 80-megawatt solar facility in Accomack County, the largest operating solar farm in the mid-Atlantic region, entered service. \nDominion also is acquiring four 20-megawatt projects from Virginia Solar LLC and will develop those facilities in Buckingham, New Kent, Powhatan and Sussex counties for Amazon Web Services. \nDominion is also acquiring a 100-megawatt development from Community Energy Solar that it will develop in Southampton County. \nThe 260 megawatts of solar capacity Dominion is developing with its Amazon partnership will generate the equivalent of enough electricity to power 65,000 homes and businesses. \nAmazon Web Services is on track to exceed its goal of 40 percent renewable energy usage by the end of this year, and has set a new goal to be powered by 50 percent renewable energy by the end of 2017. \n“By enabling 10 utility scale renewable projects in the U.S. to date, we are well-positioned to meet our latest goal of 50 percent renewable energy powering the AWS global infrastructure by the end of 2017,” said Peter DeSantis, vice president of infrastructure for AWS. \n“That said, we are nowhere near done. We will continue to make progress toward 100 percent and have many exciting initiative planned,” he said.",

      "text": "Posted on November 18, 2016 by Editor - Business News \nArticle Attribution and Read More at: Article Source \nFiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online at prices up to a third cheaper than available elsewhere. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models – the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy’s biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n“The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world’s seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that online customers will be able to buy vehicles at a price that is up to a third cheaper than other available promotions. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click. \n(Reporting by Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle) Share This:",

      "text": "Written by Charlie \nThere is a huge Amazon sale of 20% off going on now for over 200,000 items on Amazon. Things like clothing, shoes, travel gear, and more are included, as well as some top brands as well. Like this: Like Loading... \nRunning with Miles does not have direct links to credit cards. If you would like to help support the site with your applications, please check out the links on this page for offers. Advertiser Disclosure \nAmazon is continuing with their rush to Black Friday with a pretty incredible sale on over 200k items. Normally, I would try to list items that are up on sale with these deals but I think I can just provide the link below to avoid having the longest blog post in the world. 🙂 Amazon Sale of 20% Off Over 200K Items! \nLink: Amazon Sale of 20% Off \nFor the traveler and the runner, there are many good deals here so do not overlook them. In fact, there are even several pieces of Tumi gear for the traveler that likes that improved luggage for his/her travels. \nThe first thing to notice is that the prices you see on the product page are not the sale prices! The discount will be taken at checkout. The discounts are pretty fantastic on many things, too! I already was able to get a new pair of the latest model of ASICS Kayano at a cheaper price than I have seen anywhere else! \nTravel Gear A nice discount on a quality Tumi bag \nWhen it comes to the travel gear , there are plenty of things available – including Tumi ! One of my picks is the Tumi Vapor Lite Continental . It is a popular bag for travelers who want to carry everything with them and is on sale for $99 off regular price! \nUnder Armour \nThere are also over 300 pieces of gear from Under Armour included in this sale. If you are like me and you love the Under Armour quality and feel, definitely look this over . \nThe 20% off on these Amazon items extends to many categories – Clothing, Shoes, Accessories, Watches, Bags, Travel Luggage, and more! Check them out! This sale expires November 23 at 11:59PM PT. \nDon’t forget to use a card like the Discover It, Discover More, or the Chase Freedom for 5X points on Amazon! \nSome of the links on this site are affiliate links that will support this site.

      "text": "Tweet \nBlack Friday is still a week away, but that hasn't stopped stores from beginning the sales rush. The deals have been announced and some are already available. \nNow Amazon has a unique idea to make shopping simple, but it does have one requirement -- you have to be an Alexa customer to benefit. \nThe company is announcing voice shopping via the popular device and it comes with some special deals. You can grab an Amazon Tap for $79.99, a 32 inch Samsung 1080p LED TV for $119, and a Philips Hue starter kit for $15 off. That's not all, there will many more deals while this promotion runs. \n\"This is the first holiday that Prime members will be able to use their voice to shop and we’re excited to offer exclusive deals they won’t find anywhere else,” says Assaf Ronen, Vice President Voice Shopping. \"Voice shopping with Alexa takes the hassle out of the holidays, giving customers the ability to order from millions of items simply by saying the word. And, the fun doesn’t stop after this weekend. Make sure to ask ‘Alexa, what are your deals?’ every day because we’ll have exciting deals throughout the holiday season and beyond\". \nTo begin simply say \"Alexa, what are the deals?\" The promotion begins right now and runs through Monday November 21. And, for those who make a purchase during that time, and all the way until Cyber Monday, you will also get a $5 Amazon gift card if the sale was $10 or more.",

      "title": "Amazon Prime Interfaith Ad Shows We Have More Similarities Than Differences",
      "text": "WHAT: A pre-Black Friday and Christmas ad for Amazon Prime.\nWHO: Amazon, Joint London\nWHY WE CARE: Just two elderly men, clearly old acquaintances, having a catch up over a cup of tea. As they creakily stand up after their warm and friendly chat, they smile ruefully over their now less than athletic bodies. So far, so normal. Except these are not any old men, one is a Christian vicar and the other, a Muslim imam. The two-minute ad goes on to show each man using the Amazon Prime app to order identical kneepads as a gift for the other, to soften the wear and tear their religious duties cause. There’s no dialogue because the film needs none to convey its message of, as Amazon puts it in a statement, \"selflessness and thinking of other people\".\nThe ad will run in the U.K., USA, Canada, Germany and Austria, and is timely, to say the least. In the wake of the Brexit vote and the Presidential election, both the U.K. and the USA have seen a rise in anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim incidents. While the film fits perfectly with Amazon’s previous ads for its Prime service, which are all along the lines of thoughtfulness and fixing a problem for someone else, the context of an interfaith friendship is striking in its simplicity and carries the inescapable subtext that we are all, essentially, the same.\nAmazon founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, a man not prone to excessive tweeting, posted that he was \"very proud\" of the team behind the ad. The lead characters are played by real-life religious leaders; Gary Bradley, vicar at St Mary&apos;s and Paddington Green in London and Zubier Mohammad, principal of the Muslim School Oadby in Leicester, U.K.",

      "title": "Amazon Renews Tig Notaro's 'One Mississippi' for Second Season",
      "text": "Amazon has renewed One Mississippi, created by Tig Notaro and Diablo Cody, for a second season, which will start streaming in 2017.\nThe show stars Notaro in a semi-autobiographical story of a woman who, still reeling from her own declining health, returns to her childhood hometown of Bay Saint Lucille, Miss., to deal with the unexpected death of her mother, the one person who actually understood her. As she deals with the tragedy and events from her past, the series becomes an exploration of family.\nOne Mississippi also stars Noah Harpster, John Rothman and Notaro's wife Stephanie Allynne. Kate Robin serves as showrunner, with Notaro, Cody, Robin, Louis C.K., M. Blair Breard and Dave Becky serving as executive producers.\n\"Making a show as comic and tragic as One Mississippi is a risk. Pulling it off with such intelligence and nuance is rare,\" Amazon's head of comedy and drama Joe Lewis said Monday in a statement. \"We're grateful for the audience response and we're excited to bring them more of Tig and Kate's brilliance in season two.\"\nIn 2012, the stand-up comedian nearly died from a bacterial infection called C. Diff, went through a break-up, suffered the untimely death of her mother and was diagnosed with cancer. Notaro relayed the series of tragic events in a legendary stand-up routine, \"Hello, I Have Cancer,\" which made her an overnight sensation. Although she's since recounted the events in subsequent TV specials, documentaries and in a memoir, One Mississippi is her first scripted, half-hour TV comedy.\nRead more: 'One Mississippi': TV Review\nAhead of the second-season renewal, Notaro told The Hollywood Reporter some of her early ideas for where the show could head next, including whether or not Tig would pursue Kate, who is played by Allyne. The pair have 4-month-old twin sons Max and Finn.\n\"The Kate part is obviously a hint or tease that maybe there's something there,\" said Notaro, adding that she and Allyne, who also is a writer on the series, watched the season twice and took notes on what they thought would be interesting to add. \"I broke up with Brooke, will that be the end of Brooke? I don't know. I love Casey Wilson and she makes me laugh harder than most people alive, so it's hard to say we're done with her. But maybe we will.\"\nShe continued: \"Because Stephanie is my wife and a person in real life, I think people assume I'm going to end up with Kate. Will I? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. That's been the fun part of it.\"\nNotaro said she's enjoyed taking liberty with some of the storylines, even though it was hard for her at first to steer from her own reality of losing her mother.\n\"What's funny is that one of the notes about the show was that I had too many romantic interests,\" she said of her three love interests Kate (Allyne), Brooke (Wilson) and Jessie (Jill Bartlett). \"I don't mean to be braggadocious, but there was actually a fourth person in the real story. The Jessie character was a real relationship that went back and forth and it was not the one for me, but it was so helpful in my healing. There's more to that story, but I don't know if I'm going to tell it.\"\nRead more: Tig Notaro Shares What She Learned From 'One Mississippi,' Where the Series Could Go\nThough the comedian said her comedy no longer focuses on her cancer or her grief, she said One Mississippi will \"probably follow some of the older storylines but into newer territory and more fictional topics.\"\nNotaro added, \"People ask about my stand-up, 'Are you going to close the chapter on the close association you have with cancer and people knowing you with that?' And I say, 'If it feels right to let it go.' And it has. I don't talk about having cancer in my stand-up anymore. I don't have cancer. But if it comes up for me again, that I'm going through something, I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to do whatever feels right whenever it feels right.\"\nThe comedy, which was initially set up as a script deal at FX but moved to Amazon, hails from C.K.'s FX Productions-based Pig Newton banner.\nThe first season of One Mississippi is currently available for Amazon's Prime Video subscribers.",

Fiat Chrysler teams up with Amazon to sell cars online Reuters - UK Focus – 1 hour 30 minutes ago 7.475 +0.005 \nMILAN, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online at prices up to a third cheaper than available elsewhere. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference. \nThe manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that online customers will be able to buy vehicles at a price that is up to a third cheaper than other available promotions. \nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer. \nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalise their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click.

      "text": "“ One Mississippi ” is getting a second season on Amazon Prime. Season 2 of the critically acclaimed comedy will premiere in 2017 on Prime Video in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan.\nCreated by Oscar winner Diablo Cody and Emmy nominated comedian Tig Notaro , “One Mississippi” follows a fictionalized version of Notaro as she returns to her Mississippi hometown after her mother suddenly passes away. Kate Robin (“Six Feet Under”) serves as showrunner.\n“Making a show as comic and tragic as ‘One Mississippi’ is a risk. Pulling it off with such intelligence and nuance is rare,” said Joe Lewis, Amazon Studios’ head of comedy and drama. “We’re grateful for the audience response and we’re excited to bring them more of Tig and Kate’s brilliance in Season 2.”\nVariety ‘s Maureen Ryan offered effusive praise for the series when it first hit Amazon Prime in September. “The cumulative power of “One Mississippi” is almost breathtaking, given where it starts,” she wrote. “Given that array of talent, it’s not all that surprising that this is easily one of the best new shows of the year.”\n“One Mississippi” stars creator Notaro, Noah Harpster (“Transparent”), John Rothman (“Law & Order”) and Stephanie Allynne (“Comedy Bang! Bang!”). Notaro, Cody, Robin, M. Blair Breard (“Better Things”), Dave Becky (“Master of None”) and Louis C.K. (“Louie”) will be executive producers for Season 2. The series is produced by FX Productions.\nRelated stories\nTech Stocks' Donald Trump Hangover Continues\nShares of Tech Giants Fall on Renewed Fears of Trump Administration Policies\nRobert De Niro, Julianne Moore, David O.

      "title": "Amazon Echo Features: You Can Now Send Hands-Free Text Messages To AT&T Customers",
      "text": "11/18/16 AT 11:14 AM Close \nAT&T announced on Thursday it’s launching a new skill on Amazon’s Alexa-enabled devices that lets you send hands-free text messages. Starting today, Amazon’s Alexa-powered device can send messages for you and send them to a list of contacts that have been pre-programmed. To get started, all you need to do is say “Alexa, ask AT&T to text (name), and the assistant will create your message. \n“Amazon Echo is ahead of the curve in terms of voice recognition technology and functionality,” said Jeff Bradley, senior vice president, Device and Network Services Marketing. “AT&T is the first carrier to bring this unique skill to a product already known for innovation. We’re always working to bring simple solutions for our customers to stay in touch. In the tradition of NumberSync, another solution that was introduced at AT&T first, the Send Message Skill gives our customers another easy and convenient way to communicate.” \nSkills are voice-driven capabilities that chance the Alexa devices, including Amazon Echo and Dot. Alexa is Amazon’s cloud-based voice service, which can play music, and provide news, sports scores, weather and now AT&T’s hands-free Send Message skill. Related Stories 'Fallout 4' PS4 Mods Are Finally Live With Update 1.8 \nThe feature does have some limitations.

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo You might use Amazon to order everything from PS4 games to paper towels, but what about a car? Don’t laugh. Amazon and Fiat Chrysler have a new deal in which Fiat Chrysler will sell cars through Amazon at discounts.\nReuters said this morning that the deals will save consumers as much as one-third of the total cost they’d pay elsewhere. Talk about an Amazon Prime benefit, right? There won’t be any sort of special delivery, though, so don’t expect a truck to just swing by the house and drop your car off in the driveway just yet. Instead, Reuters said that Amazon will work with dealers so that customers can purchase the car online and then go pick it up at a physical dealer location in about two weeks time. That still sounds a heck of a lot better than trying to work out an agreeable price with a car dealer.\nThree Fiat Chrysler Cars available from Amazon to start Amazon will sell just three models to start, including the Fiat 500, Fiat 500L and Fiat Panda. “The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” Fiat Chrysler’s Gianluca Italia said.\nThe service will start with Fiat Chrysler and Amazon customers in Italy, but this is the sort of service I expect will launch around the world if it does well with the initial test market. I’d do this in a heartbeat.\n\n\nSource : Reuters ",

      "text": "Getty Images Like us on Facebook \nAt this point, it's kind of crazy not to have Amazon Prime. The yearly subscription service comes with endless perks, from free shipping to streaming excellent shows like Transparent . If the $99 price tag seems like just too much for the ability to have almost anything in existence ( truly anything ) mailed to you in two days, we have some good news for you: For today only, Amazon is lowering the price of Prime by 20 percent. \nFriday, November 18, Prime will only be $79 starting at 12 a.m. ET until 11:59 p.m. PT. To get the deal, sign up on this landing page . Amazon launched the deal in celebration of its new show, The Grand Tour . On top of getting to watch the automotive show, Prime users also get Amazon Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Reading, Prime Fresh, and Prime Photos. It's going to be hard to see the TV over all the loot that's going to get mailed to your door. \n[h/t Thrillist ] \nMental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers, including Amazon, and may receive a small percentage of any sale. But we only get commission on items you buy and don’t return, so we’re only happy if you’re happy. Good luck deal hunting! More from mental_floss... ",

      "text": "When Amazon announced its slate of Black Friday specials (or at least the big time \"Turkey 5\" deals that weren't part of the two-month-long sales celebration that started Nov. 1), it teased the debut of a cool wrinkle within the online shopping experience. \nSEE ALSO: Man hacked his Alexa to speak out of a singing fish, and it's horrifying \nOwners of Alexa-enabled devices connected to Amazon Prime accounts will soon have access to exclusive deals — if they ask for them. \nFrom Nov. 18-21, Amazon is holding the first ever \"voice shopping weekend.\" It's simple: just say \"Alexa, what are your deals?\" within range of a connected device (or if you're boring just visit the Voice Shopping Weekend page ) to find out what's on sale. \nInitially, shoppers were promised 70 Alexa-exclusive discounts without any details. As the sale is underway, some of them have come to light, along with exactly how to ask for them:\nSave $50 on an Amazon Tap – say, “Alexa, order an Amazon Tap.”\nSave $80 on a 32-inch Samsung 1080p LED TV – say, “Alexa, order a Samsung TV.”\nSave $30 on a Sphero Star Wars BB-8 App controlled robot – say, “Alexa, order a Star Wars robot.”\nSave $15 on a Philips Hue LED Starter Kit with 2 Bulbs & Hue Bridge Hub – say, “Alexa, order a Hue Starter Kit.” \nSave $80 on Beyerdynamic Limited Edition Headphones – say, “Alexa, order studio headphones.”\nSave $130 on a 10-piece All-Clad stainless steel cookware set – say, “Alexa, order an All-Clad cookware set.”\nSave $10 on LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box – say, “Alexa, order a Lego Classic Brick Box.”\nSave 30% on a 48-pack of Amazon Basics AA batteries – say, “Alexa, order AA batteries.”\nSave 35% on Lindt Lindor Milk Chocolate Truffles – say, “Alexa, order Lindor truffles.”\n“This is the first holiday that Prime members will be able to use their voice to shop and we’re excited to offer exclusive deals they won’t find anywhere else,” Amazon Vice President of Voice Shopping Assaf Ronen said in the announcement. \"And, the fun doesn’t stop after this weekend. Make sure to ask ‘Alexa, what are your deals?’ every day because we’ll have exciting deals throughout the holiday season and beyond.”\nWith the need for a full cabinet of voice shopping officials and plans for a big splash in the holiday season, asking for your deals is sure to become a seasonal tradition. Just don't use your Echo to order a Tap — Alexa might get jealous. \nBONUS: Nike’s self-lacing sneakers are on their way, but they ain’t cheap",

      "text": "Bloomberg—Bloomberg via Getty Images Amazon will offer deals exclusive to its Echo devices. The deals will continue through December \nIf you’re looking to get a head start on your holiday shopping , Amazon wants you to ask Alexa for help. \nThe online retailer is offering exclusive deals to Prime members who order through one of its Alexa-enabled devices, including the Amazon Echo or Tap, CNBC reported . You can access the deals by asking your device, “Alexa, what are your deals?” Alexa will then respond with deals and ask if you would like to place an order via Amazon. \nThe current deals will start Friday and last through Monday, though Amazon has said other discounts will be available throughout November and December. \nThe bargains include a 32-inch Samsung TV for $119, $30 off a Sphero Star Wars BB-8 app controlled robot (price: $97.99), and $15 off a Philips Hue LED lightbulb starter kit (price: $54.99). Alexa will also give you a discount on everyday products like 10% off 14 bars of Dove soap (price: $13.16) and 35% off a 24-pack of V8 energy drinks (price: $17.06). \nThis is the first time Amazon has offered Alexa-exclusive deals. They come as the company is trying to compete with Google and Apple , which have also launched their own automated home assistant products. \nIf you own an Alexa device, but aren’t a Prime member, now might be the time to strike. Amazon is offering a discount on Prime membership on Friday only, dropping the price from $99 to $79 a year. ",

      "text": "Share \nCrate and Barrel is unlocking the doors to an exclusive, “highly curated” marketplace for consumers to broaden their tastes for home décor. Arguably, the move emulates what Amazon is doing by working with external sellers in order to bump up the number of items available on the site and entice a wider range of customers to make purchases. \nAccording to a release , the Northbrook, IL-based company is partnering with RevCascade — most known for being a platform offering enhanced options for retailers and the brands they carry — to launch the marketplace as “an extended aisle of unique products” off of the main website. \nProducts include items from new brands, new products from existing brands, exclusive items only found through the marketplace and one-of-a-kind, high-end products from designers around the world. \nThe goal is for retailers to use the platform to launch, operate and scale their own marketplaces and ultimately increase revenue and consumer loyalty. The focus is mostly on small appliances and kitchen tools that Crate and Barrel doesn’t typically ship or sell. Crate and Barrel said it sees the expansion and extension as a benefit to the consumer, if nothing else. \nThis concept is part of a larger trend , however. More than 250 retailers have gone this route. For example, Saks Fifth Avenue, Walmart and Macy’s opened their eCommerce sites to third parties in attempts to reach more consumers. It allows the larger brand to be a “one-stop shop” and also offer more products that it wouldn’t otherwise sell from the core brand. But it may be used simply to offer additional sizes and simple but extended options. \nOf course, Amazon is indeed the leader in building out this concept, as the majority of its products are sold via a third party. \nLest it be known, there are risks to moving in this direction. For example, if something goes wrong with an item or with the third-party retailer itself, the potential hiccup still falls under the overarching brand, which would be Crate and Barrel in this case. \nRevCascade has developed a platform for connecting retailers with vendors, and the company’s done it hundreds of times. Just weeks ago, RevCascade was brought on by Crate and Barrel to test about three dozen items through the platform, for a total of eight weeks. Allegedly, there were no complaints and no returns.",

      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Friday, November 18, 2016 Amazon Announces Enticing Alexa-Exclusive ‘Voice Deals’ For Echo Owners Online shopping may seem like the modern thing to do, but if you're moving your mouse and pecking away at your keyboard (or tapping on your touchscreen), you might already be behind the curve. That will be the case if voice shopping takes hold, as Amazon would like to see happen. From now until Monday, Amazon Prime members can shop online using their voice. This is Amazon's first ever voice shopping weekend event. Of course for this to work you need to own an Alexa-enabled device. There are several out there, including the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot , Amazon Tap, Fire HD tablet , and Fire TV . If you happen to have one, just say, \"Alexa, what are your deals\" each day to hear what items are on sale. \"This is the first holiday that Prime members will be able to use their voice to shop and we’re excited to offer exclusive deals they won’t find anywhere else,\" said Assaf Ronen, Vice President Voice Shopping. \"Voice shopping with Alexa takes the hassle out of the holidays, giving customers the ability to order from millions of items simply by saying the word. And, the fun doesn’t stop after this weekend. Make sure to ask ‘Alexa, what are your deals?’ every day because we’ll have exciting deals throughout the holiday season and beyond.\" Here's a look at some of today's Alexa-exclusive voice deals: AmazonBasics AA Batteries 48-Pack: $8.74 (down from $12.49) Cocoon by Sealy Firm Foam Mattress Queen: $479.20 (down from $599) Sphero Star Wars BB-8 App Controlled Robot: $97.99 (down from $127.99) Presto! 96% Biobased Liquid Laundry Detergent 2-Pack: $10 (down from $19.99) Amazon Tap Portable Bluetooth Speaker: $79.99 (down from $129.99) Samsung 32-inch 1080p LED TV UN32J5003 : $119 (down from $197) You don't have to be super specific when taking advantage of one of these deals. For example, to order the 32-inch Samsung TV, you would simply say, \"Alexa, order a Samsung TV.\" Since this is part of a special shopping event, Alexa already knows which TV you're talking about. Same goes for the 48-pack of batteries (\"Alexa, order AA batteries\") and the other items.If you don't have an Alexa-enabled device handy, you can go here to check out the daily deals.",

      "title": "Amazon’s Black Friday starts early with Alexa’s Voice Shopping",
      "text": "Reddit \nStarting this morning Amazon is making certain Black Friday shoppers are spending cash as early as possible with “voice shopping weekend.” To do this, they’re running a deal in which Amazon Tap is a bit cheaper than normal, and a few more deals can be found by asking Alexa devices. Users that have an Alexa-enabled device should ask, “Alexa, what are your deals” each day – but make sure not to say “what is YOUR deal,” because that means something different. \nFor those not hung up on the idea that “Alexa, what are your deals” sounds a little too close to “Alexa, what is your deal, you’re sounding extremely grumpy today,” there’s a list of deals. Starting today and running through the 21st of this month, a few deals will pop up in Amazon. \n“This is the first holiday that Prime members will be able to use their voice to shop,” said Assaf Ronen, Vice President Voice Shopping. “Voice shopping with Alexa takes the hassle out of the holidays, giving customers the ability to order from millions of items simply by saying the word.” \nAmazon suggests that there’ll be an “up to 40% off” deal running on “everyday essentials” as well. There’s a bit of a bonus, too, for users who purchase “an Alexa deal” for $10 or more between here and Cyber Monday. Those users will receive a $5 Amazon gift card “while supplies last”– so maybe they have a stack of cards and literally cannot create any more, I suppose. \nEach of the following items will have sales associated with them with commands for Alexa. For the Amazon Tap deal, users will be able to say “Alexa, order an Amazon Tap.” For a 32-inch Samsung 1080p LED TV, users will say “Alexa, order a Samsung TV.” The same product command sequence works with the BB-8 by Sphero with “Star Wars robot,” with a Philips Hue LED Starter Kit with “Hue Starter Kit”, and Beyerdynamic Limited Edition Headphones with “studio headphones.” \nAlso on this list is a 10-piece All-Clad stainless steel cookware set with “Alexa, order an All-Clad cookware set.” A LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box works with “LEGO Classic Brick Box,” a 48-pack of Amazon Basics AA batteries works with “AA batteries”, and Lindt Lindor Milk Chocolate Truffles work with “Lindor truffles.” The whole collection can also be found at Amazon.com/AlexaDeals as well.

      "text": "Monday morning brought good news for a number of new television series on various networks.\nCBS announced that it was giving full-season orders to the new sitcoms “Man With a Plan” and “The Great Indoors,” which means five of the network’s newcomers will endure through the fall.\n“The Great Indoors” stars Joel McHale in a workplace comedy that mines the generational divide between Generation X and millennials, and “Man With a Plan” marked the much-publicized return of Matt LeBlanc from “Friends” to a network sitcom. Both shows debuted in late October and have earned respectable ratings. “The Great Indoors” was touted by CBS as the No. 2 new comedy of the season, averaging more than 8 million viewers.\nThe new CBS shows “Bull,” “MacGyver” and “Kevin Can Wait,” which stars Kevin James in the season’s top-rated new sitcom, were also given full orders by the network early in the fall.\nThe network also ordered three additional episodes of the medical drama “Code Black,” which is in its second season.\nHBO announced Monday that it was renewing its three fall series for second seasons.\n“Westworld,” a futuristic drama that explores sin and the complexities of consciousness, has proved a ratings hit for HBO, averaging a gross audience of 11.7 million viewers through its first seven episodes.\nThe renewal also includes critically acclaimed comedy series “Insecure.” Created by and starring Issa Rae, “Insecure” examines the difficulties of navigating the modern world as a young black woman.\nAlso scoring a second season is “Divorce,” the series that brought “Sex and the City” star Sarah Jessica Parker back to the network and digs into a marriage as it falls apart.\nCompleting the renewal trifecta was Amazon, which announced Monday a second season renewal for Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical series “One Mississippi,” a dark comedy about the intricacies of family and making peace with the past.\nThe second season of “One Mississippi” will air exclusively on Amazon in 2017.\n",

      "text": "Santa, meet Alexa By Christopher Heine November 18, 2016, 11:53 AM EST The online retail giant is pushing artificial intelligence this yuletide season. Amazon.com Amazon just gave a preview on how it's bringing voice-recognition deals to Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The retail giant today introduced a bevy of discounted holiday offers, which include everything from $80 off a 32-inch Samsung TV (normally $199) and $120 off a Cocoon mattress (normally $599) to 10 percent off Degree antiperspirant. It's a hodgepodge of potential savings, for sure. The landing page for the specials includes copy that directs Amazon Echo users to say phrases like, \"Alexa, what are deals\" and \"Alexa, order a Star Wars Rebel Fighter\" into the device to engage with its AI-powered voice-recognition system called Alexa. Because Amazon wants Echo to be adopted widely by consumers, there will be similar Alexa-only deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday to go along with its numerous other holiday-based specials. Amazon's news release this morning read: \"Plus, the great deals will continue throughout the holiday season, with Alexa-exclusive deals on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and every day in November and December. Customers who purchase an Alexa deal at $10 or more in value between now and Cyber Monday will also receive a bonus $5 Amazon gift card while supplies last.\" An Echo normally costs $180, while a small version of the device, called Echo Dot, typically comes with a price tag of $50. Whether a great number of deal-seeking shoppers buy one of them this season will make Amazon's Q4 earnings call early next year worth listening to.

      "text": "on Friday November 18, 2016 @11:20AM from the global-expansion dept. For years, Amazon's Prime Video on-demand streaming service has been available in limited regions, such as the United States and United Kingdom (along with a handful of other markets), but that's changing now. Amazon is expanding the Prime Video service to more than 200 new markets . The announcement comes via The Grand Tour motor show, which premieres in select places Friday. Earlier this week, show's hosts -- Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May -- posted on Amazon website that their new show will be streamed in over 200 nations (pretty much everywhere where BBC's Top Gear is broadcasted and streamed). Speaking of which, fans of the Grand Tour will be able to watch the show worldwide starting next month, and once Prime Video is available in their region, they will be able watch new episodes at the same time as others. The move comes months after Netflix expanded to 130 new regions in January this year. Netflix is available in roughly 200 territories as well.",
