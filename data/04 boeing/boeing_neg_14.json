      "text": "After Boeing’s CEO fretted publicly about president-elect Donald Trump’s anti-trade views, Trump attacked the company on Twitter , exaggerating the costs of a Boeing project to build new jets for the US president and threatening to cancel the contract.\nAccording to the company, Boeing is under contract for $170 million to design new presidential aircraft, known as Air Force One, to begin service in 2024. (The current planes have been in service since 1990.) No mere jetliner, these planes are required by the US military to allow the president to essentially run the country—or a war—from the air, with classified communication technologies, expensive sensors and defense equipment.\nIn his tweet, Trump claimed that the plane would cost more than $4 billion. An Air Force spokesperson told Quartz that the service is working with Boeing to identify the final cost of the program, and has budgeted $2.7 billion for the two to three aircraft, “but expect this number to change as the program matures with the completion of the risk reduction activities.” A 2016 analysis of the program by the government’s auditors estimated the total cost at $3.2 billion.\nA Boeing spokesperson said Congress will need to appropriate funds for the final contract to actually build the planes, noting that a standard 747-8, the model the presidential aircraft will be based on, has a list price of $379 million.\nBoeing, the largest aerospace company in the world and biggest exporter in the US, saw its stock fall, then rise again after Trump’s tweet. In 2013, Trump trumpeted his prowess at purchasing Boeing shares during a dip in the company’s fortunes. Boeing was not listed among his $38 million in stock holdings on Trump’s federal disclosure forms in May. A spokesman for the president-elect said Trump sold all of his public company stock in June, but provided no details, so it isn’t known when—or if—Trump sold his Boeing position. The June sales presumably don’t include positions held by his children, who remain official advisers to his presidential transition team.\nAsked by reporters where Trump had gotten his information about the cost of the new planes, Trump’s spokespeople declined to say, but noted that when you add up the costs “it’s a pretty big number,” and that the president-elect will “look to try to save taxpayer money.”\nThe reason for Trump’s outburst isn’t clear; the Boeing contract was awarded in July 2015. As Trump tweeted, the Washington Post broke news about a Pentagon report identifying $125 billion in unnecessary spending. The Post said that the report was quashed by Defense officials.\nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg did make comments this morning at the Illinois Manufacturers Association expressing his worries about the new president’s trade policies.\n“If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” Muilenburg warned, according to the Chicago Tribune . Exports make up a huge portion of Boeing’s business, according to Aviation Week , with 5,500 of 7,522 jets built by Boeing between 2000 and 2015 heading to overseas customers. Many are sold in China, the target of much of Trump’s trade ire. Any backlash could be painful for Boeing and its stakeholders.\nThe president-elect may want the contract cancelled, but it will be difficult for the US government to find a different vendor. Air Force officials insist that the plane have four engines for extra reliability; the only two companies who make four-engine jet airliners are Boeing and the European champion, Airbus, which is based in a suburb of Toulouse, France.\nAfter handing out tax breaks to keep just 800 jobs in Indiana, it’s hard to imagine the Trump team sending jobs—and a massive symbol of national pride—to France.",

      "title": "CEO President-Elect Trump, Carrier, Boeing … And What Conservatives Forgot",
      "text": "CEO President-Elect Trump, Carrier, Boeing … And What Conservatives Forgot Published December 6, 2016 By Chris Stirewalt | Published December 06, 2016 FoxNews.com \nBeing the CEO of an organization that spends about $4 trillion a year comes with a lot of leverage.Donald Trump is still six weeks away from taking the reins, but he has already twice put the bit to major federal contractors. First it was United Technologies, parent company of Carrier heating and air conditioning. Now it’s one of the lead horses in the U.S. economy, Boeing.The company’s $96 billion in revenue puts it in the top 25 largest American corporations and its more than 165,000 U.S. workers make it one of the largest employers in the country.As a candidate, Trump had targeted Boeing for expanding its Chinese operations. Now, as president-elect, he is hitting the company for the projected size of its contract to furnish two new jets to be used as Air Force Ones in the future.Having a tiff with the incoming president could always be trouble for a large multinational corporation that has much to gain or lose based on trade rules and domestic regulations. For the second largest federal contractor, though, there are special risks with an unhappy president.More than 20 percent of Boeing’s revenues come from federal contracts. President Obama has demonstrated how much juice the chief executive has over contractors. He has issued executive orders compelling those who sell to the federal government to enact policies he was unable to force through Congress: new sick leave rules, higher minimum wage and even how they handle employee promotions.Trump’s critics will blanch at such heavy-handed tactics, but smacking around some faceless corporation for allegedly wasting tax dollars or building plants in China is bound to be pretty popular.The lately lionized blue-collar workers who gave Trump his victory are liable to feel very good as they see Boeing stock prices skid and the corporation takes evasive action to escape Trump’s wrath.Remember, Americans hate big business more than big government.And this is exactly the challenge for Republicans in the era of Trump. Conservatives are used to driving the bus on the Republican side of the aisle. For more than 35 years, conservatism was either ascendant or dominant in the GOP and Washington. Even when they lost, the debate was often framed on their terms.So conservatives can be excused for believing the reason for their success has been that their views are popular. Not so.The reason movement conservatives had to work for so long and so hard to gain their foothold in Washington is that almost all politicians and plenty of voters hate conservative principles when put into action.People dislike government spending… unless it’s spent on them. People like term limits… unless it means they lose their high-ranking member of Congress. People dislike high taxes… unless they’re being paid by someone else. People hate government regulations… unless they’re protecting something important to them.And as Trump is proving, people dislike when the federal government harasses companies… unless they think they really have it coming.The much-derided Washington think tank conservatism smashed by Trump’s Republican primary victory was dedicated to the precept that it was hard to get politicians to follow conservative precepts. You wouldn’t need, for instance, candidates to sign a pledge promising to not raise taxes, unless it was so appealing for them to do so.Like their Democratic counterparts, Republicans of the various branches of conservatism are promising to work with Trump on areas of agreement, but fight him tooth and nail in the areas they disagree. That’s sounds easier than it is. With every president, priorities get tangled. With one who cultivates grudges, it could be ruinous.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other Republican bigwigs dismissed the idea of Trump’s call for a 35 percent tariff on goods made by U.S. companies overseas. Trump promises “retribution” for those who open plants abroad. But conservatism generally holds that the federal government should not direct the affairs of corporations, but rather let the market decide. Picking “winners and losers” was a chief criticism of Obama’s economic agenda.How about ObamaCare?The incoming leader of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House is promising “major resistance” to the plan backed by Team Trump to gradually repeal and replace the 2010 health law. One can easily foresee a scenario in which these members, whose districts went overwhelmingly for Trump, are told to back off and focus on other issues.Of all of the terms abused in American politics, “conservative” may be the most beleaguered. One of the reasons that polls find conservatives consistently outnumbering liberals and moderates is that the word can mean so many different things to so many different people.Are you a staunch opponent of elective abortion and gay marriage, but think that federal spending on domestic projects should go way up? Congratulations, you’re a conservative. Do you think that the government should stay out of people’s personal lives, but want to see the federal budget squeezed within an inch of its life? You, too, are a conservative.You might even just be a conservative if you wish things were the way they used to be…Republicans glossed over many of these distinctions in order to build and maintain their coalition. After all, most of the differences are about priorities not actual disagreements. The credentials of many of Trump’s picks for his administration as well as the guiding hand of Vice President-elect Mike Pence have given many on the right hope that Trump would govern as a more orthodox conservative than he campaigned.That is changing.If conservatives are serious about fighting Trump on picking winners and losers, trade barriers and health insurance, one imagines that Trump will make it his business to smash the opposition.Given Trump’s soaring popularity among Republicans, it’s not hard to guess who would win if the showdown comes anytime soon.",

      "text": "Tweet \nAir Force Secretary Deborah Lee James pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump’s tweet Tuesday morning taking Boeing to task for the cost of its Air Force One replacement program, saying: “It is a bit more complicated.” \nThe two new 747s, which are being built by aerospace giant Boeing, will need rare features like the ability to withstand an attack by missile and top-flight communications offerings, James told Politico Tuesday, making them cost a lot more than the average passenger airplane. \n“Air Force One, although it is a 747 platform, is way, way more than what you would think of as a commercial airliner,” James told Politico in an interview . “It really is, in many ways, a flying White House, in terms of the security. There’s countermeasures built in, communications, very high level communications, security of all types. After all, this is carrying the president of the United States. It has to go long distances, it has to survive under difficult circumstances, much more difficulty than a normal civilian airliner. So it is a bit more complicated than perhaps meets the eye.” \nThose added features have been requested by White House security teams, she added. \n“Those requirements then come to the Air Force and our job is to build the acquisition strategy around it to deliver those requirements,” she said. “In other words, we didn’t make up all these security factors and communications standards.” \nThe only way to lower the price tag for the new 747s would be to worsen their technical requirements, she added.

      "title": "Boeing responds to Trump’s $4 billion Air Force One claim",
      "text": "Boeing responded to President-elect Donald Trump Tuesday after he blasted the aircraft manufacturing company for a contract allegedly worth “ more than $4 billion .” In a statement on its website, Boeing disclosed that the current contract is for only $170 million. \nAs it turns out, they’re both partially right. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” the memo from Boeing read. \n“We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,” it added. \nBut Trump had an altogether different idea about the makeup of the government’s contract with Boeing, which in January won the contract to build the next generation of 747 Air Force One aircraft. \nSpeaking with reporters Tuesday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump called the plane project “totally out of control” and said the costs are “ridiculous.” \n“I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,” he continued. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nAs previously stated, the only active contract Boeing has with the Air Force at the moment seems to be the one for $170 million. Though the total value of the full contract awarded at the beginning of the year is not immediately available, the Air Force previously disclosed that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two replacement Boeing 747-8s, according to Reuters . \nSo, though both Boeing and Trump are sharing somewhat misleading numbers, the president-elect’s figure seems to be closer to the total. \nThe budgeted cost for the program to replace the two Air Force One aircraft rings in at $2.87 billion for the fiscal years of 2015 through 2021. However, the production contract has yet to be awarded to Boeing, even though the company won the bid.",

      "title": "Trump’s Boeing beef ignores the high costs of building a plane that can withstand a nuclear blast",
      "text": "Donald Trump is mad at Boeing, but what else is new? On Tuesday, the president-elect tweeted that he was considering canceling the Chicago-based aerospace company’s contract to build the new Air Force One because it was too expensive. \nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Enough ink has been spilled trying to suss out Trump’s motivations in this latest Twitter beef — He wants to protect taxpayers ! He wanted revenge for a comment by Boeing’s CEO about free trade! He’s dangerously unhinged and someone needs to take his phone away, for the love of god! — but we thought it was worth looking into why Boeing was charging the federal government so much money to build a couple of big-ass jets. \nFirst of all, the current Air Force One, a Boeing 747-200B, is over two decades old and needs to be replaced. Last year, the government signed an eight-year, $3 billion contract with Boeing to replace the current aircraft. Built on the frame of a Boeing 747-8, the new Air Force One will be bigger, more powerful, and able to fly farther than the current plane.\nBut more than that, the new Air Force One will be the most resilient, high-tech, tricked-out jumbo jet in existence. Just ask CNN’s aviation editor John Ostrower. \nWhen you have to harden two 747s to withstand an electromagnetic blast from a nuclear explosion, the price tag is high.\n— Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) December 6, 2016 Air Force One runs on 165,000 pounds of state-of-the-art electronics and is protected by both an electromagnetic pulse shield and a radiation shield in the event of a nuclear blast. \nCapable of withstanding an electromagnetic blast? Check. Capable of midair refueling? Check. Capable of dodging heat-seeking missiles? Check. There really shouldn’t be any questions about the costs of building this incredibly state-of-the-art plane, and yet here we are. \nLess CO2 emissions for a climate-change-denying president Despite its size, the modified 747 can fly for days without refueling. And it can reach speeds of up to 620 mph, 40 mph faster than its commercial counterparts. Also, the new Air Force One will be greener than the current one: Boeing says the 747-8 emits 16 less tons of CO2 per trip than the 747-200B. Not that this particular point matters much to a president-elect who denies the existence of climate change. \nAsked by reporters to clarify his tweet, Trump said, “Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program. And I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\n“We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” Ignoring the fact that Trump said he doesn’t want an American company that employs almost 157,000 people to make “that much money,” the fact that he thinks “$4 billion” is too steep of a price tag is a head scratcher. The planes themselves aren’t that expensive, around $225 million each. But it’s the costs associated with building a resilient enough aircraft to protect the president, as well as one that can act as a mobile command center like it did during 9/11, that accounts for bulk of the expense. The Pentagon is budgeting $3.2 billion for research and development, military construction, and acquisition of at least two new Air Force One planes through fiscal 2021, an analyst told Bloomberg . \nAccording to CNN Money , the Air Force hasn’t even told Boeing whether it wants to buy two or three planes. Boeing’s current contract is only for $170 million, but many details about the overall replacement project, such as how much of the aforementioned countermeasures and security specs will be included, is still in flux. \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” Boeing said in a statement responding to Trump’s broadsides. “We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nOf course, Air Force One doesn’t have everything. It certainly lacks the splashy, gold-plated fixtures found in Trump’s own private jet. Which certainly raises the question of whether the president-elect’s tirade against Boeing is a smoke screen for his effort to get his own Boeing 757 designated as the official presidential aircraft. Wouldn’t want to let all that gold go to waste.",

      "text": "December 06, 2016 3:04 PM 'Whatever His Intent, Trump Is Telling Boeing That He's Watching, So It Better Watch Out'   \nAt 7:30 AM local time the Chicago Tribune published an article titled \" Boeing CEO waits for Trump's trade play. \" As John Harwood, who covers business and politics for CNBC and The New York Times notes, just 22 minutes later Donald Trump posted his now infamous tweet calling for the cancellation of Boeing's supposed deal to build two new Air Force Ones. Trump tweet hitting Boeing & causing its stock to drop came 22 mins after this story posted on Boeing trade concerns https://t.co/NH2d6LYzwy — John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) December 6, 2016 \nTrump falsely cited cost overruns , but according to an official statement from Boeing, the project is merely in the planning stage, and they are under contract only for $170 million \"to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft.\" The Pentagon has tagged somewhere between $1.65 and $3.2 billion for the two presidential 747s, but Trump claimed there were cost overruns that had already brought the price tag to $4 billion. That figure is widely considered to have been pulled out of thin air, again, since the aircraft are not even on the drawing board yet. \nThe Chicago Tribune article, written by Robert Reed, profiled Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing's CEO, and quotes him several times. \n\"Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world. One in every 3 of those 737s were bound for China. And about a quarter of all our airplane deliveries … were bound for Chinese customers,\" the Boeing CEO told the Chicago Tribune . \"I'm not a political pundit or prognosticator — we have too many of those — but anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" he also said. \nBut it was this three-paragraph conclusion that might have caused the Trump tweet: \nMuilenburg suggests the Trump team, and Congress, back off from the 2016 anti-trade rhetoric and perceived threats to punish other countries with higher tariffs or fees. \nInstead, he suggests they get down to the business of advocating a stronger U.S. agenda during ongoing or upcoming trade negotiations with other countries. \n\"If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,\" he said. \nJustin Wolfers, an economist, economics professor, and contributing columnist at The New York Times offered this warning and insight in response to Harwood's observation that the Tribune article may have set of the president-elect: If this is cause and effect, it's chilling... warning business leaders not to criticize PEOTUS, or he'll pull federal contracts to retaliate https://t.co/CWJpKglYL8 — Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) December 6, 2016 \nWolfers and Harwood aren't alone. Chicago Tribune reporter Robert Reed, who wrote the piece that may have pushed Trump to tweet, followed up later with a new take: \" Trump's tough tweet goal: Rattle Boeing .\" \n\"Trump's singling out a major U.S. company in such an adversarial manner may be unprecedented,\" Reed writes. \"While other incoming and sitting presidents have criticized industries, unions and business groups, it's unusual for one to focus on a single company, especially when you consider Boeing is also a contractor tied to the nation's defense industry.\" \nAnd Reed makes it clear: \n\" Maybe Trump's Air Force One salvo is a down-and-dirty response to Muilenburg's suggestion that the new presidential team, and Congress, cool the anti-trade rhetoric.\" \n\" Whatever his intent, Trump is telling Boeing that he's watching, so it better watch out.\" \nWelcome to Trump's America. \nImage by US Dept.

What exists right now are contracts for $169 million to design the replacements, because the current planes reach the end of their expected 30 year lifespan next year. Even going according to schedule, the new planes won't be ready for five years after that. \nBut why did Donald Trump suddenly take to Twitter to denounce Boeing for an \"out of control\" \"$4 billion\" contract for a replacement Air Force One? TPM notes that it quite possibly could be a tantrum-fueled attempt to damage the company after Trump read earlier in the morning that someone at Boeing criticized him . [A] Google search (which is obviously an imperfect measure) suggests that the Tribune story was the only published mention of the [Boeing] speech in the last 24 hours prior to Trump's tweet. It seems at least plausible that the Tribune story was the first or one of the first reports of the speech Trump or his team saw. \nWhat appears to have happened is that earlier this morning, the Chicago Tribune published a story reporting that a Boeing executive had some skeptical things to say about Donald Trump. We already know that Trump obsessively scans the news for critical mentions of himself. (We also know that he reacts to news he sees with immediate tweeted policy proposals, as when he Twitter-mused about stripping citizenship from Americans who might burn a flag as an apparent response to a Fox & Friends segment on flag burning that had aired just beforehand. The man is a child.) \nIn any event, a mere twenty minutes or so after the Tribune story about a Boeing executive criticizing him was published, Trump suddenly found a strong opinion over one particular Boeing contract, declared it \"out of control,\" and demanded it be canceled. \nThe result was a new out-of-nowhere presidential demand, and a sudden nosedive for Boeing’s stock. \nSome justifiably cynical reporters were quick to wonder whether Trump himself is a stakeholder in Boeing and perhaps is playing the market behind the scenes on this one. Spokesman Jason Miller denied it, declaring that Trump had sold his stocks last June , but it's distinctly possible that this is a flat lie. There's no evidence of it in his financial filings, and he's lied about this precise thing before. x \nDo NOT believe Trump sold his stocks in June w/o documents proving it. He told me that precise lie - proven false by SEC filings -- in 1987. — Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 6, 2016 \nTrump making a net profit off his own tweets would indeed be an interesting story, but even without that bit of full-on corruption this appears to be Trump using the power of the office to punish companies whose executives don't agree with his own policies. That's, well, nuts. It's policymaking by a toddler. It's unhinged. \nSo it's going to be interesting to see if Der Pumpkinfuhrer can come up with any other possible excuse for suddenly wanting to cancel a Boeing contract (while lying about its costs) other than because he just read a story in which a Boeing executive expressed disagreement with him and had a major policy-making tantrum over it. Odds are good that he can't, and Trump really is just making radical administrative changes each morning based on whether somebody somewhere hurt his citrus-hued fee-fees.",

      "text": "Pin it Share President-elect Donald Trump unexpectedly started negotiating with Boeing ( BA ) over the price of a new Air Force One on Tuesday morning. First over Twitter ( TWTR ) , Trump threatened to cancel the order for a new Air Force One, which would be used for future presidents. He said the cost of the new 747 was more than $4 billion. View photos Then in the Trump Tower lobby, the president-elect amplified his message. \"Well the plane is totally out of control, it's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program,\" he said. \"I think it's ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" In January, Boeing won a contract to start preliminary work on a new Air Force One program. The Air Force awarded Boeing an initial contract worth nearly $26 million to reduce risk and lower cost, Reuters reported. The Air Force has previously said that it planned $1.65 billion for two replacement jets, Reuters reported. Noting that the current Air Force One is 25 years old, a source familiar with the Boeing Air Force One contract told CNBC that if the program does not move forward, it could be years before the president ever flies on a new one. In a statement, Boeing said: \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" According to the Department of Defense budget there's about $2.8 billion dollars allotted on the project until fiscal 2021. The document didn't put a total figure on the cost. The figure was marked as \"continuing\" under cost to complete. The Government Accountability Office said last year the cost could be about $3.2 billion, NBC News reported. It added by the time the aircraft is delivered it could be over $4 billion. When asked by reporters about the money already spent by Boeing, Trump said, \"They've got to work that out.\" The White House said on Tuesday some of the statistics cited by Trump on Air Force One don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing and the Department of Defense, and Americans would expect future presidents would benefit from upgrades. Before Trump's tweet, Boeing was trading at $152.16 a share. After the tweet, it fell, as much as 1 percent, but later recovered those losses and ended the session about flat. In Trump's 2016 financial disclosure, filed in May, he listed owning $50,001 to $100,000 of Boeing shares and listed the income from those dividends at $1,001 to $2,500. Trump's spokesperson Jason Miller reportedly said the president-elect sold all of his Boeing stock back in June. Last month, a report said that Trump can get paid for Secret Service agents that fly on his plane. The stock is up more than 5 percent year to date.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nTrump later told reporters the cost was \"ridiculous\" and that he wanted the aircraft maker to \"make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized airborne symbols of the American presidency.\n___\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n___\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nWhile that is true, the current aircraft that the president uses for the bulk of his foreign and domestic travel are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. Two variants of a Boeing 747 are in rotation. The planes were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One took President Barack Obama on a trip to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nAir Force One, the distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal, is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that take advantage of the most-up-to-date advances in technology.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who travel with him aboard Air Force One enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite that can function as an operating room, in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.\n___\nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE IN THE PROJECT?\nSo far, the Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added a commercial aircraft the president would use. Boeing has that contract. It would also build the replacement Air Force One.\n___\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor in Washington, David Koenig in Dallas and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "7 Hours Ago › \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's comments slamming Boeing's new Air Force One 747 airplane's $4 billion cost as being too high is being challenged by some analysts who also maintain the aircraft is absolutely necessary and worth it. \nStill, pressure from Trump could lead to changes in the program such as the farming out integration work on the equipment and other systems on board the new Air Force One jumbo jets to a company other than Boeing. That would presumably mean Boeing would deliver the plane without all the special defensive and other equipment required for the 747 to operate as a flying command post during emergencies and wartime. \n\"This is being targeted because it's high profile, not because it's high dollar,\" said Chris Higgins, a Morningstar defense analyst in Chicago. \nOn Tuesday morning, the President-elect tweeted: \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nHiggins called the roughly $4 billion cost of the two presidential replacement jumbo jets \"kind of peanuts\" compared with larger big-ticket programs in the Air Force portfolio, including the F-35 joint strike fighter program from Lockheed Martin as well as Boeing's $80 billion aerial tanker program and Northrop Grumman's B-21 long-range strike bomber reported to cost tens of billions of dollars. \n\"It's not a matter of if it will be replaced, but when,\" said Higgins. \"They can continue to operate the current ones and extend their life. But it becomes more and more costly to do so given how old they are.\" \nHiggins noted that Trump as a candidate also made unfavorable comments about the F-35 , which is a program that includes purchases from all major branches of the U.S. military as well as key allies. \"[Trump] seems in some of the comments that he's making to favor more spending on troops and manpower and readiness than on high-end military hardware.\" \nThe Air Force has a little less than $3 billion budgeted for research and development of the two new 747 Presidential jumbo jets through 2021 under the current budget request, or a figure above earlier budget estimates of $1.65 billion. Also, there's believed to be nearly $800 million planned for procurement of the presidential planes so that would put the latest cost at roughly $4 billion. \n\"There might be cost overruns one day but there haven't been so far,\" said Richard Aboulafia, a senior aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. \nBoeing hasn't even started building the new Air Force One wide-body jet models known as 747-8, which would replace two 747-200s that date back to the early 1990s. Both of the current 747s used to fly the president are approaching the end of their 30-year life span. \nBoeing issued a statement Tuesday that seemed to imply they may be flexible on terms of the Air Force One program. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nTrump's transition team didn't respond to requests for further comment. The Air Force also declined comment when contacted. \nAboulafia suggested that Trump's comments may reflect a \"misunderstanding of what a president needs and what a president does. It [Air Force One] has the ability to direct and manage war in wartime and survive a war. It is an incredibly complex and expensive aircraft.\" \nTrump personally owns a Boeing 757 luxury jet that is outfitted with opulent amenities but analysts said that aircraft would require extensive and expensive upgrades to compare with the current model of Air Force One planes with technology that can serve as a military command post and refueling capabilities while in flight. \nBoeing's 747-8 aircraft — the largest model in the iconic 747 series — costs around $379 million each. With two 747s, that would get a total price tag of about $758 million just to procure two of the commercial jetliner versions of the planes. The actual cost in the current budget request is for $2.7 billion in R&D development costs for the two replacement Air Force One 747 aircraft. \n\"I'm skeptical about how much development do they really need to do for this (Air Force One replacement program),\" said Dan Grazier, a former Marine Corps captain and defense industry expert at the Project On Government Oversight, a Washington watchdog group. \"It's not like they're designing a brand new plane from the ground up. They already have the design, they already build 747s, and they have them in service.\" \nAdded Grazier, \"There will be some upgrades and things like that but I would be skeptical too if I was looking at this program from President-elect Trump's view,\" said Grazer. \"That does seem excessive that they need to spend that much money to further develop a plane already flying.\" \nMeantime, others say the newer Air Force Ones will be more efficient from a fuel perspective and maintenance standpoint. Moreover, it will have newer equipment and the latest defensive technology that will provided added safety for future presidents. The current Air Force One plane was used by President Bush during 9/11 as a command post when the U.S. was under attack by terrorists. \nBoeing, an aerospace giant known for its jumbo jets and tech prowess in building previous Air Force Ones, would seem to be the obvious choice to supply new presidential planes but that U.S. government could decide buy the two 747 jumbo jets from the Chicago-based manufacturer and then move the integration and installation work to another company. \nThe integration work would involve the missile defense systems capabilities on board the aircraft, special communications and electronic equipment, cutting-edge avionics and advanced technology that allows the plane to serve essentially as a military command post. Kevin Dietsch | Pool | Bloomberg Air Force One sits on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. \nYet splitting the integration work outside Boeing might be difficult since the aerospace giant knows the aircraft well, having manufactured it and building previous Air Force Ones. Also, taking the integration work to another company might not lower the cost. \nBack in 2009, the presidential Marine One helicopter replacement program generated headlines when the cost of brand new VH-71 Kestrel helicopters from Lockheed Martin ballooned from $6 billion to $13 billion. It ultimately led to the cancellation of the program by President Obama. The new Marine One, based on Lockheed's Sikorsky S-92, will instead be based on existing helicopter technology. \nThe controversy surrounding the new Air Force One planes comes amid softening demand for Boeing's iconic 747 aircraft and uncertainty surrounding the future of the presidential replacement program could threaten jobs at the manufacturer's aerospace facilities in Washington state. In particular, analysts suggested the jobs of engineers working on defense-type aircraft could be at risk. \nAt present, one of the largest confirmed orders for 747-8 model planes is 14 planes from United Parcel Service for $5.3 billion. That single deal for cargo jets has been held out as one that will keep thousands of jobs for the 747 program's commercial program. Prior to that, the aging 747 plane had seen reduced orders due to more demand for newer models. \nThere are a total of 558 of the Boeing 747 airplanes flying today, with 292 of them for cargo purposes and the remainder largely for passenger service. \nLast year, Boeing delivered just over 760 commercial airplanes and this year has a target to deliver 745 to 750 aircraft so the potential loss of two replacement Air Force Ones may not be significant from a financial standpoint, according to analysts. More importantly, they suggest the presidential aircraft is a symbol of prestige for the U.S. manufacturer around the globe.",

      "title": "Op-Ed: Trump’s Air Force One tweet was a brilliant move",
      "text": "SHARES Saul Loeb | AFP| Getty Images Air Force One, a heavily modified Boeing 747, is seen prior to US President Barack Obama departure from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, December 6, 2016, as he travels to Tampa, Florida, to speak about counterterrorism and visit with troops. \nAnother day, another provocative tweet from President-elect Donald Trump . This time, he went after Boeing and the cost of the new Air Force One replacement program. But while the target was different, the goal of Trump's twitter use remains the same: It's his negotiating tool and, just as importantly, an instant link to public support that no president has ever been able to use before. Trump tweet \nBut why this tweet and comments and why now? As few people knew before now, the Air Force is actually currently in negotiations with Boeing on the final costs of the two new Air Force One jets it hopes to buy and have in service by 2024. The source of Trump's $4 billion cost figure in his tweet is not so clear, but the last publicly reported estimate was at $3 billion with costs still rising. Sure, there are a lot of spending programs that cost more that Trump could target. But are there many more that are as easy for all the voters to understand? Air Force One is an iconic jet that we all know exists and almost everyone can picture quickly in their minds. Our social media/short attention span media culture makes this issue absolutely perfect for Trump to single out on Twitter. \nAnd it looks like it may have already worked. About two hours after the tweet, Boeing delivered the following statement: \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nYes, that \"at the best value\" phrase at the end of the statement says it all. Who knows exactly how much the Trump tweet just saved the American taxpayers? But considering that it cost him and us nothing for him to send it, even a few hundred grand looks like a big net windfall. \nAnd that's not the only reason why the use of Twitter remains crucial to Trump. Every President of the United States has had the option to use public opinion to promote his agenda, but none before Trump has had an established and instantaneous link with his supporters like he has with Twitter. In the past, the best a president could do was go on national TV and make a long speech. That's tortuous compared to the quick bang Trump gets by tweeting directly to his 16 million-plus followers and the tens of millions more who instantly hear about his tweets from the news media. \"Saving us some money, even if it's just a little bit of money, on the new Air Force One jets is something just about every voter wants ... Like the Carrier deal, this might be a very small win on the economic scale, but it's a lot bigger on the political scale of public opinion.\" \nA lot of people still think that Trump is extremely foolish for tweeting like this as opposed to using the established forms of presidential communication. But the really foolish move would be going on national TV even once to discuss the ongoing Boeing negotiations that at best may save the taxpayers a few hundred million bucks. Twitter is instant. It's easy. And as the Carrier deal proved, it's a great way to either initiate or seal an ongoing negotiation. \nAnd, it's worth noting that, while the dollars saved or number of jobs kept in the country from these two incidents are relatively small, they both involve two key members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Boeing and Carrier-parent United Technologies . In pure market cap alone, Trump is really getting a lot of bang for his Twitter buck. \nAnd, there's another good reason why Trump probably singled out the Air Force One program: Trump has had a lot of public images during his career, from hotel and luxury apartment developer to casino magnate to sports team owner to golf club developer to reality show star to politician. But the one attribute he always insists repeating about himself is that he's a person who gets projects done on time and under budget. And with that in mind, it must be killing the President-elect that one of the top stories in New York City right now is the ongoing price tag the city is incurring to provide Trump extra protection. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio publicly said Monday that the cost is $1 million and he's sent a $35 million cumulative bill to the federal government to cover it. \nIn that light, is there a better way for Trump to distract from the message of that cost-of-protection story and cast himself as someone who wants to sacrifice the personal luxury and monetary costs of the presidency? \nTrump is a president who seems to be clinging to boosting and protecting his personal image as his most important asset and ideology. It sounds selfish, and it is. But politicians who do the best job of protecting their image tend to be the ones who understand the voters and what they really like the best. Saving us some money, even if it's just a little bit of money, on the new Air Force One jets is something just about every voter wants. It's a cost-cutting measure on something they know is needed but that they'll never get to enjoy themselves. Like the Carrier deal, this might be a very small win on the economic scale, but it's a lot bigger on the political scale of public opinion. \nAfter Tuesday the only question anyone should have about Trump is not whether he'll stop using Twitter once he's in office, but which company, program, or even person he'll use it to target next. \nCommentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

President-elect Donald Trump tweeted this morning that the government should cancel the order for the new Air Force One replacement from Boeing, citing the more than $4 billion price tag. Story Donald Trump says the U.S. is paying too much for its Air Force One program. Kai and Andrea talk with Gregory Sanders of the Center for Strategic and International Studies about what makes Air Force One so expensive and what Trump's tweets may tell us about his views on defense spending.

      "text": "A tweet from president-elect Donald Trump calling on the U.S. government to scrap an order with Boeing Co. for the development of a replacement for the Air Force One jet temporarily knocked about $1 billion US off the stock market value of the aircraft maker. \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.\n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" Trump later told reporters when he spoke in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York.\nReuters reported that Boeing has not begun building the two replacement aircraft for the current Air Force One, and has not been awarded the money for them. The company is currently working on design and engineering for the aircraft.\n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States,\" Boeing said in a statement.\nIt was not clear what Trump was using as the source for his claims about the cost of the planes.\nThe White House also said it didn't know where Trump got his figure.\nThe Government Accountability Office, the U.S. government's auditing arm, in March 2016 estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion US between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years.\nAccording to the Associated Press, U.S. military officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion US for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nBoeing aircraft have been used to shuttle U.S. presidents since 1943. The new replacements for Air Force One are due to be in service by 2024.\nIllustrating the power of Trump's words, shares of Boeing opened sharply lower at the start of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. After finishing Monday at $152.16, the stock opened at $150.84 and got as low as $150.02, representing a drop in stock market value of about $1 billion US.\nFollowing the initial shock, Boeing's stock regained ground to finish the day at $152.64.\nIn the wake of Trump's tweet, the Washington Post later reported that a Trump spokesman said the president-elect had sold all of his shares in companies earlier this year. Jay Miller didn't say why Trump had sold the shares or what he got for them.\nSelling his stock portfolio could solve an issue for Trump: concerns that his holdings could present potential conflicts of interest.",

      "text": "TOP 5363794 \nMike Pence told CNN’s Jake Tapper Tuesday that Donald Trump’s call to cancel Boeing’s new, Air Force One project is “using the bully pulpit on behalf of fiscal responsibility.” Mike Pence (Getty Images) \n“The President-elect is demonstrating today who the American people hired as our next president, a businessman that knows how to sharpen his pencils,” the Vice President-elect explained. “No sooner did he hear about a $4 billion contract for a couple of new installments of Air Force One that he said we should cancel the contract, put a hold on it.” (RELATED: Trump —‘Cancel Order’ For $4 Billion Air Force One) \n“He’s going to be a real champion for taxpayers and fiscal responsibility, and this is just the first installment.” \nWATCH: \n“Would you call that the bully pulpit even though he isn’t the president yet?” Tapper asked in response. “I mean, using the bully pulpit to send a signal to a company?” \n“I think you could call it the bully pulpit on behalf of fiscal responsibility,” Pence answered. “Not a message to a particular company.”",

      "text": "  \nEl Trumpo has seized the spotlight by the throat yet again today with his controversial tweet about Boeing , but some are thinking that there was an article that pushed him to do it. This story in which Boeing CEO expressed concerns about Trump's views on trade posted just before Trump tweet — https://t.co/aBvK87GzzW \nHere’s what might have angered el Trumpo: \nMuilenburg suggests the Trump team, and Congress, back off from the 2016 anti-trade rhetoric and perceived threats to punish other countries with higher tariffs or fees. \nInstead, he suggests they get down to the business of advocating a stronger U.S. agenda during ongoing or upcoming trade negotiations with other countries. \n“If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” he said. \nThis isn’t terribly critical, but Trump is notoriously thin-skinned and it’s not unlikely that he took them as criticisms. \nThe CEO also said that tariffs would hurt his company if Trump succeeded in implementing them: \n…in remarks before the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association last week, Muilenburg conceded there’s more populist concern about international pacts than before the 2016 election campaign. \n“I’m not a political pundit or prognosticator — we have too many of those — but anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,” he said. \nMuilenburg argues that international trade is essential to the U.S. economy and its importance is reflected in the “large and growing percentage of our business” coming from international sales, including commercial jet orders from China. \n“Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world. One in every 3 of those 737s were bound for China. And about a quarter of all our airplane deliveries … were bound for Chinese customers. This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985,” said Muilenburg, who began his Boeing career as an aerospace engineer. \nAgain, it all depends on how Trump would take these comments. Many believe he would never actually impose 35% tariffs and that it’s just a negotiating tactic to scare companies into doing what he wants. In Boeing’s case, at least we know they’re scared.",

      "title": "Boeing RESPONDS to Trump’s tweet on Air Force One",
      "text": "  \nBoeing has put out a press release on Air Force One this morning suggesting they are still just in the discovery phase of its contract with the DOD: \n— The Boeing Company (@Boeing) December 6, 2016 \nBoeing Statement on Air Force One \nCHICAGO, Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Boeing (NYSE: BA) today issued the following statement regarding the Air Force One program: \n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” \nSo it sounds like they aren’t even building it yet. Perhaps they’ve suggested it could cost $4 billion and Trump is using the bully pulpit to drive the price tag down? I don’t know, but there seems to be a rift of information we don’t have between Trump’s tweet and this press release from Boeing.",

      "text": "  \nAs you know Trump attacked Boeing this morning, tweeting ‘cancel the order’ on the new Air Force One order that Trump says will cost $4 billion, suggesting Boeing is ripping us off. \nWell just wait until he sees this. He will go through the roof: \nST LOUIS POST DISPATCH – As a new American president bent on retaining American jobs prepares to take office, the Obama administration and the U.S. defense industry are working on a deal with the Indian government to build iconic U.S. combat aircraft in India. \nIn recent months, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have made proposals to the Indian government to manufacture fighter jets — the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the F/A-18 Super Hornet — in India as the country seeks to modernize its rapidly aging fleet of largely Russian-built airplanes. \nIn both cases, the aviation companies would be building production facilities in India; Lockheed Martin proposes to move its entire F-16 assembly line from Texas to India, making India the sole producer of the single-engine combat aircraft. \nThe U.S. military is phasing out the F-16 for its own use, but other countries remain as likely customers. \nThe proposals have the strong backing of the Obama administration, which has sought a closer connection with the Indian military in recent years. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said she was “optimistic” about the prospect of a deal after a visit to New Delhi in August, and Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter is set to return to India next week, with procurement high atop the list of discussion topics. \nMoving American jobs to india? How dare Boeing and Lockheed! Trump should take over their companies to prevent this! \nOh wait….sorry, I got a little carried away. He actually should NOT do that. But can you see how this type of populist authoritarianism can lead to people agreeing with a fascist move like this? Gotta protect the American worker at all costs! \nI should point out that this news was out there before Trump tweeted against Boeing this morning. So maybe he already saw it, but because Obama is backing the move to India, Trump can’t attack it yet so he takes a swipe at Boeing over their Air Force One order? Just throwing that out there.",

      "text": "  \nTrump tweeted this morning that Boeing should cancel the order for the new Air Force One because it costs more than $4 billion: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \nHe later elaborated on the tweet to the press: \n“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous,” he said. “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nSo he’s suggesting that Boeing is ripping off the American people with the $4 billion in cost. But according to Politico, the cost is much less : \nThe Air Force said previously that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two new presidential aircraft, which will be four-engine Boeing 747-8s. \nSo that comes out to 825 million per plane? That’s a far cry different than $4 billion. But maybe Trump has some new information that we don’t have on the cost? I expect we’ll see more on this as the day continues because Trump’s tweet is all the rage in the media. \nAccording to Business Insider, Boeing’s shares fell after Trump tweeted this: Boeing shares fall after Trump tweets to cancel Air Force One order https://t.co/eyraJLUqMk pic.twitter.com/WxBjj0NVJX \n— Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) December 6, 2016 \nAt the close of the market on Monday, Boeing stock was at $152.16. The stock slipped in pre-market trading after Trump’s tweet. The stock then continued to dip in early trading, falling 0.9% to $150.90. \nBoeing did not immediately have a response to Trump’s tweet which he addressed in Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday. \nI should also note that while some were critical of the tweet from Trump, others, who you might not expect, applauded it: Don’t make me like you. https://t.co/n7aygzL9w1 \n— Charles C.

      "text": "Opinion Trump's Boeing provocation could backfire \nIt was only a matter of time before Donald Trump's attention would turn to Boeing, the U.S.'s largest exporter and its second-largest defense contractor. One of Boeing's biggest customers happens to be China, the country the president-elect seems most intent on antagonizing. \nOn Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted that the Pentagon should cancel an order with Boeing Co. for a modernized 747 Air Force One, the plane that ferries the president around the world, because of what he said were ridiculous cost overruns. His tweet pegged the plane's cost at \"more than $4 billion.\" \nThere is so much to unpack in this brief episode that it's hard to know where to begin. For starters, Boeing doesn't have an actual order to build the plane. It has a $170 million contract to begin development work to add communications and anti-missile equipment and mid-air refueling capabilities on 747-200 replacement planes that probably won't go into service until 2023. \nSo why did the president-elect choose this moment to fly off the handle? It may have been to capitalize on a Washington Post expose about a Pentagon cover-up of a report on wasteful administrative spending. What better way to show some populist outrage at the outgoing administration than by canceling new presidential planes, even if he's exaggerating the problem? \nThe Pentagon is budgeting $3.2 billion for research, development, construction and acquisition of new 747-8 planes through 2021, says Kevin Brancato, a Bloomberg Government contracts analyst. After those initial expenses, the new jets will cost taxpayers about $225 million apiece, largely to tailor the planes specifically for the needs of the president. \nThey would replace outdated versions that have been flying presidents since George H.W. Bush was in office. \"This is what an Air Force One costs,\" Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group, tells Bloomberg News. \"There have been no cost overruns.\" \nThis is not the first time Trump has stretched the facts to describe Boeing's behavior. In February, he complained that the company was \"building massive planes in China.\" Not exactly. Boeing's plant in China installs seats on smaller, single-aisle 737 jetliners specifically for that country's airlines. \nIf China pushes back on Trump's recent provocations, Boeing could well lose a huge chunk of business, along with many U.S. jobs. Since 2000, Boeing has delivered almost 1,000 aircraft worth $60 billion to China. That's just the beginning: Over the next 20 years, the Chinese airplane market is expected to reach $1 trillion. \nIf Boeing doesn't sell planes to China, the only other maker of long-distance jumbo jets, Airbus Group, would get the business -- and European workers would get the jobs. U.S. parts suppliers would also lose jobs, probably including some at General Electric, which makes the engines for Boeing's new 747-8 model. \nWhat are the chances of this happening? Pretty good, I'd say. If Trump makes good on his threats to impose tariffs as high as 45 percent on Chinese exports to the U.S., \"China will take a tit-for-tat approach,\" the Chinese government-controlled Global Times wrote in a Nov. 13 editorial. \"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus.\" \nShould that happen, thousands of blue-collar manufacturing jobs of the kind candidate Trump lamented were being lost in the U.S. would disappear, putting at risk the U.S.'s largest exporter. President-elect Trump would achieve exactly the opposite of what candidate Trump claimed he would do. \nPaula Dwyer is a columnist for Bloomberg View.",

      "title": "Donald Trump - Fact-checking Donald Trump's tweet on Air Force One, Boeing",
      "text": "\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" — Donald Trump on Tuesday, December 6th, 2016 in a tweet Fact-checking Donald Trump's tweet on Air Force One, Boeing   Tuesday, December 6th, 2016 at 5:33 p.m. We took a closer look at a tweet in which Donald Trump criticized Boeing for spiraling costs on the new fleet of Air Force Ones. President Barack Obama arrives aboard Air Force One at Tampa International Airport on Dec. 6, 2016. (Doug Mills/New York Times) \n  tweeted criticism about Boeing, the lead contractor on the next generation of Air Force Ones, early in the morning on Dec. 6, 2016. \nTrump tweeted , \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nHe later elaborated to reporters staking out Trump Tower, \"Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program. I think it's ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nThe political and defense worlds and the stock market immediately took note, since Boeing is a major American corporation that gets a lot of Pentagon money and employs significant numbers of manufacturing workers in high-wage jobs. \nWhen we looked into Trump’s tweet, we found that Trump’s description of the contract lacks some context. (His press office did not respond to an inquiry.) \nSome background on the Air Force One replacement project \nAs the trade publication Defense One has noted , the two current Air Force Ones -- a modified version of a Boeing 747-200 aircraft known as VC-25 -- were purchased under President Ronald Reagan and were delivered in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush. With Boeing closing down its 747-200 production line 24 years ago, spare parts for the two current planes have become hard to find. And the plane is approaching the end of its expected 30-year life. \nSo during his second term, President Barack Obama ordered a replacement fleet. (By tradition, a president does not order planes that he will expect to use personally.) Since the old model of the basic aircraft isn’t being made any longer, a new one had to be created. The new model will be based on the Boeing 747-8, with four engines and two floors. \nTrump’s tweet referenced one plane, but the Air Force One program will actually produce two planes, not one. That allows one to undergo maintenance while the other one is available. \nOf course, Air Force One is more than just a plane. It’s also a mobile command center, with state-of-the-art communications and safety features. \nThe plane must be able to refuel while flying, and the president and his staff need to have communications capabilities equivalent to what is in the Oval Office -- secure video conferences, classified computer access, and nuclear-strike controls. It also needs robust defensive systems such as missile evasion. \nThe new planes will be \"both the fastest and longest commercial airliner in the world,\" according to military.com . They will be able to fly 7,730 nautical miles -- nearly 1,000 more than the current planes -- and will produce 16 tons less of carbon dioxide on a typical flight, according to the company. \nThe extra features, obviously, do not come cheap. In fact, they comprise the bulk of the planes’ cost. Each basic plane costs about $380 million, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group Corporation, an aerospace and defense market analysis firm. Ultimately, Aboulafia said, the basic aircraft itself will account for just one-fifth of the entire project cost. \nHow much will the project cost? \nThe Air Force has published a budgetary document that says research, development, testing and evaluation of the new Air Force Ones -- officially known as the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization -- will cost $2.87 billion between fiscal years 2015 and 2021. However, the project is expected to extend beyond 2021, and experts told PolitiFact it would likely require another $1 billion in subsequent years to finish the job. The Teal Group has estimated that the project will require an additional $858 million between fiscal years 2022 and 2026. \nThat adds up to a grand total of $3.73 billion over 12 years. That’s not \"more than $4 billion,\" as Trump said, but it’s reasonably close -- and it’s no secret that defense contracts have a history of escalating in cost over time. Already, in response to inquiries from the media after Trump’s tweet, an Air Force spokesman told reporters to expect the interim $2.7 billion figure \"to change as the program matures.\" \nSo as a raw number, Trump’s $4 billion figure is in the ballpark. \nWe should add that none of this price-tag includes operations and maintenance, such as aviation fuel, maintenance and pilot salaries. \n\"Operations and maintenance are an inherent part of any such program,\" said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. \"Canada was in line to buy the F-35, but then realized that they would actually had to operate the things, and they had sticker shock. Malaysia bought a bunch of MiG-29s without a service contract, to save money, and they soon turned into hangar queens.\" \nSuch future costs would not involve Boeing, which is tasked with designing and building the planes, not operating them. \nWhat the tweet leaves out \nClearly, $4 billion is a lot of money. But it’s important to keep some context in mind. \nFirst, it’s not clear that Boeing is behind any spiraling of costs; the demands of the project are dictated by the federal government. \nIn addition, while Boeing is serving as the lead contractor on the project, much of the project’s costs are going for electronics and other items that Boeing itself does not produce. If costs on such items are going to go down, Boeing can’t do that directly. To cut such costs, \"it is up to Boeing to jawbone their subcontractors,\" Pike said. \nBoeing offered some spin of its own in the statement it released after Trump’s tweet. \nIn the statement, Boeing said: \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nBy citing only the $170 million allocated to date, the company is ignoring the overwhelming majority of dollars for the project that the company expects to be paid in future years. \nSecond, it’s important to note that the nearly $4 billion figure for the project as a whole is scheduled to be paid out over 12 years, not all at once. And in the context of the entire defense budget, that makes it a pretty small slice. \nThe most recent presidential budget proposal shows defense spending between 2015 and 2026 equaling $8.132 trillion. So the Air Force One project amounts to four-one-hundredths of 1 percent of all defense spending over that 12-year time frame. \nIt’s also a modest project within Boeing’s ledger of business. In 2015, Boeing had $96 billion in revenues . If one assumes the same revenues for all 12 years of the Air Force One project, then the project will account for three-tenths of 1 percent of the company’s overall revenues. Even looking just at the company’s defense, space and security revenues, the Air Force One project would represent about 1 percent. \nFinally, Trump’s contention that spending is \"out of control\" is more open to debate. While the program is expensive, it’s so new that it hasn’t busted through budgetary targets yet. \"There have been no overruns,\" Aboulafia said. \"This has always been the plan.\" \nOur ruling \nTrump tweeted, \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nThe company is actually building two planes, not one. As for the price tag, Trump has more of a point. The project’s current cost is $3.73 billion, which is within shouting distance of Trump’s \"more than $4 billion.\" That’s a projection over 12 years. Also, that figure is an amount that could rise as time goes on. \nHowever, Trump glosses over some important context. National-security requirements, not Boeing, have been the primary driver of high costs. Experts say the costs are broadly in line considering the high-tech and security requirements of a presidential plane. \nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

      "text": "Citing cost overruns, Trump says Boeing's contract to build Air Force One should be canceled By Christian Davenport • Washington Post 4 hrs ago \nBoeing's Chicago headquarters. \nUpdated at 12:18 p.m. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of the high cost of the program. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nBoeing was selected as the manufacturer in January 2015, but it wasn't much of a competition. Boeing's 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being \"consistent with the national public interest,\" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time. \nShe insisted that the Pentagon \"will insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.\" \nTalking to reporters Tuesday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump explained his tweet: \"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nThe Air Force and Boeing didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. \nRichard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump's tweet was \"completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing. But it's very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium.\" \nLoren Thompson, a defense consultant, said that \"Air Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances -- like nuclear war.\" The price tag, he said, \"is driven by the demands of the mission.\" \nBoeing is under contract to build two planes to serve as Air Force One, said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"I think once [Trump] sees an actual Air Force One and the unique capabilities it is outfitted with he may start to understand why it is so expensive to replace,\" Harrison said. \nAir Force one is a symbol of presidential power at home and abroad. But it is also a \"flying command post,\" as Harrison said. \"In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe,\" he said. \nTrump's tweet was reminiscent of when Sen. John McCain took aim at the fleet of presidential helicopters at the beginning of the Obama administration, saying in 2009, \"I don't think that there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money.\" \nPresident Barack Obama, then just a few weeks in office, said the fleet was \"an example of the procurement process gone amok,\" leading defense officials to kill the program outright and then restart the procurement process. By then, the helicopter program was well underway and did have significant problems.",

      "text": "F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, in a photo provided by Boeing. Lockheed and Boeing propose to make F-16s and F/A-18s in India By Annie Gowen • Washington Post 13 hrs ago Courtesy Boeing \nF/A-18E/F Super Hornets, in a photo provided by Boeing. \nNEW DELHI • As a new American president bent on retaining American jobs prepares to take office, the Obama administration and the U.S. defense industry are working on a deal with the Indian government to build iconic U.S. combat aircraft in India. \nIn recent months, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have made proposals to the Indian government to manufacture fighter jets — the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the F/A-18 Super Hornet — in India as the country seeks to modernize its rapidly aging fleet of largely Russian-built airplanes. \nIn both cases, the aviation companies would be building production facilities in India; Lockheed Martin proposes to move its entire F-16 assembly line from Texas to India, making India the sole producer of the single-engine combat aircraft. \nThe U.S. military is phasing out the F-16 for its own use, but other countries remain as likely customers. \nThe proposals have the strong backing of the Obama administration, which has sought a closer connection with the Indian military in recent years. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said she was \"optimistic\" about the prospect of a deal after a visit to New Delhi in August, and Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter is set to return to India next week, with procurement high atop the list of discussion topics. \nBut the election of a billionaire businessman focused on keeping jobs at home, rather than creating them overseas, has brought a measure of uncertainty to the talks. \n\"What will be the U.S. policy posture now that the new president-elect is in the mix?\" said one high-level official at an American defense firm in India, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal negotiations. \"Is he going to continue the policy of engaging in India on co-production and co-development? All of those are unknown at this point.\" \nOn Thursday, President-elect Donald Trump appeared at a Carrier plant in Indiana where his team had brokered a deal to save about 1,000 jobs, and on Sunday he let fire a series of tweets that implied a new tax penalty on goods produced by companies that leave the United States. \n\"Please be forewarned prior to making a very expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" he tweeted. \nOn the campaign trail he had railed against job losses to Asia and Mexico. \n\"We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the world,\" Trump said last month, citing American companies that have laid off workers and moved jobs to India, Singapore and Mexico. \"It's getting worse and worse and worse.\" \nOfficials at Lockheed Martin and Boeing said that any partnership to manufacture jets in India would not result in a net loss of American jobs but would create Indian employment — about 1,000 positions in the case of Lockheed Martin. \nAbout 300 mechanics on the Fort Worth assembly line would be moved to the F-35 assembly line at the same plant. Others would be given an opportunity to apply for other jobs on the newer F-35, Lockheed officials said, although they concede that some positions would be lost in the move because of attrition or retirements. \n\"I see this as a great opportunity for all parties involved,\" said Randy Howard, director of business development for Lockheed's integrated fighter group. \"It doesn't take jobs away from the U.S., it extends existing jobs, and not just for Fort Worth but for many other companies around the U.S. that build parts for the F-16.\" \nNevertheless, workers in Fort Worth say they are worried about the future. \n\"Wouldn't you be?\" said Earnest Boone, president of the District Lodge 776, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents Lockheed employees. \nIn October, the Indian government sent a letter to foreign missions and aerospace manufacturers inquiring about single-engine fighter aircraft that could be manufactured locally. \nIndia wants to co-produce the fighter jets as part of its Make in India program, which has the lofty goal of expanding the manufacturing base to 25 percent of the gross domestic product in the next six years.",

      "text": "Illustration by Jason Reed Trump's criticism of Boeing may have been retaliatory. \nDonald Trump ’s tirade on Twitter against aircraft manufacturer Boeing sent the company’s stock tumbling nearly $2 a share before markets opened on Tuesday, leaving many to wonder what prompted the president-elect’s sudden criticism. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \nTrump called for the U.S. Air Force to cancel Boeing’s contract related to the production of two new, highly customized Boeing 747-8 aircraft designed to fly future presidents of the United States. \nBoeing’s current contract is for $170 million, which does not include the cost of “purchasing or modifying the airplanes as necessary to deliver Air Force One,” a spokesman for the company told the Daily Dot. The company declined to comment on the possible motives of Trump’s tweet, which claimed, “costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.” \nThe answer may lie in a Chicago Tribune column published less than 30 minutes before Trump's tweet, one that reflected Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's apprehension over Trump's indelicate handling of U.S.–China relations . \nAccording to the Tribune , Muilenburg is urging Trump and the GOP to back off the inflammatory rhetoric hurled at China over the past week. (During the diplomatic row over Trump's controversial Taiwan phone call, an advisor to the president-elect told reporters that “if China doesn't like it, screw ‘em.”) \nMuilenburg argues— correctly —that international trade is essential to the U.S. economy; roughly 11.5 million American jobs are supported by U.S. exports, according to the International Trade Administration. \nA third of the 495 Boeing 737 airliners manufactured in the company’s Renton, Washington, plant was bound for China, Muilenburg said. “And about a quarter of all our airplane deliveries … were bound for Chinese customers.” As the Tribune reports, U.S. jobs hang in the balance: A steady influx of China commercial jet orders means more work for Boeing's thousands of U.S. workers while also providing lift for its network of domestic parts supplier and vendors. Around 90 percent of Boeing's total workforce of 151,000 people and 80 percent of its thousands of suppliers are U.S.-based, according to Boeing. \nIt’s unprecedented for a president-elect to nonchalantly target a major U.S. company during an apparent retaliatory tantrum—but such a fit is in no way unusual for Trump, the real estate mogul turned reality TV star turned U.S. leader. \nIn early October, candidate Trump promised, once elected, to use his influence and power to retaliate against conservative lawmakers who didn’t support him after a video surfaced in which Trump boasted about getting away with sexual assault. \nIt’s unclear where Trump got his “$4 billion” figure, though it could be on the mark. The Government Accountability Office said last year the cost of the project, including research, development, and production, could reach $3.2 billion. The Air Force would still have to purchase the two aircraft, ostensibly shooting the final price tag up over $4 billion. \nWhether or not that really is too costly for a pair of planes meant to protect the life of U.S. presidents for decades is a different story. “We look forward,” Boeing said in a statement, “to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.”",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing&apos;s contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nThe New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was \"ridiculous,\" though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, \"but not that much.\"\nHere&apos;s a look at Trump&apos;s claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.\n---\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government&apos;s auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump&apos;s figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n---\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN&apos;T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nThat&apos;s true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.\n---\nWHAT IS BOEING&apos;S ROLE?\nThe Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One.\nUnder the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. The new aircraft wouldn&apos;t be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump&apos;s second term, should he seek and win re-election.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force \"to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\n---\nCOULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT?\nIt&apos;s unclear. Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\n---\nDIDN&apos;T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER?\nEarnest, the White House spokesman, said Obama didn&apos;t scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected.\n---\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\n---\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor in Washington, David Koenig in Dallas and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.\n ",

      "text": "Close The Associated Press \nAir Force One, with President Barack Obama aboard, prepares to take off from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. President-elect Donald Trump wants the government's contract for a new Air Force One canceled. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Did Donald Trump tank Boeing's stock because he was mad about a news article? By Philip Bump • Washington Post 3 hrs ago ( … ) \nAir Force One, with President Barack Obama aboard, prepares to take off from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016. President-elect Donald Trump wants the government's contract for a new Air Force One canceled. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) The Associated Press \nShares of stock in aircraft manufacturer Boeing fell nearly $2 a share before markets opened on Tuesday. \nThe reason? A tweet from the president-elect. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nWere Boeing to lose a $4 billion contract, that would certainly cause people to be skeptical of future earnings. But this, as seems always to be the case with Donald Trump tweets, is not the full story. \nAs The Washington Post's Christian Davenport reports, the contract with Boeing is currently $170 million. The government's plan to replace Air Force One actually involves two different planes which would serve future presidents for years to come. Boeing won the contract in 2015; the new planes are expected to be operational in about a decade. The $170 million isn't for manufacturing, after all. It's for Boeing's work \"determin[ing] the capabilities\" of the planes they will eventually produce. \nIt was natural to wonder, given the apparently unprompted nature of Trump's tweet, if part of his comment was meant to suggest he would prefer to use his existing aircraft for the job of the presidency. His campaign spent $6.7 million on his personal aircraft after he announced his candidacy, and he has called Air Force One \"a step down\" from his personal aircraft \"in every way.\" (Not size, mind you.) Once Trump received a Secret Service detail, the agency paid $1.6 million for its agents to travel with him — money that went to TAG Air, a company owned by Trump. \nTrump's current plane is also a Boeing. \nThe Air Force wouldn't let Trump keep using his plane as president, though, unless it were significantly upgraded. As CNN reported earlier this month, Trump's personal plane would need to be upgraded with critical functionality to serve as his official aircraft. That includes missile detection and avoidance systems, electromagnetic shielding, mid-air refueling mechanisms and confidential communications systems. The cost of those upgrades would be up to Trump. \nAs it turns out, though, the Trump tweet may not have been unprompted. CNN's Jake Tapper noted on Twitter that shortly before the tweet (which was posted at 8:52 a.m. Eastern) the Chicago Tribune posted an interview with the company's CEO, Dennis Muilenberg. \n\"Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" Muilenberg told the Tribune's Robert Reed. Fair trade has helped Boeing, which prides itself on being America's largest manufacturing exporter.",

      "title": "Q&A: A look at Trump's call to cancel new Air Force One",
      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing&apos;s contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nThe New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was \"ridiculous,\" though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, \"but not that much.\"\nHere&apos;s a look at Trump&apos;s claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.\n---\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government&apos;s auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump&apos;s figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n---\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN&apos;T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nThat&apos;s true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nThe New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was \"ridiculous,\" though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, \"but not that much.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.\n___\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump's figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n___\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nThat's true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.\n___\nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE?\nThe Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One.\nUnder the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. The new aircraft wouldn't be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force \"to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\n___\nCOULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT?\nIt's unclear. Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\n___\nDIDN'T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER?\nEarnest, the White House spokesman, said Obama didn't scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected.\n___\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor in Washington, David Koenig in Dallas and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "  Trump's Air Force One slam could force changes to Boeing's 747 replacement program By Jeff Daniels | CNBC – 55 minutes ago \nBoeing stock reacts Trump calls Air Force One costs 'ridi... \nCNBC 0:34 President-elect Donald Trump's comments slamming Boeing's new Air Force One 747 airplane's $4 billion cost as being too high is being challenged by some analysts who also maintain the aircraft is absolutely necessary and worth it. \nStill, pressure from Trump could lead to changes in the program such as the farming out integration work on the equipment and other systems on board the new Air Force One jumbo jets to a company other than Boeing. That would presumably mean Boeing would deliver the plane without all the special defensive and other equipment required for the 747 to operate as a flying command post during emergencies and wartime. \n\"This is being targeted because it's high profile, not because it's high dollar,\" said Chris Higgins, a Morningstar defense analyst in Chicago. \nOn Tuesday morning, the President-elect tweeted: \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nHiggins called the roughly $4 billion cost of the two presidential replacement jumbo jets \"kind of peanuts\" compared with larger big-ticket programs in the Air Force portfolio, including the F-35 joint strike fighter program from Lockheed Martin as well as Boeing's $80 billion aerial tanker program and Northrop Grumman's B-21 long-range strike bomber reported to cost tens of billions of dollars. \n\"It's not a matter of if it will be replaced, but when,\" said Higgins. \"They can continue to operate the current ones and extend their life. But it becomes more and more costly to do so given how old they are.\" \nHiggins noted that Trump as a candidate also made unfavorable comments about the F-35 , which is a program that includes purchases from all major branches of the U.S. military as well as key allies. \"[Trump] seems in some of the comments that he's making to favor more spending on troops and manpower and readiness than on high-end military hardware.\" \nThe Air Force has a little less than $3 billion budgeted for research and development of the two new 747 Presidential jumbo jets through 2021 under the current budget request, or a figure above earlier budget estimates of $1.65 billion. Also, there's believed to be nearly $800 million planned for procurement of the presidential planes so that would put the latest cost at roughly $4 billion. \n\"There might be cost overruns one day but there haven't been so far,\" said Richard Aboulafia, a senior aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. \nBoeing hasn't even started building the new Air Force One wide-body jet models known as 747-8, which would replace two 747-200s that date back to the early 1990s. Both of the current 747s used to fly the president are approaching the end of their 30-year life span. \nBoeing issued a statement Tuesday that seemed to imply they may be flexible on terms of the Air Force One program. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nTrump's transition team didn't respond to requests for further comment. The Air Force also declined comment when contacted. \nAboulafia suggested that Trump's comments may reflect a \"misunderstanding of what a president needs and what a president does. It [Air Force One] has the ability to direct and manage war in wartime and survive a war. It is an incredibly complex and expensive aircraft.\" \nTrump personally owns a Boeing 757 luxury jet that is outfitted with opulent amenities but analysts said that aircraft would require extensive and expensive upgrades to compare with the current model of Air Force One planes with technology that can serve as a military command post and refueling capabilities while in flight. \nBoeing's 747-8 aircraft — the largest model in the iconic 747 series — costs around $379 million each. With two 747s, that would get a total price tag of about $758 million just to procure two of the commercial jetliner versions of the planes. The actual cost in the current budget request is for $2.7 billion in R&D development costs for the two replacement Air Force One 747 aircraft. \n\"I'm skeptical about how much development do they really need to do for this (Air Force One replacement program),\" said Dan Grazier, a former Marine Corps captain and defense industry expert at the Project On Government Oversight, a Washington watchdog group. \"It's not like they're designing a brand new plane from the ground up. They already have the design, they already build 747s, and they have them in service.\" \nAdded Grazier, \"There will be some upgrades and things like that but I would be skeptical too if I was looking at this program from President-elect Trump's view,\" said Grazer. \"That does seem excessive that they need to spend that much money to further develop a plane already flying.\" \nMeantime, others say the newer Air Force Ones will be more efficient from a fuel perspective and maintenance standpoint. Moreover, it will have newer equipment and the latest defensive technology that will provided added safety for future presidents. The current Air Force One plane was used by President Bush during 9/11 as a command post when the U.S. was under attack by terrorists. \nBoeing, an aerospace giant known for its jumbo jets and tech prowess in building previous Air Force Ones, would seem to be the obvious choice to supply new presidential planes but that U.S. government could decide buy the two 747 jumbo jets from the Chicago-based manufacturer and then move the integration and installation work to another company. \nThe integration work would involve the missile defense systems capabilities on board the aircraft, special communications and electronic equipment, cutting-edge avionics and advanced technology that allows the plane to serve essentially as a military command post. \nYet splitting the integration work outside Boeing might be difficult since the aerospace giant knows the aircraft well, having manufactured it and building previous Air Force Ones. Also, taking the integration work to another company might not lower the cost. \nBack in 2009, the presidential Marine One helicopter replacement program generated headlines when the cost of brand new VH-71 Kestrel helicopters from Lockheed Martin ballooned from $6 billion to $13 billion. It ultimately led to the cancellation of the program by President Obama. The new Marine One, based on Lockheed's Sikorsky S-92, will instead be based on existing helicopter technology. \nThe controversy surrounding the new Air Force One planes comes amid softening demand for Boeing's iconic 747 aircraft and uncertainty surrounding the future of the presidential replacement program could threaten jobs at the manufacturer's aerospace facilities in Washington state. In particular, analysts suggested the jobs of engineers working on defense-type aircraft could be at risk. \nAt present, one of the largest confirmed orders for 747-8 model planes is 14 planes from United Parcel Service for $5.3 billion. That single deal for cargo jets has been held out as one that will keep thousands of jobs for the 747 program's commercial program. Prior to that, the aging 747 plane had seen reduced orders due to more demand for newer models. \nThere are a total of 558 of the Boeing 747 airplanes flying today, with 292 of them for cargo purposes and the remainder largely for passenger service. \nLast year, Boeing delivered just over 760 commercial airplanes and this year has a target to deliver 745 to 750 aircraft so the potential loss of two replacement Air Force Ones may not be significant from a financial standpoint, according to analysts. More importantly, they suggest the presidential aircraft is a symbol of prestige for the U.S. manufacturer around the globe.",

(Photo by Ty Wright/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump wants to cancel a government order for a new Air Force One. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet early Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nThe new Air Force One would be a 747-8, rather than the 747-200 which is now in use by President Obama. It has a longer range, can travel faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and it gets better fuel economy. \nBoeing, which is the nation’s largest exporter, has built the plane used by every president since Franklin Roosevelt.

      "title": "Q&A: A look at Trump's call to cancel new Air Force One",
      "text": "WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\" The New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was \"ridiculous,\" though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, \"but not that much.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.\n___\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defence Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump's figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n___\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nThat's true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refuelled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command centre in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, travelling journalists and other guests.\n___\nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE?\nThe Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One.\nUnder the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. The new aircraft wouldn't be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force \"to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\n___\nCOULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT?\nIt's unclear. Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\n___\nDIDN'T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER?\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama didn't scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected.\n___\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor in Washington, David Koenig in Dallas and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.\nDarlene Superville, The Associated Press",

      "text": "By Tess Stynes and Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. agreed to acquire Liquid Robotics, maker of a wave and solar-powered autonomous robot, building on a collaboration between the companies and expanding Boeing's capabilities in unmanned underwater vehicles.\nLiquid Robotics's ocean robot, called the Wave Glider, is used for ocean data collection and communications. In September of 2014 Boeing and Liquid Robotics entered a collaboration deal on a version of the Wave Glider to enhance its capabilities.\nFinancial terms weren't provided for the deal, the second acquisition of an unmanned undersea vehicle maker this year by a major defense firm. Rival General Dynamics Corp. acquired submarine robot maker Bluefin Robotics during February.\nBoeing executives have been upbeat about the future of the undersea business, though some rivals said the Navy has been slow to come up with deals for their use after encouraging industry to invest heavily in development.\n\"There's a lot happening,\" said Leanne Caret, chief executive of Boeing's defense arm in an interview on the sidelines of a defense conference last weekend.\nMs. Caret said Boeing had received inquiries from a number of potential government customers about the Echo Voyager, a 51-foot unmanned submarine it has already developed, as well as from companies in the energy sector that make extensive use of underwater vehicles.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 16:28 ET (21:28 ",

      "title": "What Does Trump Have Against Boeing and Air Force One?",
      "text": "Our story begins, as so many do these days, with a tweet from President-elect Donald Trump. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\n\nThe deal between the Pentagon and Boeing to outfit an updated presidential plane was announced last January, and was initially pegged at $26 million. The planes could use a face lift as they have been in service since 1990, during the administration of George H. W. Bush. \nIn July, the Defense Department then added on a $127.3 million dollar contract “to develop interior, power, and electric specifications” for the jets. In all, The Wall Street Journal reported, the Air Force has apparently earmarked $1.65 billion for two new aircraft — the four-engine Boeing 747-8s, the biggest, longest-range, and fastest version of the iconic jet. The Air Force has yet to break out the full cost or delivery schedule of the replacement jets, the WSJ said. \nBoeing initially scrambled to address a hostile tweet from the man slated to be one of the company’s highest-profile passengers. \nIn a statement Tuesday, Boeing said it is currently under contract for $170 million “to help determine the capabilities” of the presidential plane. “We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,” the company said. \nIt is not clear where Trump got the $4 billion figure for the cost of the new planes. In a call with reporters Tuesday morning, Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller said that Trump was including the cost of the new planes, plus the cost of research. (The presidential planes differ from stock 747s in plenty of ways, especially in their interior amenities and communications and electronics gear. But the 747-800 is Boeing’s latest version of its bubble-headed jet, and is not being specially designed for Air Force One.) \nMiller said that the president-elect was stressing the high price tag for taxpayers. It is even higher, he failed to note, than the $1 million a day New York City is spending on security for Trump, which will come to $1.4 billion over four years. \nThough Tuesday’s tweet came seemingly out of the blue, Trump has railed against Air Force One and Boeing for a good part of the campaign. \nIn June, he apparently sold all of his stock, including in Boeing. In July, he objected to the use of Air Force One for campaign events — “Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary,” he tweeted at the time — and railed at how much fuel the existing plane uses. Trump also derided the president’s Air Force One, mistakenly claiming that his own Boeing 757 — a smaller plane suitable for medium-range flights — was bigger than the president’s. \nTrump also has taken aim at Boeing’s efforts to sell commercial airliners to Iran, thanks to the easing of sanctions with the nuclear deal signed last year. \nBut it may not all be bad news for Boeing. Jim McNerney, former chairman and CEO of Boeing, is to sit on Trump’s new President’s Strategic and Policy Forum, perhaps giving him a chance to bend the next president’s ear back toward the plane maker’s good graces. \nIn the meantime, Trump’s favorite from his personal fleet of planes remains that 25-year old, Trump-emblazoned 757. If age limitations for his planes are the same he sets for his women, that means Trump and his favorite jet have but 10 years left until “ check-out time .” \nPhoto credit: Carsten Koall/Getty Images",

      "title": "Trump on Boeing's Air Force One contract: 'Cancel order!'",
      "text": " 17   \nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Dec 7): U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - a prominent symbol of the U.S. presidency - complaining that costs were out of control. \nIt was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via brief Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint. \nTrump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. \nBoeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024. \nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. \nNOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET \nThe U.S. Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, first announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes. \nThe planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war. \nPresident Barack Obama, who was flying on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency. \nThe Air Force said in a statement that it had budgeted $2.7 billion in the coming year for the initial stage of the project involving research, development, testing and evaluation. \nThe current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8, including military avionics, advanced communications and a self-defense system, according to budget documents seen by Reuters. \n\"Of course it's not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,\" said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies. \nA March report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft. \nBut the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be would be low, at just under $2 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for research and development, then its estimate would be around $4 billion. \nBoeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet but were flat at the end of the trading day. \nHIS OWN PLANE \nTrump is known for his love of his own Boeing 757 jet. In a 2015 Rolling Stone profile, he said his plane was \"bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way.\" \n\"Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?\" he said. \nTrump's broadside against Boeing comes as Washington's business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride. \nA New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harm ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad. \nSince winning the Nov. 8 election he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans. \nBoth Ford and United Technologies said they support Trump's efforts to cut corporate tax rates and overhaul regulations, which could save the companies billions in the long run. \nTrump's attack on Boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the Aerospace Industries Association on Tuesday, where the group's CEO Dave Melcher urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high-paying manufacturing jobs that the $143 billion a year sector offers. \nIndustry executives say they are seeing willingness from the Trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of U.S. weapons. But in the short term, his tweets and comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice. \n\"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English. \nBoeing relies on the U.S. military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense, space and security business which is worth $30 billion a year. \nThe company clashed during the past year with Republicans in Congress over the Export-Import Bank, a federal program Boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers. Boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asia, which Trump opposed.  ",

      "text": "Trump slams Boeing deal for new Air Force One Nathan Bomey, USA Today 1:19 p.m.   Air Force One, carrying President Barack Obama, lands at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on June 24, 2016. (Photo: Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, Special for USA TODAY) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday called for the U.S. government to cancel a deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing to develop a new Air Force One. \nThe Air Force signed deals with Boeing in January and July to design certain aspects of the new presidential aircraft, including its interior, electrical and power system, and maintenance systems. \nThe Evendale-based aviation division of General Electric Co. would supply four GEnx-2B engines for each new aircraft. Boeing plans to replace the two aging 747-200 aircraft that serve as Air Force One with two new, modified 747-8 planes. The 30-year service life on the current planes will expire in 2017, according to Bloomberg. \nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated in March that the entire program would cost about $3.2 billion from the 2010 through 2020 fiscal years, including $2 billion for research and development. \nShortly after his tweet, he told reporters at Trump Tower: \"“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nA Boeing spokesperson did not respond to a request seeking comment. But the company said in a statement that its current deal for Air Force One development is worth $170 million. \n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" Boeing said. \nAn Air Force spokesman said the military did not have an immediate comment on Trump's exhortation. \nThe Air Force pledged to \"keep costs down\" when it awarded the initial development contract to Boeing in January, but said the replacements are necessary. \n\"Parts obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources and increased downtimes for maintenance are existing challenges that will increase until a new aircraft is fielded,” Col. Amy McCain, manager of the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, said in a statement at the time. \nRichard Aboulafia, aviation analyst at the Teal Group, said the current Air Force One plans were made in the 1980s and have become obsolete. The planes are equipped with state-of-the-art communications technology and defense mechanisms to survive nuclear war or terrorist attacks, he said. \nAnything in the $3 billion to $4 billion range would be reasonable, and a belief otherwise is \"completely ignorant,\" he said. \n\"This is the wrong place to talk about cost control,\" Aboulafia said. \"People aren’t upset in Washington about a relatively small program being canceled. They’re upset we have a president who doesn't understand what is needed to be president.\" \nSen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who is on the Armed Services Committee and has crusaded against government waste, said it made sense to be \"really careful on how much money we spend\" for the aircraft. But, she added, said the current Air Force One fleet is about 25 years old and replacing them will not be cheap. \n\"I think the American people want the president of the United States to be flying in a secure, safe and impenetrable aircraft,” McCaskill said. \nThe undersecretary of defense approved the plan to replace Air Force One in September 2015. \nThe goal was to replace the aircraft by the 2024 fiscal year. \nIt was not immediately clear Tuesday whether Trump, who owns a Boeing 757 that he uses as his personal aircraft, would or could intervene to halt the Air Force One deal after he takes office in January. \nRegarding the bizarre possibility that Trump might want to use his own plane instead of Air Force One, Aboulafia was beside himself. \n\"That's up there with talking-to-aliens-on-the-toaster weird,\" he said. \nStill, jittery investors drove Boeing shares down early in the trading day. Just after 12:30 p.m., Boeing shares were down 0.4% to $151.56. \nAs it happens, Trump himself owned Boeing shares ( BA ) as of the filing of a financial disclosure form during his presidential campaign. He owned Boeing stock worth between $50,001 and $100,000, according to his disclosure, but Miller said the president-elect sold all of his stocks in June. \nTrump has taken a special interest in the aircraft manufacturer's travails in the past. During a crisis surrounding the lithium batteries in its 787 Dreamliner aircraft, Trump tweeted in 2013 and 2014 that the company should excise the technology from the planes. \nEarlier, though, he was ebullient about Boeing's prospects. \n\"@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing,\" he tweeted in January 2013. \"Great company!\" \nContributing: Eliza Collins for USA Today and Bowdeya Tweh and Deirdre Shesgreen for The Enquirer. 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2gNKhUO TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": " 38   Cramer says Trump's Boeing tweet just uncovered more risk to your portfolio than initially thought By Abigail Stevenson | CNBC – 21 minutes ago 107.43 +0.01 While the market continued to roar higher on Tuesday, Jim Cramer couldn't ignore the cracks starting to appear in the Trump rally, especially for defense stocks. \n\"Don't get me wrong, I still think the president-elect has a very pro-business agenda, it's just more pro-some-business than others, and the list of those others seems to keep growing,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \nDonald Trump 's tweet that claimed the cost of Air Force One that Boeing is building to be more than $4 billion caught Cramer's attention on Tuesday and what it could mean for risk in defense stocks. While the $4 billion figure was unconfirmed, the real issue for Cramer was suasion, or what President Theodore Roosevelt called \"bully pulpit.\" Tweet \nUnited Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told Cramer on Monday that there was no quid pro quo in the deal for Carrier with Trump. However, Hayes made it clear that he was cognizant of his company's $6 billion in defense contracts that could be put at risk. Now it is Boeing 's turn. \n\"Just like United Technologies, getting on the next President's bad side could be a serious problem for Boeing,\" Cramer said. \nBoeing has $18 billion in contracts with the Defense Department, which is approximately 20 percent of its business. While Trump didn't say or do anything to suggest those contracts were threatened, Cramer was confident that Boeing got the message. \nMaybe Boeing will roll back the price of the plane, or maybe this debacle amounts to nothing. \n\"Either way, it is a brand new risk you need to be aware of if you own the defense stocks,\" Cramer said. \nCompanies that do business with the government — like United Technologies or Boeing — need to be prepared to pay a price, Cramer said. However, Cramer thinks it is unlikely that Trump will take away the order for Air Force One because the only other company that can build a wide-body jet like Air Force One is European Airbus. \nEither way, Trump is sending a message that these companies will pay a price, and that price is a better deal on a plane, tank or jet engine. \n\"To me, that says maybe we shouldn't be paying as much for the defense contractors. Their stocks are red hot. I know they represent great value,\" Cramer said. \nTweets like the one Trump sent could make investors regret buying Lockheed Martin , General Dynamics or Northrop Grumman , which are all up significantly for the year. \nEven if Cramer is reading too much into a simple tweet, it is clear that there is more risk than he thought initially, he said. \nOn the flipside, if Trump potentially sends tweets like this from the Oval Office, Cramer thinks investors should be paying more of a premium for the classic growth stocks that don't need or want government \n\"It's a brave new world. We have to be careful not to pay too much for those manufacturers that rely on the Federal teat. By maybe we should pay more for those that don't,\" Cramer said. \nQuestions for Cramer?",

      "text": "03:26pm December 6, 2016   \nPresident-elect Donald Trump correctly stated that future Air Force Ones will cost the American taxpayer $4 billion. \n( Note* Two planes are being commissioned, but won’t be ready until 2024 – after Trump potentially completes his second term ) \nThe left tore Trump apart for throwing out such a crazy number because they weren’t interested in researching the facts. \nIf it seemed like the Boeing comment was out of left field, the company’s CEO made these comments right before Trump’s tweet… \nFrom Chicago Tribune : \n[Dennis] Muilenburg suggests the Trump team, and Congress, back off from the 2016 anti-trade rhetoric and perceived threats to punish other countries with higher tariffs or fees. \nInstead, he suggests they get down to the business of advocating a stronger U.S. agenda during ongoing or upcoming trade negotiations with other countries. \n“If we do not lead when it comes to writing these rules, our competitors will write them for us,” he said. \n…in remarks before the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association last week, Muilenburg conceded there’s more populist concern about international pacts than before the 2016 election campaign. \n“I’m not a political pundit or prognosticator — we have too many of those — but anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,” he said. \nMuilenburg argues that international trade is essential to the U.S. economy and its importance is reflected in the “large and growing percentage of our business” coming from international sales, including commercial jet orders from China. \n“Last year, we delivered 495 737s from our factory in Renton, Wash., to customers around the world. One in every 3 of those 737s were bound for China. And about a quarter of all our airplane deliveries … were bound for Chinese customers. This phenomenon would have been unimaginable when I started at the company in 1985,” said Muilenburg, who began his Boeing career as an aerospace engineer. \nIs this what prompted Trump to send his Boeing tweet? \nWe may never know.",

Both women were among the original “Rosie the Riveters,” working for Boeing during World War II. Mrs. Dunn died Nov. 26 at age 98. (Bettina Hansen/The Seattle Times) Josie Dunn, who grew up picking cotton in Oklahoma, was among the first African Americans hired by Boeing and worked at the jetmaker for nearly 38 years. “Josie the Riveter” died Nov. 26 at age 98. Share story Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter \nJosie Dunn, raised in a poor family in Oklahoma, came to Seattle in 1943 at age 24 in a wave of young black women hired to build bomber aircraft in Boeing’s factories as a crucial part of the U.S. war effort. \nIn segregated America before the Second World War, Boeing did not employ African Americans. Mrs. Dunn got her chance after President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered wartime federal contractors to end discrimination and black leaders pressed Boeing to implement the shift. \nIn a twist on the government’s famous symbol of women at work, Mrs. Dunn was affectionately dubbed “Josie the Riveter.” \nFrom that start, she forged a new life. She worked at Boeing for nearly 38 years, raised a family, and became a pillar of the black community in Seattle’s Central District. Most Read Stories \n“I’ve had a good life thanks to President Roosevelt,” Mrs. Dunn told the Seattle Times in an interview last year. “Coming to Boeing was really a future for me.” \nMrs. Dunn died from bone marrow cancer, surrounded by family and friends, on Nov. 26, aged 98. Cotton fields \nMrs. Dunn grew up in Summit, Okla., a small town that was then all African-American. \nHer father died when she was four months old and her mother, Josie Beard, raised seven children alone. As the youngest, Josie was nicknamed by family members “Baby Jo.” \nThey lived in a house without running water, and the entire family worked long hours picking cotton. \nMrs. Dunn’s son, Ventris Ingram, said his earliest memory is of being in the cotton fields with his mother when he was about 4 years old and she was around 23. \nThis life changed with the war. \nIn 1941, President Roosevelt signed an executive order requiring companies with federal contracts to cease discrimination. Under the aegis of a government agency promoting jobs for the unemployed, Mrs. Dunn trained in Wichita, Kan., then traveled to the Pacific Northwest to join the war effort. \nShe arrived at Boeing along with her sister Annie Mae, joining other young African-American women dubbed the “Black Rosies.” \nMrs. Dunn lived a housing project, near First Avenue and Michigan Street, where most residents worked at Boeing. Her mother and son joined her after a few months. \nShe walked daily the couple of miles to Boeing Field, where at Plant 2, now demolished, she worked as a riveter — a tough, physically draining job. \nMrs. Dunn and her workmates assembled B-17 bombers at a ferocious pace. At peak production in 1944, Boeing built 16 in a single day. \nBoeing’s African-American employees were not allowed to join the Machinists union at the time, and instead were granted “temporary” work permits, a restriction that was lifted only after the war ended. \nMrs. Dunn, who always lived frugally, worked overtime and saved money to help more than 10 other relatives follow her to Seattle for job opportunities. \nHer “temporary” job turned into a long and successful career at Boeing. \nBecause of Mrs. Dunn’s expertise, she trained incoming employees in the intricacies of the work. Over the years she was given several company awards, the biggest worth $750, — “when that was real money,” her son said — for suggestions that improved productivity. Neighborhood pillar \nAfter the war, her first marriage in Oklahoma having dissolved, she married Clarence Dunn, an African-American soldier returning from Europe, where he had driven a fuel truck servicing General George Patton’s Third Army tank division in its push across France. \nMr. Dunn also worked at Boeing for a while, then left to start a demolition business. Their marriage lasted 52 years, until his death in 1998. \nIn 1953, the couple bought a house in the Central District, at the time the only Seattle neighborhood where African-Americans could buy. \nMrs. Dunn joined the Mt. Zion Baptist Church and became active in her community. \nShe was part of a neighborhood group who pooled their money to start the first black-owned supermarket in Seattle. She was also a member of the Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). \nHer only child, Ventris Ingram, now 79, said his mother was a wonderful support who “encouraged me in every way.” The first in the family to go to college, he graduated in accounting from the University of Washington and had a long career in the Internal Revenue Service. \nWhen his parents moved to a new house in the Central District, they kept the first one to rent out, and later acquired another nearby rental property. \n“She would always insist the rents be kept low,” Ingram said. “She’d say, ‘Let’s help those who are not in as good a position as we are.’” \nMrs. Dunn loved the Boeing Co. for giving her a comfortable life, her son said. \nAfter retirement in 1981, she participated in many “Rosie the Riveter” events. She was interviewed for oral and video history projects for the Library of Congress, the University of California at Berkeley, and Seattle’s Museum of History and Industry. \nMrs. Dunn is survived by son Ventris Ingram (Anita) of Renton; granddaughters Jerri Ingram (Thomas) of Seattle and Kimberly Ingram-Baun (David) of Auburn; sister-in-law Cora Faison Dunn of Seattle; nieces Lou Annie Charles (Dexter) of Seattle, Norma Jean Tucker of Fort Gibson, Okla., and Dawn Massey of Shoreline; her nephew Cloyd Kilgore of Gig Harbor; as well as four grandnieces. \nFuneral services will be held Saturday, December 10, at 11:00 a.m. at Mt. Zion Baptist Church. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that any donations be made to Central Area Senior Center, Evergreen Hospice, Mount Zion Baptist Church and Antioch Ministry.

While it was unclear what sparked Trump's anger, his tweet came just 22 minutes after the Chicago Tribune published an article highlighting the differences between Trump and Boeing's CEO when it comes to trade with China.

      "text": "This Boeing 747 apparently wasn't good enough for President Obama, but Donald Trump doesn't mind slumming it to save taxpayers the $4B for a replacement. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) Trump wants $4B replacement for Air Force One axed By Andrea Shalal and Amy TenneryReuters WASHINGTON/NEW YORK - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government on Tuesday to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency - saying costs were out of control.It was the latest example of Trump using his podium, often via brief Twitter messages, to rattle companies and foreign countries as he seeks to shake up business as usual in Washington. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, took aim at what he called cost overruns even though the plane is only in development stages.\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter. It was not immediately clear what prompted the timing of his complaint.Trump, who has vowed to use his skills as a businessman to make good deals that benefit American taxpayers, then made a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments.\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters.Boeing, which has built planes for U.S. presidents since 1943, has not yet begun building the two replacements for the current Air Force One planes, which are scheduled to be in service by 2024.Boeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the proposed replacements.\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" the company said in a statement. NOT A 'VANILLA' JUMBO JET The U.S. Air Force, which operates the presidential planes, first announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current presidential planes.The planes can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. They are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war.President Barack Obama, who was flying on the aging Air Force One to Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, has called the plane one of the best perks of the presidency.His spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on board that the contracting arrangements for replacements are \"rather complicated\" and said the recommendations for upgrades had been made by national security experts.\"The planning work that we have done on behalf of future presidents is something that the next administration will have to decide whether or not to carry forward,\" Earnest said.The budgeted costs for the replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, just on research and development, testing and evaluation, according to budget documents seen by Reuters.The current Air Force plan envisions extensive modifications to a Boeing 747-8 plane, adding military avionics and advanced communications to a self-defense system.\"Of course it’s not like buying a vanilla Boeing jumbo jet,\" said defense consultant Loren Thompson, who has close ties to Boeing and other companies.A March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the cost of the overall program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two aircraft.But the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be would be lower, at just under $2 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for research and development, then its estimate would be around $4 billion.Boeing shares dipped after Trump's tweet but were flat by mid-afternoon. Shares of several other major defense contractors were also lower. LATEST BROADSIDE Trump's broadside against Boeing comes as Washington's business lobbyists are bracing for a wild ride.A New York real estate developer, Trump took aim at big corporations during his campaign, saying that they often harm ordinary Americans by sending jobs abroad.Since winning the Nov. 8 election he has taken credit for pushing United Technologies Corp and Ford Motor Co to backtrack on outsourcing plans.Both Ford and United Technologies said they support Trump's efforts to cut corporate tax rates and overhaul regulations, which could save the companies billions in the long run.Behind the scenes, business lobbyists are emphasize the importance of trade to the U.S. economy to Trump's advisers.Trump’s attack on Boeing was the main topic of discussion at the annual luncheon of the Aerospace Industries Association, where the group’s CEO Dave Melcher urged the new administration to promote trade and bolster the high-paying manufacturing jobs that the $143 billion a year sector offers.Industry executives say they are seeing willingness from the Trump team to take another look at export controls that limit exports of U.S. weapons. But in the short term, his tweets and comments on Boeing put defense contractors on notice.\"The chilling effect on industry is huge, if you are a contractor,\" said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English.Boeing relies on the U.S. military and other arms of the federal government for a significant share of its defense, space and security business which is worth $30 billion a year.The company clashed during the past year with Republicans in Congress over the Export-Import Bank, a federal program Boeing uses to finance sales to certain overseas customers. Boeing executives have also been outspoken supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asia, which Trump opposed.Chief Executive Dennis Muilenberg last week called for Democrats and Republicans to work together to make sure the United States continues to play a leading role in shaping the global economy through trade agreements.Trump, who sold his shares in Boeing and other companies in June according to a spokesman, named former long-time Boeing CEO Jim McNerney to a high-profile business advisory council last week. McNerney could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.Trump is known for his love of his own Boeing 757 jet. In a 2015 Rolling Stone profile early in his campaign, he said his plane was \"bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way.\"\"Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?\" he said.

      "text": "Liquid Robotics’ Wave Glider floats on the surface of the ocean, but it’s propelled by a wave-powered undersea glider. (Liquid Robotics Photo) The Boeing Co. says it has agreed to acquire Liquid Robotics , its teammate in a years-long effort to create surfboard-sized robots that can use wave power to roam the seas.\nThe acquisition is expected to help Boeing create military communication networks that can transmit information autonomously from the sea to satellites via Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft , or SHARCs.\nLiquid Robotics was founded in 2007 and currently has about 100 employees in California and Hawaii. Once the deal is completed, the company will become a subsidiary of Boeing. The arrangement is similar to the one that applies to Insitu , a Boeing subsidiary that is headquartered in Bingen, Wash., and manufactures ScanEagle military-grade drones.\nJust as the fixed-wing ScanEagle drones can gather and transmit data while they’re airborne, SHARCs can monitor maritime operations and send the information back via satellite to their handlers. Boeing also makes a 50-ton underwater robot called Echo Voyager that can explore the deep sea for six months at a time, as well as two smaller unmanned undersea vehicles. The SHARCs can serve as communication relays for those undersea robots.\nThe deal announced today underscores the fact that Boeing’s love affair with oceangoing drones is much more than a fling.\n“With Liquid Robotics’ innovative technology and Boeing’s leading intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions, we are helping our customers address maritime challenges in ways that make existing platforms smarter, missions safer and operations more efficient,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, said today in a statement .\nThe SHARCs are versions of Liquid Robotics’ Wave Glider robot, which is designed to generate power for itself using solar arrays as well as an innovative propulsion system that takes advantage of the energy differential between surface waves and the relative calm of deeper water. No fuel is required.\n“When you put it at sea, it’s good for six months without a human touching it,” Egan Greenstein, senior director of autonomous maritime systems at Boeing Military Aircraft, told National Defense magazine in June . “We thought it had promise to solve hard Navy problems.”\nThe Navy tested the SHARC system last year as a sensor-equipped robotic tool for gathering intelligence and doing surveillance. “If it detected a threat, it would call home over satellite communications to tell decision-makers something is going on,” Greenstein said.\nSHARCs could come into play in situations where the Navy wants to keep a low profile, where long-term surveillance is required, or where potential undersea threats such as submarines have to be monitored.\nTerms of the acquisition agreement were not disclosed. The companies said that completion of the transaction “is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.”\n",

      "text": "By Tomi Kilgore, MarketWatch\nNumbers Trump cited don't reflect the nature of the deal between Boeing and the DoD, White House says\nBoeing Co. Investors shrugged off President-elect Donald Trump's threat to cancel an order with the aerospace giant to build Air Force One planes, after comments by the company and the White House suggested the numbers Trump Quote: d didn't add up.\nBoeing's stock(BA)inched up 8 cents, or less than 0.1%, but had been down as much as 1.4% earlier in the session.\nBased on 647.9 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, according to the company's third-quarter report, the stock's gain Boeing's market capitalization by $51.8 million, a lot better than the $1.39 billion that was lost at the stock's intraday low of $150.02.\nThe stock had dropped in morning trade after Trump tweeted that an order for Boeing to build a new Air Force One should be canceled because costs had risen to over $4 billion, which would be well more than double earlier budget estimates.\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072)\nHe also told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower, where he works and lives, that the building of the plane was \"totally out of control,\" as costs were spiraling, according to ABC News.\n\"I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,\" Trump said. \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\n(https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/806150101060055040)\nBut Boeing's response to Trump's comments suggested a very different number.\n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\nThe White House also questioned Trump's numbers.\n\"I'd refer to my colleagues at the Department of Defense for the particulars of the procurement contract,\" said press secretary Josh Earnest. \"Some on the statistics that have been, uh, cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial agreement between Boeing and the Department of Defense.\"\nBoeing had secured a contract in January to start work on the 747-8 jumbo jets that would replace the planes used as Air Force One beginning early next decade. Although the Pentagon didn't disclose the expected cost of the two new planes at the time, earlier budget estimates put the cost at more than $1.6 billion (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeing-gets-contract-for-development-work-on-new-air-force-one-planes-2016-01-29).\nBefore Trump's tweet, which was sent just before 9 a.m. Eastern, ahead of the stock market's open, the stock had traded unchanged at $152.16.\nThe stock slid to a premarket low of $149.75, down 1.6% from Monday's close, before recovering slightly. Since the opening bell, the stock has traded within a range of $150.02 to $152.64.\nTrump's tweet and comments come after Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg made comments that could be interpreted as veiled criticism of Trump's trade policies. In a speech to the Illinois Manufacturers' Association on Friday, Muilenburg cautioned against \"antiglobalization sentiments\" propagated by candidates before the election, and against pulling back from trade agreements \"that have set the rules for international commerce for decades.\"\nDon't miss:Opinion: The 'market,' it turns out, doesn't love Donald Trump's policies (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-market-it-turns-out-doesnt-love-donald-trumps-policies-2016-12-06).\nSee also:What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-president-elect-trump-means-for-companies-by-sector-2016-11-10).\nBoeing's stock has gained 5.3% so far in 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 10.5%. Shares of Boeing rival Airbus Group SEhave lost 4.2% this year.\nRob Schroeder contributed to this report.\n-Tomi Kilgore;\n 1610ET\n ",

      "text": " Google+\nzEDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ/AFP/Getty Images\nPresident-elect Donald Trump exits elevators to talk with the media at Trump Tower Tuesday.\nBy Jonathan Lemire Associated press December 06, 2016\nNEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump, a political newcomer who touts his corporate skills, turned businessman-in-chief Tuesday, first demanding the government cancel a multibillion-dollar order for new presidential planes and then hailing a Japanese company’s commitment to invest billions in the U.S.\nSix weeks before taking office, Trump is telegraphing that he'll take an interventionist role in the nation’s economy — as well as play showman when he sees a chance. The celebrity businessman’s declaration about Air Force One caused manufacturer Boeing’s stock to drop temporarily and raised fresh questions about how his administration — not to mention his Twitter volleys — could affect the economy.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘The plane is totally out of control,’’ Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower, deeming the deal ‘‘ridiculous.’’\n‘‘I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.’’\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. Awhile later, Trump returned to the lobby with Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, a massive telecommunications company that counts Sprint among its holdings. Trump pointed proudly to Son’s commitment to invest $50 billion in the United States, which Trump said could create 50,000 jobs.\nTrump — who also tweeted the deal — shook Son’s hand and posed for photos, reveling as he had last week when he toured a Carrier plant in Indiana where he said he had instigated an agreement that will preserve about 1,000 jobs the appliance maker had planned to move to Mexico.\nAs for Air Force One, the government has contracted with Boeing to build two new planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump might never fly on the aircraft, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe.\nAdvertisement\nThe Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the aging current Boeing 747s are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. The contract for developing and building new planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. The inflated $4 billion figure Trump cited appears to include operation and maintenance.\nTrump began his onslaught against Boeing at 8:52 a.m., tweeting ‘‘Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!’’\nThat tweet came 22 minutes after The Chicago Tribune posted a story in which the Boeing CEO voiced concerns about Trump’s views on trade.\nThe president-elect then descended to the lobby of the Manhattan skyscraper that bears his name to reiterate his case.\nTrump had tweeted in 2013 that he owned Boeing stock, but a spokesman said Tuesday he sold all of his stock holdings in June. That sale was not publicized by the campaign at the time, and aides did not reveal how much cash it might have generated.\nIf Trump had held onto his stock portfolio, he would have been required to repeatedly file reports with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. A 2012 update of the Ethics in Government Act obliges presidents and other senior government officials to report such transactions.\nBoeing responded to Trump Tuesday in a statement: ‘‘We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.’’\nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, which he has outfitted with white leather and gold, a large flat-screen television and a bedroom. But as president it is expected that he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. Air Force One also has seating for reporters; Trump generally does not allow the press on his own plane.\nLate Tuesday, Trump will be using his own 757 to travel to the second stop of his post-election ‘‘thank you’’ tour, in North Carolina, less than a week after an Ohio appearance that felt more like a raucous campaign stop than a traditional speech by a president-to-be.\nRetired Gen. James Mattis, who Trump announced as his pick for secretary of defense, at last week’s rally, is to appear with Trump at the evening event in Fayetteville.\nLater this week there will be rallies in Iowa and Michigan. And on Saturday, Trump will attend the 117th annual Army-Navy football game. The game between the two military academies often draws the commander in chief; both Barack Obama and George W. Bush have attended in recent years.\nBefore leaving for North Carolina Tuesday, Trump held a number of meetings in New York, including with Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil; Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who was meeting about a diplomatic post, and radio host Laura Ingraham who is being considered for press secretary.\nCorrection: An earlier verison of this story mistakenly described Donald Trump’s plane. He flies on a Boeing 757.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nContinue Reading Below\nTrump later told reporters the cost was \"ridiculous\" and that he wanted the aircraft maker to \"make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized airborne symbols of the American presidency.\n___\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nContinue Reading Below",

Oil prices had risen more than 18 percent since last Wednesday when the producers reached an agreement to limit output.\nInvestors are now shifting their focus to the Federal Reserve policy meeting next week, where traders see a 92 percent chance of an interest rate hike.\nU.S. stocks have climbed since the Nov. 8 election, driven by expectations of significant economic stimulus and cuts in corporate taxes and regulations under President-elect Donald Trump.\nHowever, the rally has split, with the Dow marking a series of record highs on gains in industrials and bank stocks, while sectors such as utilities and technology have held back the S&P and the Nasdaq.\n\"You've got a lot of overbought individual components, especially in a rising rate environment, so any bad news, including Trump tweeting on Boeing, is going to have a big impact on the market,\" said Phil Davis, chief executive of PSW Investments.\n\"It's such a narrow rally, with such a small amount of support that it might unwind in a very ugly way.\"\nSix of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by a 1.52 percent rise in the telecom services index due to gains in AT&T and Verizon.\nEnergy was the biggest drag, while technology and financials were flat.\nAt 11:09 a.m. ET (1609 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 14.89 points, or 0.08 percent, at 19,201.35.\nThe S&P 500 was up 0.27 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,204.98 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.13 points, or 0.04 percent, at 5,311.02.\nBoeing's shares edged down 0.7 percent to $151.08, after Trump tweeted that costs of the 747 Air Force One aircraft were \"out of control\" and that the order should be canceled.\nNike fell 2.9 percent to $50.34 after Cowen & Co downgraded the shoemaker's stock to \"market perform\" and cut price target. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow.\nAT&T rose 1.7 percent to $39 after CEO Randall Stephenson told investors that the new streaming television service DirectTV Now has so far exceeded expectations.\nVerizon rose 1.5 percent to $50.52 after striking a deal with Equinix to sell 29 data centers for $3.6 billion.\nIntralinks soared 15.4 percent to $13.01 after Synchronoss Technologies said it would buy the cloud-based business software provider for $821 million, representing a 15.4 percent premium. Shares of Synchronoss, which provided a disappointing fourth-quarter revenue forecast, fell 10.2 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,595 to 1,168. On the Nasdaq, 1,342 issues rose and 1,282 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 21 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 143 new highs and 13 new lows.\n(Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

      "text": "Trump wants to cancel Air Force One order from Boeing Posted: Updated: By CNNMoney The president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday, December 6, 2016 that the new Boeing 747 jet (pictured) that's being built to carry \"future presidents\" already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. (Credit: From Boeing) NEW YORK - \nDonald Trump wants to cancel government plans to build two new Air Force One jets. \nThe president-elect said in a tweet Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that's being built to carry \"future presidents\" already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, Trump responded, \"Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,\" he said. \"And I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nTrump did not say why he believes the planes will cost \"more than $4 billion.\" Boeing says it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million. \nA Boeing source familiar with the program told CNN that not even the company can estimate the cost of the program at this time, since \"the Pentagon has not even decided all the bells and whistles it wants on the new Air Force One.\" \nWithout knowing all the security features it is hard to estimate the cost, the source added, and the Air Force isn't even sure whether it wants two or three of the planes. \n\"We are not sure where he is getting that number from,\" said the Boeing official. \n\"The statistics that have been cited [by Trump], shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defense,\" said Obama White House spokesman Josh Earnest. \nIn an official statement, Boeing said that its current contract allows it \"to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.\" \nSo far the Air Force has budgeted $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones. They'll replace the aging pair of blue, white and polished aluminum 747-200Bs currently serving the President. \nThe new planes aren't expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets, according to Defense Department budget documents. That $93 million is included in Boeing's current contract. Manufacturing has yet to begin. \n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" said Boeing's statement. \nTrump's comment emphasizes that he's looking for ways to cut government costs where he can, according to his spokesman Jason Miller. \n\"The point that the President-elect was making here was that a $4 billion price tag is a very big number, the taxpayers want to make sure we're seeing absolute accountability and that the government is doing the best to drive costs down,\" he said. \nBut Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One Tuesday that the planes need to be upgraded. \n\"This Air Force One that we're currently flying on is in great shape, thanks to the skilled professionalism of the men and women in the United States Air Force,\" Earnest said. \"It is, however, an aircraft that is nearing the end of its projected life.\" \nOf the two Air Force One jets that are currently in use, one has been flying since Ronald Reagan was president, and the other was delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush's administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the new planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing's jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. A team of engineers and aircraft machinists would then add state of the art communications, missile avoidance systems, inflight refueling, VIP interior and protections from the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast. That takes years to do. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. Airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige as well as billions in revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build a new version of Air Force One. \nThe current planes have 4,000 square feet of interior floor space. The 747-8 is a longer and more spacious version of the current version, and features four General Electric engines. Those expand its range by 1,000 miles thanks to considerably better fuel economy than the 1970s-era engines used on the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing's first presidential plane was used by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1943, and it has made every Air Force One since President John Kennedy. \nBoeing is the nation's largest exporter. But it has recently been criticized by Trump for both its deal to sell commercial jets to Iran and its decision to open a factory in China to finish passenger cabins on planes purchased by Chinese airlines. \nRecently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. \nShares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump's comment. \nTrump held between $50,000 to $100,000 worth of Boeing stock, according to a financial disclosure from June of this year. But Trump spokesman Miller said Tuesday that he sold all his publicly-traded stock that same month. \nIn January of 2013, when the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded by problems with its batteries, Trump tweeted that he had bought just bought stock in Boeing at depressed prices, calling it a \"great company!\" \n-- CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this story \nThe-CNN-Wire™&© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump slammed the cost of a new Air Force One and used Twitter to call for canceling the new aircraft fleet Tuesday, raising questions about the future of the program managed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n>> Read more trending stories\nIn a tweet sent at 8:52 a.m., the Quote: : \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\"\nBoeing spokesman Todd Blecher declined comment and referred all questions to the Air Force, which did not immediately release a response.\nThe Air Force is planning to replace two aging Boeing 747-200s that serve as Air Force One when the president is aboard with two newer and highly modified Boeing 747-8 airliners. The jets were expected to join the fleet by 2024, replacing a current fleet that will be more than three decades old at the time.\nA program official at Wright-Patterson has said the White House has urgently asked for the jets because of reliability concerns as the planes age, among other concerns.\nRichard Aboulafia, a senior aviation analyst with the Virginia-based Teal Group, said in an email the tweet was \"complete nonsense. But making program management and military requirements decisions via tweet is just very wrong.\"\nIn an interview, he said the president-elect's position on the Air Force One replacement was \"very concerning.\"\n\"This is not from the standpoint of the contract, but just from deeper lack of understanding for what the president does,\" he said. \"It's very important for the president to travel, visit other places in the country, and other countries and be able to manage national emergencies while he travels. You can't do that without Air Force One.\n\"Now the alternative is he thinks a 50-year-old Air Force One will do the job,\" Aboulafia said. \"Hopefully, nobody can be that completely misinformed.\"\nA message seeking comment was sent to Trump spokespersons this morning.\nTodd Harrison, director of the aerospace project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said it's a tradition for an outgoing president to request a new Air Force One \"so that it would not be seen as being for personal benefit.\" President George H.W. Bush's administration OK'd the purchase of the current fleet, he noted.\n\"If Trump cancels the program now, it could be another eight years before a new replacement program is started, so that aircraft would be pushing 40 years old by then,\" Harrison wrote.\nThe production of the iconic Boeing 747 jumbo jet could come to an end \"so it's not clear that the Air Force would be able to buy a commercial derivative plane like the 747 from a U.S. company in the future.\"\nNeither Boeing nor the Air Force has released the latest figures on the program.\nAboulafia said the more than $4 billion Trump cited was \"about right over 10 years.\"\n\"It's incredibly expensive to be able to manage a country and fight a war from the air, and build two planes that can do that,\" he said. But he rejected the claim the costs were \"out of control.\"\nLoren B. Thompson, a senior defense analyst at the Virginia-based Lexington Institute and a defense industry consultant, said in an email the president-elect \"probably overstates\" the cost of the two new jets.\n\"Boeing thinks the program will cost less, but it is hard to say precisely how much because the Air Force hasn't finalized the requirements for the program.\n\"This is a plane that might need to remain airborne for days during a nuclear war,\" Thompson wrote. \"It must be able to carry out functions no other plane in the world would need to accomplish.\"\nThe jet's cost is driven by its mission with self-protection measures such as shielding against electromagnetic pulse in a nuclear explosion and specialized communication gear to command a nuclear strike \"which is why it is so much more expensive than the planes Trump is used to buying,\" Harrison wrote.\nThe National Museum of the U.S. Air Force hopes to land one of the current Air Force Ones when the plane was expected to be retired in the next decade to add to its collection of 10 presidential aircraft.",

      "text": "Trump Criticizes Boeing for Air Force One Costs Trump Criticizes Boeing for Air Force One Costs Jackie Reddy December 6, 2016 \nTrump has expressed his concerns over the cost of the new Air Force One in a tweet, but the manufacturer has maintained that it is offering value for money. \nDonald Trump has called on the U.S. government to scrap its agreement with Boeing for the development of a new Air Force One fleet. \nIn a tweet on Tuesday, the president-elect expressed his concerns over the project’s financials. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!,” he posted. \nThe aircraft manufacturer and the U.S. Air Force signed two deals earlier this year to design the planes’ maintenance, power, interior and electrical systems, but the military has not formally been awarded a contract to actually assemble any planes. According to the U.S. government’s Accountability Office, the total cost of refurbishment, as estimated through to the 2020 fiscal years, would cost about $3.2 billion. \nThe current Air Force One fleet consists of two 747-200 planes dating from the 1980s. Boeing has said that it will be replacing these with two new 747-8 planes. \nFollowing his tweet, USA Today reported that Trump told assembled press at Trump Tower, “The plane [Air Force One] is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous.” \nHe added, “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nBoeing, however, was quick to respond to Trump’s concerns. \nIn a statement , the manufacturer said, “We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” \n ",

      "text": "License DMCA Details \nIn June, US aerospace company Boeing inked an agreement with Iran Air to produce 109 passenger aircraft. Estimated value: $25 billion. The agreement represents the biggest business interaction between the US and Iran since that country's 1979 Islamic revolution. \nOn November 17, the US House of Representatives voted 243-174 to block the deal . The Senate seems unlikely to follow suit president Barack Obama would almost certainly veto the bill, but Boeing's stock took a temporary 2% tumble on the vote. \nWhy do House Republicans (the vote was pretty much party-line) want to destroy thousands of American jobs and hammer the revenues of a major American manufacturer? \nThe stock answers: \nIran has an active nuclear weapons program (the US and Israeli intelligence communities say it doesn't). \nIran is violating the 2015 deal to end the non-existent program (the International Atomic Energy Agency says it isn't, apart from a few ten thousandths of one percent more heavy water than the deal allows them). - Advertisement - \nIran sponsors terrorism (even if that's true, the US lacks moral credibility to complain about it given its 25-year, 24/7 terror campaign comprising hundreds of thousands of killings across the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa). \nThose are the War Party's talking points. The conventional wisdom among the non-insane population looks more like this: \nFor nearly 40 years -- ever since the Iranian people rose up and overthrew the authoritarian monarchy installed by the US in a 1953 coup against its democratically elected government -- enmity with Iran has been a sacrament of American political class religion. It's one of those cold war relic feuds that our politicians just don't quite know how to let go of. \nI think that conventional wisdom gives the political class too much credit for morals and too little credit for guile. The truth, in my opinion, is more along these lines: \nBoeing builds swords and it builds plowshares. That is, it builds military aircraft and weapons systems on one hand, and civilian passenger aircraft on the other. - Advertisement - \nWhen Boeing builds plowshares, the only thing it's beholden to the political class for is permission. It shouldn't even have to ask pretty please, but unfortunately does. The politicians don't hold the purse strings, though. It's legitimate business. \nWhen Boeing builds swords, on the other hand, it works directly for the politicians. The end user is either the US armed forces or a foreign military approved of, and probably funded by, American politicians. Kiss the ring, Boeing. \nThe War Party (both Republican and Democratic wings in tag-team fashion), given the opportunity, prefers to forbid Boeing to build plowshares and keep it in the position of begging to build swords. \nNot that Boeing is innocent in all this. Since World War II, the primary mission of the US government has been to transfer money from your pockets to the pockets of Boeing and other \"defense\" contractors.",

      "text": "— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump targeted Boeing in a tweet, accusing it of letting costs go out of control in the building of a new Air Force One jet. \nTrump is not a stickler for accuracy, but there are number of inaccuracies in his tweet. Let’s break them down one by one. \n“Boeing is building . . . ” \nEarlier in 2016, Boeing received a $170 million contract to design a replacement for the aging pair of Air Force Ones used by the president. Boeing is not actually building the jet, though logically it is the only U.S. manufacturer with the capability to build such an aircraft. \n“ … a brand new 747 Air Force One … ” \nAt a minimum, there would be two Air Force Ones. You need a spare in case there is a problem with one. The jets generally have a life cycle of 30 years. \nA plane only receives the call sign “Air Force One” when the president is on board. This is actually a highly modified version of the Boeing 747-8 jet. \n“Costs are out of control, more than $4 billion” \nCost have actually not been set. The Defense Department’s five-year plan indicates a cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years for design and development. It’s logical to assume at least another $1 billion in additional expenses to complete and procure the aircraft. \nSo an estimate of $4 billion — for design, testing and manufacture of at least two jets — is not completely out of line. But the budget is subject to approval by Congress and the actual design of the aircraft. Boeing literally needs to re-engineer the plane from the ground up, so there are many one-time expenses. \nAir Force One needs to be designed to survive a nuclear war. It requires all sorts of undisclosed security upgrades and countermeasures. It can refuel in flight . The actual cost of the plane will depend on the equipment that goes into it. There also needs to be extensive testing, probably lasting two years, before the plane is deemed ready for presidential travel. \nCongress obviously would have a say in the final price tag. The Boeing 757 jet used by the secretary of state was supposed to get long-range engines but at the last moment, they were killed by then-Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). This resulted in some cost savings — and also that the secretary of state would always have to refuel in Alaska on flights to and from Asia. \nBoeing says it made no money making the last set of Air Force One jets and does not expect to make money on this order, as it is more a matter of prestige. Indeed, Boeing has already announced that it may soon end production of the 747 jet . \n“Cancel the order!” \nNothing has been ordered yet. But the program could be eliminated. This may not be a problem for Trump, but certainly would affect his successors, especially if no order is placed before Boeing stops making 747s. The current aircraft were delivered in 1990, and as we noted, the life cycle is about 30 years. The Pentagon says the current fleet “faces capability gaps, rising maintenance costs, and parts obsolescence as it reaches the end of its planned 30-year life-cycle.” \nTodd Harrison , a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said “the program is very new and hardly had a chance to get started yet.” So, in effect, there are no real cost overruns yet. He added that the estimated $4 billion cost is reasonable given the requirements of the project. Published: Dec. 6, 2016, 4:57 p.m.",

      "text": " \nWASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\" \nThe New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was \"ridiculous,\" though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, \"but not that much.\" \nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency. \n___ \nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST? \nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump's figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n___ \nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE? \nThat's true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday. \nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances. \nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House. \nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests. \n___ \nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE? \nThe Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One. \nUnder the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. The new aircraft wouldn't be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election. \nIn a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force \"to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \n___ \nCOULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT? \nIt's unclear. Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus. \n___ \nDIDN'T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER? \nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama didn't scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected. \n___ \nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT? \nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20. \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

      "title": "Why did Trump tweet about Boeing this morning?",
      "text": "I’m asking that question earnestly. I don’t know the answer. But it’s fun to speculate, as part of a new game we’re going to be playing for the next four years called “What the hell inspired that? ” We played it just last week, if you remember, when he tweeted one morning out of the blue about locking up flag-burners and maybe stripping their citizenship. That subject was completely off the political radar until some mysterious unknown stimulus inspired a thought to flit across Trump’s mind, raising the question: What the hell inspired that? \nLefty site TPM has a theory. A story about Boeing’s CEO criticizing Trump’s trade policy went live on the Chicago Tribune website this morning at 7:30 a.m. Trump tweeted about the exorbitant cost of Boeing’s new Air Force One models just 22 minutes later . Did he see the Tribune story and retaliate? I’m thinking … no. Read the Tribune story and you’ll see that there’s nothing in it that’s so harsh that would have required a staffer to bring it to Trump’s immediate attention. It’s some anodyne hand-wringing about how a trade war with China might hurt business. It’s also hard to believe that Trump is routinely checking the Tribune website or, as one Twitter pal suggested, that he or his staff have some sort of Google alert set up to flag new news stories that include his name. He’s the president-elect; every story includes his name.\nBesides, how often does Trump tweet about print news apart from stuff in the New York Times or Washington Post? He is, famously, a fan of “the shows,” especially the morning shows. He phones into “Fox & Friends” regularly (or used to, at least). He feeds scoops to Joe Scarborough . Chances are, if he’s flying off the handle about something in the early hours of the day, it’s because cable news just did a segment on it. That’s the leading theory for how the flag-burning tweet came to be, in fact:\nTiming of Trump's tweet lines up w/ Fox segment at 6:25AM on students burning the flag https://t.co/W7G4Hlw1O6 https://t.co/8M0AC4EfQy \n— Katherine Faulders (@KFaulders) November 29, 2016 \n\nAny proper game of “What the hell inspired that? ” should begin with a review of what was airing on cable news between 6 and 9 a.m. that day. As luck would have it, John Ziegler decided to conduct that review for this morning’s programming and found this news tidbit that aired on Fox at around 6:40:\n>>> more jobs may be headed overseas. the “washington post” reporting the obama administration is working on a deal to build fighter jets in india instead of the united states. both lockheed martin and boeing agree to manufacture f-16 and f-18 jets in india bringing 1,000 jobs oversea, days after president-elect donald trump worked to keep the same number of jobs at carrier manufacturing in indiana.\nAssuming that transcript is accurate, that’s actually not what the Post reported . The story on Boeing and Lockheed Martin building F-16s and F/A-18s for India mentioned specifically that “any partnership to manufacture jets in India would not result in a net loss of American jobs but would create Indian employment.” They’re going to manufacture those planes abroad and, presumably, reassign U.S. workers who used to build those jets to other projects. The way Fox presented the story, though, made it sound like outsourcing. Is that why Trump brought up Air Force One, because he thought Boeing was set to embarrass him by sending jobs overseas right as he’s preparing to take office and is enjoying some goodwill after the Carrier deal? Or is there something else going on behind the scenes that inspired the Air Force One tweet? When you’ve chosen someone known for lashing out in retaliation at enemies to be the most powerful man in the world, there’s no end to the possibilities.\nHere’s Rush relishing the idea of a president-elect attacking a company as retribution for, among other things, donating to his political opponents. In lieu of an exit question, read this darkly funny story at CNBC about Wall Street nerds trying to design an algorithm that’ll help make trading decisions based on Trump’s tweets . If he’s going to try to tank companies’ shares by threatening to withhold federal contracts (which he did today with some success in Boeing’s case), savvy investors should be prepared to cash in.\nUpdate: I didn’t see their item until I had finished this post but it turns out Mediaite had the same thought about the Fox News segment this morning that Ziegler and I had. They’ve posted the video, wondering if that’s what inspired Trump’s tweet. Go judge for yourself. Oh, and yes, Fox did misrepresent the WaPo story about Boeing and Lockheed Martin supposedly “outsourcing” jobs.\n",

      "text": "By Tess Stynes and Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. agreed to acquire Liquid Robotics, maker of a wave and solar-powered autonomous robot, building on a collaboration between the companies and expanding Boeing's capabilities in unmanned underwater vehicles.\nLiquid Robotics's ocean robot, called the Wave Glider, is used for ocean data collection and communications. In September of 2014 Boeing and Liquid Robotics entered a collaboration deal on a version of the Wave Glider to enhance its capabilities.\nFinancial terms weren't provided for the deal, the second acquisition of an unmanned undersea vehicle maker this year by a major defense firm. Rival General Dynamics Corp. acquired submarine robot maker Bluefin Robotics during February.\nBoeing executives have been upbeat about the future of the undersea business, though some rivals said the Navy has been slow to come up with deals for their use after encouraging industry to invest heavily in development.\n\"There's a lot happening,\" said Leanne Caret, chief executive of Boeing's defense arm in an interview on the sidelines of a defense conference last weekend.\nMs. Caret said Boeing had received inquiries from a number of potential government customers about the Echo Voyager, a 51-foot unmanned submarine it has already developed, as well as from companies in the energy sector that make extensive use of underwater vehicles.\nWrite to Tess Stynes at tess.stynes@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 06, 2016 16:28 ET (21:28 ",

      "text": "Trump Blows the Whistle on Boeing’s $3.2 Billion Air Force One Contract White House Picture of the Day \nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s bold gesture last week of persuading Indianapolis-based Carrier Corporation to cancel plans to shift about 800 jobs to Mexico – and his threat to punish other companies contemplating similar moves -- has been met with widespread voter approval. \nThe hard-nosed New York real estate magnate signaled last week that he intends to use his formidable bargaining skills to bend U.S. industry to his will in pursuit of his “America First” agenda of preserving manufacturing jobs at home while imposing protective tariffs and tearing up international trade deals. \nRelated: Carrier Gets State Incentives, Trump Pledge for Keeping U.S. Jobs \n“Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences,” Trump said during a tour of the Indianapolis furnace plant last Thursday that employs more than 1,100 workers. “Not gonna happen. It’s not gonna happen.” \nA new Morning Consult/Politico survey released on Tuesday found that six out of ten voters across the political spectrum view Trump in a more favorable light following his efforts to persuade Carrier officials to keep those jobs in this country. Even among those who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton for president, 32 percent said the deal in which Carrier would receive $7 million in tax incentives from the state and assurances of major federal tax relief improved their view of Trump. \nNow the president-elect appears to have his eyes on much bigger fish. \nTrump on Tuesday called for the federal government to cancel a deal with Boeing, the premier aircraft manufacturer, for the development of a new generation of Air Force One, insisting that the multi-billion-dollar contract is far too costly. The Air Force signed agreements with Boeing in January and July to design and develop aspects of the new presidential aircraft, including its interior and electrical and power systems, according to USA Today . While only a small fraction of the total cost has been accounted for so far in the procurement process, the entire program likely will cost about $3.2 billion through fiscal 2020, the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated in March. Related: The Pentagon Wasted $125 Billion and Buried the Evidence \nHowever, without explaining how he came up with his figure, Trump insisted today that the real cost would be $4 billion and that as far as he was concerned that was out of the question. He tweeted: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n“Well, the plane is totally out of control,” Trump later told reporters who were camped out in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. “It’s gonna be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much.” \nTrump’s pronouncement clearly caught the Pentagon and Air Force by surprise, and the government had no immediate response. Boeing was first awarded the contract in January 2015 with virtually no competition, according to The Washington Post . That’s because Boeing’s 747-8 was the only plane manufactured in the U.S. that could meet the stringent national security and safety standards for a plane to carry the president, his family and top aides and guests around the world. The current Air Force One will be 30 years old next year and is slated to be replaced by 2020 at the earliest. \nTodd Blecher, a spokesperson for Boeing, issued a statement saying that the company was currently under contract for $170 million “to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States.” He added, “We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.” \nRelated: The Pentagon Wasted $125 Billion and Buried the Evidence \nTrump, the master dealmaker who made billions of dollars in business ventures worldwide by keeping his rivals and contractors off balance, appears to be applying his same tactics as a successful CEO in trying to run roughshod over government bureaucrats and private contractors. In a conference call with reporters today, Trump spokesperson Jason Miller said that the president-elect intends to closely examine the Defense Department’s budget in search of potential big savings. \n“I think this really speaks to the President-elect’s focus on keeping costs down across the board with regard to government spending,” Miller said. “I think people are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs, even in addition to this one. So we’re going to look for areas.” \nTrump’s concern about runaway defense spending and waste is clearly justified. The Pentagon has routinely been hit with criticism of massive waste and cost overruns, as in the case of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The Washington Post reported today that the Pentagon had “buried” an internal audit that revealed $125 billion of administrative waste for fear that Congress would retaliate with cuts in its budget. \nHowever, Trump may be signaling far bigger concerns about Boeing than simply what he is portraying as excessive spending on the next generation of Air Force One planes. The Obama administration reportedly is negotiating a deal with India that would allow Boeing and Lockheed Martin to build U.S. combat aircraft in India that would replace that country’s aging fleet of mostly Russian-built aircraft. \nRelated: Pentagon’s Sloppy Bookkeeping Means $6.5 Trillion Can’t Pass an Audit \nUnder that arrangement, Lockheed Martin and Boeing would outsource manufacturing of the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the F/A-18 Super Hornet to India to substantially save labor costs. In both cases, the aviation contractors would be building production plants in India, according to The Post . Indeed, Lockheed Martin is proposing to shift its entire F-16 assembly line from Texas to India, “making India the sole producer of the single-engine combat aircraft,” the newspaper reported. \nIt wouldn’t be surprising if Trump – with his sharp focus on keeping U.S. jobs at home and bringing others back from overseas -- might have a different idea once he takes office Jan. 20. Although the president-elect made no mention about the brewing deal with India, which was first reported late yesterday. He may have decided to yank Boeing’s chain over the Air Force One contract to give company executives fair warning of a much bigger confrontation to come over their efforts to export manufacturing jobs. \nOr, he may have been vexed by a speech delivered by Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg to a group of Illinois manufacturers last Friday that suggested that Trump and his allies temper their rhetoric about trade policy, as the Chicago Tribune noted today . \"Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaigns and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade,\" he said, without specifically mentioning Trump by name. \nAfterward, Muilenburg told reporters that “Free and fair global trade is important, and it definitely creates U.S. manufacturing jobs. We want to make sure that doesn’t get lost in the political rhetoric,” he added. TOP READS FROM THE FISCAL TIMES",

UPDATE: White House says some of Trump's Air Force One statistics don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing, Department of Defense \nRelated: History and background of Air Force One The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley says Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII.",
