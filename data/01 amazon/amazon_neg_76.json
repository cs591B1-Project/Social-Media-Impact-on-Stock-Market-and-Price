      "text": "At $60, this price is pretty unbelievable (Photo via Amazon) 5357271 \nI’m going to tell you a secret. You have to promise not to tell anyone. Promise? Good. Right now, Daily Dealer readers can get a massive discount on the Fire HD 6 , Amazon’s Kindle/tablet hybrid. Okay, that’s not the secret. The secret is that the code is FIREPROMO and that it gets you the Fire HD 6 for 50 percent off its original price. The Fire HD 6 usually costs $120 but with the code FIREPROMO it is just $60. It has never been on sale for $60 before. This is the real deal. So many entertainment options for so, so cheap with this deal (Photo via Amazon) \nFire HD 6 Tablet, 6-inch HD Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, Includes Special Offers on sale for $59.99 with code FIREPROMO \nI have a Fire myself and let me tell you, it is really convenient. (Although I do wish I had the opportunity to only pay 60 bucks for it). It can function like a regular Kindle, meaning you can carry it around with you to read books, such as when you are traveling by plane, train or automobile. But it can also function as a tablet (like, say, an iPad), meaning that you can watch movies, listen to music and do whatever other stuff goes on inside all those little apps. \nAnd I’m not alone in thinking this is a great device. Take the words of “Mike W,” a Hall of Fame Amazon reviewer who is trusted for his wisdom when it comes to giving purchasing advice. This is what he has to say, in a review titled “ Unreal performance for $99! I couldn’t be happier “: \nI’ll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a $99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level. I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I’d give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try. I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access. What I’ve found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews. In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year’s best purchase. \nFirst off the look is nice. It’s sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I’d imagined, it’s not heavy enough to be considered a negative. The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response. To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit. For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you. \nI first checked out the e-reader function. My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader. I am a big fan of the Kindle app for the iPad, and am far more accustomed to its functionality, but the Fire performed very well and my only complaint is that when searching the definition of a word, Wikipedia is used (versus google on the Kindle for iPad/Phone apps) which is a step down in quality imo, but certainly a small complaint overall, and in the quick 2 or 3 words I searched the answer was attainable from that page and did not require going over to the Wikipedia page as some have reported. \nNext, I checked out Silk, the web browser. This aspect of the Fire probably received the most complaints as the early reviews came in. It was reported to lag and to crash frequently, even on amazon’s own site. I expected this to be the case as I tested it, but I found that these problems must already have been addressed (your tablet loads the newest version of the software upon your registration) in subsequent updates as my experience was the ability to browse quickly and flawlessly across a number of varying websites. This was the second surprise for me, as I expected a far lower quality and especially a slower speed. I couldn’t be happier with what I’ve experienced so far. \nI browsed the app store and found it very functional and easy to maneuver, I set up my gmail within a matter of seconds, and I looked through a variety of sales and offers. At no time have I found slow speeds, poor touch responses, or any lagging. \nThe Kindle Fire HD6 has exceeded my expectations in every way, and I still can’t believe I got it for $99 + tax. This thing is an incredible bargain, and so far its quality of performance holds its own against my iPad, something I absolutely did not expect at this price. I’m sure as I become more familiar with the Fire, the reasons for the price difference between it and the iPad will become more apparent, but when you consider the main reasons for which I purchased the Fire, it holds up marvelously well. Again, this may be the year’s best purchase from a value standpoint. So far,I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone. Enjoy! \nUPDATE 1/22/15- Since writing this review back in October, I’ve purchased 3 more for my kids. In perhaps the greatest test of speed and function, namely being easy, fast and fun enough to be preferred by children, these tablets have continued to impress and have proved that they are indeed a game changer in the world of budget tablets. With 3 months of rather heavy use under my belt, I have experienced absolutely no technical difficulties, and I remain a very satisfied customer. I therefore continue to highly recommend this excellent tablet. \nMike couldn’t believe he got it for only $99. Now I can’t believe it’s available for $59. Am I being Punk’d ? The kids love it (Photo via Amazon) \nHave a suggestion for a cool product or great deal that you think Daily Caller readers need to know about? Email the Daily Dealer at [email protected] .",

      "title": "Amazon won’t resume work with one of its airlines until it’s sure the pilots won’t strike again",
      "text": "Stephen Brashear | Getty Images An Amazon-branded Boeing 767 freighter, nicknamed Amazon One, flies over Lake Washington during the Seattle Seafair Air Show on August 5, 2016 in Seattle, Washington. A week after unhappy pilots who fly cargo planes for Amazon were forced by a judge to end their strike, the online retailer has still not resumed shipping packages with the cargo airliner, one of the pilots told Recode. \nAnd it sounds like Amazon won't do so until it is confident the pilots won't strike again. \n\"We rebalanced capacity across our carrier partners and we are leaving the adjustments in place until we are certain there will be no further disruptions,\" an Amazon spokeswoman confirmed on Thursday evening. \nThe cargo airline in question, ABX Air, is one of several Amazon has contracted in the last year to operate a total of 40 planes on Amazon's behalf. The goal, Amazon has said, is to make sure it has enough shipping capacity to handle the annual increases in demand it is seeing, especially during the fourth-quarter holiday season. Amazon is also starting to build out its own transportation network because it believes it will lead to shipping savings over time. \nMore from Recode:\n16 things to get IPO-ready (or just build a really strong business) \nIs it possible to outsmart Amazon this holiday season? \nApple will need the FAA's blessing if it wants to use drones to improve its Maps \nBut taking more control over the movement of packages after they leave an Amazon warehouse obviously comes with downsides, especially in a case like this where Amazon is leasing the planes but not hiring its own pilots to fly them. Amazon has said the current disruption has not affected customers, but one could imagine it increasing costs for the quarter because of the last-minute nature of the change of plans. \nAbout 250 ABX pilots, who belong to a local Teamsters union in Ohio, first went on strike before Thanksgiving because of what they say is an understaffing crisis resulting in 8,000 emergency flights for customers like Amazon and DHL this year that upended some of their lives. (Amazon, for its part, is notoriously anti-union.) \nThe steady flow of emergency flights, \"exacerbated\" by bringing Amazon on as a client, made it difficult for pilots to use the comp days they receive in exchange for working an emergency flight on a day off, according to ABX Air pilot and union rep Tim Jewell. The Amazon work has also led to pilots being forced to change between day and night shifts more often than is allowed under their contract, Jewell said. \nOn Nov. 23, a judge issued a two-week, temporary restraining order that forced the pilots back to work and to negotiate with the airline while working. The two sides have not yet come to a resolution, and it's unclear if the pilots will attempt to strike again at the end of the restraining order window. \n\"We hope very much to resolve it and not have to go down that road,\" Jewell told Recode. \"We hope that this period here woke up the company enough that they're willing to work with us to mutually come to an agreement to move forward.\" \nA spokesman for ABX Air's parent company says they expect \"these minor disputes to be resolved without further work stoppages.\" \n— By Jason Del Rey, Recode.net . \n\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",

      "text": "Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of these items - Are you buying them? By Mark Jones, Komando.com photo courtesy of shutterstock \nOnline shopping is a convenient way for consumers to find the best deals on what they are looking for. It's so simple these days to search online for certain items and compare prices from site to site. \nAmazon is the largest online retailer and you can find almost anything you could imagine to purchase on the site. The downside is, there has been a rash of counterfeit products recently showing up on Amazon. The good news is the retail giant is starting to crack down on counterfeiters. \nConsumer advocate and watchdog, the Counterfeit Report, recently conducted a study of Amazon to check on counterfeit sales. It placed orders that came from Amazon Fulfillment and Amazon Marketplace and claims that none of the dozens of name-brand products it ordered were authentic. \nThe Counterfeit Report submitted infringement notices to Amazon and 8,429 counterfeit items were removed from its site. It seems the main problem with counterfeit items comes from the Marketplace. There are three ways that Amazon fulfills orders: Amazon Direct - These products are sold and shipped by Amazon. Amazon Fulfillment - These items are provided to Amazon by a third party. They are then warehoused and shipped by Amazon. Amazon Marketplace - This is when a product is sold and shipped directly from a third-party seller. \nThere are nearly 2 million Marketplace account holders all over the world. The items sold through Amazon Marketplace are never inspected by Amazon, making it easy for criminals to sell counterfeit items. What Amazon is doing to fight counterfeiting \nAn anonymous source says Amazon will be cracking down on counterfeiters in 2017. It plans on assembling teams in the U.S. and Europe, working with major brands to develop a registry that will prevent fake items. All brands, even those not selling on Amazon, will be encouraged to register with the online retailer. \nOnce a brand is registered, Amazon will require any merchant listing those items in the marketplace to prove they have permission to sell them online. Amazon already tried out this system earlier this year with Nike and a few other companies. The registry will be expanded next year to thousands of companies. \nAmazon has also taken legal action to fight counterfeit items on its site. Earlier this month it filed lawsuits against companies it accuses of selling counterfeit items in its marketplace. How to tell if an item is counterfeit \nIt's difficult to spot a counterfeit item. Scammers are great at producing fake items, but there are some things you can watch out for: Quality - Counterfeit items don't go through the same quality control procedures that the real items do. If the item doesn't seem to be up to standard or is poorly made, there's a good chance it's fake. Too good to be true deal - If you see a product that is being sold by an unknown source and it's really inexpensive, it's probably fake. If it is a bargain that is too good to be true, it probably is. Incorrect packaging - Items made by reputable businesses will not have simple mistakes on its packaging. Counterfeit items may have the wrong logo design or could even have misspelled words. Make sure you receive all items - Many counterfeit products are sent without things like the owner's manual or product registration card. If you receive an item without these things it's most likely fake. More news stories you can't miss:",

      "text": "Comments Despite the cancellation, the period drama series starring Genevieve Angelson might still continue season 2 somewhere else. \n\" Good Girls Revolt \" is short-lived. After one season only, Amazon decides to ditch the drama based on a true story about a group of young female researchers navigating the sexist publishing world at a fictional News of the Week in 1969. \"Amazon passing on S2 of Good Girls Revolt.

      "text": "In an October lawsuit, Apple accused a company selling electronic devices through Amazon of faking the authenticity of its iPhone chargers. Now, independent research has verified that phony power accessories pose a dangerous risk.\nImage: moomsabuy / Shutterstock.com \nIn its report, the UK-based Chartered Trading Standards Institute , which commissioned the testing and released the results today (Dec. 2), emphasized that unofficial and fake devices are \"unknown entities.\" Leon Livermore, chief executive of the institute, noted that counterfeit goods \"could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one.\"\nOf 400 purported iPhone chargers tested, only three had enough insulation to protect against electric shocks, meaning that less than 1 percent of accessories tested were actually safe to use.\nMORE: The Best Gifts for Travelers \nThe tests, performed by the Illinois-based global safety specialists UL, applied a high amount of voltage to the chargers. The power accessories were bought online from retailers in eight different countries, including the U.S., Australia and China.\nAccording to the Trading Standards Institute, consumers can check to see whether their Apple device chargers are legitimate.\nFirst, the plug should easily fit into the power socket, without requiring any force. Next, look for Apple branding, a batch number and the UL and CE safety marks, although these can be forged. Lastly, did your charger come with instructions and safety materials? If not, it may be junk. Of course, consumers can always skip the uncertainty and buy directly from Apple or well-known accessory makers such as Belkin, Kensington, Monoprice and TwelveSouth. \nSee Also : Best Portable Chargers and Battery Packs \n15 Best iPhone 7 Accessories How to Buy USB Type-C Cables That Won't Fry Your Gadgets Best Portable Charger - Battery Packs for Phones, Tablets About the author Henry T.

      "text": "Amazon's original offerings continue with a second season of the site's 1980s comedy, Red Oaks, as well as the debut of gonzo car show The Grand Tour. The movie offerings are plentiful and dominated by two names and franchises: James Bond and Rocky Balboa. We've picked the best of what Amazon has to offer this month.\n\nAlso streaming: Hulu | Netflix | Online Originals \nAmazon may be the source of many holiday presents this year, but its video selection for December is modest. The highlight is the debut or return of three Amazon original TV series. Although a huge number of movies come to Prime this month, most can be skipped. But, there are a handful of winners that earn our recommendation.\nLost in Oz (Dec. 2) \nLost in Oz: Extended Adventure - Official Trailer | Amazon Kids \nThose of you who are expecting anything like the 1939 Technicolor film will be surprised by this 3D animated reimagination of the L. Frank Baum parable. Dorothy is a sassy modern teen who is transported into a high-tech, mechanized Oz that looks like something out of Futurama. Amazon debuted the pilot a year ago, and the full series is finally ready.\nMan in the High Castle, Season 2 (Dec. 16) \nThe Man in the High Castle Season 2 - Official Trailer | Amazon Video \nShowrunner Frank Spotnitz starts with Philip K. Dick's enticing alternate history of World War II — in which the Germans and Japanese win. He expands the great sci-fi novel into a multifaceted series full of intrigue, with Nazis, Japanese invaders and conquered Americans jockeying for power and scrambling to survive. Plots collapsed and characters were running for their lives at the end of Season 1.\nMozart in the Jungle, Season 3 (Dec. 9) \nMozart in the Jungle – Season 3 Official Trailer | Amazon Video \nAfter Season 1 set up a crazy cast of characters in a fictionalized version of the New York Philharmonic, Season 2 seeds chaos with an almost-romance between young oboist Haley (Lola Kirke) and eccentric young maestro Rodrigo (Gael Garcia Bernal). Meanwhile, dissension grows as the musicians come closer to going on strike. Now things are set to explode in Season 3, with lovely Italy as a backdrop.\nThe Expanse (Dec. 14) \nTHE EXPANSE | Season 2 Trailer #2 | Syfy \nTwo hundred years in the future, humans haven't made it to other stars, but they do have colonies on Mars and in the asteroid belt in SyFy's new series. And once humans settle in someplace, they have a tendency to want to attack other places. Such is the danger — a solar system war — that's threatening humanity in The Expanse.\nAnomalisa (Dec. 17) \nANOMALISA - Trailer (2015) - Paramount Pictures \nMichael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis), the central figure in this animated film by Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), perceives all people as identical. But while attending a conference to promote his latest book, he meets the one woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who might be different.\nBlood Diamond (Dec. 1) \nBlood Diamond (2006) Official Trailer - Leonardo DiCaprio Movie \nDiamonds fuel bloodshed in Africa, either by funding armies or giving them a prize to fight over. Seven countries have endured diamond wars in recent decades. This film uses the 1990s Sierra Leone war as a backdrop for a fictional tale of two men — one a scammer (Leonardo DiCaprio), one a destitute laborer (Djimon Hounsou) — who are pursuing an ultrarare pink diamond.\nCaddyshack (Dec. 1) \nCaddyshack (1980) Official Trailer - Chevy Chase Movie \nComedy writer-director Harold Ramis' first feature film is an outrageous spoof of the petty squabbles and shenanigans of the members of a suburban country club. The 1980 film's comic-legend cast includes Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield.\nCafé Society (Dec. 22) \nWoody Allen's CAFÉ SOCIETY Trailer Movie CLIPS ( Blake Lively, Jesse Eisenberg) \nJesse Eisenberg, the master of coming-of-age stories, plays Bobby, a young man who is sent from New York City to work for his uncle Phil, a hotshot talent agent in 1930s Los Angeles. In this Woody Allen film, Bobby is torn between two cities, two lifestyles and two women, who are played by Kristen Stewart and Blake Lively.\nThe Fighter (Dec. 1) \nThe Fighter - Trailer HD \nMark Wahlberg plays \"Irish\" Micky Ward, a 1980s welterweight boxing sensation, in this 2010 docudrama. Wahlberg's performance is dependably solid, but the standout actor is Christian Bale, who portrays Dicky — the scraggly, drug-addled half-brother who becomes Micky's trainer.\nLars and the Real Girl (Dec. 1) \nLars and the Real Girl Official Trailer #1 - Ryan Gosling Movie (2007) HD \nRyan Gosling plays the title character, Lars — a man who falls in love with a doll of a girl — literally. Lars purchases a \"real girl\" sex doll not just for basic pleasure, but also for actual companionship. He thinks she's real. Although his family and friends — and in fact the entire town — are mortified at first, they humor him by treating Bianca as real, on the advice of a doctor who says that's the best way for him to work through his psychological break and eventually come back to reality. What could be a one-joke flick turns instead into a kindhearted comedy.\nThe Lobster (Dec. 2) \nThe Lobster Official Trailer #1 (2016) Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz Comedy Movie HD \nWriter-director Yorgos Lanthimos' absurdist comedy envisions a near future in which being single is not an option. The government runs a program to match up singles, but those who fail to find a partner within 45 days are transformed into the animals of their choice. The entire cast, lead by Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, performs in perfectly flat-affect deadpan.\nWhat Else to Stream Keep making the most of your Amazon Prime membership by using it to the fullest.

      "text": "If you're an Amazon Prime customer who was wishing for HBO and Cinemax support through the e-retailer's Channels service, you're now in luck.\nAmazon announced on Thursday that its Prime members can now sign up for HBO and Cinemax streaming through its Amazon Channels service. HBO will be available to subscribers for $15 per month. Those interested in getting Cinemax will need to pay $10 per month. Amazon is offering a 30-day free trial on both HBO and Cinemax.\n\nIn order to get your hands on the content, you'll first need to be an Amazon Prime member. From there, you can simply head over to Amazon Channels and choose the networks to which you'd like to subscribe. A free-trial period will immediately commence, and then all billing for access to the content will be handled by Amazon.\nMORE: Is Amazon Prime Worth It? Here Are the 15 Best Perks \nAmazon Channels is designed to be deliver programming to those who want to create their own skinny bundle of programming. Rather than sign up for cable or satellite service, Prime members can head over to Channels and subscribe to individual services. They'll then pay a monthly fee for access to all of its content.\nAmazon offers a slew of channels through the service, including Showtime, Starz, and Comedy Central Stand-Up, among others. All of the services come with their own monthly pricing and users can choose to sign up for one, some, or all. The service works on more than 650 devices and free trials are available on all the networks. \nThe lack of HBO, however, was a point of contention for those who were eyeing Amazon Channels as a potential option to watch streaming programming. HBO is one of the most sought-after streaming services available and not offering it to Prime members was heavily criticized. Now, though, Amazon has caught up and added Cinemax, to boot. \nAccording to Amazon, its HBO option includes access to all of the network's programming, including \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Westworld,\" and \"The Sopranos.\" It also includes documentaries, sports, movies, and other content.\nAs noted, you can watch the content on hundreds of devices and you'll stream the content from Amazon Video.\nThe new HBO and Cinemax streaming options are available now on Amazon Channels.\nAmazon Prime Streaming Guide: Best Movies and TV Shows Netflix vs. Hulu vs. Amazon Prime: Streaming Showdown PlayStation Vue vs. Sling TV: Face-Off About the author Don Reisinger Read more Amazon Streaming Add a comment Comment Firstname Submit Ask a Category Expert Create a new thread in the Apps General Discussion forum about this subject Title Title Subject Publish No comments yet Your comment Comment Firstname Submit",

It's perfect for folks who love to edit recordings in GarageBand and similar applications. \n\nTrouble Man by Marvin Gaye Picture 8 of 18 The soundtrack to the 1972 blaxploitation film features \"Main Theme From Trouble Man,\" which became one of Gaye's signature songs. It's not only a classic album; it's one of the few things on Captain America's list of cultural milestones necessary for catching up on what he missed while frozen in the sea. This LP is a remastered version of the soundtrack pressed on high-quality 180-gram vinyl. \n\nLee Oskar Harmonicas Picture 9 of 18 In 1983, harmonica virtuoso Lee Oskar (songwriter and member of the band War) formed a company bearing his own name that made and sold high-quality harmonicas. More than 30 years later, the Lee Oskar harmonicas still carry the prestige of being the best on the market. The company's Major Diatonic harmonicas are available in 14 different keys, from low F to high G, and are viewed as \"the blues harmonicas.\" \n\nJBL Clip 2 Picture 10 of 18 The Clip 2 is a hockey-puck-shaped Bluetooth speaker that packs impressive treble, midrange and bass into a surprisingly small form. It comes in black, blue, red, teal and gray, and the combination of its IPX7 water resistance rating and integrated carabiner clip means you can take your tunes wherever you go, even through the wild. \n\nMemorex MKS-SS2 SingStand 2 Home Karaoke System Picture 11 of 18 The Memorex SingStand 2 isn't just a karaoke setup that looks like it belongs in a recording studio; it also enables dynamic performances, with inputs for external instruments and a second mic. Although the SingStand 2 comes with free song downloads, its support for tablets and smartphones allows you to take advantage of the plethora of karaoke content available on YouTube. \n\nPlantronics BackBeat Go 3 Picture 12 of 18 The big problem with using most earbuds during your workout is that they simply don't stay put. The Plantronics BackBeat Go 3 earbuds fix this problem with comfort-fit ear tips and a sweatproof coating. Plantronics sweetens the deal with high-quality audio, so you can get lost in the tunes and your workout.\n\n\n\nCasio CTK-2400 Premium Pack Picture 13 of 18 With the Casio CTK-2400 Premium Pack, you can help that budding musician in your life jump-start his or her artistic endeavors. This 61-key keyboard not only comes with an X-style stand for easy setup but also packs a pair of headphones so musicians can cultivate their tunes without interrupting what's going on around them. \n\nAudio-Technica AT-LP120-USB Turntable Picture 14 of 18 The Audio-Technica AT-LP120-USB is more than just a fantastic record player, its built-in preamp means there's one less item to buy when building your own setup. Its support for 33rpm, 45rpm and 78rpm means it plays more records than other turntables that only support the first two. The AT-LP120-USB will also appeal to those with rare records, as its USB cable means you can digitize your vinyl into MP3s.\nSonos Play: 3 speakers Picture 15 of 18 Talk about customizable. Sonos' Play speakers use Trueplay technology to tune their already-phenomenal sound to the room you're jamming out in. Sonos' Play line supports all of the major streaming music services — including Apple Music, Spotify, Google Play Music, Pandora and SiriusXM — so you'll revel in amazing sound no matter how or where you listen. \n\nBose QuietComfort 35 Picture 16 of 18 The QuietComfort 35 headphones may carry a large price, but they provide impeccable noise cancellation and sound quality without wires. Giving them to any friend or family member who deals with noisy environments should earn praise. They'll also love the 20 hours of battery life and easy-to-use controls. \n\nYamaha YSP-4300 Digital Sound Projector with Wireless Subwoofer Picture 17 of 18 The Yamaha YSP-4300 uses a custom Intellibeam system of 22 drivers to create realistic surround sound even though it's a soundbar with a wireless subwoofer. At $1,800, it's the kind of investment that may be restricted to discerning audiophiles, but the connectivity of four HDMI ports and access to PCs, Macs, iPhones and iPads makes this soundbar the centerpiece of your home. \n\nPanasonic ErgoFit Earbud Headphones RP-HJE120-A Amoeba record store gift card Spotify gift cards Ticketmaster gift card Cord Taco (Set of 5) Chromecast Audio iRig Guitar Interface Adapter (iOS devices only) Trouble Man by Marvin Gaye Lee Oskar Harmonicas JBL Clip 2 Memorex MKS-SS2 SingStand 2 Home Karaoke System Plantronics BackBeat Go 3 Casio CTK-2400 Premium Pack Audio-Technica AT-LP120-USB Turntable Sonos Play: 3 speakers Bose QuietComfort 35 Yamaha YSP-4300 Digital Sound Projector with Wireless Subwoofer",

      "title": "Why the $49 Amazon Fire tablet is a great buy this holiday",
      "text": "\nIn the past we've steered people clear of really cheap Android tablets at holiday time. Not this year.\nThe Amazon Fire Tablet is both really cheap and Android, though perhaps not the Android you're used to. There's no Google to be found, which means no Play Store or Google Apps of any kind.\nBut if you go for the 7-inch Fire you're only going to be asked to part with $49 of your hard-earned cash. Or as is often the way, even less than that, thanks to frequent sales like Black Friday just gone. I've been using one for some time and people keep asking me if it's worth buying?\nThe answer is yes.\nI'm not going to run through how much hardware you get for your money and what that's like — I've done that previously in our extended hands-on. But there are a few things in particular that make this a great tablet that I'd happily recommend buying for yourself or a loved one this holiday time.\nThe first is the price. It's one of the signature selling points for Amazon, and it's almost too cheap to ignore. At $49 (£49 in the UK and €49 in the rest of Europe) it's firmly in impulse buy territory. Amazon will even sell these things in a six-pack and you'll still have spent less than many tablets.\nIt's a great tablet to travel with, too, especially for keeping folks entertained. I always take one on the road for family trips. Because it's so cheap I'm happy enough to travel with it and not worry too much if it gets lost/stolen/eaten/destroyed. It's also extremely portable at a mere seven inches, and slips into any reasonably sized pocket on a bag with plenty of space to spare.\nIt's also pretty tough. Mine has seen a few child-induced falls to the floor, or worse, and lived to tell the tale each and every time. If you're buying for young ones, Amazon also sells several rugged kid-proof cases that will cushion the Fire tablet from those inevitable child-induced bumps.\n\nThen you get to what you're actually going to do most of all with the tablet: consume media. The Fire is perfect for this, and particularly good is the option to download Amazon Prime Video to a microSD card for offline viewing. 8GB of internal storage helps keep the price down, but a cheap SD card will give you tons of space to take content with you when there's not going to be an Internet connection.\nThe 7-inch Amazon Fire Tablet's microSD card can store Prime movies for offline viewing.\nAnd while there's no Google Play Store, the Amazon Appstore isn't as bad as it used to be. You get tons of free apps through the Underground program, and if you're a Prime subscriber (which you will want to be to get the most from the Fire anyway) you're never more than a couple clicks away from buying whatever you need. It won't play some of the latest and most graphics-intensive games particularly well, but it's just fine for casual titles. Just keep one eye on your password settings if you're handing it to a child!\nThrow in Kindle, Audible, and Prime Music, and you're pretty much set. Amazon has a robust content ecosystem that, so long as you're not entrenched in Google's, has plenty to offer. Prime Music still falls a little flat, but since it's included with your yearly Prime subscription for no extra charge, it's hard to complain too much. If you want more there's always the new Music Unlimited for an extra charge.\nThe 7-inch Fire tablet is definitely something you should try yourself or gift to your nearest and dearest this holiday time. It'll be better if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber , but if you want a basic tablet for consuming content or giving to the kids to use, it's well worth your time.\nSure, the battery life isn't terrific and the screen isn't superb, but it does what it needs to do and doesn't struggle with it. The software may take a little getting used to, but there's nothing particularly bad about it and your content is always close at hand. Which is one of the most important things here, because consumption is what you'll want one of these for.\nFor $49 you really can't go wrong.\nSee at Amazon 30-day free trial to Amazon Prime \nAmazon Prime \nBenefits of Amazon Prime Get a free 30-day Amazon Prime trial Share Prime with friends and family Best movies to stream on Prime Video Shop smart with Amazon coupons ",

      "title": "Earn 3X JetBlue Points When You Shop at Amazon!",
      "text": "And right now, you can earn 3 JetBlue points per $1 you spend with Amazon . \nHere are the rest of the details: Sign-in to your JetBlue account and shop with Amazon through this link (remember to have cookies enabled on your browser or you won’t earn points!) Purchase must be made on Amazon.com (external links you find on Amazon are NOT eligible) Alcohol, Amazon Fresh items, Kindle subscriptions, wireless services, and items sold through the Amazon Appstore are NOT eligible JetBlue points should appear within 60 days after your Amazon purchase has shipped \nBecause JetBlue points are worth generally ~1.4 cents each, shopping through this JetBlue promotional portal is like getting an extra ~4.2% back in JetBlue flights (~1.4 cents per point x 3 points per $1) when you shop at Amazon. Use Your JetBlue Points to Fly in JetBlue’s Upscale Mint Business Class \nNote: Shopping through the JetBlue portal means you will NOT be able to earn rewards through another portal that might earn more bonus miles, points, or cash back for your purchase. Check CashBackMonitor for the latest portal deals! Combine the JetBlue Promotion With Other Deals \nWhile earning 3 JetBlue points per $1 is a nice promotion, you can sweeten the deal by stacking this promotion with other offers and credit card bonus categories! Remember, you’ll earn these JetBlue points on top of credit card rewards you’ll earn from shopping at Amazon. \nFor example, through December 31, 2016 , there’s a targeted AMEX Offer to earn 3X AMEX Membership Rewards points per $1 spent at Amazon. \nAnd the Discover It earns 5% cash back at Amazon until December 31, 2016 on up to $1,500 in combined bonus category purchases. So if you use the Discover It to shop with Amazon through the JetBlue promotional portal, you’ll earn the equivalent of ~ 9.2 cents per $1 ( 5 cents per $1 with the Discover It + ~4.2 cents per $1 through the JetBlue portal). \nAnd if you’re a new cardmember, Discover will match the cash back you’ve earned at the end of your first 12 billing cycles ! So you’ll really earn 10% by shopping at Amazon just by using your Discover It (plus the 3 JetBlue points per $1). \nOr, if you aren’t able to take advantage of these deals, you should use a card that will net you at least 2% back for your purchases. The Citi Double Cash will give you 1% cash back on all your purchases AND another 1% cash back on payments , as long as you meet the minimum spending each month. How Else Can You Earn JetBlue Points?",

      "text": "Written by Charlie \nFind out how you can earn 8 points per dollar on Amazon with these two steps! It is a great way to rack up miles and points! Also, a very nice limited-time offer of 15% back on Sony products on Amazon! Like this: Like Loading... \nRunning with Miles does not have direct links to credit cards. If you would like to help support the site with your applications, please check out the links on this page for offers. Advertiser Disclosure \nThis morning, I wrote the post about how you can now earn 3 JetBlue points per dollar on Amazon. This is huge since it is the first opportunity for shoppers to actually earn points across the board – just shopping on Amazon! But, I also wanted to remind everyone and show that it you could now earn 8 points per dollar on Amazon, just by having the right card and a little planning! How You Can Now Earn 8 Points Per Dollar on Amazon Step 1 – Go Through JetBlue \nLink: Earn 3 Points per Dollar on Amazon \nAs I wrote this morning , if you start your Amazon shopping by going through JetBlue’s new Amazon link, you will be able to earn 3 points per dollar on most things on Amazon ( some exclusions, like digital subscriptions, and such apply ). Some people had been asking about earning this via the app. As long as you first click the JetBlue link from your mobile device, you will be fine as it will then open in the app and you should still earn it. This is how it works for affiliates like me on mobile so it should essentially be the same with JetBlue. Step 2 – Chase Ink + Gift Cards Buying Amazon gift cards from office stores with your Ink card will give you 5 points per dollar! \nIf you have the Chase Ink Plus or Chase Ink Cash cards, you can stop at your favorite office supply store and pick up Amazon gift cards – and earn 5 Ultimate Reward points per dollar ( the Chase Ink Cash earns it as cash back but you can easily convert those points to UR points – How To Unlock Your Chase Freedom Points For Full Value ). This is something people have been doing for a very long time and it works out really good to help in your day-to-day spending on Amazon. \nCaution: If you will be buying things that you normally like to get the added protection on from your credit card (price protection, extended warranty, etc ), do not buy those things with gift cards as you will not have those protections. \nDifferent Card? \nIf you have a Discover card with category bonuses, they often have Amazon as a rotating bonus category ( like right now ). It will let you earn 5% cash back ( double on the Discover It if it is your first year ) up to the first $1,500 . Another option is with the Chase Freedom card which also includes Amazon in its rotating quarters ( last year, it was 10% back! ) for 5% back. Putting it Together \nLet’s say you buy $5,000 of goods from Amazon in a year ( not hard to do since many people buy everyday items on there as well ). Of course, you buy the Amazon gift cards from an office supply store with your Chase Ink card to earn the 5 Ultimate Reward points per dollar and you use them going through the JetBlue portal. \nThat will equal the following: 15,000 JetBlue points – worth about $225 in redemptions on JetBlue 25,000 Ultimate Reward points – worth about $400 – $500 for most people Rebate value – $625 – $725 on $5,000 in purchases ( 12.5 – 14.5% in value! ) \nThat is pretty good! \nLink: Sony 15% Bonus on Amazon Prime Card \nAs long as we are talking Amazon, take a look at this one. If you open an Amazon Prime store card, instead of earning merely 5% on your Amazon purchases, if you buy Sony products ( with some exclusions ), you will get 15% back! \nThis is great if you are in the market for some cameras, televisions, video cameras and more from Sony! It does not work on digital products, video games, or Sony Playstation but Sony makes a lot of stuff! Here are the details: 15% back on select Sony products offer Limited time offer and subject to credit approval. Offer expires at 11:59 p.m. PST on December 10, 2016. Offer only applies to Sony-branded products sold by Amazon.com. Offer does not apply to Sony Playstation, video games, or digital content. Offer only valid for Amazon Prime Store Cardmembers and authorized users of an Amazon Prime Store Card. Offer is comprised of the standard 5% back statement credit offered to Amazon Prime Store Cardmembers, plus an additional 10% back bonus statement credit, and may not be combined with any Special Financing or Equal Pay offer. Offer does not apply if you select a Special Financing or Equal Pay offer to apply during checkout. Offer only applies to the portion of net qualifying purchases (purchases less returns and other credits) of eligible items paid for with an Amazon Prime Store Card at Amazon.com. Offer does not apply to shipping charges, taxes or other fees associated with the purchase of an eligible product. Please allow up to two billing cycles for your statement credit to post to your Amazon Prime Store Card account. \nIf you want a great travel camera ( Sony makes some awesome cameras ), this could be a nice way to get one! The same can be said for Sony televisions and such. Just remember to go through the JetBlue portal first to earn 3 points that way too! \nSome of the links on this site are affiliate links that will support this site. Thank you for your support.

      "text": "Also streaming: Amazon | Netflix | Online Originals \nFor many people, the week between Christmas and New Year's can be a lazy one, and it's a great time to catch up on TV or rewatch classic films. Hulu has a little of both this year, with the debut of its own comedy series, plus three new \"regular\" TV shows and a TV special. The movie selection is vast and eclectic (though not very recent), and includes multiple works by Quentin Tarantino, Jackie Chan and Kevin Spacey, among many others. These are the best of Hulu's offerings for December.\nTV Shows Hairspray Live! (Dec. 8) \nHairspray Live! - Coming Soon to NBC (Promo) \nNBC revives the ultracampy musical about a 1960s TV dance show, with a special performance on Dec. 7 (but showing the next day on Hulu). As with NBC's other musical specials (like The Wiz), the show packs some big-name (and semi-big-name) entertainers, including Ariana Grande, Kristin Chenoweth, Martin Short, Rosie O'Donnell, Jennifer Hudson and Billy Eichner.\nShut Eye, Season 1 (Dec. 7) \nShut Eye Trailer (Official) • Shut Eye on Hulu \nJeffrey Donovan (Burn Notice) stars as a psychic scammer in Los Angeles who's looking to break out of the business and escape control by a kind of gypsy mafia in this Hulu comedy, also starring Isabella Rossellini.\nStar, Season 1 (Dec. 14) \nOfficial Trailer | Season 1 | STAR \nThree young women — two destitute and one with a trust fund — join forces with the dream of becoming a star singing group. Fox hit it big with Empire, and this show, though set in different circumstances, has a similar energy. Real superstars Queen Latifah, Lenny Kravitz and Benjamin Bratt join newcomers Jude Demorest, Ryan Destiny and Brittany O'Grady in this show written and directed by Lee Daniels.\nBarbarians Rising, Season 1 (Dec. 27) \nBarbarians Rising (2016) | Official trailer \nRome's history was a continual story of pushing out and getting pushed back in. Even at its height, the Roman Empire was always fighting border wars and skirmishes. This History Channel combo of documentary and dramatization tells the story of various outsiders, from Hannibal to Alaric, who challenged the empire. Warning: May not be 100 percent accurate.\nMars, Season 1 (Dec. 20) \nMARS: Trailer #2 | MARS \nDid you like The Martian? Well, Nat Geo has a whole TV series that envisions what the first manned mission to Mars (theorized for 2033) will look like.\nOther shows Teen Mom 2, Season 6 (Dec. 13)\nThe Thundermans, Season 3 (Dec. 9)\nUncle Grandpa, Season 3 (Dec. 1)\nVenture Bros, Season 6 (Dec. 31)\nMovies American Beauty (Dec. 1) \nAmerican Beauty - Trailer \nDirector Sam Mendes' first major film (from 1999) was a seductive entry in the American trope of dark comedies that expose the horrors of suburban life. The Academy agreed, awarding Oscars to Mendes, writer Alan Ball and lead actor Kevin Spacey, as well as earning the awards for best picture and best cinematography. Nearly everyone in this film either already was or soon became a star, including Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Allison Janney, Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper.\nAnomalisa (Dec. 17) \nANOMALISA - Trailer (2015) - Paramount Pictures \nThis animated film is by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich), so it's going to be unusual. Anomalisa is the story of an author, Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis), who perceives all people (voiced by Tom Noonan) as identical — until, while away at a conference, he meets the one woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who might be different.\nApocalypse Now (Dec. 1) \nApocalypse Now - Trailer \nJust a few years after the last U.S. chopper left Saigon, Francis Ford Coppola revisited the war in a reinterpretation of Joseph Conrad's horror novel \"Heart of Darkness.\" Martin Sheen plays Capt. Benjamin Willard, sent on a possible suicide mission to assassinate the insane Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has established a murderous cult of followers in the Cambodian jungle. This month, Hulu also offers the 2001 extended cut of the film, Apocalypse Now Redux.\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Dec. 1) \nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - Trailer \nThe plot of this international collaboration (in Mandarin, with subtitles) is as complex as the choreographed battles of warriors who can defy gravity. In short, it's a story of two doomed loves, between veteran Chinese warriors (played by Michelle Yeoh and Yun-Fat Chow) and young fighters (Ziyi Zhang and Chen Chang). The sets are beautiful, the stars are gorgeous and the fight scenes are exquisite.\nDesperately Seeking Susan (Dec. 1) \nDesperately Seeking Susan Official Trailer #1 - Will Patton Movie (1985) HD \nBored, stifled New Jersey housewife Roberta (Rosanna Arquette) becomes obsessed with a recurring newspaper personal ad (they had those back then) titled Desperately Seeking Susan. Fascinated and desperate herself to escape a dull home life, Roberta kind of stalks Susan (Madonna) in Manhattan. Roberta ends up with a case of amnesia and a new jacket that leads her to assume Susan's identity. Hilarity ensues.\nFriday the 13th: I to VIII (Dec. 1) \nFriday The 13th - Official® Trailer [HD] \nFrom the original low-budget slasher classic to the disastrous Jason Takes Manhattan, Hulu offers the long-running horror series that terrorized the 1980s. The cast of the original, like most Hollywood movies, includes Kevin Bacon.\nIron Man (Dec. 27) \nIron Man - Trailer [HD] \nThe first Marvel hero to hit the big screen this century, Iron Man brought nerdom out of the low-budget shadows and onto the blockbuster list, thanks to brilliant work by star Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreau. They mix in plenty of dry humor to keep the film from becoming too earnest, but not enough to make it into a spoof.\nLegend of the Drunken Master (Dec. 1) \nThe Legend of Drunken Master (8/12) Movie CLIP - Bamboo Smack Down (1994) HD \nJackie Chan utilizes an unusual performance-enhancing drug in this martial arts comedy. With enough booze, his character fights even better than when he's sober. And he needs the extra kick to fight off a band of thieves out to steal his country's treasures.\nNo Country for Old Men (Dec. 1) \nNo Country For Old Men (2007) Official Trailer - Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem Movie HD \nJavier Bardem played psychopathic killing machine Anton (for which he won an Oscar) in this pitch-black tale of greed and violence. He's pursuing a man, Llewelyn (Josh Brolin), who stumbled into a caper, and is himself pursued by a sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). Neither can fully appreciate what he's in for. This adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel won Oscars for best writing, best directing (the Coen brothers) and best picture.\nPrivate Parts (Dec. 1) \nPrivate Parts - Trailer \nHoward Stern stars in his own biopic chronicling the shock jock's unlikely rise to fame by challenging all the notions of decency on FCC-regulated media. Of course, the film is narcissistic. But Stern brings plenty of humor in, pointing out his own foibles, and he gives ample credit to his collaborators Robin Quivers and Fred Norris, who also star as themselves.\nPulp Fiction (Dec. 1) \nPulp Fiction Official Trailer #1 - (1994) HD \nQuentin Tarantino earned one of his two best screenplay Oscars (the other being for Django Unchained) for this wild romp through 1990s LA. It follows the intersecting stories of about a dozen over-the-top characters, all up to nefarious actions. The ensemble is dominated by a pair of hit men, played by John Travolta (in his moviemaking comeback) and Samuel L. Jackson (before he became a parody of himself). It also stars Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel.\nReservoir Dogs (Dec. 1) \nReservoir Dogs Official Trailer #1 (Red Band) - (1992) HD \nTarantino's first feature film was an instant classic, introducing hallmarks of his style, including nonlinear storytelling, oodles of pop culture references, tons of violence and his obligatory cameo. Six criminals, all strangers under assumed names (like Mr. Pink and Mr. Orange), get together for a jewel heist that goes terribly wrong. The solid cast includes Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi.\nRosemary's Baby (Dec. 1) \nRosemary's Baby - Trailer \nMia Farrow's breakout role came in this most subtle of horror movies from 1968. She plays a young bride, Rosemary, whose life deteriorates once she becomes pregnant — including failing health and the disturbing vision that she was raped by a beast. Her actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) and a motley crew of eccentric neighbors try to convince her that everything is fine, but she increasingly suspects that they have devilish plans for her and her baby. Rosemarie has no idea until the end just how right she is.\nThe Silence of the Lambs (Dec. 1) \nThe Silence of the Lambs Official Trailer #1 - Anthony Hopkins Movie (1991) HD \nIn this psychological crime thriller, the most frightening killer is the one already behind bars. Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and convicted cannibalistic killer. Young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) seeks his help in catching another deranged serial killer, known as Buffalo Bill. While the police focus on Bill, Lecter remains the biggest danger. The Silence of the Lambs swept the Academy Awards, winning for best actor (Hopkins), best actress (Foster), best director (Jonathan Demme) and best writing (Ted Tally).\nSling Blade (Dec. 1) \nSling Blade (1996) Official Trailer - Billy Bob Thornton Movie HD \nBilly Bob Thornton won an Oscar for his screenplay and was nominated for his starring role in this dark Southern tale. Karl Childers, a man with a minimal IQ, is released from a mental institution a quarter century after murdering his mother and her lover. Trying to start a new life in his hometown, he finds friends but also threats that may turn him again to violence.\nThis Is Spinal Tap (Dec. 1) \nThis is Spinal Tap (Amerik. Trailer) \nMockumentary master Christopher Guest introduced his signature style that pairs dry humor and outrageous scenarios in this spoof of a British heavy-metal band called Spinal Tap. Beyond a spoof, it was also a humorous indictment of self-indulgent and subpar pop music that was menacing the early 1980s.\nThe Truman Show (Dec. 1) \nThe Truman Show - Trailer \nDirector Peter Weir's 1998 film is about the opposite of reality TV — a world in which the biggest show on Earth stars a man who has no idea his entire life is a sham — with its every moment orchestrated and secretly filmed for the viewers. Jim Carrey, as Truman Burbank, stars in and owns nearly every scene, with Laura Linney and Noah Emmerich providing fine backup.\nThe Usual Suspects (Dec. 1) \nThe Usual Suspects - Trailer \nKevin Spacey began his rise to fame with an Oscar-winning role as Verbal, the sole survivor of a massive gun battle. The story leading up to the gunfight unfolds in flashbacks as Verbal, in police questioning, recounts what may or may not have happened. Keyser Söze, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak and Chazz Palminteri co-star.\nOther movies The Bridges of Madison County (Dec. 1)\nDriving Miss Daisy (Dec. 1)\nHard Rain (Dec. 1)\nJackie Chan's Project A (Dec. 1)\nMoonstruck (Dec. 1)\nRain Man (Dec. 1)\nRonin (Dec. 1)\nRumble in the Bronx (Dec. 1)\nSpider-Man 3 (Dec. 31)\nWhat Else to Stream The amount of good content online doesn't stop here.

I thought that I would enjoy Hulu enough to get a real cable service... but it isn't even worth the $8/mo for Hulu... how on earth do people justify their cable bills? 0 1 comments",

You can order it from your phone while you ' re out the door , and don ' t have to print anything out. We recommend Amazon (people call it the Everything Store for a reason), because whomever you’re gifting will be able to find something to buy. You can give any amount, depending on how generous you're feeling. \n\n\nAmazon Dash Button Picture 2 of 17 \nAmazon Dash Buttons are a cheap and easy gift for that person in your life who keeps running out of things. Whether they ' re a pet owner who needs dog treats, a friend who snacks on Slim Jims or a guy who likes feeling fresh after they use the bathroom (really, there ' s one for Dude Wipes), they ' ll love one-press ordering. Best of all, you can get it to give to them with Prime two-day shipping. \n\nAnker Astro E1 5200mAh Portable Battery Picture 3 of 17 \nGive your loved ones the gift of freedom from outlets. A good power bank, like this one from Anker, will refill a phone or tablet ' s battery while you ' re on the go, possibly with some extra juice left over. It ' s also the perfect gift for the Pokémon Go player in your life. \n\nMoviepass Picture 4 of 17 \nMovies are expensive, but you can help your favorite amateur film critic ' s wallet out all year long. Starting at $14.99 per month (depending on where you live), you can send a fan to two movies each month. For more, you can upgrade to three movies per month, or, if you ' re really generous, a new movie every single day. \n\nIsotoner SmarTouch Gloves Picture 5 of 17 \nBaby, it ' s cold outside — but I can ' t use my iPhone with my gloves on.

Get them Tile, a small Bluetooth tracker that they can check with their phone. Tile can make a sound to help locate items and sync an object ' s last known location to a phone app. The next time they lose their wallet or remote control, it will be much simpler to find it again. \n\nChromecast Picture 7 of 17 \nIf you ' re swinging by an electronics store for a last-minute gift, you can ' t go wrong with a Chromecast. After connecting it to an HDMI port on a TV and hooking it up to Wi-Fi, users can stream their favorite content from Android phones and tablets, as well as from laptops and iPhones. With apps like Netflix, Hulu and HBO Go, Chromecast can facilitate hours and hours of entertainment. \n\nMohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna Picture 8 of 17 \nFor the cord - cutter s on your list, the Mohu Leaf 30 TV can get some of their favorite over-the-air channels back. The indoor antenna ' s 30-mile range scans for non-cable channels like CBS, Fox, PBS, ABC and NBC to play in HD as they air. It won ' t help with cable shows, but it ' s a great help for those who want a little live programming in their lives. \n\nXbox One Wireless Controller Picture 9 of 17 \nA great controller just got better. The new Xbox One Wireless Controller has Bluetooth, which means it ' s great for Xbox and PC gamers alike. It also comes with a comfy textured grip , unlike the original controller s . It ' s a great last-minute gift for the gamer in your life, but if you have more time, consider personalizing it in the Xbox Design Lab ($79.99). \n\nBlue Apron Subscription Picture 10 of 17 \nLearning to cook can be daunting, but a subscription to Blue Apron makes it easy. Everything you need to make a meal comes in a refrigerated box, with easy-to-follow instructions. The two-person, one-week plan provides three meals for two, but longer plans and family plans are also available. \n\nSpotify Premium Subscription (6 Months) Picture 11 of 17 There's no better way to fill your home with holiday cheer than ad-free holiday music. Swing by a store and pick up a Spotify Premium gift card for a 1, 3, or 6 month subscription, or double up and cover an entire year. \nXbox Live (1 year) Picture 12 of 17 You need Xbox Live to fully enjoy your Xbox One. It lets you play multiplayer games, check out free titles and get some discounts from the Xbox Store. If the gamer in your life prefers PlayStation, you should opt for a PlayStation Plus membership instead . \nClear (6 months) Picture 13 of 17 \nThe only thing worse than waiting for your holiday gifts is waiting on the security line in the airport. While you can ' t gift TSA Precheck , an alternative called Clear offers gift memberships. Clear operates in a similar manner to Precheck , but is currently operating in only 16 airports. But for a frequent traveler without Precheck , this is the next best thing. \n\nAmazon Prime Picture 14 of 17 \nFor the person who has everything (and wants more), there ' s Amazon Prime. If you can ' t think of anything physical to get, a year of two-day shipping, access to Prime Music and Video, free eBook and unlimited storage on Amazon Drive isn ' t a bad idea. They ' ll thank you when Prime Day comes around. \n\nLoot Crate (6 months) Picture 15 of 17 \nLoot Crate is the gift of Comic-Con all year round. Each month, a box will show up at the recipient ' s door filled with a curated collection of nerdy swag, often sticking to a theme. Expect figurines, comic books, T -shirts, stickers and other pop culture goodies. \n\nNew York Times All Digital Access Picture 16 of 17 \nIf you’re going to have arguments about current events with your family during the holidays, your loved ones might as well be informed about them. Give them All Digital Access to the New York Times, with access to \" All The News That’s Fit to Print \" in a web browser, on their phone and tablet, along with articles in the Times ' archive and the ability to share their membership with another person. \n\n\nAmazon eGift Card Amazon Dash Button Anker Astro E1 5200mAh Portable Battery Moviepass Isotoner SmarTouch Gloves Tile Location Tracker Chromecast Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna Xbox One Wireless Controller Blue Apron Subscription Spotify Premium Subscription (6 Months) Xbox Live (1 year) Clear (6 months) Amazon Prime Loot Crate (6 months) New York Times All Digital Access",

      "text": "Amazon Web Services has a new service dedicated to Internet of Things (IoT) developers, called Greengrass.\nThe service, announced on Wednesday at AWS re:invent in Las Vegas, will enable messaging, data caching, and local computing between IoT devices.\nSee Also: IoT and companies: Everyone wants a piece of this revolution \nFor IoT developers using low-power, wide-area devices, AWS Greengrass provides a way to send data to the cloud and retain device efficiency.\nThe new platform also allows one device to be set up as a hub, called AWS Greengrass Core, which can take data from smaller devices and send it to the cloud. This means the smaller devices don’t need to send data outside of a local intranet network, allowing it to save energy.\nReducing the cost of sending data to the cloud is a big win for large IoT projects, where thousands of IoT devices may be connected to the network.\nGrowing Greengrass globally Developers can create a Greengrass Group that can continue to work without any help from outside networks. This means if a smart lightning network in an office disconnects from AWS, it can remain active.\nGreengrass Groups are also useful for places that do not have optimal wireless service, making it a good sell for emerging markets.\nAWS is one of the major platforms for IoT developers already, as it provides cheap cloud storage and network building tools. Adding Greengrass to the package makes AWS even more enticing for businesses looking to add IoT to their warehouse, office, or transport network.\nThe post Amazon unveils Greengrass for AWS IoT developers appeared first on ReadWrite .\n",

      "text": "'Good Girls Revolt' actor Genevieve Angelson in New York City. Photo by Bennett Raglin, WireImage/Getty \nHigh ratings apparently aren't enough to save a show from the chopping block. Amazon will cancel 'Good Girls Revolt', a period drama that debuted on Amazon Prime as an original series earlier this year, according to The Hollywood Reporter . \nWhy? We aren't sure, but a source apparently told Hollywood Reporter that Amazon Studios head Roy Price gave Season 2 the thumbs down, possibly in part because he projects the series won't garner any awards. Another source said that the show brought in more viewers than any other Amazon originals. \nFor Internet-only platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, original programming gold is more important than ever in battling traditional cable outlets for ad spend and viewers, the latter which also translate into paid subscriptions. Amazon's other original shows include 'Mozart in the Jungle', 'Transparent' and 'Lost in Oz'. \nIt's said that Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind 'Good Girls Revolt,' will try to give the series a new home, saving it from becoming a one-hit wonder like 1999's also-highly acclaimed ' Freaks and Geeks '. \nAmazon didn't respond to a message seeking comment.

      "text": "Share \nIf you’re a member of American Express Membership Rewards, the ability to spend your points on Amazon isn’t new. \nFor every one point you redeem, you get 1 cent off your purchase. Which isn’t much, really. \nBut for a limited time, you can get $25 off your next Amazon purchase of $50 or more. \nThis is a targeted promotion, so it won’t apply to everyone, but it’s definitely worth checking if it can help you cross off your holiday shopping list for less! Find Out If You’re Eligible for This Awesome AmEx Amazon Deal \nMake sure your AmEx card is eligible for American Express Membership Rewards , and that you’re enrolled. Then, follow these super easy steps. 1. Link your American Express card to your Amazon account. \nIt’s not as hard as it sounds; Amazon walks you through the process . If you’re still confused, there’s a whole list of frequently asked questions to scroll through. 2. Shop, shop, shop! \nFill up your shopping cart with at least $50 of goods sold by Amazon.com, not a private dealer. \nIf you’re not sure what to get, you can always opt for a $50 gift card . 3. Check out. \nOnce you get to the payment page, select your AMEX membership rewards cards, then enter the number of points you’d like to put toward your purchase. \nYou only need to put in one point for the promotion to apply, which is what Jennifer at Deals We Like recommends. \nWhen you get to the checkout page, use the promo code AMEX16EVER . If you’re not part of the targeted promotion, you’ll get a message letting you know you’re inelgible. \nBut if it works, you’ll see a $25 discount on your order. \nOur director of media relations, Lizabeth Cole, tried the deal with her American Express rewards card. She was stoked it applied and says she’ll likely use it toward Legos. What to Do If You’re Not Eligible \nDon’t give up just yet. \nJennifer at Deals We Like recommends asking Amazon’s customer service about the offer , and she explains exactly how to do so (just make sure to use the right promo code for this offer). \nIf you’re lucky, a nice agent just might apply the deal to your card! \nYour Turn: What are you adding to your shopping cart? \nCarson Kohler (@CarsonKohler) is a junior writer at The Penny Hoarder. After recently completing graduate school, she focuses on saving money — and surviving the move back in with her parents.  ",

      "title": "AWS Announces Three New Amazon AI Services",
      "text": "AWS Announces Three New Amazon AI Services [November 30, 2016] Tweet \nToday at AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com ( News - Alert ) company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced three Artificial Intelligence (AI) services that make it easy for any developer to build apps that can understand natural language, turn text into lifelike speech, have conversations using voice or text, analyze images, and recognize faces, objects, and scenes. Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition are based on the same proven, highly scalable Amazon technology built by the thousands of deep learning and machine learning experts across the company. Amazon AI services all provide high-quality, high-accuracy AI capabilities that are scalable and cost-effective. Amazon AI services are fully managed services so there are no deep learning algorithms to build, no machine learning models to train, and no up-front commitments or infrastructure investments required. This frees developers to focus on defining and building an entirely new generation of apps that can see, hear, speak, understand, and interact with the world around them. To learn more about Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, or Amazon Rekognition, visit: https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai \nUntil now, very few developers have been able to build, deploy, and broadly scale apps with AI capabilities because doing so required access to vast amounts of data, and specialized expertise in machine learning and neural networks. Effectively applying AI involves extensive manual effort to develop and tune many different types of machine learning and deep learning algorithms (e.g. automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding, image classification), collect and clean the training data, and train and tune the machine learning models. And this process must be repeated for every object, face, voice, and language feature in an application. Amazon AI services eliminate all of this heavy lifting, making AI broadly accessible to all app developers by offering Amazon's powerful and proven deep learning algorithms and technologies as fully managed services that any developer can access through an API call or a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. Amazon AI services make the full power of Amazon's natural language understanding, speech recognition, text-to-speech, and image analysis technologies available at any scale, for any app, on any device, anywhere. \n\"The combination of better algorithms and broad access to massive amounts of data and cost-effective computing power provided by the cloud is making AI a reality for application developers. AWS is home to some of the most innovative and creative AI applications in use today,\" said Raju Gulabani, VP, Databases, Analytics, and AI, AWS. \"Thousands of machine learning and deep learning experts across Amazon have been developing AI technologies for years to predict what customers might like to read, to drive efficiencies in our fulfillment centers through robotics and computer vision technologies, and to give customers our AI-powered virtual assistant, Alexa. Now, we are making the technology underlying these innovations available to any developer in the form of three fully managed Amazon AI services that are easy to use, powerful, and cost effective. We are excited to see how customers use Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition to build a new generation of apps that have human-like intelligence and can see, hear, speak, and interact with people and their environments.\" \nIntelligent conversations with Amazon Lex \nAmazon Lex is a new service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text that is built on the same automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology and natural language understanding (NLU) that powers Amazon Alexa. Amazon Lex makes it easy to bring sophisticated, natural language capabilities to virtually any app. Developers can build and test bots (conversational apps that perform automated tasks like checking the weather or booking flights) directly from the AWS Management Console by typing in a few sample phrases (e.g., \"find a flight,\" or \"book a flight\") along with instructions for getting the required parameters to complete task (e.g., travel date and destination) and the corresponding clarifying questions to ask the user (e.g., \"when do you want to travel?\" and \"where do you want to go?\"). Amazon Lex takes care of the rest, building the language model and asking the follow-up questions needed to complete the task. Because Amazon Lex is integrated with AWS Lambda, developers can configure Amazon Lex to invoke the appropriate backend service (e.g., the flight booking service) through an AWS Lambda function. Developers can also use pre-built enterprise connectors that execute AWS Lambda functions to answer questions like \"what are my top 10 accounts in Salesforce.com ( News - Alert ),\" by fetching data from enterprise systems like Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Marketo, Zendesk, QuickBooks and HubSpot. \nBots built using Amazon Lex can be used anywhere: from web applications, to chat and messenger apps like Slack and Facebook ( News - Alert ) Messenger, or through voice in apps on mobile or connected devices. Amazon Lex handles the authentication required by different platforms and simplifies the user interface design by not requiring developers to write custom code for each platform. Moreover, developers do not have to worry about scaling their infrastructure as Amazon Lex scales automatically as traffic to a bot increases, and developers pay only for the calls made to the Amazon Lex API. \nCapital One offers a broad spectrum of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses, and commercial clients through a variety of channels. \"As a heavy user of AWS, Amazon Lex's seamless integration with other AWS services like AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB is really appealing,\" said Firoze Lafeer, Chief Technology Officer, Caital One Labs, Capital One. \"A highly scalable solution, Amazon Lex also offers potential to speed time to market for a new generation of voice and text interactions, such as our recently launched Capital One skill for Alexa.\" \nOhioHealth is a nationally recognized healthcare organization with a network of 11+ hospitals in 47 counties. \"We are excited about utilizing evolving speech recognition and natural language processing technology to enhance the lives of our customers. Amazon Lex represents a great opportunity for us to deliver a new experience to our patients,\" said Michael Krouse, Senior Vice President Operational Support and Chief Information Officer, OhioHealth. \"Everything we do at OhioHealth is ultimately about providing the right care to our patients at the right time and in the right place. Amazon Lex's next generation technology and the innovative applications we are developing while using it will help provide an enhanced customer experience. We are just scratching the surface of what is possible.\" \nHubSpot ( News - Alert ) is a marketing and sales software leader. \"HubSpot's GrowthBot is an all-in-one chatbot which helps marketers and sales people be more productive by providing access to relevant data and services using a conversational interface. With GrowthBot, marketers can get help creating content, researching competitors, and monitoring their analytics. Through Amazon Lex, we're adding sophisticated natural language processing capabilities that helps GrowthBot provide a more intuitive UI for our users,\" said Dharmesh Shah, Chief Technology Officer and Founder, HubSpot. \"Amazon Lex lets us take advantage of advanced AI and machine learning without having to code the algorithms ourselves.\" \nTwilio ( News - Alert ) helps businesses make communications relevant and contextual by making it possible to easily embed real-time communication and authentication capabilities directly into software applications. \"Developers and businesses use Twilio to build apps that can communicate with customers in virtually every corner of the world,\" said Benjamin Stein, Director of Messaging Products, Twilio. \"Amazon Lex will provide developers with an easy-to-use modular architecture and comprehensive APIs to enable building and deploying conversational bots on mobile platforms. We look forward to seeing what our customers build using Twilio and Amazon Lex.\" \nIntelligent Speech with Amazon Polly \nAmazon Polly makes it easy for developers to add natural-sounding speech capabilities to existing applications like newsreaders and e-learning platforms, or create entirely new categories of speech-enabled products - from mobile apps to devices and appliances. Amazon Polly is easy to use; developers can send text to Amazon Polly using the SDK or from within the AWS Management Console and Polly immediately returns an audio stream that can be played directly or stored in a standard audio file format. With 47 lifelike voices and support for 24 languages, developers can choose from both male and female voices with a variety of accents to make applications for users around the globe. And Amazon Polly's fluid pronunciation of text content means applications deliver high-quality voice output across a wide variety of text formats. Amazon Polly is scalable, returning high-quality speech fast, even when converting large volumes of text to speech. With Amazon Polly, developers pay only for the text they convert, and they can cache generated speech and replay it as many times as they like with no restrictions. \nThe Washington Post is a Pulitzer Prize-winning media and technology company that publishes more than 1200 stories a day. \"We've long been interested in providing audio versions of our stories, but have found that existing text-to-speech solutions are not cost-effective for the speech quality they offer,\" said Joseph Price, Senior Product Manager, The Washington Post. \"With the arrival of Amazon Polly and its high-quality voices, we look forward to offering readers more rich and versatile ways to experience our content.\" \nGoAnimate is a cloud-based, animated video creation platform, designed to allow business people with no background in animation to quickly and easily create animated videos. \"Amazon Polly gives GoAnimate users the ability to immediately give voice to the characters they animate using our platform. This is especially helpful in scenarios where live voiceover is either resource or time prohibitive, such as when developing a video in many languages, or within pre-production to speed the approval process,\" said Alvin Hung, CEO and Founder, GoAnimate. \"The speech from Amazon Polly is integrated seamlessly with our rich set of pre-animated assets, which reinforces GoAnimate's ease of use and affords our customers both efficiency and speed to market.\" \nIntelligent Image Analysis with Amazon Rekognition \nAmazon Rekognition enables developers to quickly and easily build applications that analyze images, and recognize faces, objects, and scenes. Amazon Rekognition uses deep learning technologies to automatically identify objects and scenes, such as vehicles, pets, or furniture, and provides a confidence score that lets developers tag images so that application users can search for specific images using key words. Amazon Rekognition can locate faces within images and detect attributes, such as whether or not the face is smiling or the eyes are open. Amazon Rekognition also supports advanced facial analysis functionalities such as face comparison and facial search. Using Rekognition, developers can build an application that measures the likelihood that faces in two images are of the same person, thereby being able to verify a user against a reference photo in near real-time. Similarly, developers can create collections of millions of faces (detected in images) and can search for a face similar to their reference image in the collection. Amazon Rekognition removes the complexity and overhead required to develop and manage expensive image processing pipelines by making comprehensive image classification, detection, and management capabilities available in a simple, cost-effective, and reliable AWS service. There are no upfront costs for Amazon Rekognition, developers pay only for the images they analyze and the facial feature vectors they store. \nRedfin is a full-service brokerage that uses modern technology to help people buy and sell houses. \"Redfin users love to browse images of properties on our site and mobile apps, and we want to make it easier for our users to sift through hundreds of millions of listing and images,\" says Yong Huang, Director of Big Data & Analytics, Redfin. \"Amazon Rekognition generates a rich set of tags directly from images of properties. This makes it relatively simple to build a smart search feature that helps customers discover houses based on their specific needs, such as a fireplace, yard, or swimming pool. And since Rekognition accepts Amazon S3 URLs, it is a huge time-saver to detect objects, scenes, and faces without having to move images around.\" \nSmugMug is a safe and beautiful home for photos that stores billions of beautiful photos for millions of amazing customers every day. \"SmugMug customers want to spend their time making more memories, not manually managing their photo collection,\" said Don MacAskill, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Geek, SmugMug. \"Amazon Rekognition will allow us to automatically identify the content in customers' photos, unlocking a host of features that will allow them and their visitors to have more time to focus on enjoying life and celebrating their photos.\" \nDeep Learning and AI on AWS \nAmazon Polly is available today in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), and EU (Dublin) Regions, and will expand to additional Regions in the coming months. Amazon Rekognition is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Dublin) Regions, and will expand to additional Regions in the coming months. Customers can sign up for the Amazon Lex preview starting today. \nIn addition to these services, AWS recently announced it is investing significantly in MXNet, an open source distributed deep learning framework, initially developed by Carnegie Mellon University and other top universities, by contributing code and improving the developer experience. MXNet will enable machine learning scientists to build scalable deep learning models that can significantly reduce the training time for their applications. For more information on AWS support for MXNet, visit: http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2016/11/mxnet-default-framework-deep-learning-aws.html . \nAWS also makes it easy for developers to run their own deep learning and machine learning workloads to build their own AI platform on top of AWS. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), with its broad set of instance types and GPUs with large amounts of memory, is ideal for deep learning training. P2 instances, launched in September 2016, were designed for large-scale machine learning and deep learning with up to 8 NVIDIA Tesla K80 Accelerators, each running a pair of NVIDIDA GK210 GPUs that have 12 GiB of memory and 2,496 parallel processing cores. And, customers can make use of AWS's Deep Learning AMI, which contains six pre-configured and pre-tested deep learning frameworks including all dependencies, Nvidia drivers, and data science tools like Jupyter and Anaconda. In addition, AWS CloudFormation templates are available for training deep neural networks at scale in just a few clicks. \nAbout Amazon Web Services \nFor 10 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 70 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, analytics, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT) and enterprise applications from 38 Availability Zones (AZs) across 14 geographic regions in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and India.

      "title": "Report: Microsoft’s answer to Amazon Echo may be Home Hub software for Windows 10",
      "text": "  \nAmazon’s Echo is an internet-connected, voice-activated speaker that you control by talking to it. Google Home is a similar device, but it uses Google’s Asisstant voice service rather than Amazon’s Alexa. And Apple is said to be working on a Siri-based version. \nBut what about Microsoft? The company reportedly has its own solution on the way… but according to Windows Central , it won’t be a standalone speaker. \nInstead, Microsoft Home Hub is expected to be new software that can turn any Windows 10 PC (with the right hardware) into a smart home hub. \nIn a nutshell, Home Hub is a souped-up version of Microsoft’s Cortana voice assistant software plus multi-user features that will let you designate a PC as a device for use by the whole family. It’s expected to roll out in 2017, also some parts of the experience are already included in the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update, which is already available to members of the Windows Insiders Program. \nRight now you can set up multiple user accounts on a single PC, but switching between them or sharing data between accounts can be a bit of a hassle. Home Hub will let you set up a “family” account that everyone in a household can access no matter which user is logged in. \nImagine you’ve got an all-in-one Windows 10 PC in the living room or kitchen. It has Home Hub software, a family account, and accounts for each of the members of your household. Since one of the features rolling out with the Windows 10 Creators Update is the ability to interact with Cortana from the lock screen, you’ll be able to approach the computer and start talking to it without unlocking it… and it won’t matter whether you’re currently logged in or not. \nAny shared calendar appointments or other data are available… and thanks to Windows Hello, you can also authenticate yourself quickly to access your private appointments, contacts, or other data without switching user accounts. \nCortana will also offer Alexa/Google Assistant-like integration with third-party services such as smart home hardware. \nBut since Home Hub is basically just software, you’ve also got a fully-functional PC. Want to jot a note with a digital pen and leave it for other members of the family to see? You can leave a virtual sticky note instead of posting it on the fridge. \nThe multi-user features seem like they could help set Home Hub apart from the competition. But I can’t help but wonder if people want to set up an always-on PC to act as a smart home hub with a screen and always-listening microphone when companies like Amazon and Google are banking on the simplicity of their voice-only solutions. \nWhile Amazon hasn’t released any official sales figures for its Echo products, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon has sold 5.1 million (PDF) Alexa-enabled devices since the Echo first launched in 2014. \nThat said, there’s also a report out this week suggesting that Amazon may be working on a new model that has a touchscreen display. So maybe Microsoft isn’t the only company that figures a smart home hub could benefit from a screen. Share this:",

      "title": "Gigabites: Amazon Truck Packs 100PB of Data",
      "text": "Tweet Welcome to your weekly edition of Gigabites. Today, Amazon drives a truck through data transfer speed records, Altice commits to fiber rollouts throughout its US footprint, Telefónica picks Nokia for 10-gigabit trials and more. \nWhat's faster than a gigabit connection by, oh, 20 years or so? Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN)'s new Snowmobile trucks designed to store and transfer up to 100 terabytes of data per truck, or a total of 100 petabytes of data using Amazon's entire fleet. \nAmazon Web Services Inc. announced the new Snowmobile service at the company's re:Invent 2016 conference. According to AWS, users can move 100PB of data \"in as little as a few weeks, plus transfer time.\" The company notes that the same transfer \"could take more than 20 years to accomplish over a direct connect line with a 1Gbps connection.\" Amazon Web Services Snowmobile truck, as depicted by Amazon \nThe purpose of Snowmobile is naturally to transfer large amounts of data to AWS infrastructure. At that point, customers can take advantage of Amazon's substantial storage capacity and cloud computing resources to make their data accessible around the world and perform actions like data analysis and disaster recovery implementations. Far from dismissing the importance of digital infrastructure, AWS is using Snowmobile to supplement telecommunications networks, marrying physical and virtual logistics in a way that only Amazon can. \nFor more gigabit coverage and insights, check out our dedicated Gigabit/Broadband content channel here on Light Reading. \nLeaving Amazon aside, Altice was the big headline-maker in gigabit news this week. The French company unveiled plans on Wednesday to deliver 10-gigabit Internet speeds to customers by driving fiber to the home across its entire US footprint, which today passes nearly 8 million residences. The deployment plan is an ambitious one, but Altice believes it can complete the rollout over the next five years without significantly increasing its capex budget, which maxed out at about $1.4 million in the most recent quarter. (See Altice FTTH Bill Could Hit Almost $9.6B in US .) \nAltice says it will avoid additional spending by \"[reinvesting] efficiency savings to support the buildout.\" According to SNL Kagan analyst Jeff Heynen, who spoke to Multichannel News , Altice is in an enviable position because much of its US footprint is already fiber-rich, and because the company has a lot of aerial plant, which will allow it to avoid expensive trenching activity. Altice also claims to have developed proprietary technology for its fiber rollout, which the company could be hoping will be more cost-effective than other next-generation FTTH technologies already emerging. \nThe US isn't the only country with 10-gigabit Internet speeds on the agenda. Spanish provider Telefónica announced it has successfully tested FTTH equipment from Nokia Corp. (NYSE: NOK) that will also allow it to hit the 10-gigabit threshold. Unlike Altice, Telefónica is exploring standard technology for its FTTH network plans: XGS-PON. Nokia says nine operators are now using its XGS-PON gear. (See Eurobites: Telefónica Fires Up Nokia's XGS-PON .) \nStill speaking of 10-gig, a small municipal broadband provider in Tennessee announced this week that it's selected Calix Networks Inc. (NYSE: CALX) as its partner for a major network upgrade. Tullahoma Utilities Authority said it will deploy the Calix E7-2 Modular Access Systems, GigaCenters and 700GE optical network terminals to enable a transition to 10-gigabit PON technology. \nAnd finally, it wouldn't be a Gigabites roundup without news of a new neighborhood on AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T)'s gigabit launch list. This week, the telco said it has expanded gigabit access to new areas in the Greensboro, North Carolina region. \n— Mari Silbey, Senior Editor, Cable/Video, Light Reading (0) |",

      "text": "  AMZN \nThe growth of smartphones and the ever-improving online payment systems have jointly made people much more comfortable about shopping online. The sheer convenience of sitting at home and ordering things to be delivered to your doorstep is indeed irresistible, and the growth rate of the e-commerce market stands testimony to people’s changing preferences. \nThere are still several parts of the retail business that will be a difficult nut to crack for e-commerce players, such as groceries or niche segments like home improvement products, but they are only a small part of the trillion-dollar retail industry. According to the e-marketer forecast shown in the graph above, e-commerce sales are going to accelerate from $1.5 trillion in 2015 to $4.05 trillion by 2020 - that is nearly three times the current size. \nThe problem for physical retailers is that this is not a new market being created by major e-commerce players like Amazon, but more of a shift in the existing market towards a new system of buying and selling products. To put it simply, Amazon is not creating new customers; they are, in fact, stealing customers from their physical counterparts. \nIf Amazon continues to hold its lead over companies like Wal-Mart ( NYSE:WMT ), Target ( NYSE:TGT ), Kohl’s ( NYSE:KSS ) and other brick and mortar stores, the company is only going to eat away further at their collective market share. The bigger Amazon gets, the more difficult it will be to catch up. The only way forward now is to aggressively pursue their own online agendas, but is it too little, too late? \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.

      "text": "Apple accused a third-party seller on Amazon of faking the authenticity of its iPhone chargers a couple of months ago. Now, an independent research firm has come up with a warning that such phony chargers present a huge risk.\nadapt by theilr on 2014-11-15 19:10:24 Only 1% of chargers are safe The U.K.’s Chartered Trading Standards Institute conducted a study recently. It referred to fake devices as “unknown entities.” Leon Livermore, CEO of the institute, warned that fake products may seem less expensive than authentic ones, but their actual cost could end up being much higher.\n“It might cost a few pounds more but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one,” Livermore said.\nThe Trading Standards Institute tested 400 purported iPhone chargers and found that only three (or less than 1%) had enough insulation to safeguard a user against electric shocks. For testing purposes, a high amount of voltage was applied to the chargers, which were purchased online in eight different countries, including China, Australia and the U.S.\nIn a separate study, it was found that 15% of the of the 3,019 electrical goods bought second-hand were not compliant with regulations, notes the BBC . Researchers advise it is always unsafe to use electrical items which come from antique dealers, second-hand shops, and charity shops, as many come with failings like basic insulation and counterfeit plugs.\nHow to spot fake iPhone chargers Just weeks ago, Apple filled a lawsuit against Mobile Star for allegedly selling fake chargers on Amazon. Apple purchased and tested more than 100 Lightning cables and chargers marked as “Fulfilled by Amazon” and found that 90% of them were fake.\nTo help buyers check if their Apple device chargers are authentic or not, the Trading Standards Institute issued a few guidelines. First, the plug must swiftly fit into the power socket without applying any force; second, always search for Apple branding, the UL and CE safety marks and a batch number (these can be faked though); last, if your charger does not come with instructions and safety materials, it might be fake.\nNevertheless, the best option always is to buy directly from Apple or from a well-known third-party accessory maker like Monoprice, Kensington, Belkin and more. As a precautionary measure, consumers are always advised not to overcharge their gadgets, never cover their devices when charging and never use a charger with a frayed cable or cracked case.\nPhoto by theilr \nThe post Fake iPhone Chargers Are Risky For Your Life, Here’s How To Spot Them appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "\"Good Girls Revolt\" actor Genevieve Angelson in New York City.\nPhoto by Bennett Raglin, WireImage/Getty High ratings apparently aren't enough to save a show from the chopping block. Amazon is canceling \"Good Girls Revolt,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter on Friday. The period drama made its debut on Amazon Prime as an original series earlier this year. \nWhy cancel it? Sources told The Hollywood Reporter that Amazon Studios head Roy Price gave Season 2 the thumbs down, possibly in part because he projects the series won't garner any awards. Sources also said the show brought in more viewers than many other Amazon original series. \nFor Internet-only platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, original-programming gold is more important than ever in battling traditional cable outlets for ad dollars and viewers. The latter also translates into paid subscriptions. Amazon's other original shows include \"Mozart in the Jungle,\" \"Transparent\" and \"Lost in Oz.\" \nSony Pictures Television, the studio behind \"Good Girls Revolt,\" reportedly wants to find the series a new home, saving it from becoming a one-hit wonder like 1999's also highly acclaimed \" Freaks and Geeks .\" \nAmazon didn't respond to a request for comment.\n ",

      "text": "Don't Miss These December Amazon Sales Amazon's Holiday Deals Are Just Getting Started December 2, 2016 , 8:40 PM \"The 12 Days of Christmas\" is one of those songs that gets used in about a million holiday commercials each year, always with some lame, punny twist. And while I usually ignore everything I see with the \"12 Days Of\" trope attached, I hope you'll believe me when I say that you should not ignore Amazon's 12 Days of Deals: a dozen days your bank account can get very excited about. This Sunday, Amazon will kick off its 12 days of sales, each of which with a different theme. Sunday is all about gifts for kids, Monday is books and media, Tuesday is gifts for entertaining and foodies, and so forth. December 12 is lined up to be Cyber Monday 2.0, with deals on tech and gadgets. The last day of deals, December 15, opens up to sales on stocking stuffers in general, so you can wrap up the odds and ends of your holiday shopping.Pro tip: If you want extra sales, shop on your phone. The Amazon app will offer flash sales from December 7 to 20 in addition to the themed deals that are already taking place on site.At last, there's a \"12 Days Of\" riff that I can get on board with.

      "text": "December 2, 2016 1:00 pm From left: Roku; Apple; Amazon If you're looking to stream Netflix, Amazon, Hulu or other services for the first time, want to upgrade to the latest tech, or want to give a loved one the gift of streaming, here are the most popular hardware options to choose from. Chromecast Chromecast Ultra The idea of “casting” can scare nontechies. It shouldn’t: Simply plug the tiny Chromecast into your TV and, after an easy setup via a smartphone or tablet, you’ll be able to use those devices to stream Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. to your television. If you own a Google Home, voice command allows you to instruct the Chromecast to play YouTube videos (more apps like Netflix will be compatible soon). $69 Apple Apple TV You ask Siri the weather. Why not also instruct her to “Show me TV shows with James Marsden”? The Siri-enabled Apple TV (available in 32GB and 64GB) will search iTunes and Netflix for a list you can then narrow down by saying, “Just the Westerns” or “Just the new ones.” One issue: Apple TV doesn’t have an Amazon app, so the only way to watch Amazon Prime shows is to stream them to the device via another Apple product. $149–$199 Amazon Amazon Fire Stick, Fire TV Like shoes and bags, your player should match your TV. The Fire TV runs 4K Ultra HD video, so it pairs well with new souped-up sets. While little bro the Stick doesn’t, it’s low in price and super small (more counter space!). Both have remotes that run Amazon’s voice assistant, Alexa. Want to rewind to see that Grey’s Anatomy kiss again? Say, “Rewind 30 seconds.” Want to skip the Walking Dead in which Glenn dies? Say, “Next episode.” Fire Stick: $40; Fire TV: $90 Roku Roku Stick, Roku Ultra Think of the easiest thing to do. Using a Roku is easier. The pared-down home screens make getting to Netflix, Hulu and other platforms brainless. The search function is “agnostic” and won’t prioritize one streaming service’s content over another’s—so you’ll never accidentally buy a movie you can watch through one of your monthly subscriptions. The Roku Stick is the only portable device with a quad-core processor (i.e., it works as smoothly as the bigger boxes). The Ultra plays 4K video, has a voice-controlled remote and a “lost remote finder” feature. Roku Stick: $50; Roku Ultra: $130 < >",

      "text": "Fly to South Africa for Only $729 from the East Coast 5 days ago \nAmazon has the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy on sale for $27 ! This is the extended cut and on Blu-ray. \nThis means over eleven hours of cinematic goodness. And of course, we all know the reason the movie is that long… \nIn all seriousness, this is a great deal and Amazon is (not surprisingly since it is December 2nd) guaranteeing it for Christmas. \nI don’t think I need to explain what this movie Trilogy is to you. If you don’t know what it is, I’d try to make a LOTR pun about it, but unfortunately, all the good ones Aragon. Please note, if you purchase anything through my Amazon links, I may receive referral credit for your purchase.",

      "title": "Walmart's new gas-and-grocery hybrids could become a major threat to Amazon and Kroger (WMT)",
      "text": "Walmart is opening a new kind of gas station that offers more than just coffee, snacks, and fuel. \nThe convenience stores, called Walmart Pickup and Fuel, also offer same-day pickup for groceries ordered online.\nThere are only two locations right now — one in Huntsville, Alabama and the other in Thornton, Colorado — but if expanded, they could make Walmart an even bigger threat to companies like Amazon and Kroger that are betting big on the growth of online grocery shopping.\nWalmart The new stores offer  grab-and-go items, including hot sandwiches, healthy snacks, drinks, and a coffee bar, as well as basics like milk, eggs, and bread, according to Walmart. They are open from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. \nFor a wider selection of grocery items, online grocery pickup is available at the stores between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Customers can order groceries before 1 p.m. and pick them up that same day, after 5 p.m.  \nWalmart employees pick and pack the groceries at a nearby Walmart supercenter, and load them into customers' cars at the Walmart Pickup and Fuel for free. \nWalmart already offers online grocery pickup at hundreds of stores. But this new store concept is meant to make that process easier and more convenient, thanks in part to the small size of the stores and parking lots.  \nThe concept sounds eerily similar to a new kind of store that Amazon is planning to launch.  \nAmazon has plans to roll out 20 grocery stores by the end of 2018 . The stores will have different formats, but half of them will likely be \"click-and-collect\" drive-up spots for Amazon customers to pick up their online orders — just like Walmart's new Pickup and Fuel stores.\nThe other half of Amazon's new stores could look like miniature versions of traditional grocery stores. \nKroger has also been investing heavily in online grocery. The company offers online grocery pickup at more than 500 stores. But unlike Walmart, Kroger charges a fee for picking up online orders, which is about $4.95 per order in Richmond, Virginia. \nNOW WATCH: Here's how much an iPhone 7, a TV, and sneakers would cost if they were made in the US \n",

      "text": "“Good Girls Revolt” was cancelled by Amazon, and we have LOTS of feelings Sarah Terry More We’ve been talking about the fact that there aren’t enough female-driven TV shows on the air for a while now. But things have been getting better. That’s why we were SO bummed that Amazon announced that they cancelled Good Girls Revolt , an awesome show starring a bunch of fabulous ladies. The show followed the young women working in a newspaper office in the ’60s, where only men get to be reporters. But these badass ladies stand up for their equal rights and demand the opportunity to write. The feminist angle to the show makes it a double bummer that Amazon decided to cancel it. Good Girls Revolt was also cancelled, despite being one of the best reviewed dramas on Amazon. According to The Hollywood Reporter , the show got mostly positive reviews from around town. Amazon even boasted that Good Girls Revolt was the “top binged first season of a U.S.-produced Amazon original series ever over its first 10 days.” If the show was doing so well, why would they cancel it? More According to The Hollywood Reporter , it’s possible that the show wasn’t considered an awards season contender, which is important to Amazon based on the success of the streaming network’s comedies. We are just disappointed that Amazon cancelled a great show with such a clear feminist point of view. We don’t get enough of those as it is! But luckily, Sony plans to shop Good Girls Revolt to other networks. More We’d like to see that happen ASAP! Because the other bummer about the show’s cancellation is that we don’t get to find out what happens. Season 1 left us with a cliffhanger, and we NEED to know. But the good news is that Sony, the studio that produced the show, has not given up. They plan to “shop” it to other networks, which means a new season of Good Girls Revolt could land at another channel or streaming service. The show’s creator, Dana Calvo, had a response that gives us hope. Amazon passing on S2 of Good Girls Revolt. But so grateful we got to tell the story. We won the popular vote. Thank u And Dana’s statement to Kate Arthur from Buzzfeed (via Twitter) is awesome: I just called @DanaSCalvo of #GoodGirlsRevolt , and she said this about its cancellation. pic.twitter.com/rFM5vA5Nc9 — Kate Aurthur (@KateAurthur) December 2, 2016 “Based on data provided to us from Sony, Symphony Advanced Media reported our show was a hit, and we have loyal viewers. Eighty percent of people who watched the first few minutes of the pilot stayed until the last minutes of the finale. We had twice Transparent’s audience. We were stunned by Amazon’s decision, but heartened and encouraged by Sony’s devotion to the project.” Genevieve Angelson and Anna Camp, two of the awesome ladies who star in the show, tweeted about the show’s cancellation. Act your heart out and leave everything on the table. No matter the outcome. #goodgirlsrevolt pic.twitter.com/OzD1bt5Qjb — Anna Camp (@TheRealAnnaCamp) December 2, 2016 this is all a part of an important story about women and we're all gonna tell it together #goodgirlsrevolt — Genevieve Angelson (@GenevieveAngel) December 2, 2016 We will keep our fingers crossed and hope this fabulous show finds new life somewhere else. Because we haven’t had quite enough of Good Girls Revolt !",

      "title": "Amazon Adds 28 New Services as It Keeps Expanding Cloud Infrastructure",
      "text": "NEWS ANALYSIS: Amazon Web Services made 28 announcements about new cloud solutions and enhancements over two days during its re:Invent conference as it continues to expand its infrastructure. LAS VEGAS—Amazon Web Services this week showed once again just how much farther ahead of the pack it is in cloud computing and how high it is setting the bar for the future—not just for cloud computing, but all of IT. At the company’s re:Invent conference here, AWS CEO Andy Jassy and CTO Werner Vogels made 28 announcements over two days, each one seeming to top the last and eliciting cheers on several occasions from the keynote audiences, which this year totaled 32,000, a significant increase from last year’s 19,000. Jassy and Co. had a little fun while they were at it. After having endured a barrage of mockery from Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison at the Open World conference in September, AWS returned the favor. Jassy said AWS customers have the power to see through the “hand waving and bombast” of “old guard leaders” such as Ellison, who had taken AWS to task for being behind the times in its database and platform technology. Oracle’s assertions, Jassy said, were based on “wild claims and benchmarks that suit their purposes.”AWS now can stake its own claim for equal if not superior data management technology. Jassy announced a PostgreSQL-compatible version of its Aurora database to go along with the MySQL-compatible version. Also new is Athena, a SQL query tool for Amazon’s ubiquitous storage service, S3.Vogels added to that announcements for Amazon Pinpoint, a “data engagement service” that sounds a lot like omnichannel marketing analytics tools from Oracle and Salesforce.com. To round out the data management news, Vogels announced AWS Glue, a fully managed data catalog and extract, transform and load (ETL) service that enables users to move data between databases for more efficient analytics. AWS also beefed up the next versions of its data transfer appliance to help users get data into the cloud. Snowball, announced last year, was so popular that AWS had to up the ante, Jassy said. The new version, Snowball Edge, can carry up to 100TB and is rack-mountable. The next step up from there is Snowmobile, which can hold up to 100 petabytes (PB) and comes complete with its own ruggedized, climate-controlled shipping container that was hauled into the keynote area at the end of Jassy’s talk. Going Serverless But the big stories at the conference—and going forward—were serverless computing and artificial intelligence (AI) services. Serverless computing, which AWS introduced with its Lambda event-driven service two years ago, appears to be poised to take over as the primary method of running compute services in AWS, in addition to EC2 instances and containers. Several large customers, including iRobot and FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority), told their stories of converting much of their infrastructure to Lambda functions. FINRA processes 500 billion transaction validations a day, running them as Lambda functions. So, the disappearing data center also could lead to the disappearing server. During one session AWS speakers actually brought out a magician to make a real server disappear like the rabbit in the hat. Does such a model—wherein compute is so much cheaper for the user—end up hurting AWS’ ability to make money on compute? Not so, said Michael Liebow of AWS partner Accenture, which is in the process of converting its applications to serverless. “Serverless is orders of magnitude cheaper and accelerates the server,” said Liebow, global managing director for Accenture Cloud Platform, which runs on the AWS cloud. “This is the post-infrastructure era. It changes how you design solutions. You pay for what you use. For AWS, it’s really a volume play. The usage scales up even faster [than running on EC2].” Accenture’s AWS Business Group, for its part, announced an expanded relationship with AWS around internet of things systems, transformation services, and analytics and big data Services. At re:Invent, AWS announced three major initiatives around serverless computing. The first, AWS Greengrass, is a service that enables Lambda to be embedded on devices, giving them the ability to execute code on their own without having to send data back to the cloud (Greengrass is also included on the new Snowball Edge). The second, Lambda@Edge, is a model by which developers can put JavaScript code at AWS edge locations to execute remote functions. Finally, AWS Step Functions is a way for developers to map out in a visual workflow format how serverless components interact with each other and in what order. All in with AI AWS has been doing AI for a long time, and parent company Amazon is making a lot of money with its Alexa AI-powered Echo devices for consumers. At re:Invent, Jassy announced a new set of AI services that enterprise developers can now use for their own applications. Amazon AI includes Rekognition, a facial recognition service; Polly, a text-to-speech service; and Lex, which is the natural language technology from the Alexa device. Several customers are adding what are called Alexa “Skills” to their own applications, including Expedia and GE Appliances, while Intel is working with AWS to create reference designs for OEMs. It’s easy to see how just about any application that can tie back to the AWS cloud will be capable of having voice-enabled and intelligent services. The next step is proactive applications, in which Lambda functions can fire commands to a mobile device or Echo speaker to remind users to take out the garbage or take their medicine. As he did at the AWS Global Partner Summit earlier in the week, Jassy enjoined attendees to embrace the direction AWS is headed. He reflected on the 10 years of AWS existence at this, the fifth re:Invent. “We wasted a lot of time and energy wondering if people would embrace the cloud,” he said. Now, he speaks with confidence that over time all enterprise data center workloads will move to the cloud. “The next 10 years will have markedly more innovation than the first.” As he likes to say, “Giddy up.” Scot Petersen is a technology analyst at Ziff Brothers Investments, a private investment firm.

      "text": "HIGHLIGHTS Sony, TriStar look to buy back rights and continue series Star Dana Calvo “stunned” by decision The Amazon series “Good Girls Revolt,” which premiered in October to mostly positive reviews, has been canceled by the streaming service, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \nSony Pictures Television and TriStar Television banner are in the process of securing the rights back from Amazon in hopes of shopping the series to another outlet. \n  10-episode drama, which was set in 1969, followed a group of young female researchers working at News of the Week and was inspired by the landmark sexual discrimination cases covered in Lynn Povich’s book “Good Girls Revolt.” \nAccording to streaming monitor Symphony Advanced Media, the series collected more viewers than many of Amazon’s other originals. Reportedly, Amazon Studios head Roy Price didn’t see it as an awards-season player and passed on a second season. \n“Based on data provided to us from Sony, Symphony Advanced Media reported our show was a hit, and we have loyal viewers,” cast member Dana Calvo told BuzzFeed hours after hearing of the cancellation. “Eighty percent of people who watched the first few minutes of the pilot stayed until the last minutes of the finale. We had twice ‘Transparent’s’ audience. We were stunned by Amazon’s decision, but heartened and encouraged by Sony’s devotion to the project.” TV Best TV shows online now \nOf Amazon’s launches this year, “One Mississippi” has been picked up for another year and prospects look good for “Goliath.” Still uncertain are the possibilities of a second year for “Fleabag” or Woody Allen’s “Crisis in Six Scenes.”  ",

      "text": "Samsung \n360-degree video is So Hot Right Now. Between the launch of Daydream, expanded support in apps like YouTube, and a continuing interest in headsets like Gear VR and the Oculus Rift, video creators wouldn't be unwise to dip a toe into this particular pool. (If only wearables had stayed so hot.) Samsung's consumer-grade 360-degree camera, creatively called the Gear 360, is currently on sale for $50 off at Amazon , Best Buy , and B&H Photo . That brings the price down to $299.99. \nIf the Gear VR isn't the most high-powered 360-degree camera around, then at least it's the prettiest. The little snowball uses two camera modules and fisheye lenses to record omnidirectional video, then stitch it back together into a single file. The combined resolution is 3840x1920 at 30 frames per second, so it's not going to be quite good enough for pro-level photography, but as a relatively cheap way to check out the format it'll work just fine. Users can transfer photos or still images to the smartphone app or store them on a MicroSD card slot. A small battery allows the gadget to double as a GoPro-style \"action cam,\" and there are plenty of available accessories for that purpose. \nIf $300 is still too rich for your blood, there's another alternative. DailySteals has the LG 360 Cam, a similar but less capable (and stylish) device, for just $99.99 for the next three days. Source:",

      "text": "\nWith Rogue One’s Jyn Erso staging a coup against the Empire and real-life journalists vowing to stand their ground against president-elect Donald Trump, I smell rebellion all around. But like the Star Wars one-shot says, rebellions are built on hope . That’s why I’m not not too worried about Good Girls Revolt , the retro drama which was just canceled by Amazon.\nThe retro drama centers on a group of female researchers at a fictional weekly newspaper in 1969. Despite advancements in civil rights, women in the newsroom still find themselves in low-level, low-paying editorial position. Even when they’re making generous contributions like assisting with a story or even writing, their names never make it on the bylines. The show is an adaptation of the novel by Lynn Povich, which was inspired by frustrating real-life events.\nAccording to Variety, this may not be the be-all and end-all for the show. Sony, the studio behind the series, is reportedly planning to shop it around elsewhere. While not traditional, this route isn’t particularly new. Just this year, ABC canceled their drama Nashville , only for it to be picked up by CMT. Girlfriends spin-off The Game lasted for three seasons at the CW before BET scooped it up and kept it going for six more. Similar occurrences for shows like The Mindy Project , Arrested Development and Community .\nSo yes, there is hope that these kick ass women fighting the patriarchy at their Newsweek -like paper will live to rebel another day.\n(via Variety , image via screencap)\nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "Amazon's new Snowmobile collects data instead of blasting through powder This is far more than just simply backing up your hard drive. Share Save \nMoving large amounts of electronically stored data is both difficult and time consuming. Current internet technology limits how quickly data can be transferred using the internet. While a few pictures on your phone can be uploaded in seconds, backing up all the data for an entire corporation can take years. This is a problem Amazon Web Services, the cloud-based computing arm of the online retailer, is currently dealing with. They now have a solution: the Snowmobile, literally a massive mobile server. \nThe Snowmobile is an expansion of Amazon's Snowball service. Amazon ships an 80 terabyte Snowball storage unit to customers. Once they uploaded their data, the customer would ship the Snowball back to Amazon so the data could be directly transferred to a server. Amazon designed the Snowball to deal with high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns at come with moving large amounts of data over the internet.For some customers, the Snowball simply didn't provide enough space. This led to the development of the Snowmobile, a semi-truck with 100 petabytes (or 100 million gigabytes) of storage that Amazon will use to directly transfer and move digital data from a customer to one of their data storage facilities. Essentially, they send customers a truck-sized hard drive that will physically move all of your stored data. Although it may sound strange to use a truck to move digital data, moving 100 petabytes over fiber internet could take more than 20 years. According to Wired , a Snowmobile can do a full New York to Los Angeles trip in 10 days, including the data transfer time.Pricing is based on how much data is stored on the Snowmobile per month. Amazon is charging $0.005 per gigabyte, which is relatively inexpensive. Do the math and you'll find that a fully-loaded truck will set you back $500,000. Amazon obviously believes there will be enough demand to invest in the Snowmobile.Amazon Web Services has storage facilities worldwide, with several scattered throughout the United States. This means the turnaround time for a Snowmobile can be days, not years. For Amazon's part, they're taking Snowmobile security and encryption very seriously. The company will provide dedicated security personnel, GPS tracking, alarm monitoring, and 24/7 video surveillance. Customers have the option of a security escort vehicle to accompany the Snowmobile while in transit. The truck itself will be tamper-resistant, water-resistant and temperature controlled.

      "text": "4.47”(L) x 2.99”(W) x 0,38”(D) Weight: Transfer rate: Up to 220MB per second \nThe drive uses perpendicular magnetic recording ( PMR ) technology to store data on its two spinning magnetic discs (platters). This type of data recording provides more storage density than the traditional “longitudinal” recording. Imagine each magnetic disc as an optical disc or a vinyl record with thousands of invisible tracks storing millions of bits on each track. The perpendicular recording method places data bits pointed up or down perpendicular to the disk surface whereas the longitudinal method places the bits “circumferentially” along the track direct. \nOnce customers connect the new Seagate Duet drive to their Windows PC or Mac, the device automatically pulls up their Amazon account. After the login process, it will then begin syncing photos, music, pictures, and other personal data the user already has stored in Amazon’s cloud. At the same time, all files saved/moved to the external drive are automatically copied to Amazon Drive as well. What’s great with this solution is that media and files placed into the Amazon Drive app for smartphones and tablets will end up on the external drive too. \n“Accessing stored files, photos, and videos while away from the Seagate Duet drive is also easy using the Amazon Drive mobile app,” Seagate said . “This phone and tablet app gives access to photos and videos saved on the Seagate Duet drive and in the cloud. This way, it’s possible to relive the best moments with loved ones wherever and whenever.” \nCustomers who pre-order the Seagate Duet drive now from Amazon will receive free shipping. Gift-wrapping is also available for those who want to throw it under the Christmas tree later this month. Also watch:",
