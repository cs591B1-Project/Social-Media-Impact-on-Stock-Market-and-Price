Brand-new Amazon Original Specials include the animated If You Give a Mouse a Christmas Cookie and Ezra Jack Keats’ The Snowy Day , along with the live-action An American Girl Story -- Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas as well as existing holiday episodes from Creative Galaxy and Tumble Leaf . \n“We are so excited to bring our customers our first-ever holiday line-up of specials this season, with If You Give a Mouse a Christmas Cookie and The Snowy Day based on beloved children’s books that highlight strong bonds between friends and families. It’s what the holidays are all about,” said Tara Sorensen, Head of Kids Programming at Amazon Studios. “The American Girl Maryellen special is an inspiring feel-good story that will surely become a holiday family favorite for our customers.” \nIf You Give a Mouse a Christmas Cookie \nIf You Give a Mouse a Christmas Cookie is an animated holiday special based on the classic If You Give a Mouse a Cookie book series written by Laura Numeroff and illustrated by Felicia Bond. In this special, it’s holiday time and in Mouse’s house that means Christmas cookies (including a special one for Santa, of course), caroling with friends…and one nearly-destroyed holiday pageant. Can Mouse and his animal friends save the show, without getting utterly distracted along the way? It’s a wild ride as Mouse and his friends work together to solve a problem in a fun and creative way. The special is written and produced by Ken Scarborough ( Doug , Curious George, Martha Speaks, Arthur, and Saturday Night Live ); stars Mason Mahay (voice of Oliver), Roger Craig Smith ( Avengers Assemble and Wreck-It Ralph ), Jessica DiCiccio ( Over the Hedge ), Jeff Bennett ( Futurama ), and Lara Jill Miller ( The Loud House , Henry Hugglemonster , and Doc McStuffins ). The special also features an original song “Christmas Cookie Song” by Lisa Loeb, available exclusively on Amazon Music to download and stream November 25. If You Give a Mouse a Cookie was part of Amazon’s 2015 fall pilot season rated 4.7 stars by customers with 82% 5-star reviews; season one will premiere on Amazon Prime Video next year. \nEzra Jack Keats’ The Snowy Day \nThe Snowy Day is an animated holiday special based on the award-winning book by Ezra Jack Keats. The book is well-known as one of the first picture books to feature an African-American protagonist, has won many awards, including the Caldecott medal–one of the highest honors in children’s literature, and was included in the Library of Congress’ list of “Books that Shaped America.” The special follows Peter, a young boy in a red snowsuit, as his mother sends him on an adventure to Nana’s house to retrieve their traditional Christmas mac and cheese dinner. Enjoying the snowy day along the way, Peter encounters friends from the neighborhood, including storekeepers and bakers to the older boys he admires – and a group of a capella singers voiced by Boyz II Men. After arriving at Nana’s and retrieving the mac and cheese—and his most coveted gift, a brand-new red sled—Nana helps Peter team up with the older boys for an epic snowball fight, resulting in the destruction of the special holiday dinner and his sled. When the neighborhood comes together to celebrate new traditions with Peter and his family, Peter realizes that the true meaning of the holiday is who you spend it with. Narrated by Laurence Fishburne ( Black-ish , Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice , and The Matrix ) and featuring voice talent by Regina King ( American Crime and The Leftovers), Jamie-Lynn Sigler ( The Sopranos ), and Angela Bassett ( American Horror Story and BoJack Horseman ), The Snowy Day features an original song “Snowy Day” by Boyz II Men, available exclusively on Amazon Music to download and stream November 25. Executive produced by Laurence Fishburne and Helen Sugland ( Akeelah and the Bee ) as well as Ann Austen, Irene Sherman, and Deborah Pope (Ezra Jack Keats Foundation). \nAn American Girl Story -- Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas \nAn American Girl Story -- Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas is the second collaboration between American Girl and Amazon and is based on American Girl’s previously launched BeForever character Maryellen Larkin. The special is set during Christmas in 1955 in Daytona Beach, Florida, where middle child Maryellen (Alyvia Alyn Lind ) longs to stand out amidst the hustle and bustle of her big, busy family. A boisterous and artistic girl, Maryellen’s adventurous spirit is sometimes at odds with the era she’s living in: when conformity was valued above individuality. When Benji (Samuel Faraci), a family friend afflicted with polio comes to stay with them and visit Daytona Beach’s hospital for care, Maryellen is inspired to help the polio patients have the best Christmas ever. But her first attempts fall flat, followed by a fight with her best friend Davy (Maxwell Acee Donovan). With guidance and advice from Maryellen’s wise and sympathetic mother (Mary McCormack), Maryellen learns the key to helping others is through listening. Through her gift of drawing, Maryellen helps give the children an extraordinary Christmas they’ll never forget. Executive produced by Jane Startz ( Ella Enchanted ). An American Girl Story -- Maryellen 1955: Extraordinary Christmas features an original song “Christmas and Everyday” by Best Coast, available exclusively on Amazon Music to download and stream November 25. \nThese specials are part of Prime Video’s growing line-up of award-winning and critically acclaimed Originals for kids and families -- to see more originals available exclusively for Prime members visit www.amazon.com/originals . \nSource: Amazon Studios",

      "text": "10 Amazon vouchers of $40 and 1 of $100 for recharges above $10 made from the USA to mobiles in Honduras between November 1st, 2016 and April 30th, 2017.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nLlamaHonduras.com hosts a new promotion for Hondurans who live in the USA and recharge a Claro Honduras cell phone on LlamaHonduras.com.

Prizes vary according to the amount recharged on LlamaHonduras.com. Anyone living in the USA can benefit of this promotion. The only condition is to have a free account on the website and send a minimum of $10 as mobile credit to a Claro mobile in Honduras: https://llamahonduras.com/buy/mobile_recharge\nEach month, LlamaHonduras.com will offer, by random pick:\n10 Amazon vouchers of $40 each for top ups higher than $10; 1 Amazon voucher of $100 for top ups higher than $25.\nFor Hondurans in the USA, who send Claro credit to mobiles in Honduras, this is a win-win situation.

The price to call landlines in Honduras is 10.9 cents/minute, while the price/minute for calls to mobiles in Honduras is 15.9 cents. In other words, one can get up to 91 minutes for $10 Voice Credit purchase.\nThank You points are offered on any regular purchase on the expat website, outside the promotional period. Once these points reach 1000, they can be converted in $10 Voice Credit for free calls to Honduras and other parts of the world.\nLlamaHonduras.com makes available 3 ways to call.

      "text": "Photo: Paul Morigi/Getty Images \nDirector and screenwriter David O. Russell — tired of picking up Oscar nominations ( The Fighter , Silver Linings Playbook , American Hustle ) — is making the move to prestige television, and he's bringing some major star power with him. A few months ago, it was announced that Russell was shopping around a television series with Julianne Moore and Robert De Niro already attached to star, and according to Deadline , Amazon has won the bidding war and already signed up to produce two 8-episode seasons. While everyone is rather tight-lipped about the exact premise of the series, rumor has it that the show will be a mafia drama — which has us hoping we're dealing with some sort of American Hustle spin-off and the return of Jennifer Lawrence to some choice period outfits.",

      "text": "Talk \nAmazon is gaining ground in apparel. \nAmazon ’s push in fashion has it gaining steam in apparel, but so far it’s mostly in basics. \nAccording to e-commerce research firm One Click Retail, October apparel sales on Amazon grew 5 percent versus a year earlier and 85 percent compared with September. \nBut luxury shopping still has yet to come to the e-commerce behemoth in full force. \nOne Click analyst Jeff Brown said Halloween costumes led the growth for the month, accounting for an estimated $21 million in sales and 27 percent in the total lift in apparel month-over-month. \nOutside of costumes, the men’s category in October saw “very strong growth,” said Brown, who has worked at Target and Overstock.com. \nAmazon is still largely seen as a destination for functional basics, with popular items including Levi’s 501 Original Fit Jeans and workwear items such as Dickies overalls and Carhartt hoodies. \nIn September, back-to-school shopping fueled the number-two growth category of shoes, with athletic shoes accounting for more than $28 million in sales. \nOne Click Retail has been tracking Amazon sales data since 2015 and found that, compared with other categories that are experiencing “explosive” growth, apparel growth has been “relatively flat.” \n“ Although Amazon had a big push for luxury goods , the mainstays, such as underwear, socks, jeans, workout apparel and sporting goods, are doing the best,” said One Click’s managing partner Spencer Millerberg, who previously worked at both Wal-Mart and Amazon. \nAmazon has made attempts at attracting luxury retailers, but it’s struggled to gain significant traction. Recently, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said that the company would not do business with Amazon in its existing business model. \n“Amazon has been described as the ‘mall of the mess,’ and when you take a look at it, that’s probably a fair statement,” Millerberg said. “It’s the same reason that Wal-Mart has struggled. It’s not the destination that customers think of first, and not the way they shop, either.” \nMillerberg said it was an awareness problem. \n“They didn’t have the brand and the product two years ago, and one year ago they didn’t have the platform to support it; now, they have an awareness issue,” he said. \nSome experts anticipate that Amazon will experiment with a physical retail space in the form of a pop-up shop or sample shop to build awareness of Amazon apparel. Amazon has also slowly started rolling a number of lines of in-house apparel. \n“It’s the same thing as everything Amazon does,” said Millerberg. “They launched private brands of baby wipes and now they are the number-three brand in the space. They’ve done it in hundreds of different categories, but I don’t know if they will be able to make those same in roads [in apparel].”",

Quote: Once a powerful lawyer, Billy McBride is now a washed up ambulance chaser, who spends more time in bars than the courtroom. When Billy reluctantly agrees to pursue a wrongful death lawsuit against the massive law firm he helped create, a vast and deadly conspiracy comes to light. Billy and his team end up in a life-or-death trial against the ultimate foe, which could end up helping Billy find redemption and exact revenge on the firm. The Amazon original series is created by David E. Kelley and Jonathan Shapiro. Wouldn't mind another season.",

      "text": "November 7, 2016 By Jonathan Ping Leave a Comment \nAmazon has a targeted promotion for Prime members that offers you a 2% bonus when you reload your Amazon gift card balance using a checking account. For example, if you load $100, you will get $102 in Amazon credit. To see if this promotion is available to you click here to visit the Reload Your Balance page . If you are eligible, you will see the banner below. \nFor qualifying transactions, a reward equal to 2% of your qualifying reload amount will be automatically applied to your Amazon Balance after the qualifying transaction has been completed. You must reload your Amazon Balance using the payment method that includes a checking account and linked debit card. The maximum single reload amount to your Amazon Balance may not exceed $2,000. \nI’m usually not targeted for these promotions and I saw it, so perhaps it is relatively popular. Note that this promotion isn’t all that valuable if you already purchase things on a 2% cash back credit card, or even better on a 5% back credit card with Amazon as a rotating category . However, if you avoid credit cards and usually buy things on a debit card, this is an easy way to get a little extra towards your Amazon shopping. Load your balance first via this promotion, get the 2% extra, and then go shopping. Share this:",

      "text": "What happens when a young man ignores a direct command from God to abandon his father? Author Larry B. Litton Jr. answers this question and many more in Vann Gellis – the Birth of a Pirate. The book is available at Amazon for immediate download for $9.99. The Birth of a Pirate is the first installment in the long awaited series, Vann Gellis, Pirate of the Gods.\nThe Pirate of the God series chronicles the epic journey of Vann Gellis, the Christian boy turned pirate.\n\"This is more than your traditional pirate story,\" Author Larry Litton says. \"This is a story about how key decisions Vann make's in the quest to save his father change him and shows him that a man really is the sum of his choices.\"\n17th Century Nassau is a haven for pirates. The local British government enables and even encourages piracy and profiteering. Samuel Gellis is one of the only pious men to be found on Nassau. He has been wrongfully imprisoned by the corrupt officer of the Admiralty Jonathon Anvil. Vann must find a way to raise the money necessary to free his father. But Vann has a special gift that his father believes was bestowed upon him by God.\nExcerpt\n“Stay on the Path of righteousness,” my father said to me. “He said I was to be the beacon of light for the world to see God through me, but I’ve become a pirate bastard.”\nVann does stray. He joins the crew of the Wicked Night, the most brutal pirate ship known in the Caribbean captained by Alain Masterson, the most savage pirate to have ever sailed. Vann uses his gift to discover that a massive Aztec treasure has been found by the Spanish navy. Vann kidnaps a hostage held by Masterson who knows where the treasure is being held and takes to sea in a longboat. He’s captured by another pirate ship captained by the beautiful Jean Valdemere. They quickly find something in common - their love for each other - and they go together to seek the treasure. But before they can get there, they happen upon Ezra the Holik, a seer from the Obedeah tribe who has been sent by God to stop Vann. But Vann is determined to save his father and not even God can dissuade him from his mission. But when he finds his father, he’s confronted with an epic decision that could impact the future of all mankind.\nLarry B. Litton Jr. is a former mortgage banker who has run a number of large companies owned by financial firms such as Goldman Sachs. Larry retired from the financial services industry in 2015 to focus on running a number of small businesses he owns as well as pursuing his career in writing. You can contact Larry at 713-805-8346 or via email at larryblittonjr(at)gmail(dot)com. You can also find Larry on Facebook as well as Twitter.",

      "text": "Electric Jukebox's £169 TV dongle for music is finally ready It'll go on sale at Amazon, Argos and Selfridges for £169 from midnight. Share Save \nRemember the Electric Jukebox , the two-part music gadget designed for non-Spotify types? If your answer is a resounding no, nobody would blame you; the company unveiled the product over a year ago and stayed almost silent, at least until today. With Christmas fast approaching, Electric Jukebox finally has some good news to share: the eponymous streaming device with its wand-like controller and one-year premium music subscription will officially go on sale for £169 from midnight today. \nBacked by Robbie Williams, Stephen Fry, Alesha Dixon and Sheryl Crow, the Electric Jukebox is designed around your TV. Seriously, it won't work on anything else. The streaming device plugs directly into the HDMI port, which can then be navigated using the wireless controller. The peripheral is home to a motion sensor and microphone -- allowing for gesture control and voice searches -- and there are four buttons on the front: at the top is a large OK, a back and pause in the middle and at the bottom button invokes voice commands. \n\"I'm not after the Spotify customer,\" says Rob Lewis, co-creator of the Electric Jukebox, told Engadget last year. \"I'm after everyone else.\" That suggests Electric Jukebox is after the older customer, who wants to listen to music but not trawl through endless lists of tracks or pull out their smartphone. Voice searches remove some of those headaches, as does the simplistic Neon Broadway UI that puts artist hubs and curated playlists at the forefront. Because it all happens on your TV, Electric Jukebox hopes that listening to music will become more collaborative, with friends and family gathering to sing along to any one of 29 million available tracks. \nThe Electric Jukebox comes with a one-year music subscription right out of the box, but when that runs out, the company needs a way to ensure owners remain invested in the platform. In a bid to keep music \"affordable and easy to access,\" its pricing additional music passes at £52 a year (£1 per week). That's less than the half the price of Spotify, Apple Music and Google Music. \nTo begin with, Selfridges, Argos, Amazon and \"a major TV network\" are on board to sell the Electric Jukebox when it goes on sale tomorrow. We'll have to wait until later this month to find out which network that is, but QVC would be a logical guess. We hope to put it through its paces in the coming weeks, just in case you need some real feedback before pulling the trigger.",

EST November 07, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nCLEVELAND, OH - It's hard to share this sale without sounding like a commercial for Amazon. Since this deal will be picked up all over the country today, however, we wanted to be the first to notify you of a birthday-related bargain. The Amazon Echo - Amazon's Alexa always-connected speaker, smart home command center and source of information is one of the most popular products in the country. Today \"Alexa\" turns two and to celebrate \"her\" second birthday, Amazon.com has cut prices by $40 bringing the reduction down to $140 - which is great considering Echo sold at $200 for a period of time. The Amazon Echo can play all of your favorite music, call you an Uber, answer all sorts of questions, control your lights, entertain your kids and perform as a virtual assistant without any monthly fees. This deal may not return Black Friday and could be the only time we see it this year. Was: $179.99 Now: $140.39 Looking for more huge Amazon deals and early Black Friday door busters?

      "text": "Close Jeremy Clarkson and Showrunners Brainstorm Name of Amazon Car Show Jeremy Clarkson has branded the decision to reveal the salaries of BBC stars paid over £150,000 “disgusting.”\nThe former Top Gear presenter , who left the BBC under a cloud of controversy in 2015 after hitting a producer, tells Newsweek that the government change to be introduced in the next royal charter is “just not British.”\n“You just do not do it. Nobody talks about their earnings,” Clarkson said while promoting his new Amazon car show, The Grand Tour . (Read our full interview here .)\nBritain’s Culture Secretary Karen Bradley confirmed plans to name on-screen personalities earning £150,000 or above in September , saying “license fee payers have a right to know where their money goes. By making the BBC more transparent it will help deliver savings that can then be invested in even more great programs.”\nThe change is expected to come into effect by next summer once the new royal charter, the agreement between the BBC and the government dictating its responsibilities as a publicly funded broadcaster, is rolled out in early 2017.\nThe former culture secretary John Whittingdale had previously set the threshold at £450,000, as agreed with the BBC earlier in 2016, but Bradley opted to lower that figure when she was appointed by new Prime Minister Theresa May in the wake of the EU referendum.\nThe lower threshold is in line with the BBC’s policy of revealing the salaries of executives who earn more than £150,000.\nThe changes will affect some of the BBC’s most popular entertainers including Graham Norton, Gary Lineker and several members of the cast of the popular soap EastEnders .\n“I don’t know why it’s so interesting what somebody earns. If you’re going to put someone in a management position running the BBC, Tony Hall,” Clarkson said, in reference to the BBC’s director general. “You would assume and hope he is capable of deciding who gets paid what and he doesn’t have to explain it to every Tom, Dick and Harry. Why do we need to know?”\nJeremy Clarkson tells Newsweek it's \"disgusting\" that BBC stars will have their salaries disclosed if they earn over £150,000. Amazon Prime Video Other changes to the way the BBC operates include dissolving the BBC Trust and appointing a new unitary board, as well as being regulated by media watchdog Ofcom. Critics say the increasing influence of the government on the BBC could be detrimental to its output.\nIn September, the corporation, which is trying to save £800 million a year by 2022, lost the rights to its hit program The Great British Bake Off after failing to match a competing offer from Channel 4.\nClarkson’s Grand Tour co-star James May told Newsweek there are “undoubted issues with the BBC’s remit and the way they are obliged to run themselves, and the way they choose to run themselves” but “as an institution, I’m still immensely fond of it.”\nMay, along with fellow former Top Gear star Richard Hammond, quit the show following Clarkson’s departure in 2015. In an interview with Newsweek , Clarkson criticized the BBC for being “rubbish at talent management.”\nBut May said, despite the issues they encountered during their time at the BBC, the broadcaster is essential to public life.\n“When I was growing up the BBC was my third parent, so it’s very important to the way I turned out. I’ve still done a few small things for them, there’s no animosity there,” said May. “As a principle, I think the BBC is an excellent brand and people shouldn’t interfere with it.”\nHammond, meanwhile, cautioned that the BBC needs to be more invested in helping programming grow as part of its public service remit, rather than chasing ratings. The corporation has previously been criticized by MPs for trying to compete with commercial rivals by airing big budget programs like The Voice .\n“I think anything that disadvantages the BBC is difficult,” said Hammond. “But, equally, the BBC, if it’s not careful, can put commercial operators at a disadvantage because it’s the only [broadcaster] that’s guaranteed funding. It should be prepared to get behind shows that don’t do well in the ratings and give them a push, because nobody else can. It’s the only place in the world that can say: ‘Let’s let something grow organically.’ [ Top Gear ] benefited from that.”\nThe Grand Tour launches on Amazon Prime Video on November 18. New episodes will stream every Friday .\n ",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nI’m the first to admit that not every TV show is for every person, and Amazon’s Mozart in the Jungle is one that may only appeal to a niche. But oh, what a lucky niche we are. The weird and wonderful series, now entering its third season, is a quick binge watch about a fictional New York orchestra. The series explores not only the lives the musicians — both establishment characters and newcomers — but also dueling maestros, and the very business of being in the fine arts; that is to say, the tenuous financing of it all, both for the musicians themselves and for the institution of the orchestra. \nIn its second season, the series (which also secured a somewhat out of the blue Golden Globe award last year) really opened up and played with its format, producing a set of episodes that felt like a French New Wave movie rather than a TV show. It also produced the exceptional episode “Touché, Maestro, Touché!” which was visually and thematically rich — something you don’t usually get from a comedy series. \nAnd Mozart in the Jungle is very funny, even if the jokes may not make sense if you’re watching this trailer without context. Still, you can get a sense of its madcap tone and light-hearted exploration of modern life through classic music. Check it out below: \nBut first let’s address the elephant in the room: what has Hailey ( Lola Kirke ) done to her hair?? There’s a lot of hair-related action in the trailer, and a lot of Gael Garcia Bernal , which isn’t surprising given his Golden Globe win. He’s fantastic in the series as the tortured maestro Rodrigo. But Mozart in the Jungle is really Hailey’s story, and we don’t get much of a sense of her here other than her new aspirations to conduct. There’s also a woeful lack of Saffron Burrows , although the few scenes of Bernadette Peters that we get almost makes up for it. \nMozart in the Jungle Season 3 drops in its entirety on December 9th. Here’s the official synopsis of the season below: \nSeason 3 of the Emmy and Golden Globe winning Mozart in the Jungle is about reinvention, as the orchestral family must find themselves as individuals before they can reunite renewed and stronger. With the symphony under lockout, Gael heads to Venice to find inspiration working with an operatic diva. Meanwhile Hailey unsuccessfully tours Europe and begins to question her career as an oboist.

      "text": "  04:00 AM EST Best Selling Play Food Set Is Available For Flash Sale on Amazon \nMommy Please announced that their top selling play food set is available for a flash sale. \nDuluth, GA, United States - November 8, 2016 /PressCable/ — \nCompany spokesperson Elsie Murphy stated, “ We understand that the holidays are fast approaching, and this time of year can be very expensive and cause financial difficulties on families. We want to do our part, and have decided to lower the price on our toy food set for a limited time, to make it more affordable for everyone.” \nThe Mommy Please 125-piece play food set is ranked the #1 best-selling plastic play food set on Amazon.com. The set is made of BPA-free plastic that is colorful, durable, free from any harmful chemicals, and safe for children ages 3 and over. The play food set contains a large variety of foods from all food group, including tomato, lettuce, lemon, waffles, crackers, peppers, potatoes, apples, bread, oranges, juice, watermelon, milk, mushrooms, hog dogs, cheese, pizza, hamburger, ice cream cone, strawberries, asparagus, pie, chicken, cucumber, bananas and more. Both healthy and non-healthy choices are included, to allow children to learn and explore different food items. Some of the food products contain labels with nutritional information, so children can begin to learn about healthy options for meal planning. \nOver 50 satisfied customers have written reviews on Amazon for the plastic play food set . One happy customer that is a verified purchaser wrote, “Over the past 20 years, I have purchased many sets of toy groceries. I am more than willing to pay for quality items that will last through multiple children playing with, biting on, stepping on, and then there are the pickers, that cannot help themselves but to pick at stickers, labels, etc. And because I have different ages of children in my private home childcare, I have 2 separate rooms set up with age appropriate items in each. When I received this set, I thought I would have to put all of it into the preschool room, because I assumed it would not be sturdy enough to withstand the toddlers. My assumptions came from previous purchases of large boxed sets of pretend food, and how quickly they had bite marks, dents, holes, and in general, were a waste of money. But after looking through all of the items, I realized that most of it would be appropriate for the toddler room, and the items that needed to be used in the preschool room would not be missed by the younger children. The preschoolers are more careful with, and understand how to play with cardboard replicas of milk containers, brownie and cake mix boxes and plastic cans of fruit with paper labels. And I honestly always do the nibble test on toy groceries before deciding which age level kitchen area they are appropriate for, and was really impressed with how many of the items in this set passed the nibble test with flying colors. There is a huge selection of food items, and the attention to detail is obvious. I definitely recommend this set to anyone with age appropriate children.” \nMommy Please is uncertain how long the flash sale will last, and customer are encouraged to order early to ensure that the play food set is in stock. The flash sale price is $19.97, and all Amazon orders with totals of $49 ship for free. \nAbout Mommy Please: “Mommy Please has worked tirelessly to bring children a play set that will never cease to keep their imaginations going. We strive to ensure that happiness, education, and creativity are all incorporated into play time every single day. As a company that focuses on family values, Mommy Please intends to influence the lives of families around the world.” \n  https://www.amazon.com/Pretend-Food-Toy-Play-Set/dp/B01COI9EAC \nContact Info:",

      "text": "\nMacy's Herald Square Clint Spaulding \nFor ad effectiveness as measured by the ABX Advertising Benchmark Index, Amazon Inc., Macy’s Inc. and Target Corp. were among the top performers for October. \nAccording to ABX in its report , major retailers ran 595 new ads in October, and many scored well with the research firm’s new Gender Equality Measure, “which means the advertisers are portraying girls and women in respectful ways,” the company noted, adding that the GEM impacts several of the other measures in the index such as “Reputation” and “Action.” The company added the GEM last month as part of the #SeeHer hashtag effort from the Alliance for Family Entertainment as well as the Association of National Advertisers. \nThe ABX Advertising Benchmark Index includes 14 variables, with a score of 100 being equal to “average effectiveness.” ABX said several major retailers delivered effective ads during the month that scored well over 100 while the same companies saw campaigns in other channels miss the mark. For October, some of the most effective ads were launched by retailers such as Macy’s, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Kohl’s Corp., Kroger, J.C. Penney, Best Buy and Toys ‘R’ Us, among others. ABX noted that some of the least effective ads across media channels were from CVS, Gap Inc., Best Buy, Walgreens and Fry’s Electronics. \nClick here to see a chart of the ABX October Ad Report . \nFor television, the number-one ad was Amazon Echo Dot “Just Ask” spot . It scored an overall ABX Index measure of 133. ABX researchers described the ad as a “fascinating spot with off-screen actors asking the Amazon Echo Dot questions that are humorous to the situation — such as losing jewelry down the garbage disposal, capturing a spider and wondering how many minutes are in 18 years in relation to a baby making a mess of spaghetti.” \n“This ad scores a strong +33 percent over norm in the overall ABX Index; a very high +103 percent in Reputation, and a great +53 percent in Action,” ABX said. “Within Action, all options for researching the product further scored extremely high, but Purchase was lower, at only 6 percent over norm.” \nThe researchers noted that for average TV scores for the month, Amazon didn’t fare well despite the strong performance of this ad. Overall, it placed 14th out of 18 major retailers measured. \nFor radio, Target delivered the most effective ad with the “Imagine hearing that your child has cancer…” spot. Its ABX Index score was 117 and had a whopping 201 “Reputation” score. In the ad, ABX said “a female voice asks listeners to imagine their child has cancer or Sickle Cell Disease and how terrible that would be. That’s why Target is teaming up with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Interestingly, Awareness and Message are only about average, but the association with St. Jude’s drove high Action subset scores in Intent to Contact, Research the Web, Recommend and Talk About it.” \nFor print ads, “Macy’s teaming up with Breast Cancer Research Foundation” campaign scored the best with an ABX Index reading of 116. “ This simple black-and-white ad shows how Macy’s is helping in the fight against cancer,” ABX said. “Of note is the new Gender Equality Measure, which evaluates how respectfully girls and women are presented in advertising. At +16 percent over norm, Macy’s has done a good job with this ad, showing a female with a healthy figure walking for the cause.” \nIn the digital realm, J.C. Penney’s “Biggest Sale of Them All” spot was number one. The ad’s ABX Index score was 129. ABX said for the month, J.C.Penney ranked third out of 19 digital retailers placing major campaigns. \nIn the free-standing insert category, Kohl’s “Columbus Day Door-Busters” was number one with an ABX Index of 122. ABX researchers said the retailer did a “good job of messaging,” which pushed other measures in the index up. “ Also helping those scores is the 109 Gender Equality Index, which means Kohl’s is doing better than average in portraying its female models with respect.” \nFor out-of-home ads, Best Buy was top with its “Prices Matched, Miles Saved” billboard ad. It had an ABX Index score of 110. ",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc. could be in the crosshairs of Europe’s taxman, and the stakes for the Seattle online retailer are high.\nAfter the European Commission ordered Ireland to claw back 13 billion euros (about $14 billion) from Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.44% in August, other multinationals such as Amazon AMZN, +3.96% and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, +1.60% face their own reckoning. Brussels is scrutinizing their European tax deals to determine if they constitute illegal “state aid,” benefits that could give them an unfair advantage over rivals.\nIt is still unclear when any of those decisions will materialize—or which company will be next. Any new clawback order likely would pale in comparison to Apple’s multibillion hit because few make nearly as much money as Apple.\nStill, Amazon stands out as potentially one of the larger targets that have been under investigation by the EU, based on an analysis of company filings in Luxembourg, home to its European business. The world’s largest online retailer paid an untaxed subsidiary €3.39 billion in royalties, largely from European operations, from 2006 to 2013, according to these filings.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nPopular on WSJ.com:\nEarly results in key states to hint at election outcome\nTesla Motors plans to charge for its quick-charge access\nTwo things to watch on election night (1:34) As voters decide whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will be the next president, WSJ's Gerald F. Seib discusses two things to watch on election night: the fate of Florida and whether we see a concession speech from the losing candidate.

      "title": "New Baby Rear View Mirror On Amazon Provides Parents With A Clear View of Their",
      "text": "  06:08 AM EST New Baby Rear View Mirror On Amazon Provides Parents With A Clear View of Their Aunt Mo’s has launched a new baby rear view mirror on Amazon that helps a parent keep an eye on their children while driving safely. \nEach day in the USA eight people are killed, and over one thousand people are injured due to distractive driving. One of the main reasons for distractive driving is the use of a mobile phone, another reason for so many accidents is a parent trying to see what their child is doing in the back seat of their vehicle. To reduce the number of accidents on the road, and allow a parent to see what their young child is doing, a new baby rear view mirror by Aunt Mo’s has been launched on Amazon. \nThe new baby rear view back seat car mirror launched by Aunt Mo’s has been hailed as one of the most important motoring accessories for parents of little ones. It allows a parent to keep an eye on their young child while in a rear-facing seat of the vehicle. Without installing the mirror, which is easy to install and is shatterproof, it means the parent does not have a clear view of their child without taking their eyes off the road. \nA spokesman for Aunt Mo’s said: “Our rear view mirror is not just an important device for the parent so they can keep an eye on their young child, but it also allows the parent to interact with the child safely.” For $24.99, it has been described as one of the most important accessories a parent will purchase for their vehicle, allowing them to see the baby and for the baby to see them. It features a double strap for easy mounting and can be adjusted to suit the drivers view with the 360-degree ability. The product is bigger and wider than other mirrors on the market and can be installed in one minute. It stays in place and can easily be adjusted when needed. Unlike many other mirrors available on the market, the Aunt Mo’s rear view back seat car mirror is perfectly stable, and to show their faith in the product it comes with a money back satisfaction guarantee. \nKey Features: \n• DRIVE WITH PEACE OF MIND: Keep an eye on your baby while on the go and never have to worry again. \n• ADJUST TO YOUR PREFERRED ANGLE: Featuring a convenient double strap for easy mounting and superior stability, you can easily set up your infant back seat mirror in just a few minutes. The mirror’s position is easily adjustable thanks to the 360 degrees, strong pivot ball joint so that you can set it to your preferred angle. \n• KEEP AN EYE OF YOUR CHILD IN THE CRIB: Multipurpose and convenient, this baby car back seat mirror can also be used in the crib or nursery and help you monitor your infant at all times. To learn more about the new baby rear view back mirror, which is made out of high quality material and to see why it has become one of the most recommended products for parents, please visit https://www.amazon.com/Aunt-Mos-Adjustable-Shatterproof-Accessories/dp/B01HXXATPC/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1478518083&sr=8-1&keywords=aunt+mo%27s \nAbout Aunt Mo’s \nAunt Mo’s provides quality products that help with lifestyle issues and provides a quality satisfaction guarantee. The baby rear view back seat car mirror has gained a great deal of attention with parents for providing them with an important vehicle safety tool.",

      "text": "The ambience of the tropical Amazon rainforest were the only things a group of researchers and soldiers were hearing besides the beeping of their location scanners. \n“Where's that temple again Jones?” asked the head researcher. \n“Hold on, the scanner says the place is that way--across another group of bushes.” the scientist answered. \n“Great. We should be getting close.” \nUnknown to them, they had been followed. A group of college student activists appeared and looked on at them. They also came to South America on an expedition trip, and by coincidence, had discovered the science team and their helicopter and decided to follow them. “I had a hunch in what they’re looking for.” said a student. “Who knows what could be in here!” He said with a grin. “Thirty years ago, this part of the rainforest was a major site for dinosaur fossils, maybe we can find more here.” He said and one of the group rolled his eyes. “Dinosaurs are nothing more than oversized iguanas with brains the size of peas.” One said in annoyance, obviously showing zero interest in being in the forest. He had only signed up for this for easy credits like any fool. “Actually no, dinosaurs are more related to birds than they are reptiles.” The eldest of the group who was the supervisor. “Some were believed to even have feathers with recent studies. And they were very intelligent animals as well. They worked together and traveled in groups and packs. From brontosaurus to triceratops and others. The Velociraptors for example were very cunning and often lead by a Matriarch who gave commands and orders to the rest when they hunted in how to isolate and make it so there was no escape route.” “Whatever.” “C’mon let’s go inside.” A female student said as they continued following. The college students went on looking around and soon came to a pathway and decided to go right, not knowing the other group had went left. \n**** \nThe scientists and the soldiers whom they served as bodyguards to the latter tread very deep into the rainforest. \n“We're getting closer….” \nThe scientists and soldiers had to travel a few more kilometers until they entered an opening through a group of trees. Within that opening was a huge, archway or gate. The structure was built ages ago by what it seems to be an unknown and lost civilization that never was recorded in every ancient history book. \n“This must be out destination. I'm getting a huge spike of energy emitting from this structure.” \n“It must be it! This must be the place! The Gateway to the Temple of Juga’nnath!” \n“Hold up Doctor! You need to be cautious…” \n“What's wrong Captain?” \n“I heard rumors that this pyramid used to be a… gateway to different universes or dimensions, something like that.” \n“Huh, I never saw that in the reports, Captain Kane. Keep us posted if you find anymore information about this archway.” \n**** \nThe researchers and soldiers had a correct hunch that this was build by a lost civilization, and judging from the hieroglyphics etched to the walls, they did not look earthly or familiar to any recorded ancient writing. The groups entered the large gate. A flash of light only occupied their sight until it died down and found themselves in another place. \nIt looked like another part of the jungle… BUT it wasn't. Everything was glowing and the sky was an unnatural black with no stars. In the middle of the jungle-like space was a large black pyramid, made of black rock, filled with the same unknown hieroglyphics. The soldiers went ahead of the researchers to check the place around and it looks no one hasn't been there recently for thousands of years potentially. \n“Captain! All clear. We can enter the vicinity.” \n“Good! I do hope we won't come across any boobytraps….” \n“That's the reality of every ancient pyramid sir.” \n**** \nAnd to everyone's surprise, there were zero boobytraps to be spotted. One could only think who were these people who built this mysterious pyramid that didn't bother to put boobytraps! But the answer to that question was becoming clearer as the teams were walking towards the middle of structure where a huge altar sat. Little did the researchers know that the soldiers were knowledgeable on what this pyramid used to be. \nCaptain Lane called out, “Doctors, I think it's time to tell you about this place. Would you kindly walk around and see what it is there that our researchers should know about?” \nThe researchers took more of the captain’s word and were astonished to find more ancient writing symbols, icons, and murals that showed a great battle and a giant race of creatures that really resembled kaiju , or giant monsters, particularly lizards. \n“My god! What is this place?” called out a researcher. \nThe others were still observing the altar until it glowed and the pyramid’s ground shook; a downward stairs appeared behind the altar! \n“Everyone! A row of stairs appeared, let's get down and see what's in there.” \n**** \nThe crowd descended down the stairs which almost took a while until they finally got to ground-level and entered to what seems to be a massive, spacious room. Disembodied torches lit several feet and with the little light they were able to see, the explorers realized that they were in some kind of indoor coliseum. And at the base of the seats were large cages that seemed to hold very large creatures that were used to fight against the gladiators. \nThe people looked on at the paintings before them on the stone walls. Showcasing several images that had been put on there. Two groups were shown, one looked like humans with supernatural powers, whilst the others looked surprisingly like dinosaurs. They were engaged in a terrible war; one section showed a dinosaur-like creature being victorious as a city was shown on fire having been destroyed in the battle. Another mural was shown and one of them was shown kneeling before a ghastly figure making a pact with it, swearing his allegiance to the being, it looked like. What the being was none of them knew as they looked on. Red Ore was shown on the images which seemed to be the source of its power it looked like. The third mural showed a female clad in metal fighting against the dinosaur creature in a titanic battle. The fourth showed the lizard creature being dragged into another dimension whilst the female looked on. The last showcased him, trapped there with spirits and souls flying around and tormenting him as punishment. But his face was shown plotting revenge over those responsible for his torment. “It is said that thousands of years ago, there was a creature called Kanosei, also known as Ju'gunnuth. He was a kaiju, some kind of giant lizard monster.” said Captain Lane. “Jones… I think it's time to tell you about this coliseum…” \n“What is this place?” \nThe captain continued, “This colosseum used to be where all the fights between the King of Kaiju and the gods battled at to keep them from conquering other realms, or dimensions. Kanosei was from Earth but he gained a huge army of his species to go to every reality. Kanosei had to make a deal with the God of Knowledge to in order to go through his conquest without fail. \n“Until a very powerful goddess with the alias Iron Empress defeated the kaiju ruler and his clan. Kenosha was banished from the Earth and he sealed here in this very arena. Long since this war, various warriors from different dimensions including our planet came here to fight and win something very big.” \n*** \nThe explorers walked deeper into the colosseum, studying its abundant hieroglyphics. Suddenly another altar showed risen from the ground again. This time, it showed a huge holographic projection that seemed to display the same events that was illustrated from the murals and including some aforementioned gladiatorial fights from the coliseum. \nThe information the researchers gathered was very big indeed. This arena had a history, but it was almost scary to find out that some creature and its kind had conquered the Earth, but it was eventually defeated and held prisoner for who knows how long! The scientists and soldiers slowly paced through the old prison cells, mostly came up empty. Some soldiers went ahead of them to check out anymore. \nSome of the troops found one particular cell that seemed to be the biggest and magnificent of all, its captive veiled in the dark behind its bars. Since the bars were tall and large, there was just enough spacing between them for a grown man to squeeze through. Seeing that the cell was clear, the others were signaled to joined them. As the men walked inside carefully, they heard a HUGE roar that startled them badly. \n“What the hell was that?!” a soldier cried. \nThey immediately turned the other way as huge trembles that resembled giant footsteps coming towards them! \n“Everyone! Get back!” called one of the troopers, motioning them to vacate the occupied cell. \nThe other soldiers and researches heard the loud bang and joined with the others. The college group did the right thing in running the opposite direction. \n“It cannot be…” The lead scientist of the archaeological team said looking on as they looked at the darkened figure who was getting rid of its bounds. There was no denying it, it bore the appearance of a large green lizard creature with huge claws and glistening green scales that would shine in the sunlight. “We found him! We found Ju’gunnuth!” They exclaimed smiles on their faces as at last they had found the legendary Kaiju had last. “After all this time, at last we have discovered him!” They claimed as they looked on. “We did it,” Another female scientist said. “After all this time we finally have found him. We must extract him from this place and take him to our lab.” \n“But… how in the world are we going to haul a creature this size?!” \nThe lead scientist said, “Why’d you think we brought the soldiers along?!” \nThe soldiers pulled up their weapons at the struggling creature was still freeing itself from the chains. \n“Hold on, Doctor! It's the king of the Kaiju! Don't fire those net guns just yet everyone!” Captain Lane ceased his men’s attack. He wanted to speak to the giant lizard who was finally waking up. \n“A human! Been such a long time since I stepped on any of you!” The kaiju laughed. \nThe captain stepped towards the creature, very carefully not prompt to kill him. “Kanosei! Ruler of the Kaiju! We have searched far and wide for you as we request that you share some of the knowledge you had attain over countless millennia.” \nThe place was silent. Kanosei had not spoke for a while before spatting, “I have no interest in dealing or “lending” anything useless to a group insignificant such you little pieces of meat. For I have greater goals to plan!” \nJu’gunnuth ripped off the last of the chains and with a flip of his giant tail, the soldiers were smacked out of his path. \n“You humans won't leave my coliseum alive!” \nThat was no empty threat…. Everyone blanched as they began running out of the stadium, hopelessly trying to outrun the miniature earthquake that was more than enough to get them very good. The kaiju ruler then ran towards the humans with his terrifyingly fast speed, holding his hands to scoop up the humans. The soldiers attacked feebly with their puny guns, those brave men were slaughtered by the might of the kaiju”s sharp claws. A few of the researchers were also caught in the avalanche of earth, but the rest of the soldier and the scientists had to move on.they ran up the stairs and returned back to the entrance wing of the pyramid. \nThe kaiju king decided not go to pursue the humans just yet. It’s been years since he moved around. He walked through the old coliseum as he picked up his personal trophies: a ray cannon, a giant two-handed sword, and giant razor claws. All of these weapons that once belonged to many great warriors from other worlds that fallen before him. \nIt was time to get out. \nKanosei ran across the coliseum so he could catch up to the humans; he busted through the stairway lead up to the altar room. The sheer mass of the creature running through the very ancient structure caused the place to almost collapse. \nAs the group was escaping through the pyramid complex, rocks from the ceiling dropped upon a few more soldiers and another researcher! All that was left was Captain, and Jone, along with the rest of the researcher crew. They ran all out safe and sound from now. \n*** \nCaptain Lane and the remaining research team finally headed out of the pyramid and ran straight for the artificial from whence they came from. The captain contacted HQ for the location of their ride. \n“HQ! Where is our transportation, we need immediate evac as soon as possible!” \n“Lane, our position has been compromised by civilians a few hours earlier. We are going to need to find a way to cover our tracks. Permanently.” \n“Okay. Can you at least arrive at our location because only a few of the research team and my troops made it out alive. There is a giant lizard coming after us. Get here soon, so I can blow up the portal!” \n“Roger.” \nCaptain Lane told the head scientists and the remaining few to go into the portal. “Leave, I’m gonna bomb this portal so the big lizard man won’t get out!” \n“Wait! With you in it?” said the lead scientist. \n“Look, I’m the only one who can detonate the thing. You and I should know that whatever that creature did ages ago is no good--you saw the look in his eye that he means business.” \n“Alright! Hope that dinosaur blows up!” \nThe scientists ran through the portal archway. Captain Lane picked up bag that carried a small TNT bomb that was more than a lot to blow up the archway portal that separated the pyramid realm and the human world. \nOn the human side of the pyramid portal, the helicopter came into view and contacted Lane for confirmation that they were present to pick up the researchers. The scientists exited the portal. That was the last time Lane saw them ever again. \nThe roar was getting louder from inside the pyramid, Kanosei was coming. The bomb was already detonated. Has been speed up into 20 seconds… the stomping from the lizard grew louder as he was approaching the entrance of the pyramid. The kaiju king saw the puny human looking near the exit portal and ran after him, staring at him with a creepy grin. \nAnd then…. \nEverything blew up. \nThe TNT bomb blew up Captain Lane and the portal between the human world and the portal dimension. The impact of the blast knocked the large lizard off his feet and hitting on the pyramid’s surface. He was unconscious. The pyramid cracked into ruins afterwards…. \n*** \nAfter two month of heavy news about what occurred in the Amazon Rainforest, everyone eventually stopped talking about it once the government and military personnel classified the information, including with Captain Lane's death and the compromise with the college student group. \nHowever, something very big was more important and urgent to talk about was that of a small army of giant lizard-like creatures risen from the oceans and began attacking the closest spots of human settlement they stepped through. \nThe army of lizards was lead by Kanosei, and he was paving the way for his people to conquer once more--starting with humanity.",

      "text": "Amazon might launch a Prime housekeeping service Job ads show the company is seeking 'Home Assistants' in Seattle. Save Getty Creative \nAfter years selling the products you need to keep your home tidy, Amazon may soon actually help you clean it. Two job postings, first spotted by The Seattle Times , show that the company is looking for \"Home Assistants,\" who work with customers to tidy people's homes, do laundry, put groceries away and \"assure that customers return to an errand-free home.\" \nThe ads originally stated (they were originally posted on October 13th) that Amazon's goal was to offer \"timesaving assistance to Amazon Prime members,\" suggesting that its new cleaning service would be offered as a Prime perk. However, the company has since updated its listings to remove any link to the subscription service. \nCurrently, the positions are open to people living in or around Seattle but it's worth noting that Amazon is looking for dedicated employees, not independent contractors who will feed into the \"gig economy.\" It will offer applicants on-site training as well as Amazon stock, health insurance and flexible working hours. \nWhile Amazon isn't commenting on its job listings, the fact that the company is only looking for a small number of staff suggests it's looking to trial the service to see if there's demand. Even if it does become one of Amazon's next Prime perks, it'll probably take some time for Bezos and co. to amass a housekeeping army capable of keeping America's (and possibly Europe's) homes clean.",

      "text": "TOP 5315188 \nI did not realize how cold it was going to be today. I suppose my first sign should have been the frost covering my front lawn. But I really discovered the frigidity when I got in line to vote before the sun had fully risen this morning. I know they say we’re in global warming and everything, but there was nothing warm about that queue. Everyone in line was talking about how cold it was, with the lady behind me even saying that she knew it was time to get out her winter coat but could not get herself to do it just yet. Tell yourself it’s not cold and it won’t be cold. Or something. \nAnyway, I’m not sure how Amazon coordinated with the weather, since they announced this deal at 3 a.m., but somehow on the coldest day of the year they announced a one-day-only deal on winter jackets . That’s what you call great timing. Perhaps that’s why Amazon is the most successful online retailer. So, today only, nearly 300 coats – men’s, women’s, boys’ and girls’– are “up to 70 percent off.” As usual, when Amazon says something is “ up to 70 percent off ,” that actually means several items are discounted even more than that. You surely want to check out all 292 options, but I’ve highlighted some of the bargains that caught my eye: Normally $200, this puffer jacket is 78 percent off (Photo via Amazon)",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase\nREUTERS/Rick Wilking\nChances are that if you've made a few purchases through Amazon before, you know the basic perks of becoming an Amazon Prime member: for $99 a year, you get free shipping, and early access to lightning deals and other Amazon discounts.\nWhile your thinking would be right on both counts, becoming an Amazon Prime member has many more lesser known advantages, and when all are considered together, that $99 price tag turns out to be a great value.\nBelow, we take you through all of the access that comes with a Prime membership, so you can see for yourself.\nThis article was originally published on 3/28/2016 and has been updated.\nView As: One Page Slides Free same-day shipping Amazon As mentioned above, one of the most well known perks of being a Prime member is that you get free two-day shipping on all purchases. What you may not know is that in some cities, you'll have access to free same-day delivery .\nOn April 6, 2016, Amazon rolled out free same-day delivery to 11 new metro areas (in bold below).\nSame-day delivery is currently available in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte , Chicago, Cincinnati , Dallas/Ft. Worth, Fresno , Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Louisville , Milwaukee , Nashville , New York City, North & Central New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Raleigh , Richmond , Sacramento , San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle/Tacoma, Stockton , Tampa Bay Area, Tucson , and Washington, D.C. , with more cities to be added to the list soon.\nAnd if you're not lucky enough to live in one of those cities, two-day delivery is still pretty good.\nPrime Now Amazon If same-day delivery isn't fast enough for you, and you live in one of the metro areas listed below, Prime members also have access to the Prime Now app , which provides free two-hour delivery on tens of thousands of items, and the option of one-hour delivery if you want to pay a flat fee of $7.99.\nWhether you're in need of gifts, groceries, or meal delivery, Prime Now can get your goods to your door faster than ever before.\nPrime Now is currently available in Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles & Orange County, Miami, Minneapolis & St. Paul, Nashville, New York City, Phoenix, Portland, Raleigh, Richmond, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle & Eastside, and Virginia Beach.\nPrime Video Amazon Prime Video is one of the fastest growing aspects of Amazon Prime. The streaming service is making a play to compete with the likes of Netflix and Hulu, and is doing a good job at it judging by the past two years of awards seasons. With Emmy-winning original series \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" on its roster, in addition to a large library of shows and movies, Prime Video is quickly becoming a must-have for anyone who has cut their cable cord.\nShowtime and Starz at a discount Amazon/Screenshot In addition to access to Prime Video, being a Prime member also gives you the opportunity to subscribe to some premium channels at a discount , including Starz and Showtime . With more and more networks switching to the \"a la carte\" method of subscription, it's likely that an even wider array of channels will soon be available.\nPrime Music Amazon/Screenshot For anyone not yet committed to Spotify or Tidal, or are simply tired of paying that monthly subscription cost, Prime Music provides a cheaper alternative. While their library is a bit smaller than the aforementioned services, it's still a sizable catalog that will contain most of what you are looking for. If you're not a diehard music fan and simply need a way to get tunes on your devices, Prime Music can help you save that monthly fee you're sending to Spotify every month.\nKindle Lending Library Amazon Amazon Prime also gives you access to the Kindle Lending Library , allowing you to rent one book for free every month. It's a great way to keep your reading list fresh without breaking the bank.\nPrime Reading Amazon One of the newest perks of being a Prime member is Prime Reading , which Amazon announced on October 5. While the Kindle Lending Library is great, if you don't have a Kindle you're sort of left out of the reading party. Prime Reading makes a wide selection of books, magazines, and short stories available to all Prime members without the use of a Kindle device. Instead, you can simply download the Kindle app to whichever tablet or phone you have and get right to reading.\nPrime Audible Channels Amazon Not only will your Prime membership give you plenty to read, with the new Audible Channels feature, it also will give you access to a ton of short-form storytelling and audiobooks through the Audible app. Whether you're looking for short fiction, news, comedy, conversations, or classic novels read by the likes of Scarlett Johansson and Elijah Wood, you're sure to find something here to fill your earbuds during your next commute .\nBig discounts on the latest video games Amazon Another great additional deal for Prime members is a 20% discount on all new video games for the first two weeks of their release, as well as any preorders you might make. If you're an avid gamer, you might make back the $99 Prime subscription with discounts here alone.\nPrime Pantry Amazon/Screenshot Prime Pantry will deliver groceries and household goods straight to your door, saving you from the struggle of a weekly trip to the store. Fill up your box online and pay a flat rate of $5.99 per box.\nUnlimited photo storage Amazon Yet another one of the lesser known features of a Prime membership: unlimited photo storage . If you like to take as many photos as your digital camera can allow and are a bit of a photography hoarder (don't worry, you're not alone), Prime will give you access to Amazon cloud storage , where you'll be able to upload photos from your phone or computer and be able to access them whenever you want.\nStart your 30-day free trial now, and find out if Prime is right for you.

      "text": "Bookstore News: November 8, 2016 By Judith Rosen | Nov 08, 2016 Amazon's campus pick-up program comes to New York; a Spanish-language bookstore arrives in Phoenix; an Oklahome indie preps for its opening; and more. Spanish-language Bookstore Opening in Phoenix : Palabras Librería will hold its grand opening November 12 in conjunction with the Grand Avenue Festival. Owner Rosie Magaña opened the bookstore with just five books last year after being inspired by the interactive art instillation “Librería Donceles” by Pablo Helguera at ASU’s Combine Studio. The installation showcased a library with more than 10,000 Spanish-language books. Now that the store’s shelves are stocked Magaña wants to celebrate. She has also set up two pop-up libraries in downtown Phoenix. Amazon Opens at Stony Brook : Earlier this month Stony Brook University became the first college campus in New York state to offer an Amazon pickup location. The location inside the Frank Melville Jr. Library is the 15th college to open a pickup location since Amazon began the program last year. Commonplace Books to Pop Up in Oklahoma City Next Month The group behind a new indie bookstore coming to the Midtown neighborhood in early 2017 will test their concept as a pop-up starting December 1. A recent Indiegogo campaign fell significantly short of a hoped for goal of $50,000 to create a community bookstore. Mitchell Kaplan’s Next Film on Dickens and Christmas : The owner of Books & Books in Coral Gables, Fla., is serving as executive producer with Paula Mazur, Andrew Karpen, and Vadim Jean on a new film based on Lee Standiford’s book The Man Who Invented Christmas , about how Charles Dickens came to write A Christmas Carol . Bleeker Street has acquired U.S. rights to the picture, starring Dan Stevens and Christopher Plummer, which will go into production next month for a planned 2017 release. Mountain Fold Books to Close : The Colorado Springs, Colo., bookstore, which featured small press books, zines, and comics, closed on November 4. In an announcement on Facebook , the bookstore cited the discontinuation of the Pikes Peak Community Foundation’s fiscal sponsorship program. The store will open one last time on November 12 to sell off its remaining stock and furniture. Unsold books will be donated to the Pikes Peak Literary District. Observatory Books Closes After 39 Years : After falling in January, 82-year-old Dee Logenbuagh was forced to close the store temporarily. Now she has decided to close it for good at the end of the month. The store will reopen for ten days starting November 16 for a going-out-of-business sale. ADVERTISEMENT",
