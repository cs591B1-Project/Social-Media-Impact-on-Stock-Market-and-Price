      "text": "Yes, These Sailor Moon Ford Commercials Are Real Megan Peters Tweet This \nIf you want to be a Sailor Scout, then you have got to ride in style. The group of intergalactic heroines is well-known for its planetary gifts and magical transformations. And, now, a car company wants you to know that Sailor Moon and her comrades have a thing for their vehicles. \nYes, this Sailor Moon commercial for the Ford Fusion is real - and it might make you want to lease out the stylish ride. \nFord uploaded the oddly dubbed trailer to Youtube recently, making Sailor Moon the latest franchise to get an overdub treatment. The company added the trailer to its extensive collection of clips known as ‘Ford Overdubs.’ These commercial spots take nostalgic shows and video games which fans love and poorly dub them over with sales pitches. \nFor Sailor Moon , Ford’s overdub finds the star-struck heroine gazing at constellations with her cat-slash-sidekick Luna. “There’s Sagittarius, Libra, [and] the constellation of the new Ford Fusion,” Usage gushes. “Oh, I just love it so much. The sculpted exterior, the newly redesigned grill and wheels. It’s the most stylish car I’ve ever seen.” \nLuckily, the Moon Princess is brought back to reality when Luna reminds Usagi that the Fusion has more to offer than just looks. “It has amazing driver assist features like pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection and adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go. They all make driving less stressful.” \nSadly, Sailor Moon is too young too drive, but the heroine can fantasize about her beloved dream car. For now, Usagi will have to rely on her moon crystal powers to teleport her around until she can test for a license. \nSailor Moon is not the first anime series to be given the overdub treatment by Ford. Last year, the car company surprised fans when they borrowed footage from Dragon Ball Z to make commercials. In one of the clips, fans watch as Krillin and Gohan use their Dragon Balls to summon the dragon Shenron and wish for three separate cars. The mystical creature tries to explain that the Ford Fusion meets the wishes and their requirements, but the Z-Fighters are unwilling to listen. The other commercial shows Trunks and Goten undergo a fusion dance - and then promptly turn into an all-wheel coupe. \nFord has used other surprising franchises for its overdub videos. One of the first series they took footage from was Captain Planet, and Ford also sourced clips from Metal Gear Solid . The adverts featured Solid Snake, Colonel Roy Campbell, and Psycho Mantis selling the high-points of Ford’s Fusion line-up. ",

      "text": "Tweet \nIt’s even available in schoolgirl uniform blue ! \nGetting older can be a little strange when your hobbies include things as unabashedly youth-oriented as anime . After years of feeling like the tone of the medium is in tune with your own psyche, one day you realize you’re twice the age of the main characters of the latest hits, and as the time demands of adult life pile up, it becomes harder and harder to watch every single episode of every new series. \nBut perhaps the most surreal moment is when your favorite anime characters aren’t just being used to sell you posters and plushies, but actual automobiles . \nAs part of its sporadic Overdubs series of Internet advertisements, Ford Motor Company is once again tapping into the nostalgia that lies in the hearts of 1990s-era otaku with a new video featuring Sailor Moon pining after the automaker’s Fusion compact sedan. \nAs the video opens, we see series lead Usagi (the video earns a little otaku cred by calling her by her original Japanese name, as opposed to Serena, Bunny, or one of her other localized monikers) staring up at the night sky with feline mentor Luna . Together, they spot the constellations Sagittarius, Libra, and…Ford Fusion…? ▼ Huh. Don’t remember seeing that one at the planetarium. \nCharmed by its looks, Usagi gushes “It’s the most stylish car I’ve ever seen.” Relatively handsome though it may be, that seems like a bit of an exaggeration, but then again, restraint was never Usagi’s strong suit. The cooler-headed Luna points out that the car also has some hi-tech safety features, such as pre-collision assist and pedestrian detection, before Usagi adds “A Lightning Blue one would match my uniform perfectly.” ▼ She’s got a point, although I can understand why Ford, to appeal to the widest market possible, went with the name “Lightning Blue” instead of “Japanese Schoolgirl Navy.” \nOf course, as Luna points out, junior high student Usagi is to young to get a license just yet. She’ll be old enough in a couple of years, though, and when she finally does find herself behind the wheel, hopefully she’ll have the maturity to resist the urge to race Dragon Ball’s Krillin and Gohan when they rev up on her in a Ford of their own. \nImages: YouTube/Ford Motor Company, Ford Motor Company \nFollow Casey on Twitter , where he still thinks the RX-7’s “Innocent Blue Mica” was a pretty awesome name for a paint color.

      "text": "model name / number: F150 QR Code Link to This Post Selling my fathers 2000 Ford F150 XLT triton v8 4x4 pickup for him. It has been used a lot, but very reliable! It is a 4x4 with 2 rows seating (can seat 6). It runs good and it has power seats, air condition and heaters work great, power windows, cd player/radio works great, shows external temperature, the front seats do move up so people can get in the back seat (the back doors do not open any longer from rust). Spare tire in the back, heaters work good, fluids maintained in engine. Extra cup holders and slots throughout truck. The drivers front seats material is worn, and there is a oil smell inside because he is a mechanic. The odometer no longer works, and it is just at 220,000 miles (I did contact the DMV and they stated that you can still transfer the title even without the mileage if it is over 10 years old). Bottom hinge on tailgate is broken so just extra support with bungee, and dents in box of truck. He bought the truck in great condition but it did come with a \"prior salvaged\" title when he purchased it many years ago.

      "text": "Newsletter Signup Why Joey Logano Needs To Make NASCAR's Final Four Ford does not want to be embarassed again by having no Ford in the chase on Ford Championship Weekend. NASCAR Nascar Media \nFord, no question, is a major backer of the NASCAR Sprint Cup series, but the company isn’t quite as visible as the monster-sized Chevrolet and Toyota. The company saves a lot of its promotions money until the end of the season, sponsoring the finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway for years now. \nNext weekend, all the races will be titled “EcoBoost” events, plugging Ford’s method of using turbochargers to get big-engine performance out of smaller engines. Which it doesn’t in NASCAR, of course, because everybody has to run the same pushrod V-8 configuration. \nHere’s the problem: After Joey Logano was wrecked by former Ford driver Matt Kenseth, Ford’s only hope of actually having a Ford in the Ford Championship Weekend Sprint Cup race evaporated. It left Kevin Harvick, Jeff Gordon, Kyle Busch and Martin Truex, Jr. to fight it out. And those guys are in Chevys and Toyotas. \nAnd this year, again it’s up to Logano to try to squeeze his Penske Ford Fusion into the final four at Phoenix today, joining the already-qualified Jimmie Johnson (Chevrolet) and Carl Edwards (Toyota).",

I have a 1984 Ford Mustang LX Convertible with a 5.0 (302) engine that runs great but needs the new convertible top I bought installed properly... In the meantime I have this good running dependable Ford Ranger, that is a basic model but works great.. I am getting ready to move to the Denver area, and I need moving money!!! So here I am trying to sell my truck, to fix the mustang, or sell the mustang that will be listed also under 1984 Ford Mustang convertible... Or Hell I have no idea what I am doing, but push is coming to shove!! Make me an offer on this Manual 5speed ranger, and I just might take it! No trades, or buying on payments!

      "text": "type: truck QR Code Link to This Post 1999 F350 7.3 turbo diesel with banks Turbo System. Crew cab, Automatic, long bed, with Bed Extender and gooseneck hitch. Has airbag suspension and towing package. New batteries, new glow plugs, new fuel injectors, new valve cover harnesses (injector and glow plug), new glow plug relays, new fuel pump, new starter, new fuel injection pump.. and more. I sunk a lot of money and sweat into the truck in 6 months. Slung cylinder 2 pushrod and busted my #2 cylinder wall. Already bought another pushrod and put back in it. Engine is not locked up and was shut off immediately. Will turn over just fine. I went and bought another truck cause I can't afford to keep up with a diesel. Interior is in great condition, scorpion spray in bed liner. Valve cover, air intake and 1 turbo vent is taken off in picture. All are here and I will be putting back on. No rust no dents no cracks. Just needs a bath. Aftermarket hood is metal (not fiberglass) I've found 3 complete engines locally for $700 to $500. If you know anything about the trucks and the condition mine is in, you know the price is worth it I've sunk every last dime into rebuilding. All the terrible 2's parts are brand new and replaced (no refurbs). I have all paprework for parts and warranties (all lifetime). I hate to let her go, but my pockets only run so deep. I'm not a mechanic by trade so labor tends to add up quick. Any questions feel free to call. 850)377-779three.. Francis. do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5865752960",
