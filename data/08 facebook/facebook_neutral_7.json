      "text": "Secrets Of Online Shopping Discrimination November 14, 2016 11:25 PM \nFollow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) – Most people think you can usually find a better deal when you shop online. \nBut the price you see can be different than what other people see. The type of computer you use, your online search history, even your zip code have all been used by online retailers to determine what price you pay. \nIn a study conducted by researchers at Northeastern University in Boston, nine out of 16 online retailers and travel websites tested showed different prices or difference results for the same searches. \n“I always assumed all the prices would always be the same,” said Liz Owens. \nOwens, a busy mother of two, does a lot of her shopping online and was initially skeptical when she was told the prices she sees are not always what everyone else sees until she participated in a test. \nOwens, along with six other people, were provided a list of items and had to look them up on the same websites and at the same time. \nFor most of the items, everyone’s search resulted in the same price. However, it didn’t happen every time. \nWhen Owens looked up a night’s stay at the Caribe Royale Hotel in Orlando on Travelocity on her laptop, she was shown a price of $132 per night. The same search on Travelocity at the same time on a mobile phone came up with a price of $119. \nA spokesperson for the travel website said it sometime does offer lower prices for people who use smartphones. \nA similar finding was discovered when participants searched Rosetta Stone’s online language software. \nThose in the group who searched on a desktop computer were shown a price of $249 for Levels 1-5 of Mandarin Chinese. Those who used a mobile device were offered the same products for $189 – a $60 difference. \n“I think that is shocking,” Owens said when seeing the price difference. “We did the search at the exact same time and I got a much higher price.” \nHowever, it wasn’t always a case of desktop versus mobile. Sometimes it was where a participant was logged on from that made a difference in price. \nWhen Owens priced a GE 7-foot Christmas tree on HomeDepot.com with free home delivery anywhere in the U.S., her price was $399. When the same item was priced on the site from Boston and Minneapolis the price shown was $438. \nHome Depot said sometimes it does offer different online customers different prices based on the region where they log-on from. The company said it can figure out one’s location from a computer’s IP address. \nResearchers found 9 of 16 online retailers use “price steering” or “price discrimination” \n“You as a consumer are just looking at a website and really have no idea why it’s showing you what it’s showing you,” said Christo Wilson, who along with his team of researchers at Northeastern University collected online shopping search results from more than 300 people. \nBased on their findings, Wilson said they found cases of “price discrimination” and “price steering” \nPrice steering is when two users receive different product results or the same products in different order for the same search. \nPrice discrimination occurs when two users receive different prices for the same search results. \nWilson tested 16 online retailers and travel sites and found on nine of those sites customers saw different results and or prices \nWhen you log onto a website, companies can see your search history, your clicks, the type of computer and browser you use, and even determine your location. All of this, according to Wilson, can be used to personalize prices online. \nWilson said price discrimination is becoming more prevalent and sophisticated, although; he added it can be very difficult for online shoppers to detect. \n“This is a real challenge for us and for consumers because companies are always experimenting with different strategies and algorithms,” he explained. \nWhat can you do to figure out if the price you see is the lowest price? \nThere’s no perfect solution, but here’s a start. \nWhen looking for the best deal look it up on your desktop and using your mobile phone. If you think shopping in “private” or “incognito” mode is going to hide your information from online retailers, it doesn’t. \nComputer security expert says to hide your identity when shopping online use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). You can download some VPN services for free. Better ones will cost around $20-30 a year.",

It seems pretty cool, doesn't it? I may want new work, now that I'm about to hang up my law-professor spurs. I can just see myself, gunsmithing at the Shop Fox, then going out carousing in my hot dress. There's a little arrow in the upper right corner of the ad, so I click that and get... I am so tempted to click \"I already own this.\" Then what ads would I get? Or would the government start spying on me? And spare me the comment \"Start?! Althouse you are so naive.\" Here 's the link to John's post about spellchecking \"commenter.\" Don't hesitate to make a comment, er .... If my post made you wonder why I wrote \"Parents are so terrible!\" — feel free to speculate in the comments, but you will never guess. If my post made you wonder about the origin of the phrase \"hang up your spurs,\" read this , at Grammarphobia. Today, to “hang up one’s spurs” (or the tools of one’s trade) means to retire from the field, to give up, or to turn one’s attentions elsewhere. This... is a tradition dating back to classical times. The Roman poet Horace, who lived in the first century BC, refers to this tradition... [w]ith the lines nunc arma defunctumque bello / barbiton hic paries habebit , the narrator decides to retire metaphorically from the field of battle and hang up his weapon—the lyre with which he does his wooing. ADDED: Meade says \"'the lyre with which he does his wooing' should be a picture of me from the New York Times on the front porch with my laptop.\" He means the picture of him here .

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nNEW YORK (CBSMiami/AP) — Ride-sharing service Lyft, rival to Uber, is getting rid of its pink mustache logo and replacing it with light beacons meant to be more useful for users.\nRide-hailing service Lyft, the underdog rival to Uber, is getting rid of its iconic pink moustache logo and replacing it with something more useful — beacons.\nThe light-up beacons, which Lyft calls “amps,” will be on the dashboard of Lyft drivers’ cars beginning Jan. 1 in New York, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\nBeacons can communicate with people’s smartphones using Bluetooth technology. In retail stores, this means guiding you to a certain shoe display, for example.\nWith Lyft, it means having your driver’s beacon light up a specific color once he or she is near. You can have your phone light up in that same color, too, then hold it up so the driver can see you.\nLyft says this will make it easier and safer for drivers and riders to find each other. This can be especially helpful at night, or in crowded areas where multiple people might be hailing a ride.\nSan Francisco-based says it won’t use the beacons for ads, though the passenger-facing side might be devoted to sponsored campaigns, such as a beer company warning against drinking and driving.\nLyft’s first symbol was a giant, bright pink, fuzzy moustache attached to the front of drivers’ cars. But it soon became cumbersome (it could get quite dirty, for example), and maybe a little too whimsical for a company working to expand. Next came the “glowstache,” a compact, pink, glowing plastic moustache. The amp, while still bright pink, is a clean, oval shape.\nLyft held a retirement party for the ‘stache, said Melissa Waters, vice president of marketing. But the pink stays.\n“It’s loud, proud, quirky, fun,” she said. In upcoming TV ads, Lyft paints itself as just that, in deep contrast to a menacing, slick ride-hailing company called “Ride Corp.”\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

      "text": "Illegal wildlife property. Image: USFWS Mountain-Prairie Facebook Is a Black Market For Vietnam’s Wildlife Traffickers   01:51 PM CET Copy This URL \nInvestigators with the Wildlife Justice Commission (WJC)—a global organization of environmental crime experts—have been infiltrating smuggling groups in the Vietnamese town of Nhi Khe for more than 12 months. Their probes revealed that US $53.1 million in rhino horn, ivory, tiger parts, and trafficked species, such as pangolin, were attributed to 51 dealers in Nhi Khe last year. \nThis week, an international forum in The Hague, Netherlands concluded that Vietnam’s government could do more to crack down on its illegal wildlife trade. At a public hearing , originally called for by WJC, a panel delivered recommendations to Vietnamese authorities, with an emphasis on detecting smuggling rampant on social media like Facebook. \nThe organization discovered that private Facebook groups, where members must be invited by the group’s owner, are being used as de facto black marketplaces to deal and solicit trafficked animal parts. In a report by The Guardian , who previewed the investigation’s findings, Facebook is used mainly to sell ivory wares and products. Once approved by a group’s administrator, clientele across southeast Asia are able to keep in touch with dealers via instant messaging. Money exchanges are usually handled through WeChat Wallet, the Chinese messaging platform’s payment functionality. Customs officials seize ivory tusks, rhino horns, and leopard skins in Hong Kong, China. Image: International Fund for Animal Welfare \nWhen contacted by Motherboard, a spokesperson for Facebook said the company “does not allow the sale and trade of endangered animals and we will not hesitate to remove any content that violates our Community Standards when it is reported to us.” \nAs per the company’s Community Standards , criminal activity that causes the physical harm of animals, including the coordination of wildlife trafficking, is prohibited on its platform. \nFacebook also claims to have worked with NGOs and authorities—the exact scope of which is unknown—to receive tips about wildlife trafficking by its users. The company maintains the right to delete accounts and posts if abuse is detected, but Facebook’s approach to alleged instances of smuggling are dealt with on a case-by-case basis. \nOver the last few years, social media and ecommerce sites have seen an uptick in wildlife trading activity, both legal and illegal. In May, officials discovered that illegal plant species were being sold across country borders on eBay and Amazon. And recently, the international wildlife treaty CITES ruled that authorities must seek out the trade of pet cheetahs on Instagram and Facebook. \nHowever, despite the evidence WJC provided to the Vietnamese government regarding Nhi Khe crime groups, little has been done to shut down the network. \nIISDRS November 15, 2016 \n“We have provided the Vietnamese authorities a detailed case file with everything necessary to prosecute these criminals and close down their operations. We have offered assistance and worked with stakeholders to encourage the Vietnamese authorities to act, but so far to no avail,” Olivia Swaak-Goldman, WJC executive director, said in a statement . \nAccording to WJC, the 579 rhinos traded through the criminal network represent nearly 50 percent of all South African rhinos killed in 2015. \nIn their recommendations, the international panel pushed for better protection of whistleblowers; more criminal proceedings in addition to administrative sanctions; probes into tax law violation by alleged dealers; and the establishment of task forces to detect wildlife crime on social media. \nA spokesperson for WJC wrote in a tweet today that it’s “not the end of the process, we will continue to work to achieve action.” Topics: wildlife trafficking , facebook , wildlife crime , Wildlife Justice Commission , The Hague , Social Media , black markets , WeChat , vietnam , Nhi Khe , ivory , tiger parts , pangolin Contact the author by or Twitter  ",

Must-Reads from Magazine Twitter Print A \nEven as Republicans were racking up electoral victories, Democrats had convinced themselves that the GOP was too extreme to win elections. The scale of the Democratic Party’s decimation under Barack Obama occurred right under their noses, but Democrats did not appreciate the full scope of the debacle until Hillary Clinton lost. Only then did it become clear that Barack Obama’s legacy was built on a foundation of sand. There is, however, a troubling lesson here for conservatives. The GOP didn’t need to moderate to retake total control of the federal government. Neither do Democrats. \nThe Democratic Party appears set to respond to Hillary Clinton’s surprisingly deep loss to Donald Trump by casting off what many believed was her pallid, status quo liberalism for something more vibrant. That vibrancy has largely been provided by the party’s progressive wing. What’s more, this wing has a legitimate claim to primacy within the party. Self-described socialist Bernie Sanders won as much support in the Democratic primaries as did Donald Trump in the Republican presidential nominating contests. Furthermore, as the WikiLeaks releases revealed, the Democrats’ progressive insurgents can contend with merit that the party’s brass put their thumb on the scale for a losing candidate. Clinton’s faction had their shot, and now it’s time to get out of the way. \nThis leftward drift is evident in the Democratic Party’s decision to coalesce around one of its most radical elected members as the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee: Representative Keith Ellison . Dare suggest that someone who flirted with 9/11 trutherism, once devoted himself to the Nation of Islam under Louis Farrakhan, and opposed funding Israel’s anti-missile defense system on the grounds that saving Israeli citizens from Hamas rockets was an obstacle to peace talks, and you’ll get an earful. Even as they bemoan the “normalization” of xenophobia by President-elect Donald Trump, Democrats are committing themselves to a similar project: rehabilitating and regularizing their fringe. \nLike Democrats did not so long ago, Republicans might comfort themselves in the notion that the other party has veered too far toward the political extremes to appeal to a majority of the American voting public. Surely, the fact that Republicans let themselves come to this same erroneous conclusion before Barack Obama’s two victories will be no obstacle to reaching it again. The GOP was similarly overjoyed when the DNC chose former Vermont Governor Howard Dean to lead the party prior to the 2006 midterm elections. On each occasion, the GOP’s hubris was soon exposed by events. \nAfter two consecutive midterm-election wipeouts and, now, an unexpectedly strong election for Republicans in a presidential year, the landscape has been sterilized of moderate Democrats. Indeed, the model of a radical Democrat from a progressive perspective is cast in the mold of Jim Webb. The Democratic Party of today is urban, coastal, and ideologically homogenous—which is to say, a minority party. That is both a challenge and an opportunity. \nTaking stock of the scope of their losses in early 2009, the Republican Party pursued a course similar to the one Democrats are contemplating. Desperate for anything resembling renewed enthusiasm for the conservative cause, the GOP found it in the vigorous and organic Tea Party. This was a multifarious movement that was mocked and lampooned by the cultural left right up until the moment it took command of most of the levers of government. The Republican Party under Donald Trump may shed much of its affinity for green-eyeshade conservatism, but it has retained the Tea Party’s desire to see cultural revanchism. \nUnless the laws of American politics have been repealed entirely, the pendulum will swing back in Democrats’ direction soon enough. Whether it is attributable to Ellison’s likely leadership of the DNC or not, the transformed Democratic Party that emerges ascendant will be radically more progressive than even today’s Democrats. And that progressive party will have the authority of a public mandate. \nRepublicans didn’t have to moderate or become the Democratic Party-lite to win back power (although a case could be made that they did have to endorse Democratic policy prescriptions to win the White House). So, too, will Democrats eventually regain their power and they will do so without becoming a more conservative party. And when they do, Republicans will rue the day they celebrated the ascension of the radical left. \nJoin us—you'll be in good company. Everyone worth reading is reading (and writing for) COMMENTARY: “ There’s an enormous amount of shouting in the wild west of conservative media. That has its place, and is often a sign of the energy on the right. But amidst the cacophony there’s a special need for serious, considered, and compelling argument, presented in the hope of persuading, not just punishing. This is where COMMENTARY has always shined, perhaps more now than ever before. It aims to tackle the best arguments of its intellectual opponents, not just the easiest targets. It’s a journal I’ve read for nearly 30 years and I can’t think of a time when I’ve valued it more. „ Jonah Goldberg “ There is more commentary in the world than ever before—whether in print, on the air, or on the Internet. But there is still a dearth of serious, informed commentary that reports, analyzes, and argues without ever stooping to name-calling or vitriol. If you further narrow down the segment of the commentariat that looks at the world from a conservative and Jewish perspective—well, you’re left with only one choice. The magazine you are now reading. COMMENTARY has changed over the years—for instance, it now publishes this blog—but one thing that has not changed is its steadfast commitment to providing the best analysis from the most informed writers of the most important ideas in the world, all written in clear prose that appeals to a general audience. There is nothing else like it. Never has been, never will be. „ Max Boot “ Every month in print, and every day online, COMMENTARY somehow manages to pull off a dazzling balancing act: intellectual but unpretentious, serious but never boring, timely but not fleeting. On the leading questions of the day, it offers fresh and unfamiliar insights. And on the emerging questions that will dominate the years to come, it often sees things first and clearest. It is simply indispensable. „ Yuval Levin “ In 1975 the Economist said of COMMENTARY: “The world's best magazine?” Take away the question mark and that statement still stands, thirty-eight years later. It's still the magazine America's liberals dread most, and the one America's enemies can't afford to ignore. It's the point of the conservative spear in the never-ending fight against the insanity of the left, whether it's in foreign policy or economic policy, social and cultural issues, or the arts—and no one does a better job standing up for Western culture and America's interests and those of its allies, including Israel. In fact, surviving the next three years—the Obama administration home stretch—and building the foundations for an American resurgence afterward will be impossible without reading COMMENTARY in print and online. „ Arthur Herman “ For decades, COMMENTARY has opened its pages to the most serious uncompromising defense of the American creed—exemplar of ordered liberty at home, pillar of the free world abroad—in an era when it has been most under attack. From the exceptionally influential manifestoes of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick to today's counterattack against the empowered advocates of the entitlement state and of American decline, COMMENTARY remains what it has been for more than a generation: fearless, informative, indispensable. „ Charles Krauthammer “ COMMENTARY isn’t just an important magazine. It’s an indispensable one. It’s been indispensable for half a century, and it is today. It’s indispensable for understanding the moment we live in, and it’s indispensable for laying out a path forward. The challenges we confront are great, but COMMENTARY is used to facing grave challenges without fearful cowering or wishful thinking. So we need COMMENTARY today as much as we ever have, and we need it to be as strong as it’s ever been. „ William Kristol “ COMMENTARY’s writing is predictably engaging and edgy, but its content is anything but homogeneous. Center-right perspectives characterize contributions, but not predictably so. Jewish affairs are thematic, but not always. Controversies of the day are the usual subjects, yet offered only with reflection well apart from the frenzied 24/7 news cycle. Intellectual honesty and analytical rigor characterize COMMENTARY and that is why even its political critics concede that they are still enlightened by the very arguments they often oppose. „ Victor Davis Hanson “ COMMENTARY is an indispensable read on the Arab Spring, the Afghan war, the future of American conservatism, and all the other crazy stuff out there. But you already knew that. What I really love about it is that it’s a full-service operation, and its back-of-the-book guys—the fellows who write about music, literature, and all the things that make life worth living as the world goes to hell—are the best in the business. There is an observation in a Terry Teachout piece on the wonderful singer Nancy LaMott about “Moon River” that has stayed with me for almost two decades. I fished it out from the back of my mind to impress a gal at a Goldwater Institute reception only the other day, and it worked a treat. So thank you, COMMENTARY! Likewise, my differences with the arts’n’culture crew unsettle me far more than the geopolitical ones: reasonable people can disagree on how large a nuclear arsenal those wacky mullahs should be permitted to own, but I’m still agog at the great Andrew Ferguson’s mystifying praise for the New York Times obituaries page a couple of issues back. That’s COMMENTARY for you—provocative to the end, on matters large and small. In these turbulent and dismaying times, we can all use a huckleberry friend waiting round the bend, in the mailbox each month and on the computer screen every morning. For any journal of opinion, as “Moon River” teaches us, there’s such a lot of world to see. COMMENTARY sees most of it with piercing clarity: it can’t know all the answers, but it asks all the right questions, and with great farsightedness. It deserves your wholehearted support. „ Mark Steyn “ COMMENTARY has played an invaluable role in American political discourse for decades, offering thoughtful analysis on issues rather than sound bites or bumper stickers. Especially when it comes to U.S. foreign and defense policy, COMMENTARY has time and time again been ahead of the crowd, anticipating trends and developments that others react to only after the fact. I can't imagine not being a COMMENTARY subscriber. „ John Bolton “ In the midst of today’s political rancor, COMMENTARY Magazine provides a rare venue for thoughtful discussion. COMMENTARY’s talented writers provide insightful analysis of foreign affairs, domestic policy, and the politics of the day. COMMENTARY is a treasure not only for conservatives, but for anyone looking for in-depth exploration of the issues that influence America’s public dialogue and shape the nation’s future. „ Karl Rove “ It's notorious, and true, that government officials hardly read anything. Memos, sure; nowadays, emails and tweets as well. But magazines? People barely have time to eat lunch or see their kids, so how can an intellectual monthly affect public affairs? The question is a good one. How did COMMENTARY do it? The answer is that officials, like all citizens following American foreign policy, need a way to understand the world around them. When prevailing theories fail, when conventional wisdom is clearly at variance with what they see before their eyes, the outcome for senators and congressmen and White House officials is what the shrinks call cognitive dissonance. They may say one thing but believe another, or simply be unable to square previous beliefs and policies with the clear effects of U.S. conduct. They've lost the ability to explain the world. And then came COMMENTARY, offering month after month of piercing, bracing analysis—and value judgments of right and wrong, and clear writing about American gains and losses. Here was an insistence on looking reality in the face. Here was plain argument, seeking no quarter intellectually and giving none. And it mattered. It shamed some people, and emboldened others; COMMENTARY demanded that we conform policy to the opportunities and dangers that really faced America. In years of confusion and obfuscation, that striking clarity changed policies, and changed American conduct, because it changed the way we understood the world. „ Elliott Abrams “ For more than 60 years, COMMENTARY has been a go-to source on matters of the greatest importance to our nation and our civilization. Today, its full-throated defense of the United States and freedom is as eloquent as it was a half-century ago, and no less urgent. Issues of the day will change, news cycles come and go, but COMMENTARY remains an indispensable authority in the battle of ideas that help to shape our world. Its continued success is both an indication, and source, of the country’s intellectual health. „ Donald Rumsfeld “ COMMENTARY is America's most important monthly journal of ideas, period. For nearly seven decades it has published the best and most exciting writing from the most important thinkers: Saul Bellow and Lionel Trilling; Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick; Paul Johnson and Ruth Wisse; Cynthia Ozick and—of course—Norman Podhoretz and Midge Decter. Is there anything remotely like it? No. It is the lamp by which America, and Israel, and the Jewish people, may find their way to safety. I'm proud to be published in its pages. „ Bret Stephens “ Irving Kristol once called COMMENTARY the most influential magazine in Jewish history. Certainly, no publication had a greater influence on me as I evolved from adolescent reader (arguing over its articles with my father and older brother) into a “frequent contributor” who made it my intellectual home. The magazine did not exploit American freedom to escape from civilizing duty but rather activated the intertwined responsibilities of citizens and members of a group. American Jewry can boast of many contributions to the welfare of this country and the Jewish people, but few as fortifying as COMMENTARY. „ Ruth R. Wisse “ Edward Shils noted that there are four means of education in the modern world: the classroom, bookstores (especially used-bookstores), the conversation of intelligent friends, and intellectual magazines. For me intellectual magazines were more important than any of the other three, and no magazine among them more so than COMMENTARY. I first happened on COMMENTARY as a student browsing in the University of Chicago Bookstore in 1957. I have not missed an issue since. The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. „ Joseph Epstein “ Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. „ Matthew Continetti “ COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. „ David Brooks “ Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment—whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard—has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. „ Heather Mac Donald “ I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P’s: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my “idealistic” ’60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life’s ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation’s history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn’t alone. „ Michael Medved “ Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. „ Andrew Roberts “ In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. „ David Frum “ COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there’s anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America’s place in the world and what it should be. I’m a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. „ Dana Perino \nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast—the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945. \nJoin the intellectual club, today. Twitter Print A \nIf you want to understand why no rational person should take the United Nations seriously, consider the following three facts: Last week, the World Health Organization, a UN agency, named Israel the first country in the world to be awarded its highest ranking for medical emergency response teams deployed overseas. In other words, the organization deemed the Israel Defense Forces its first responder of choice for any disaster worldwide. Two weeks ago, the daily Israel Hayom reported that the UN’s peacekeeping service asked Israel to train its peacekeepers in emergency field medicine; the seminar is expected to take place in the coming weeks. And every year, this same UN labels Israel the world’s worst violator of health rights, the only country deserving of a country-specific condemnation. \nSo if you take all three of those decisions seriously, you’re forced to conclude that the UN thinks the world’s worst violator of health rights is the ideal choice to be first on the scene in any medical disaster worldwide and also to train the UN’s own peacekeepers. The UN, by an overwhelming majority, regularly passes resolutions that even its own professional staff knows to be nonsense. Its latest condemnation of Israel for ostensibly violating health rights, for instance, passed in May by a vote of 107-8 with eight abstentions. \nAnd lest anyone thinks there might be some way to square this circle, no, the contradiction can’t be resolved by assuming that Israel’s disaster relief efforts are somehow divorced from its regular medical practices. Over the past few years, for instance, thousands of Syrians wounded in that country’s civil war have willingly come to the Golan Heights and handed themselves over to an enemy army (Israel and Syria are still officially at war) in order to obtain medical care from Israel that they can’t obtain elsewhere. That’s the same Golan Heights where, according to the resolution, Israel is regularly violating Syrians’ health rights. \nSimilarly, West Bank Palestinians have higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality than Mideast neighbors like Egypt and Jordan or even OECD member Turkey, due in part to their access to Israeli hospitals. That’s the same West Bank where, according to the resolution, Israel is regularly violating Palestinians’ health rights. \nOne might argue, looking at the decisions cited in the first paragraph, that the UN’s periodic passage of delusional anti-Israel resolutions doesn’t really matter. After all, its annual condemnations of Israel’s medical practices didn’t stop either WHO or the peacekeeping service from recognizing that Israel actually shines in this field and seeking to benefit from its expertise. \nThe problem is that those decisions are a rare exception to the norm. Far more often, the UN’s non-reality-based resolutions actually serve as the basis of international policy. \nConsider, for instance, the UN’s 2012 vote to recognize “Palestine” as a nonmember observer state, even though it didn’t meet the basic requirements of statehood set out in the 1933 Montevideo Convention. That convention requires states to have an actual government. “Palestine” has two, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, with the result that its ostensible president can’t even enter the latter territory and his writ doesn’t run there. \nWhile it’s still unclear how this acceptance will affect the ICC, its effect on UNESCO has been devastating. Not only did it result in the loss of U.S. funding–a full 22 percent of the agency’s budget–but the Palestinians’ nonstop submission of resolutions denying historical fact in Jerusalem has become so embarrassing that even UNESCO’s director publicly repudiated the latest one. \nBack in 2002, responding to worldwide criticism of the IDF’s efforts to stop a murderous wave of Palestinian suicide bombings, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan famously asked , “Can Israel be right and the whole world wrong?” It turns out even the UN recognizes that the answer to this question is “yes.” After all, two UN agencies just conferred accolades on Israel’s medical conduct despite the UN’s own 107-8 vote lambasting that same conduct. \nBut that’s precisely why Israel has refused ever since its establishment to take UN resolutions seriously: No sane country would agree to determine its policies based on the demands of an organization so often disconnected from reality. Indeed, the only sensible conclusion that can be drawn from the UN’s schizophrenia toward Israel is that the organization is in desperate need of comprehensive reform to cure its own illness. \nJoin us—you'll be in good company.

The magazine spoke to my intellectual interests and passions, and still does. As a reader and as a writer, I should be lost without it. „ Joseph Epstein “ Why does COMMENTARY matter? Since 1945, no other monthly magazine has so consistently published serious, provocative argument and analysis. No other monthly magazine has viewed America and the world through such a wide angle, encompassing economics, politics, society, culture, religion, and diplomacy. No other monthly magazine has published such a celebrated and wide-ranging list of editors and contributors. Cerebral, critical, and committed, the point of view found in its pages is as unique as it is formidable. And in a world of Iranian nukes, rising anti-Semitism, radical Islam, American disarmament, bipartisan neo-isolationism, and disintegrating institutions, reading COMMENTARY is more than a pleasure. It is a necessity. „ Matthew Continetti “ COMMENTARY has long been an unmissable landmark on the American intellectual landscape. These days it shapes debate, propels argument, and explains society with renewed vigor and force. It is one of the small group of essential reads for anybody engaged in politics, Judaism, foreign policy, national manners, and morals. „ David Brooks “ Anyone looking for a definitive exposition of a significant historical moment—whether UC Berkeley's Free Speech Movement, say, or the battles over \"general education\" at Harvard—has at his fingertips an inestimable gift: COMMENTARY's archives, which contain countless gems of reporting and analysis. Today's generation of COMMENTARY writers is building an equally invaluable store of knowledge for future researchers and scholars. „ Heather Mac Donald “ I first subscribed to COMMENTARY in 1973, as a recovering liberal who had invested four years of my young life in writing speeches for a constellation of McGovernite candidates and office-holders. Living in Berkeley at the time, I relished COMMENTARY as a guilty pleasure, feeling grateful that the magazine arrived each month discreetly disguised in a plain, brown wrapper that concealed its suspiciously neo-conservative content. In the militantly leftist community in which I functioned forty years ago, receiving regular monthly installments of the most degrading porn would have produced far less embarrassment than my growing devotion to the persuasive prose of Norman Podhoretz and Co. Yes, my personal journey from left to right-center involved the usual biographical factors, including the three P’s: paychecks, parenthood, and prayer. Paychecks, because they arrived with shocking subtractions in the form of onerous and incomprehensible taxes; parenthood, because responsibility for a new generation forced a longer-term perspective; and prayer, because my own growing Jewish observance led to the conclusion that my “idealistic” ’60s generation, with all its narcissism and preening self-regard, might not provide life’s ultimate answers after all. Fortunately for me, reading COMMENTARY with near-religious regularity helped to organize my onrushing insights and experience into a more coherent world view. In a dark time in our nation’s history, while surviving (temporarily) in the most unhinged corner of the continent, this incomparable publication persuaded me that I wasn’t alone. „ Michael Medved “ Just as one begins to despair of hearing the strong voice of sanity and courage, leavened with charm and good humor, in our modern polity, COMMENTARY arrives, and once a month one can be reminded that there are indeed some clear-sighted and articulate people who seem actively to enjoy the battle for truth. „ Andrew Roberts “ In a time of passion, COMMENTARY champions reason. Against lies, COMMENTARY speaks for truth. Confronting those who would doom to death the Jewish people, COMMENTARY is a magnificent continuing achievement of American Jewish life. „ David Frum “ COMMENTARY has become my new go-to website for news analysis because it is measured, substantive, thoughtful, and written for news consumers of all shapes and sizes. When juggling all the issues of the day and thinking them through, I find myself going back to COMMENTARY again and again to see if there’s anything more that can help me add the ingredients needed to finalize an argument. I like the mix of foreign policy and national political news, as well as the discussions about America’s place in the world and what it should be. I’m a print subscriber and a frequent website visitor, and I follow all of the writers on Twitter. Thank you, COMMENTARY, for providing such consistently helpful content. „ Dana Perino \nSubscribing to COMMENTARY gives you full access to every article, every issue, every podcast—the latest stories as well as over 70 years of archives, the best that has been thought and written since 1945. \nJoin the intellectual club, today.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his employees to \"keep moving forward.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying \"progress does not move in a straight line.\"\nT-Mobile's CEO John Legere tweeted \"let's see what an out of the box, nontypical, non-politician can do for America!\"\nCEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the U.S. election — a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that major brands have long espoused.\nSome are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies' values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign.\nThe men and women who head the nation's biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. \"Neutral is the best policy,\" says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\nT-Mobile's Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory last week, while holding off on judging the president-elect's policies.\nMany CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop.\n\"We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,\" said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney.\nCEOs and companies that try to bring people together are \"going to be the winners,\" says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University's Lubin School of Business.\n\"That always works better from a brand perspective,\" he says.\nTrump's victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple's iPhones.\nIn a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn't mention Trump by name, but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote.\nFacebook's Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump's call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network.\n\"I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,\" he wrote. \"This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.\"\nThe Associated Press",

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) – A silver Mazda was pulled from a retention pond at a rest stop on Interstate 75 in western Broward County Tuesday afternoon.\nThe car apparently had been there for two and a half days, with the bodies of two young men inside.\nRelatives said the owner of the car, 21-year-old Sebastian Ramos of the Bonita Springs area, had gone to a concert in South Florida Saturday with his good friend, 25-year-old Josh Lausche.\nThe pair was last seen leaving the Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood about 2 a.m. Sunday. They were headed across the state after a day and night of fun in South Florida.\nRelatives reported them missing Sunday after not having heard from them and being unable to reach them.\nThe car in the retention pond was discovered by a motorist, who noticed the fence around the pond was knocked down.\nIt was a tremendous crash. Heavy damage to the car suggested it plowed into the bottom of the shallow water.\nHow the driver, presumably Ramos, came to lose control, missing a curve on the ramp and plowing through the fence, is unknown.\n“We will look at speed as a factor. We will look to see if alcohol was involved,” said Sgt. Mark Wysocky of the Florida Highway Patrol. “It will all be part of the investigation.”\nThe car went undiscovered for so long, apparently, because the crash happened in the wee hours of Sunday morning and there were no witnesses.\nRamos was a student at Florida Gulf Coast University. Lausche had returned to West Florida from Minnesota about a year ago.",

The infilling of the Holy Spirit helps us deal with pain but is no guarantee Christians won't be immune to our share of it. The question is not whether you will experience pain, but how you will respond when the pain comes. It's been said the heat that melts the butter hardens the clay. Too many Christians, I've observed in my six decades on Earth, melt at the slightest problem. They've been led to believe following Christ means a life of joy and fulfillment. That's absolutely true, but the way that message has been preached, at least in America, has left some with an unhealthy expectation that the Lord only allows smooth sailing in our lives. On top of this, an overemphasis on the so-called prosperity gospel based on a mistranslation of 1 John 3 that God wants you to prosper has caused many a shipwreck for Christians who bought into it without understanding being a Christian is more than living like you won the lottery. Jim Bakker should know. He told me he got off base partly because of an overemphasis on the prosperity gospel. And he has experienced far more pain in his life than almost anyone I know. In this month's cover story of Charisma magazine, I tell how Jim Bakker lost everything—his ministry, his reputation and his wife, and even his home burned to the ground. In addition, he lost his freedom and was in prison for almost five years. Despite it all, he has come back—in some ways stronger than ever. Sometimes I will write an editorial about our cover story in Charisma . You can click here to read the digital version of that issue about Bakker, who I have covered since before the infamous \"fall\" in 1987. Here I share my own thoughts and conclusions on his life and I ask how you'll respond when the inevitable crises in life cause you to despair. You may never experience the depth of what Jim Bakker experienced. But all of us will experience loss, whether it's the loss of a dream or a job or one's health. Maybe it will be the loss of a marriage. And even if it's not the loss of any other of these things, each of us will experience the loss of a loved one because no one can escape the inevitability of death. We can all learn valuable life lessons from how Jim Bakker fell and how the Lord raised him up in this hour: Humble yourself. If Jim Bakker was haughty before the fall, he is humble today. What happened to him was unjust in my opinion. Maybe he couldn't help being humiliated as he lost everything as the world press covered every twist and turn. Read how low he was when he came out of prison. Yet I've known others who were humiliated by lesser \"scandals,\" and they tried to justify themselves and remained prideful. Whatever your pain is, embrace humility and ask God what He is trying to teach you. Learn something new. While Jim was in prison cleaning toilets, he took time to get a doctorate degree by correspondence. But more than that, he did an in-depth study of the words of Jesus and also the book of Revelation. It was unplanned and unwanted, but it was like a five-year sabbatical, and he took advantage of every moment to study Scripture. So if you are bedridden due to your health or out of work, what creative way can you spend the time learning something new or growing spiritually? Realize the Lord may be preparing you for something you can't anticipate. Most of us don't change unless we go through a difficult time. If this is happening to you, realize God has a bigger plan and allow your trial to shape your character. In Jim Bakker's case, it was becoming an expert on end times so he could help ready the body of Christ for whatever difficulties may be ahead. If PTL had continued to go and grow, would he have learned that? No. But look at the people he has been able to help. What is the equivalent of this in your life? Finally, never give up. As long as there's life, there's hope. Nothing will continue as it is now—either very good or very bad. So you may feel overwhelmed, but that doesn't mean the sun won't rise tomorrow. Meanwhile, remember the words of Winston Churchill: \"Never give up.\" One of the things I admire about Jim Bakker is that he didn't give up. Instead, he started over, built a great organization and a great legacy, and served as an example for us all. You can read my article on Jim and the entire November issue of Charisma by clicking here for the digital edition . A few months ago, I interviewed Jim while I was on a visit to Morningside.

      "text": "USA Today 10:34 a.m.   A photo posted by McDonald's in Italy on Facebook. (Photo: usatoday.com) \nMcDonald’s is revamping its menu with a Nutella burger. \nYup, you read that correctly. Unfortunately the decadent sandwiches are only available in Italy. \nDubbed the “Sweety con Nutella,” the new sandwich features Nutella spread between two hamburger buns and comes in a cardboard box similar to the hamburger containers. \nMcDonald’s Italy posted a photo of the new treat on Facebook Thursday. The post has been shared almost 100,000 times. \n“A soft sweetness has arrived that you will not be able to resist. Try Sweety with Nutella now: soft bread with a creamy, indulgent center,” McDonald’s Italy said in the caption. \nUSA TODAY reached out to McDonald's for comment on whether the Nutella burgers will make their way across the pond.

Post to Facebook OnePlus 3T offers pre-holidays revamp OnePlus is trying \"one-up\" itself.  //usat.ly/2fWRqA5   Join the Nation's Conversation   OnePlus 3T offers pre-holidays revamp Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY 5:12 p.m. EST November 15, 2016 The OnePlus 3T smartphone. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nOnePlus is trying \"one-up\" itself. \nOn Tuesday the Chinese smartphone maker announced the OnePlus 3T, a modest upgrade to its OnePlus 3 that was released in June. \nThe new device keeps many of the same traits found on the OnePlus 3, including a nearly identical design and5.5-inch 1080p HD screen. USB-C is still present, as is the company's Dash Charge fast charging technology. The real changes lie under the hood. \nBattery life has been improved, the company claims, while the processor has gotten an upgrade to a speedier Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip. OnePlus has also increased the resolution on the front camera to 16 megapixels, up from 8 megapixels on the OnePlus 3. \nOnePlus says the both the 3 and 3T will run the most recent version of Android, called Nougat, by the end of the year. \nThere will be two storage options, 64GB and a new 128GB version, but there's still no microSD slot for expansion beyond those capacities. \nThe phone seemed snappy during a brief hands-on, though I obviously did not have time with it long enough to test the battery or new camera. Given that the OnePlus 3 was already one of the year's more impressive Android phones I'm holding high hopes for the 3T. \nThe decision to upgrade comes at an interesting time for OnePlus. Although the company built its brand on being one of the first to combine higher-end specs and a lower price, that market has become increasingly competitive. A variety of manufacturers have since released comparable phones, the latest being Chinese giant LeEco which this fall brought its similarly spec'd Le Pro 3 phone to the U.S. \nFor its part, OnePlus says the upgrade is part of its \"Never Settle\" motto, and that it is rolling out the improvements now in order for consumers to get them as fast as possible, removing the need to wait for a seemingly inevitable new flagship OnePlus next year. \nThe new 3T will be available on November 22 for $439 for the 64GB version or $479 for the 128GB version. \nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nIt's been said that hindsight is 20/20. \nWhile our view of what's transpired in this country in recent months may not be crystal clear, over the past week, many have raised questions about the proliferation of fake news, raising concerns about how inaccurate stories — widely circulated on sites like Facebook — might have influenced voters in the presidential election. \nOn Monday, the social network updated the language in its Facebook Audience Network Policy . Google banned faux news from using its online advertising service. For thousands, however, these changes come too late; it's decidedly more difficult to halt the spread of misinformation. \nThe bruising election has pitted the public against esteemed journalistic institutions, leading some to give more credence to partisan posts from pages like Freedom Daily and Addicting Info . Given these conditions, one is led to wonder: will news consumers ever agree on a set of facts, or is our media literacy past the point of no return? \nTake Two asked two guests: Laura Davis, digital news director at the USC Annenberg Media Center Alexios Mantzarlis, leader of the International Fact-Checking Network at Poynter Highlights Facebook and Google might have been the vehicles in which people came across these stories, but then it's the people who like them and the people who circulate them who give them greater exposure. Laura, how much responsibility do we the public bear for this? \nI think Facebook needs to do a better job, but I also think the news media can do a better job and the public can do a better job. Look where those stories are taking you: what are those sites? Are they credible? Can you do more research to verify and see if any other outlets are reporting that? That's a hard thing to ask of the broader public which is why I think the solution starts with Facebook. There could be a large percentage of the population that does this, Alexios, but you might have people who keep spinning it out. There might be concern that the voices of truth get outweighed or outnumbered. \nYeah, I'm sympathetic to the challenges that Facebook faces in trying to police content on the network. I mean, for one, people could be gaming the system and reporting content. Facebook does allow you to report content as fake, but they could be reporting content just because they don't like what is on there, not because it's fake. \nAnother thing I'd mention is that Facebook repeats the problem of hoaxes and the confirmation bias that preceded it. We had fake rumors and gossip long before the internet, and so in a way Facebook makes it more visible and measurable to everyone. Old wives' tales existed before, right? \nPress the blue play button above to hear the full interview. \n(Questions and answers have been edited for clarity and brevity.)  ",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is under fire for failing to rein in fake and biased news stories that some believe may have swayed   Its predicament stems from this basic conundrum: It exercises great control over the news its users see, but it declines to assume the editorial responsibility that traditional publishers do.\nOn Monday, Facebook took a minor step to address the issue, clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won't display ads on sites that run information that is \"illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news.\" The company said it was merely making explicit a policy that was already implied.\nIts move followed a similar step by Google earlier on Monday, after the search giant acknowledged that it had let a false article about the election results slip into its list of recommended news stories.\nIn the case of both companies, the aim is to discourage fake-news sites by depriving them of revenue.\nFacebook is also said to be facing brewing internal turmoil over its influence and what it can and should do about it.\nEmployees have expressed concern over Facebook's role   and racist memes largely associated with the alt-right, according to The New York Times and BuzzFeed. Some have reportedly   investigate the role the company played in the election.\nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, however, insists that Facebook remains a neutral technology platform where its users can share anything they want, with only a tiny fraction of it fake or problematic.\nLast week, Zuckerberg called the idea that voters might have been influenced by what they saw on Facebook — fake, uber-partisan stories, such as a false one about Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump for president — \"pretty crazy.\"\nFACEBOOK CONTROL\nPeople update to Facebook so frequently that the company has no choice but to filter what everyone sees in their news feeds — the main artery through which users see posts from their friends, family, businesses, news sources and celebrities they follow.\nThe company's secret algorithms are designed to deliver the posts from friends and other sources that will draw people in and lead them to read and click and \"like\" and share — \"maximizing their engagement,\" in Facebook's jargon.\nFacebook frequently tweaks its algorithm to improve engagement. Various changes have been aimed at shutting out sites that promote clickbait and other garbage that users say they don't want to see, even as they click on it and share away. When users are surrounded by posts they want to see, they're more likely to stick around.\nThat's key to Facebook's advertising business. But it can be problematic when it comes to false but highly interesting posts.\nFacebook's news feed \"maximizes   bulls--t is highly engaging,\" former Facebook product   in an Election Day post. \"Highly partisan, fact-light outlets\" on both the right and the left, he wrote, \"have no concern for the truth, and really only care for engagement. ... It's   bulls--t.\"\nSocial media companies today have to acknowledge that they are news organizations, said Jeffrey Herbst, president and CEO of the Newseum, a journalism museum in Washington. \"Not like news companies of the 20th century,\" he added. \"But not just pipes where people get their news. They determine what is news.\"\nIn a post Saturday night, Zuckerberg rejected that idea.\n\"News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,\" he wrote. \"Facebook is mostly about helping people stay connected with friends and family.\"\nFACEBOOK AS NEWSPAPER — NO, SCRATCH THAT\nBack in 2013, Zuckerberg said he wanted Facebook to be people's \"own personal newspaper,\" one that delivers the stories most interesting and important to them. That's still the company's goal — though minus any reference to itself as a media company of any kind.\nOf course, fake stuff has existed on the internet long before Facebook. And under the law, Facebook is no more responsible for what appears on its site than \"the paper mills that print newspapers are responsible for their content,\" said Steve Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who studies communication technology.\nAt the same time, Jones said he thinks the broader issue of Facebook's responsibility is one that's going to be \"debated forever.\"\n\"Even the notion of truth is something that's highly contested at this point,\" he said.",

      "text": "YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) – The father that posted a Facebook video of his son’s reaction to learning his mother died of an overdose is still getting national attention.\nOn Monday, Brenden Clark will be on “The Doctors” to talk about the video he posted , hoping to create awareness for the heroin epidemic and encourage those who are addicted to get help.\nIt’s been a month since he posted the video and since then, over 36 million people have watched it.\n“We’re still just getting the gist of it,” said Denise Dezee, Clark’s mother. “You know, we had no idea this would happen.”\nClark says he gets messages from people in countries all over the world.\n“It’s crazy, it’s overwhelming, but it’s a good feeling.”\nHe and Dezee say they never expected it to reach so many people or touch so many lives, but they’re glad to know it did.\n“Honestly, I hope…more people can see the reality of it and people just continue to want to get help,” Clark said.\nAs for Brenden’s son, he’s received a lot of support, too, thanks in part to a Facebook page set up from someone out-of-state called “Cards for Cameron.” \n“Oh my gosh, we’ve had letters written, not just a few words, but letters. People praying for us and supporting us,” Dezee said.\nClark is now four months into recovery. He wants to become a drug and alcohol counselor one day, but says he wouldn’t change the experience he’s had since posting the video.\n“I think our lives will be forever changed but we’re always gonna be regular, down-to-earth people like we’ve been,” Dezee said.\nClark thinks the attention he’s been getting will calm down.\n“I think eventually it will blow over, you know? I mean, here and there somebody might say, ‘Oh hey, that’s the guy.'”\nClark will be on “The Doctors” Monday at 9 a.m. on WKBN Channel 27.\nThis embed is invalid\n",

      "title": "Facebook's Fake News; Apple Glasses?; Tesla-Killer?; Snap IPO - Eye On Tech",
      "text": "Facebook, Google and Twitter all take steps to curb fake news, questionable content and abusive behavior. \nConveniently though, they waited until after the election to do so. \nApple is reportedly working on new wearable glasses, Jaguar introduces a new electric SUV, and Snap files for its IPO. Fake News for Facebook, Google The fake-news issue surrounding Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) has been garnering a lot of attention lately. Perhaps rightfully so. Many argued that the companies should have cleaned up these acts a long time ago, but the amount of phony sources and questionable content hit a fever pitch during the election cycle. Now, both companies have announced measures that will target these sources and will hopefully curb the amount of fake news found in search and news feeds. Some have even blamed these platforms for swaying the presidential election. So if it took Facebook and Google this long to try and clean up the fake news issues, it must be a pretty tough fix, right? Not quite, especially after four students built an algorithm-based sorting mechanism in just 36 hours aimed at labeling \"verified\" and \"not verified\" news sources. While that doesn't solve everything, it certainly shows that the companies could filter these stories if they wanted to. Perhaps even more interesting is the developments out of Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). Earlier this month, we talked about the company's temporary release (or accidental release) of a \" muted words \" function. As it turns out, Twitter is in fact implementing that function, allowing users to block out tweets based on specific keywords or phrases. This comes alongside an overhauled user policy, which looks to crack down on hateful and hurtful content and makes it easier to report abusive tweets, even from bystanders. So let's get this straight: now I can finally mute out words like \"Trump,\" \"Clinton,\" and \"election,\" have a more constructive conversation, and stop seeing fake news plastered all over the web after the election is finally over? Quite honestly, it's totally disgusting. These platforms could have fixed these issues long ago. Does anyone else find it ironic that these three companies happened to stumble upon a solution just a week after the election was over? I call B.S. On the one hand, we could argue that the election prompted the companies to look into this type of content and behavior and has since found a fix. But seeing as though Twitter accidentally released its muted words function in late-October, and complaints had been raised on Facebook's political coverage far prior to election day - and some kids made a fix in less than two days time! - leads me to believe all of them failed to implement a solution solely because the election was driving results for them. After all, Facebook recorded more than 700 million interactions on Election Day while Twitter experienced more than 75 million tweets on Nov. 8th, more than double the prior election. Apple's New Smart Glasses? Just yesterday we talked about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and discussed whether it missed out on buying Harman (NYSE: HAR ), which Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) scooped up for $8 billion. We said the company needs to find a way to grow, and if it can't do so on its own, then M&A is the next logical step. But alas, reports are now surfacing - because obviously the always-secret Apple would never tell us! - that the company is working on wearable glasses . Details are super thin on this, of course, but given other forays into the same arena (think Google Glass or Snap (Private: CHAT ) Spectacles), it's not impossible to think it could happen. Reportedly, 2018 could be a timetable for when the product becomes available, but again, details are thin. So what's the impact? Personally, I'm not a huge buyer on the hype train of wearable devices. In theory, yes, the potential of the Apple Watch and Spectacles or whatever else can now be worn is neat. But in practice, I don't need to view the world through a computer/glasses screen, take phone calls on my wrist or know what my heartbeat is for 16 hours out of the day. For some people, it's a great addition. No doubt. And commercially, these products have a purpose. But we've seen it with Google Glass, and we've seen it with countless wearable watches. The broader public just isn't buying into it in the massive way tech companies were hoping for. In essence, it's not the next iPhone. If Apple's goal is to build a suite of wearable products, then glasses would be a reasonable next step. If it's a profitable endeavor, who are we to complain? Like everything else Apple has revolutionized, maybe it won't be the first, but chances are it could be the best. And maybe everyone will want it then, but I won't hold my breath. Will Jaguar's New Car Stand a Chance Against Tesla? Jaguar's (NYSE: TTM ) new I-PACE concept car is an electric powered SUV capable of going from 0 to 60 mph in roughly four seconds. Currently, the company estimates it will have a range of more than 310 miles and the capacity to recharge 80% of its battery in just an hour and a half. Jaguar is hoping to bring the vehicle into production sometime in 2018. This sort of fits into the argument against Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) - at least the ones that don't have anything to do with CEO Elon Musk. It goes something along the lines of when Mercedes ( OTCPK:DDAIY ), Jaguar, BMW ( OTCPK:BMWYY ) and other carmakers enter the space, Tesla will be done for. Sort of like it's an annoying competitor that can be crushed, but right now, there's just no point because it's too small. Once it gets bigger and truly gets on Mercedes/BMW/GM's (NYSE: GM ) nerves, then they'll squash it like the cockroach that it is - in the words of Kevin O'Leary. But that's the wrong take on Tesla. If Tesla's going to fail, it's not going to be because its competitors finally caught up; it will be from its own failures. Like we've said over and over again: Tesla can succeed, but it has to maneuver a tightrope in order to get there. First, several of these competitive threats won't even start production until 2018. Tesla has already been producing cars for years and is looking to ship about 80,000 of them this year. Let me know when BMW sells 80,000 electric cars. At last check , the i3 had sold 6,205 in the U.S. through October, which is down about 30% from last year. The i8 has sold a little under 1,300 so far this year, which is down 13% from last year's figures. We can call that cherry-picking I suppose, but the point is clear: Tesla has a huge head start over every company looking to get into the space. By the time Jaguar and other companies start producing these vehicles in 2018, Tesla will have churned out even more of its own. It has successfully carved out the top spot in a niche category, but a category that all the majors are poised to enter. Germany banned internal combustion engines starting in 2030. That sounds like a long ways away, but it's really not for something so bold. Maybe that will force German carmakers to make a superior electric car. Or maybe, that will draw more attention to Tesla, which will boost sales. Most likely, both will happen, but Tesla won't disappear. I'm just saying that we've seen a number of automakers come out with electric car prototypes and had some commentators instantly deem them as Tesla-Killers. But from the looks of it, Tesla won't be swallowed up in competition. It is vulnerable and has its obstacles without a doubt. But I wouldn't look for this to take it down. Quickly Speaking on Snap… The company has reportedly filed for its IPO . The valuation range is apparently targeting between $20 billion and $25 billion. Given how other hot IPOs have gone, I wouldn't be surprised to see it trade through that valuation, assuming the markets are still trading well come that time. Still, the actual valuation is perplexing to me. I previously laid out my case when the company introduced its Spectacle Glasses less than a week ago. Essentially, the company seems overvalued and here's why . If the company has a lights-out year in 2017, we're talking about $1 billion in sales. Taking the low end of the range - $20 billion - we're pricing Snapchat at 20x sales. Even with strong margins and assuming the company is profitable, this is more expensive than the industry-leading Facebook . I know Snap is the hot name with the hot growth, but choosing between the two, Facebook is definitely more attractive. Unless Snap shows us strong margins and earnings - or the potential for earnings - alongside continued strong growth both for users and revenues, this one is definitely overvalued.

Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published. You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! By Hayley Tsukayama November 15 at 6:28 PM Follow @htsuka (Dado Ruvic/Reuters) \nSince last week's election, Facebook's role in policing fake news on its site has become a very hot topic. \nAnd it should be. Throughout the election, Facebook's behavior has exposed what seems to be a great contradiction at its heart. As the social network has pushed hard to dominate new forms of media, it’s also bent over backward to deny that it is a media company — and denying that responsibility that comes with that label. \nThe truth is that Facebook has already taken on one of the functions of a media company: to act as a gatekeeper. It has labeled satire . It takes down “clickbait” articles which, in its own words, have headlines that “intentionally leave out crucial information, or mislead people.” Its algorithms clearly have some standards for content quality. \nBut Facebook won't apply those standards to its fake news problem. In fact, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took to his own profile to explain why and to reject the much-discussed idea that false news articles on the network could have affected the election. (Zuckerberg said the same thing at a conference last week. But the idea has persisted so strongly that he decided to address it again.) [ Mark Zuckerberg denies that fake news on Facebook influenced the elections ] \nI don’t know if we can lay credit or blame for this election’s outcome at social media's doorstep. Finding that out would take a lot of research, an army of sociologists and access to a lot of to Facebook data I don't have. \nBut what is troubling about Zuckerberg’s post is his explanation for why Facebook isn't tagging or penalizing false news: \n“Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.” \nI agree it's not easy for Facebook to tackle this problem. Worries of a politicized Facebook have dogged its steps before . Those accusations are still haunting the network; Facebook in a statement Monday denied a Gizmodo article claiming it had a solution to its fake news problem but quashed it, fearing backlash from the right . \nIt's true that Facebook alone shouldn't define what is the truth. But its prominence as a source of news gives it the responsibility to flag what is false. \nIn his post, Zuckerberg essentially falls back on an old excuse when the fake news issue comes up: that Facebook is just technology firm and a platform . . . an aggregator not up to the task of policing its users. \nThat excuse started out thin, and is only getting thinner. \nSure, social media companies may want to deny that they are in the content business. But they are in it — and only getting deeper. Look at where these companies are investing: more photo-sharing, video, virtual reality . Those are all new media products that they say they need to survive. \nYet Zuckerberg is sticking to his tech company script, denying responsibility for what is posted on Facebook — even when it doesn't make sense. \nFor example, to prove his point that fake news has little influence on Facebook, Zuckerberg pointed out that there isn't that much of it on the network. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” Zuckerberg said in his post. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.” \nThat may be true, but doesn't reflect how Facebook works. A piece of writing crafted to generate clicks, likes and shares, by design, gets outsized attention. Zuckerberg himself said in his post's comments that specific users may see more false content on their feeds depending on how they and their friends use the site. \nHe also refuted the idea that slanted news could have on individual voters by citing Facebook's own research, which shows the network exposes people to a broader set of ideas. Here, again, the issue is more nuanced. Yes, a recent Pew Research Center study showed social media posts have changed some people's minds. But the same study showed that people often mute, block or otherwise filter out social media opinions they don’t want to hear. \n“We see people engaging in a broader range of viewpoints while simultaneously taking steps to avoid content that is against their views,” said Aaron Smith, associate research director at Pew. “If there’s one consistency, it’s that you can really see both sides of that coin depending on how you ask things.” \nAnd, Smith added, individuals don’t control everything they see on Facebook — Facebook’s algorithms do. So, again, Facebook is the only one with the power to control what's on its site. And for a company that crows over its abilities to convince people to buy products, play games and even convince people to vote, it rings false for Facebook to reject the idea that its algorithms pick couldn't possibly influence those votes. [ Your political posts on social media are actually changing minds — sometimes ] \nFacebook is not alone in wrestling with this problem. On Monday, the first Google result that appeared when searching for popular vote tallies linked to a false news report . That prompted both Google and Facebook to say they won't accept advertisements from fake news sites anymore — a small step that won't address the larger problem, but at least makes an attempt. \nIn my mind, killing fake news online is a shared responsibility. Social media users should, of course, be critical of the things they read. But Facebook and other social media sites aren’t picking up their share of the work. Otherwise such obviously false information wouldn’t score so well with those so-called neutral algorithms. \nAnd if these companies continue to push their media efforts, they can't then shy away from the responsibilities that come with the business. If quality and truth are what matter when it comes to content, that has to matter all of the time — not just when it's uncontroversial. business",

      "title": "Did Facebook Fake News Win Election For Trump? 5 Fast Facts You Need To Know",
      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the claim that Facebook fake news influenced the election “pretty crazy.” (Getty)\nCan Donald Trump thank a flood of fake news stories shared on Facebook this year for his shock presidential election victory? While historians and political scientists will be arguing for years over what really led to Trump’s victory, media critics are now pinning at least some of the responsibility on an unprecedented number of fabricated, fudged or misleading “news” stories online that were shared widely via Facebook, as well as other social media outlets.\nAn article in New York Magazine last week , bluntly titled, “Donald Trump Won Because of Facebook,” made the case that, “the most obvious way in which Facebook enabled a Trump victory has been its inability (or refusal) to address the problem of hoax or fake news.”\nAn investigation by BuzzFeed News published less than a week prior to the election traced about 100 political “news” sites trafficking in fake stories — most of them extremely pro-Trump — to a single small town in the Balkan state of Macedonia, where groups of college students and teenagers discovered they could rake in big bucks by generating phony “news” stories favorable to Trump or damaging to Hillary Clinton, and sharing them on Facebook where they would quickly go viral.\nWhat are these fake news stories, where do they come from and did they help to win the election for Trump?\nHere’s what you need to know.\n1. Facebook is One of America’s Top News Sources Nearly two-thirds of Americans use Facebook and other social media for their news. (Getty)\nMore than 60 percent of American adults use Facebook as well as other social media sites for their news, and 18 percent use the platforms “often” as a major news source, according to a Pew Research study from May of this year. Facebook has the broadest audience of any social media site, reaching 67 percent of all adults in the United States.\nAccording to the site Internet World Stats , as of June 2016 Facebook had 201 million total users in the United States — a penetration rate of 62 percent.\nOf the millions of adult Facebook users, the Pew Study found, about two-thirds, 66 percent, use the social media platform as a news source.\nWhat percentage of news stories displayed and read on Facebook are actually fakes? That number has not been determined. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks the figure is as little as one percent.\n“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,” he wrote in a Facebook post of his own on Saturday. “The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”\nBut one former Facebook employee, Antonio Garcia-Martinez — author of a book about Facebook, Chaos Monkey — called his former boss “disingenuous” for dismissing the idea that Facebook may have influenced the election. Facebook sells itself to advertisers on the basis that it can and does influence voters, Garcia-Martinez told National Public Radio .\n“There’s an entire political team and a massive office in D.C. that tries to convince political advertisers that Facebook can convince users to vote one way or the other,” the former Facebook employee said. “Then (Zuckerberg) gets up and says, ‘Oh, by the way, Facebook content couldn’t possibly influence the election.’ It’s contradictory on the face of it.”\n2. Most, But Not All, Fake Stories This Year Were Pro-Trump This fabricated “news” story claiming that movie star Denzel Washington had endorsed Trump was shared more than 22,000 times on Facebook in two days. (Facebook/American News)\nA study by BuzzFeed News in late October of “hyper-partisan” news sites — that is, sites taking a strong and obvious slant toward one candidate — 38 percent of stories generated by right-wing, pro-Trump sites were false, or contained falsehoods blended with fact to create a misleading impression.\nOn left-leaning sites, which would tend to be support Clinton or in many cases her Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders, 19 percent were false or contained significant fabrications — half as many on pro-Trump sites, though still a large number considering that legitimate news sites should contain no fabrications at all.\nIn addition to the recent false story — pictured above in a Facebook post from pro-Trump site American News — claiming that actor Denzel Washington “switches to Trump” and “speaks out against Obama,” other popular and totally fake news stories that were shared widely on Facebook this year included a story claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump ; a claim that the Clinton Foundation had “purchased over $137 million of illegal arms and ammunition” to be delivered to the United States in November; and even a story claiming that Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin were lesbian lovers. \nAs recently as Monday, November 14, the top Google search result for the query “final election results” led to a story claiming that Trump was winning the popular vote in the election. Like the other stories, that one was completely fabricated. (In realty, Clinton was ahead by more than one million votes , with that number expected to rise.)\n3. Many Fake News Stories Originate With Moneymaking Sites Overseas Facebook banner for a pro-Trump “news” site based in Macedonia. (Facebook/USA News Flash)\nTwo separate news organizations this year — BuzzFeed News and the U.K. based Guardian newspaper — investigated the origins of fake news sites and found a large number of pro-Trump sites based in Macedonia, a Balkan nation bordering on Greece to the south, Kosovo and Serbia to the north.\nIn fact, both investigations traced at least 100 pro-Trump sites to a single town in Macedonia — Veles, population 44,000. The Guardian probe found 150.\n“We are an independent news magazine with [our] primary goal to influence American policy, especially politics,” the anonymous operator of one of the Veles-based sites told The Guardian. “Then my city fellows saw what I was doing and started to copy my work. They are just looking to earn money from ad networks.”\nA fake news story making the bizarre claim that Clinton was romantically involved with Yoko Ono went viral during the 2016 campaign. (Facebook)\nAccording to the BuzzFeed News investigation, the sites in Macedonia are run mostly by teenagers looking to turn a quick buck. While U.S. publishers struggle to build revenue streams from Facebook shares and search engine clicks, the small amounts of money paid by those sources can be substantial in a struggling economy such as Macedonia’s.\nThe Macedonian teens interviewed by BuzzFeed earlier experimented with fake or often plagiarized stories about Bernie Sanders, but found that even Sanders with his devoted cult following did not generate the same level of traffic as Trump.\n“People in America prefer to read news about Trump,” the 16-year-old proprietor of pro-Trump site BVANews.com told BuzzFeed.\nWhile not all stories even on the Macedonian sites are flatly false, BuzzFeed found that false stories on average generated significantly more internet “clicks” than accurate news stories. A false story claiming that Clinton in 2013 had described Trump as “honest and can’t be bought” generated 480,000 Facebook shares, comments and reactions in one week — compared to the New York Times bombshell revealing that Trump had likely paid no income tax since 1995, which produced 175,000 Facebook engagements.\nCan Hillary Clinton Still Win The Election? 5 Fast Facts You Need To Know With the 2016 Presidential Election now nearly a week in the past, can Hillary Clinton still win? Many supporters are looking for a way to stop Donald Trump.\nClick here to read more 4. Fake News Stories Also Cover Trump-Related Themes Fake news story with racial overtones posted by Freedom Daily. (Facebook/Freedom Daily)\nThe pro-Trump fake news sites do not confine themselves to generating false and misleading stories only about the candidate. They also churn out stories on themes that they believe, often correctly, will appeal to Trump supporters. Those fake or distorted stories often involve violent crimes committed against white people by African-Americans.\nThe above story claiming that “blacks” had set “two white men” ablaze with gasoline was posted on September 23 by the pro-Trump site Freedom Daily, on its Facebook page . The story generated nearly 14,000 shares, more than 2,000 comments 9,500 reactions. But as BuzzFeed found by checking old news stories, while the photos is the post may have been real, the story itself was a total fabrication.\nThe incident had taken place about a year earlier, and involved a dispute between co-workers that turned violent. Neither of the men involved was white. The story was not “censored” but received wide coverage in local media in the Baltimore area, where it happened.\nStory posted Tuesday by pro-Trump site USA News Flash. (Facebook/USA News Flash)\nSimilarly, a story posted Tuesday to Facebook by the pro-Trump site USA News Flash claimed that Trump supporter in Alabama had been “martyred,” stabbed to death by a “black man.” \nWhile the murder described in the story happened, it was the result of a tragic robbery — not a political attack targeting a the victim for supporting Trump. The suspect has been arrested and charged with capital murder.\n5. Facebook and Google Are Now Taking Steps to Curb Fake News . @Google CEO Sundar Pichai says, given tight margins in US election result, fake news could have been factor https://t.co/qdFroy0TDz pic.twitter.com/gUv2Ju1bqz \n— BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) November 15, 2016 \n\nOn Monday, both Facebook and the dominant search engine Google announced steps to reduce fake news stories from circulating on their respective platforms.\nThe two internet titans announced measures to hit sites that promulgate fake news where they will feel it most — the bank account. According to a Reuters report , Google will evaluate sites for misleading and false news content and remove offenders from the company’s AdSense network, which is the primary source of revenue for many news sites.\nFacebook said that it would stop displaying revenue-generating ads on sites that traffic in fake news.\n“In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,” a Facebook spokesperson told NBC News on Tuesday. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.”\nWhile depriving fake news sites of advertising will clearly reduce the incentive to publish phony news stories, neither Google nor Facebook announced new policies aimed at actually reducing the number of fake news stories that show up in search results and user news feeds.\nTop 6 Trending Fake News Stories on Facebook Facebook has seen fake news stories trend repeatedly after firing its team of human editors.

But I was still curious, so I logged on to Facebook and found that many of my hometown friends, too, were sharing the article. \nIt was entirely false. \nYet the article still lives online and may make yet another round on the internet. \nUnchecked rumors spread on social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter. (Tim Lee/Raleigh News and Observer) \nThe false news epidemic is getting a lot of attention, especially after an election where many false or misleading articles led Facebook's trending list. It's worrisome in an age where 6 out of 10 Americans use social media platforms to consume news, according to a study by the Pew Research Center . \nOn Monday, Google and Facebook announced plans to combat the problem through restrictions on advertising, Reuters reported . The problem with Facebook is deeper than fake news \nBut some are taking the matter of media literacy into their own hands. Melissa Zimdars, assistant professor of media studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, has created a list called \" False, Misleading, Clickbait-y and Satirical 'News' Sources . \" \nI love my mother dearly, but she could use some tips on verifying news sources. Zimdars' list helps break down the red flags. Here are her tips, reprinted in full: \nAvoid websites that end in “lo” (example: Newslo) . These sites specialize in taking a piece of accurate information and then packaging that information with other false or misleading “facts.” \nWatch out for websites that end in “.com.co” — they are often fake versions of real news sources. \nWatch out if known/reputable news sites are not also reporting on the story. Sometimes, lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event. \nOdd domain names generally equal odd and rarely truthful news. \nLack of author attribution may, but not always, signify that the news story is suspect and requires verification. \nSome news organizations are also letting bloggers post under the banner of particular news brands; however, many of these posts do not go through the same editing process (example: BuzzFeed Community Posts, Kinja blogs, Forbes blogs). \nCheck the “About Us” tab on websites or look up the website on Snopes or Wikipedia for more information about the source. \nBad web design and use of ALL CAPS can also be a sign that the source you’re looking at should be verified and/or read in conjunction with other sources. \nIf the story makes you REALLY ANGRY, it’s probably a good idea to keep reading about the topic via other sources to make sure the story you read wasn’t purposefully trying to make you angry (with potentially misleading or false information) in order to generate shares and ad revenue. \nIt’s always best to read multiple sources of information to get a variety of viewpoints and media frames. Some sources not yet included in this list (although their practices at times may qualify them for addition), such as The Daily Kos, The Huffington Post and Fox News, vacillate between providing important, legitimate, problematic and/or hyperbolic news coverage, requiring readers and viewers to verify and contextualize information with other sources.

Una compilación de mis ideas, historias, pensamientos y cualquier cosa que me interese releer en el futuro. 6 mins ago My perspectives on the november 2016 US election as posted on my Facebook. Ive never really posted a comment on my FB status wall or whatever it’s called now. But today really sucks… and the world seems keen on making the worst decisions possible. Democracy seems to be failing to further our growth in the 21st century and yet there does not seem to be a better alternative out there. Humanity’s betterment through time has always been this way. We take two steps forward, then take one back. It’s sad to see that at this time we are living mid-step towards the past. Many people are trying to find constitutional loopholes and tricks to prevent the Trump presidency. To them i say the following. There is a large movement trying to stop trump from entering the white house. I understand the motivation behind the people rooting for this option, I am not american, but I am still dreading the trump presidency. The laws of the country functioned as they have for many years and the outcome was clear and irrefutable. People are protesting and petitioning for change and it is their right to do so and that is beautiful. However, as terrified as I am about trump as president of the USA, I would be twice as horrified to see the birthplace of modern democracy overturn this election. This election was voted for by all americans according to a system that has functioned for much longer than any of us have lived. If the system is outdated and flawed you should have changed it before it brought you consequences. The election must be respected because if the results are not upheld then you, americans, will prove that your laws, amendments, your constitution and your democracy are worthless. So, if everything that you stand for and your ancestors have stood for for so long is worthless, then you should ask yourselves, why do we matter? I am very sorry about your future president. But you chose him, the collective you, not just those that you regularly spend time with. Regardless of your differences a representative majority of your people decided for Donald trump. This will be a big challenge and you can manage it if you stick together. But you also can only succeed if you stick to the great principles of your aching nation. So do not despair, and keep moving forward.",

      "text": "EMAIL \nFake news is the news right now. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg released a statement on Saturday following speculation that false information on the social media platform influenced the outcome of the presidential election. \nThen on Monday, both Facebook and Google announced new policies to restrict advertising revenue for phony news sources. \nSo a lot of people are concerned about fake news and how to keep misinformation from spreading online. Some solutions are emerging — at a recent hackathon held at Princeton University, a group of four students developed a Google Chrome browser extension to classify stories as verified or non-verified. \nBut even if the Internet gets better at shutting down bogus stories, it’s never going to be perfect. Here are seven easy ways to protect yourself and your timeline. 1. CHECK THE DATE \nThis happens all the time — old news stories are repackaged and reposted to generate a fresh wave of clicks, and they get spread around Facebook in a flash. Do you remember seeing your friends posting a story after Donald Trump’s election that President Obama had moved to permanently protect Planned Parenthood? The story is true, with the caveat that the rule has not yet gone into effect — but it was originally posted in September. When it resurfaced last week, it created the impression that the measure was in direct response to Trump’s election, which is not the case. \nWhile old news may well be accurate and not actually fake, resharing it often takes it out of context, which can turn it into accidental misinformation. \nSo before you do anything else, check the publication date of the story, or run a quick web search of the headline to see when the event it’s about originally happened. 2. CHECK THE SOURCE AGAINST ITSELF \nMaybe the story itself seems plausible (“Hillary Clinton hospitalized following a stroke”) but when you check the source’s other stories, you get things like “Area woman cures HIV through harmonica music” and “Something good happened in Florida.” That’s a dead giveaway that the source is trying out a little (fake) legitimacy to bring in (and trick) readers. \nAnd speaking of the source … 3. LOOK CLOSELY AT THE WEBSITE \nCheck out the source’s site before you blindly repost. Does it look like it was designed by a kindergartner on a sugar high with a basic knowledge of HTML? Steer clear. \nYou should also pay attention to the domain name — sometimes it will look like a legitimate domain, but with just a few letters changed. Also look out for top-level domain extensions (com, org, edu) that you don’t recognize, and labels that are a little too on the nose; if a story about the miraculous healing power of cinnamon buns takes you to cinnamoncouncil.org, it’s probably shady. \nEveryone knows The Onion , but some satirical sources (WeeklyWorldNews.com, The Borowitz Report ) are less well-known. Others (DailyCurrant.com, DrudgeReport.com.co, MSNBC.co) self-protect by calling themselves satire but try to pass as legitimate. \nLook for tiny disclaimers hiding in corners and copyrights. Snopes has a good list of these sites here . And on that note … 4. VERIFY WITH FACT-CHECKING SITES \nSnopes is a great one. Factcheck.org and PolitiFact are others. Don’t hesitate to use them. 5. CHECK THE SOURCE AGAINST OTHER SOURCES \nLet’s say your possibly legitimate story about Clinton’s stroke came from a possibly legitimate source, but you’re not sure. Check to see who else is reporting on it. If the New York Times , the Washington Post , USA TODAY, CNN or other reputable sources haven’t picked it up, chances are good it’s not valid. Related: About the rumor that Harambe got over 10,000 votes … \nAnd even if they have, check to see if they’ve done their own reporting; if every story links back to the same original source, it’s completely possible there will be a batch of corrections issued the next day when something turns out to be false. 6. USE REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH \nFor hoax sources, a legit-looking photo can be a great tool for tricking inattentive readers. Find the photo’s original source by using TinEye or Google’s reverse image search to determine if it has been misrepresented. \nAlso, speaking of images, this should probably go without saying, but memes are not a reliable news source. 7. BEWARE OF EXTRAVAGANCE \nClickbait is called bait for a reason — it has to be interesting enough to break the scrolling cycle and take you to a new page. This means pulling out all the psychological stops, appealing to your humor, sympathy and frustration. \nAny time a story seems to be too funny, too uplifting, too terrifying or infuriating, that should trip an alarm in your head. Then follow up with your new arsenal of tricks, and it’s almost impossible to go wrong. Jillian Vandiveer is a Brooklyn College student and a USA TODAY College digital producer.",

      "text": "Share Tweet Follow Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the claim that Facebook fake news influenced the election “pretty crazy.” (Getty) \nCan Donald Trump thank a flood of fake news stories shared on Facebook this year for his shock presidential election victory? While historians and political scientists will be arguing for years over what really led to Trump’s victory, media critics are now pinning at least some of the responsibility on an unprecedented number of fabricated, fudged or misleading “news” stories online that were shared widely via Facebook, as well as other social media outlets. \nAn article in New York Magazine last week , bluntly titled, “Donald Trump Won Because of Facebook,” made the case that, “the most obvious way in which Facebook enabled a Trump victory has been its inability (or refusal) to address the problem of hoax or fake news.” \nAn investigation by BuzzFeed News published less than a week prior to the election traced about 100 political “news” sites trafficking in fake stories — most of them extremely pro-Trump — to a single small town in the Balkan state of Macedonia, where groups of college students and teenagers discovered they could rake in big bucks by generating phony “news” stories favorable to Trump or damaging to Hillary Clinton, and sharing them on Facebook where they would quickly go viral. \nWhat are these fake news stories, where do they come from and did they help to win the election for Trump? \nHere’s what you need to know. 1. Facebook is One of America’s Top News Sources Nearly two-thirds of Americans use Facebook and other social media for their news. (Getty) \nMore than 60 percent of American adults use Facebook as well as other social media sites for their news, and 18 percent use the platforms “often” as a major news source, according to a Pew Research study from May of this year. Facebook has the broadest audience of any social media site, reaching 67 percent of all adults in the United States. \nAccording to the site Internet World Stats , as of June 2016 Facebook had 201 million total users in the United States — a penetration rate of 62 percent. \nOf the millions of adult Facebook users, the Pew Study found, about two-thirds, 66 percent, use the social media platform as a news source. \nWhat percentage of news stories displayed and read on Facebook are actually fakes? That number has not been determined. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks the figure is as little as one percent. \n“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,” he wrote in a Facebook post of his own on Saturday. “The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.” \nBut one former Facebook employee, Antonio Garcia-Martinez — author of a book about Facebook, Chaos Monkey — called his former boss “disingenuous” for dismissing the idea that Facebook may have influenced the election. Facebook sells itself to advertisers on the basis that it can and does influence voters, Garcia-Martinez told National Public Radio . \n“There’s an entire political team and a massive office in D.C. that tries to convince political advertisers that Facebook can convince users to vote one way or the other,” the former Facebook employee said. “Then (Zuckerberg) gets up and says, ‘Oh, by the way, Facebook content couldn’t possibly influence the election.’ It’s contradictory on the face of it.” 2. Most, But Not All, Fake Stories This Year Were Pro-Trump This fabricated “news” story claiming that movie star Denzel Washington had endorsed Trump was shared more than 22,000 times on Facebook in two days. (Facebook/American News) \nA study by BuzzFeed News in late October of “hyper-partisan” news sites — that is, sites taking a strong and obvious slant toward one candidate — 38 percent of stories generated by right-wing, pro-Trump sites were false, or contained falsehoods blended with fact to create a misleading impression. \nOn left-leaning sites, which would tend to be support Clinton or in many cases her Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders, 19 percent were false or contained significant fabrications — half as many on pro-Trump sites, though still a large number considering that legitimate news sites should contain no fabrications at all. \nIn addition to the recent false story — pictured above in a Facebook post from pro-Trump site American News — claiming that actor Denzel Washington “switches to Trump” and “speaks out against Obama,” other popular and totally fake news stories that were shared widely on Facebook this year included a story claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump ; a claim that the Clinton Foundation had “purchased over $137 million of illegal arms and ammunition” to be delivered to the United States in November; and even a story claiming that Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin were lesbian lovers. \nAs recently as Monday, November 14, the top Google search result for the query “final election results” led to a story claiming that Trump was winning the popular vote in the election. Like the other stories, that one was completely fabricated. (In realty, Clinton was ahead by more than one million votes , with that number expected to rise.) 3. Many Fake News Stories Originate With Moneymaking Sites Overseas Facebook banner for a pro-Trump “news” site based in Macedonia. (Facebook/USA News Flash) \nTwo separate news organizations this year — BuzzFeed News and the U.K. based Guardian newspaper — investigated the origins of fake news sites and found a large number of pro-Trump sites based in Macedonia, a Balkan nation bordering on Greece to the south, Kosovo and Serbia to the north. \nIn fact, both investigations traced at least 100 pro-Trump sites to a single town in Macedonia — Veles, population 44,000. The Guardian probe found 150. \n“We are an independent news magazine with [our] primary goal to influence American policy, especially politics,” the anonymous operator of one of the Veles-based sites told The Guardian. “Then my city fellows saw what I was doing and started to copy my work. They are just looking to earn money from ad networks.” A fake news story making the bizarre claim that Clinton was romantically involved with Yoko Ono went viral during the 2016 campaign. (Facebook) \nAccording to the BuzzFeed News investigation, the sites in Macedonia are run mostly by teenagers looking to turn a quick buck. While U.S. publishers struggle to build revenue streams from Facebook shares and search engine clicks, the small amounts of money paid by those sources can be substantial in a struggling economy such as Macedonia’s. \nThe Macedonian teens interviewed by BuzzFeed earlier experimented with fake or often plagiarized stories about Bernie Sanders, but found that even Sanders with his devoted cult following did not generate the same level of traffic as Trump. \n“People in America prefer to read news about Trump,” the 16-year-old proprietor of pro-Trump site BVANews.com told BuzzFeed. \nWhile not all stories even on the Macedonian sites are flatly false, BuzzFeed found that false stories on average generated significantly more internet “clicks” than accurate news stories. A false story claiming that Clinton in 2013 had described Trump as “honest and can’t be bought” generated 480,000 Facebook shares, comments and reactions in one week — compared to the New York Times bombshell revealing that Trump had likely paid no income tax since 1995, which produced 175,000 Facebook engagements.",

Post to Facebook James Harrison shares another insane workout How does he do this?  //usat.ly/2fvLeAF   Join the Nation's Conversation   James Harrison shares another insane workout Alysha Tsuji , USA TODAY 10:07   \nJames Harrison does the bench press with weights hanging from the bar. (Photo: James Harrison, Instagram) \nSteelers linebacker James Harrison posts crazy workout videos on his Instagram all the time, and he also plays medicine ball volleyball . He's in excellent shape. On Tuesday, he revealed another one of his intense workout techniques. Harrison says in the caption that it's for \"stability and power.\" A video posted by James Harrison (@jhharrison92) on Nov 15, 2016 at 8:07am PST \nHarrison is doing the bench press with weights hanging from both ends, and the hanging weights actually touch the ground on each rep. Perhaps this is him taking his on-the-field frustrations and channeling them into a super hard workout, but something's telling me that he'd be doing this even if the Steelers were undefeated right now. \nPlease don't try this at home if you don't know what you're doing.

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) – A group of American Airlines passengers are suing the company after a plane they were on caught fire right before it took off from Chicago to Miami .\n“People were terrified. People were climbing over seats, people were just trying to get out because they were afraid that this thing could blow before they could make it out of there,” said Alexandra Wisner.\nWisner is the attorney representing 18 of the passengers who are not only suing American Airlines, but have also included Boeing – who made the plane – and G.E. – the manufacture of the plane’s engine – in their lawsuit.\nBut it’s the allegations against American that have some in the airline industry paying attention.\nWisner says her clients describe chaos when the fire started.\nSome passengers saying there wasn’t enough instruction from flight attendants.\nThey also said not all of emergency evacuation slides were deployed – and when one was deployed, it was at an angle that had to be straightened out.\n“They (flight attendants) just weren’t giving direction on how to handle it, how to get out,” Wisner said. “And because of that, it resulted in even more stress on them, even more trauma psychological, specifically, because they were so terrified of whether or not they were going to make it out in time.”\nWisner says warning passengers about sitting in an exit seat in case of an emergency is not enough to get airlines out of liability.\n“The air carrier cannot shift responsibility onto the passenger by saying while you’re sitting next to an emergency exit door now it’s on you,” Wisner said. “It’s still on the air carrier to make sure that in the event of an emergency that everyone safely and orderly exits the aircraft.\nAmerican Airlines released a statement, which read:\n“We’re proud of our pilots, flight attendants and other team members who responded quickly to take care of our customers under very challenging circumstances. American is actively participating in the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation…”\nThe lawsuit was filed in Illinois, which does not require it to list how much money the passengers are asking for.\nWisner says although there were no serious physical injuries, mentally her clients will suffer for a long time.\n“When you speak to these people you can see it still affects them,” Wisner said. “They’re crying, they’re noticeably upset, they’re still reliving it. It’s not over yet for them by any means.”",

      "text": "The Straits Times | Charmaine Ng | Wednesday, Nov 16, 2016 Photo: Facebook screengrab The Straits Times Wednesday, Nov 16, 2016 \nIt's not the White House, but the US$6 million (S$8.47 million) mansion President Obama and his family will be moving into after the end of his term is not too shabby either. \nSituated in the upscale Kalorama neighbourhood in Washington DC, the mansion is just a little more than 3km from the White House. \nIt is a 761 sq m brick Tudor mansion, which has nine bedrooms, eight and a half bathrooms, a terrace with formal gardens and a courtyard that can fit up to 10 vehicles - all the better to accommodate the Secret Service staff who will continue to protect the President even after he leaves office. \nThe neighbourhood is upscale, with several embassies nearby, including the Embassy of Oman. The Obamas' new mansion is next door to the home of a former congressman and down the street from the French ambassador. \nBut overall, the neighbourhood is quiet and calm, despite being located in the midst of a busy city. Here's the $8.7 million home the Obamas will be renting 1 of Come next year, this nine-bedroom mansion in a posh Washington suburb will have very famous tenants. US President Barack Obama and his family will be renting this US$6.3 million (S$8.7 million) home in the affluent neighbourhood of Kalorama after his presidency ends, say media reports. The house is reportedly owned by Joe Lockhart, who served as White House press secretary for former US President Bill Clinton, according to CNN. A listing for the property, on real estate website Redfin, says the house was built in 1928 and has nine bedrooms spread over three floors. It was recently renovated in 2012, and occupies an area of 8,122 sq ft. In March, the US President revealed his family's plans after his term ends in January next year. He said they would remain in Washington till younger daughter Sasha completes her high school education. Elder daughter Malia, 17, and Sasha, 14, have attended private school Sidwell Friends in Washington, since their father became the American president in 2009, reported CNN. \"We're going to have to stay a couple of years in D.C. probably so Sasha can finish,\" Obama was quoted by media outlets in March as saying. \"Transferring someone in the middle of high school? Tough.\" The swanky Kalorama neighbourhood is dotted with mansions and its residents include ambassadors, industry leaders and former politicians, according to the Independent Journal.

Redfin \n\"You can get almost any place in Washington that you want to go to in 15 minutes, but on the weekend, it's like you're in the country,\" former Democratic congressman and soon-to-be Obama neighbour Bart Gordon told The New York Times. \nInside, the home has a clean, traditional aesthetic - similar to that of the White House. The living room has been described in news reports as \"stately\" and \"generous\", while the kitchen features marble countertops and white cabinets as well as a hardwood floor. \nThe mansion also has an \"au pair suite\", which could accommodate Mrs Michelle Obama's mother, Ms Marian Robinson, who has lived with the family in the White House, reported The New York Times. \nThe Obamas, who own a house in Chicago, will be renting the Washington mansion from owner Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary and senior adviser to former president Bill Clinton. \nThe President has previously said his family will remain in the capital until his daughter Sasha finishes high school in 2018. \nHis older daughter Malia, who graduated from high school in June, will take a gap year before enrolling at Harvard University. \nThis article was first published on November 15, 2016.

      "text": "By Elias Groll Elias Groll is a staff writer at Foreign Policy , covering cybersecurity, privacy, and intelligence. November 15, 2016 - 5:28 pm @eliasgroll \nThis election season, Facebook turned into a cesspool of false news. A fake story about Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump spread like wildfire. An article purportedly describing how an FBI agent investigating Hillary Clinton’s email server had killed his wife and shot himself flew across the platform. Neither story was true — and now the social media giant faces an outcry that it effectively aided and abetted Donald Trump’s electoral victory last week. \nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and CEO, has called the notion “crazy,” but he’s clearly sensitive to the criticism at a time when nearly half of Americans consume news through Facebook. What’s more, the entire business rationale of the social media site is to generate advertising revenue — dollars predicated on the notion that what Facebook tells its users, they take to the bank. \nThis week, the company moved to cut off fake news outlets from its advertising platform — likely driven in part by a BuzzFeed expose detailing how a group of Macedonian teens set up a cottage industry of right-wing Facebook pages trafficking in viral fake news and pulling down enough advertising to fund a comfortable teenage existence in a poor Balkan state. But Zuckerberg faces a much larger problem than strangling the ill-gotten ad revenue of a few Balkan propagandists. \n“Facebook needs to to be known as a place that can have influence on how people think and behave,” said Mike Ananny, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies news and social media. “If they didn’t then why would advertisers give them money?” \nFacebook newsfeeds are posts, photos, and articles curated just for users by a company-designed algorithm. Zuckerberg says the goal is to deliver the content that is most “meaningful” — in practice, that means content that your extended network has interacted with in some way by commenting on it, liking it, or sharing the material. \nBut that model has created a tinderbox for far-right conflagrations. In the month leading up to Nov. 10, Breitbart, the house organ of the alt-right, beat a who’s-who of establishment media outlets in total Facebook interactions. Only CNN and Fox outperformed the upstart website — whose success this election season propelled the site’s former CEO Steve Bannon, an operative with ties to white nationalist movements, into a senior advisory position in the Trump White House. \n“ As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging ,” former Facebook designer Bobby Goodlatte added. \nIt’s not just Facebook’s problem. On Monday, a Google search for “final election results” turned up a fake article in Google News results claiming Trump had won the popular vote. In response, Google also cracked down ad revenue for such sites, and banned its advertising network on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” \nPrivately, Facebook executives are reportedly concerned about the degree to which fake news and racist and alt-right memes on the platform influenced voting decisions, and are looking for ways to better deal with fake and extreme right-wing political content. One group of employees believe the company hasn’t gone far enough and have formed a renegade taskforce to tackle the problem, according to BuzzFeed . \nOver the weekend, Zuckerberg indicated that he would be unlikely to crack down hard on fake news on the platform. “ Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” he wrote on his page. “I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.” Users flagging suspicious content, he seems to suggest, could be enough to weed out the rot. \nBut in doing so, Zuckerberg is optimistic about human nature. “Our goal is to show people the content they will find most meaningful, and people want accurate news,” he wrote. “In my experience, people are good, and even if you may not feel that way today, believing in people leads to better results over the long term.” \nIt’s not clear why Zuckerberg believes accurate news is in demand. “ We don’t know whether people want accurate news,” Ananny said. “The National Enquirer should have gone out of business a long time ago if that was true.” \nFor its part, Google’s initial efforts to weed out noxious and fake news items come down to tweaking some code. “The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.” \nBut for both Facebook and Google, algorithms only go so far in solving the fake news problem. Computers seem to have trouble determining what is and isn’t fake news, and Facebook has in recent months indicated it isn’t inclined to keep humans in the loop. That hasn’t gone well. \nIn August, the company fired a group of journalists who had been involved in selecting so-called “trending stories” to be featured prominently on the site after allegations arose that they had a left-wing bias. They were replaced by an algorithm — which immediately promoted a false story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly getting fired from Fox News for supporting Clinton. (She wasn’t, of course.) \nZuckerberg insists his platform isn’t littered with false information — “more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic” — but it’s impossible to validate his claims. \nFor researchers like Ananny, studying Facebook is an exercise in frustration. The company provides little access to its data and is ferociously protective of how its algorithm works. While political scientists have determined that Facebook can influence voter turn-out, the finer dynamics of how the platform influences voter behavior remains unknown. \nResearchers fear that social media companies such as Facebook are accelerating the trend begun almost two decades ago of herding news consumers into like-minded enclaves where they engage with content that only reinforces their existing views. \nIt’s a notion that Facebook denies, but tech thinkers argue that the so-called “filter bubble” shields internet users from opposing viewpoints. A 2016 study of Facebook, for example, found that users tend to “promote their favored narratives” and “form polarized groups.” Whether a given piece of content agrees with their pre-existing beliefs “helps to account for users’ decisions” about whether to share content — that most prized action on the world’s largest social media platform. \n“Engagement is the holy grail for Facebook,” Ananny said. “But engagement is not what republics need in order to live together.” \nFrank Zauritz – Pool /Getty Images Share + ",

      "text": "ad will close in 5 Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Facebook’s fake-news problem: What is its responsibility? Published: 11/16/16 @ 12:00 \nAssociated Press \nNEW YORK \nFacebook is under fire for failing to rein in fake and biased news stories that some believe may have swayed the presidential election. Its predicament stems from this basic conundrum: It exercises great control over the news its users see, but it declines to assume the editorial responsibility that traditional publishers do. \nOn Monday, Facebook took a minor step to address the issue, clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won’t display ads on sites that run information that is “illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news.” The company said it was merely making explicit a policy that was already implied. \nIts move followed a similar step by Google earlier Monday, after the search giant acknowledged that it had let a false article about the election results slip into its list of recommended news stories. \nIn the case of both companies, the aim is to discourage fake-news sites by depriving them of revenue. \nFacebook also is said to be facing brewing internal turmoil over its influence and what it can and should do about it. \nEmployees have expressed concern over Face- book’s role in spreading misinformation and racist memes largely associated with the alt-right, according to The New York Times and BuzzFeed. Some have reportedly formed an unofficial task force to investigate the role the company played in the election. \nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, however, insists that Facebook remains a neutral technology platform where its users can share anything they want, with only a tiny fraction of it fake or problematic. \nFACEBOOK CONTROL \nPeople update to Facebook so frequently that the company has no choice but to filter what everyone sees in their news feeds – the main artery through which users see posts from their friends, family, businesses, news sources and celebrities they follow. \nThe company’s secret algorithms are designed to deliver the posts from friends and other sources that will draw people in and lead them to read and click and “like” and share. \nFacebook frequently tweaks its algorithm to improve engagement. Various changes have been aimed at shutting out sites that promote clickbait and other garbage that users say they don’t want to see, even as they click on it and share away. When users are surrounded by posts they want to see, they’re more likely to stick around. \nThat’s key to Facebook’s advertising business. But it can be problematic when it comes to false but highly interesting posts. \nFacebook’s news feed “maximizes for engagement. As we’ve learned in this election, bulls--t is highly engaging,” former Facebook product designer Bobby Goodlatte wrote in an Election Day post. “Highly partisan, fact-light outlets” on both the right and the left, he wrote, “have no concern for the truth, and really only care for engagement. ... It’s now clear that democracy suffers if our news environment incentivizes bulls--t.” \nSocial media companies today have to acknowledge that they are news organizations, said Jeffrey Herbst, president and CEO of the Newseum, a journalism museum in Washington. “Not like news companies of the 20th century,” he added. “But not just pipes where people get their news. They determine what is news.” \nIn a post Saturday, Zuckerberg rejected that idea. \n“News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,” he wrote. “Facebook is mostly about helping people stay connected with friends and family.” \nBack in 2013, Zuckerberg said he wanted Facebook to be people’s “own personal newspaper,” one that delivers the stories most interesting and important to them. That’s still the company’s goal – though minus any reference to itself as a media company of any kind. Don't Miss a Story  ",

      "text": "Modal Trigger Chili's manager and Ernest Walker Photo: Facebook; Getty Images \nA manager at Chili’s has been placed on administrative leave after taking away a man’s free meal for Veterans Day, the company said while apologizing for the incident widely shared on social media. \nErnest Walker, 47, said he was “grossly offended” and “dehumanized” during the wild ordeal at a Chili’s Grill & Bar in Cedar Hill, Texas, after a manager refused to acknowledge his military documents and took away his leftovers as he readied to leave on Friday. Walker later identified the manager as Wesley Patrick in a Facebook post detailing the incident that had been viewed more than 770,000 times as of Tuesday. \nThe restaurant has since thanked Walker for his service and apologized for the incident, which prompted some who saw Walker’s video to say they’ll never eat at the restaurant chain again. \n“Unfortunately, Mr. Walker was not treated in a manner our veterans deserve,” the restaurant chain’s president, Kelli Valade, said in a statement. “On a day where we served more than 200,000 free meals a small gesture of our appreciation for our veterans and active military for their service, we fell short.” \nThe company “immediately removed” the manager involved and is now working with Walker on a resolution that “promotes trust and healing,” according to the statement. \nWalker — who sat a table with his service dog, Barack — was stationed in Hawaii in the 25th Infantry Division during the late 1980s, he told reporters during a press conference on Sunday. \nHe blames the manager’s reaction on an earlier encounter Walker had with an elderly man wearing a Donald Trump T-shirt. Walker said the man claimed to have served in Germany and that blacks were not allowed to serve there. \n“I do believe that the election has changed the hearts and changed the motives of people so much so that he believed in his heart and mind after talking to the Trump supporter that I was stealing food,” Walker said, according to the Dallas Morning News . \nWalker said Patrick also told him he was “not a real soldier” because he was wearing a hat indoors and didn’t believe his service dog was authentic. \n“Other guests heard him,” Walker’s post continued. “He asked for my military ID, I was calm, and provided it to him. At that point he should have just said, ‘I am sorry sir, thank you for your service.’ Instead he followed up with ‘the guest also said your dog is not a service dog.’” \nThe dog was wearing a red service vest and certified tags at the time, Walker said. \n“I was sitting for 35 minutes prior with Barack beforehand,” the post continued. “At this point I was grossly offended embarrassed dehumanized and started recording … Mr. Wesley snatched my food away, made body contact.” \nCedar Hill Mayor Rob Franke said the incident is “not what we are about,” the Dallas Morning News reported. \n“My concern for the veteran is paramount, but we must also consider the manager and how he can become a better person and perhaps do better the next time he is put in a difficult situation,” Franke said in a statement. “People do best and learn the most from experience. To learn requires patience and grace, neither of which can occur in the heat of emotion, demonstration, and anger.” \nWalker, meanwhile, acknowledged that someone was “nice enough” to start an online fundraiser to buy him a “better meal,” which has raised at least $1,400 as of Tuesday . He parlayed the newfound goodwill by challenging others to donate to veterans. \n“I truly appreciate it, all I really ever wanted was to finish my Chili’s burger on my special day,” Walker posted on Facebook . “But there are thousands of hungry Veterans that are Forgotten and Homeless. So I challenge America to raise enough money to Feed A Million Soldiers!” Share this: ",

After hacking the accounts of many bigwigs in recent months, OurMine targeted Zuckerberg’s Pinterest account once again on Tuesday, which was defaced with a new tagline and the group’s web address. According to technology website CNET, the hacking group informed the organisation about their latest adventure. Earlier OurMine had hacked Zuckerberg’s Twitter and Pinterest accounts. Zuckerberg’s Pinterest bio temporarily said, “Don’t worry, we are just testing your security .” The defacement was removed shortly. OurMine said it has an “exploit on Pinterest” but it gave no details. The group had also claimed responsibility for hacking",

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) \nWILMINGTON, Del. — The years of Delaware court fights over the presidential yacht, USS Sequoia, appear to be over. \nBut the-once stately vessel, called by some \"America's most famous boat,\" has spent the time rotting in a Virginia shipyard and will likely require millions of dollars in repairs and possibly an exterminator before it can safely set sail again.\nThe good news for its new owners is they won't owe a penny to the previous owners following a long Chancery Court battle over possession of the historic ship.\nUSA TODAY\nJudge orders sale of ex-presidential yacht Sequoia\nThe judge in the case, Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III, wrote a 21-page opinion released this week that sums up the vessel's recent plight.\n\"The Sequoia, an elderly and vulnerable wooden yacht, is sitting on an inadequate cradle on an undersized marine railway in a moribund boatyard on the western shore of the Chesapeake, deteriorating and, lately, home to raccoons,\" wrote Glasscock in the opinion.\nIt was a sad state for a ship where Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, among other presidents, hosted dignitaries and friends.\nGlasscock ruled that FE Partners, a Washington, D.C., investment group that specializes in historic ship restorations could purchase the Sequoia at an adjusted price of zero dollars. The decision capped years of legal wrangling over ownership and finally, the purchase price of the ship. The vessel was owned by Sequoia Presidential Yacht Group LLC. Washington Attorney Gary Silversmith was the principal owner and offered the vessel for charters along the Potomac River until it was pulled for repairs.\nThe USS Sequoia, with Queen Margrethe and Prince Consort Henrik of Denmark aboard, departs for a cruise on the Potomac River in Washington, D.C, in 2011. U.S. presidents had used the yacht until it was sold in the 1970s.   (Photo: YURI GRIPAS/AFP/Getty Images) \n“FE Partners is committed to restoring and preserving the Sequoia in cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard so that future generations of Americans will be able to enjoy the storied past of this magnificent yacht,\" said Richard Graf, general counsel of FE Partners in an email.\nEarlier this year, marine experts estimated the cost of repairing the national landmark to seaworthy condition ranged from an estimated $400,000 to upwards of $4 million if the hull has to be significantly rebuilt.\nOnce that work is complete, the value of the repaired and seaworthy former presidential yacht would be between $7.8 million and $13 million, said Earl McMillen III, founder of McMillen Yachts in Newport, R.I.\nThe historic yacht, designed by John Trumpy and built at the Mathis Yacht Building Company of Camden, N.J., in 1925, is in dry dock in Deltaville, Va.\nThe yacht had earlier been awarded to FE Partners, LLC, based on another Chancery Court decision.\nIn this latest decision, Glasscock was asked to decide the value of the yacht and whether the former owner, Sequoia Presidential Yacht Group LLC was owed money for the vessel.\nThe deal was complicated because FE Partners loaned money to the Sequoia Group to make repairs. If the loan soured, FE had an option to purchase the yacht for $7.8 million.\nIt was Glasscock's task to assess the costs and outstanding debts. He concluded that FE Partners owed the Presidential Yacht Group, owned by Washington attorney Gary Silversmith, nothing in exchange for the yacht.\nA \"President's Eyes Only\" folder lies on the bed used by presidents aboard the yacht Sequoia, Wednesday, July 31, 2002, in Washington.

(Photo: PABLO MARTINEZ MONSIVAIS, AP) \n\"I find under the contracts that Silversmith was obligated to maintain the vessel such that it was safe, structurally sound and fully equipped for its intended use as a Potomac River cruise vessel,\" Glasscock wrote.\nInstead, he found there was little evidence that happened, based on testimony from Silversmith's expert.\n\"I am left with only one side’s expert reports and testimony that bear on the question of the cost of Silversmith’s obligation to maintain the Sequoia ... Silversmith did not direct his expert to do an inspection that would allow him to answer the pertinent question, which is what would it take to put this vessel\" in shape to meet the loan contract provisions, Glasscock wrote.\nMeanwhile, FE Partner's experts told a sad tale of the condition of the yacht, describing rotting wood and a structural decline that was so significant it changed the shape of the hull.\nFor the last year and a half, the Sequoia has been on blocks in the boatyard. Initially, it was protected from the elements by shrink wrap but that covering was removed.\nThe damage done while dry stored is a fraction of what already haunts the vessel. McMillen said there is extensive rot in the hull and several of the structural blocks which make up the hull are cracked. It should have new wiring, new plumbing and new marine-grade air conditioning.\nHis total estimated cost to repair the boat ranged from $3.9 to $4.2 million.\n** ADVANCE FOR WEEKEND AUG. 23 - 24 ** Chesapeake Maritime Museum Shipwright apprentice Bob Savage greases the adjacent planks before fitting additional pieces into place during renovations to the U.S.S.

The area has the expert shipwrights needed to do the work, he said.\nIn her present condition \"would you ever put passengers on her?\" asked an attorney for FE Partners.\n\"No,\" McMillen said.\n\"Would you ever put her in the water?\" the lawyer asked.\n\"No,\" McMillen said.\nSilversmith, during the court hearing, questioned whether there weren't capable boatyards along the Chesapeake Bay where the work could be done at less cost.\nRestoring and repairing wooden boats is \"a lost art,\" McMillen said. \"I think, quite frankly, that's why they don't build wooden boats anymore. They are wonderful works of art.\"\nThe Sequoia's history makes it more than just an aging wooden boat. Franklin Delano Roosevelt hosted Winston Churchill on its deck; John F. Kennedy celebrated his last birthday on board the Sequoia; and Richard M. Nixon spent a night in 1974 with a bottle of whiskey at a shipboard piano before he resigned the presidency.\nDanish Queen Margrethe walks with Vestas CEO Ditlev Engel, to board the USS Sequoia Presidential Yacht for lunch,,Tuesday, June 7, 2011, at the US Navy Yard in Washington.   (Photo: Evan Vucci, ASSOCIATED PRESS) \nThe 104-foot wooden vessel has changed hands several times in recent years since President Carter had it sold at auction in 1977 for $286,000.\nIt fell into disrepair before it was purchased and restored by its current owner, Silversmith, a Washington lawyer and real estate developer. Silversmith said he paid $1.9 million in 2000, and sank millions into repairs.\nSilversmith operated the boat for charter on the Potomac River for many years. He said that he had been maintaining and caring for the boat all along and even took it to the Chesapeake Maritime Museum in St. Michaels for repair. The boat was regularly hauled out of the water for maintenance.\nSilversmith did not respond to a request for comment. His attorney declined to comment. FE Partners was expected to issue a statement later.\nFollow Molly Murray on Twitter: @MollyMurraytnj",

Before Facebook he was the director of business development at Microsoft Corp where he launched the BizSpark program. \nSince 2012, he’s served on the board of the French media group Le Monde. He’s also the co-author of the book: “ The Kelkoo.com success story “, published by Pearson in 2005. \nThe two-day Disrupt conference runs December 5 to 6 in the Olympic Village’s Copper Box Arena and features Startup Alley and Startup Battlefield where one startup will take home £30,000. You can buy early-bird tickets for Disrupt London here . \nYou want to display your company? Then go for a booth in the Startup Alley. For startups there is also the brand new CrunchMatch program where we match startups to investors. Check it all out here . \nExtra early bird tickets are now available to purchase for the discounted price of just £950 a piece. You can get your tickets at this price until 4 November. \nFor all you students out there, the deal is about to get even sweeter.

      "text": "SHARE: Facebook The Freedom Train was a train that traveled all across the United States in the late 1940s, carrying some of the greatest national treasures of the USA. Drawing of Freedom Train Interior Photo Credit \nFreedom Train, Taken on September 6, 1949 Photo Credit \nThe idea for this amazing train came to William Coblenz from the Public Information Division of the Department of Justice, during his lunch break. While he was perusing an exhibit in the Nation Archives, Coblenz realized that most Americans would never see the historic documents. Photograph of Freedom Train Display Car Photo Credit \nPhotograph of Freedom Train Display Case Installation Photo Credit \nThe more he thought about the problem, the more he became inspired. He got an idea to make a train with travelling exhibition of artifacts and documents. He presented the idea to Solon Buck, the Archivist of the United States, who then proceeded it all the way to President Truman, who finally agreed on it. \nThe train was named“The Spirit of 1776” and was painted red, white and blue. It held some of the most important artifacts in possession of the United States, including: The Emancipation Proclamation, the flag that was used in the famous Iwo Jima photograph, the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburg Address, a letter from Christopher Columbus and George Washington’s original copy of the Constitution. \nIt even carried an original copy of the Magna Carta of 1215. Photograph of Freedom Train Exhibit Photo Credit \nPhotograph of National Archives Employees Peggy Mangum and Florence Nichol Loading the Log of the Frigate Constitution onto the Freedom Train Photo Credit \nOf course, this possessions required an intensified security, so the special detachment of the Marines was always present. \nThe train covered over 37,000 miles, visiting the 48 states, neither Alaska or Hawaii were states at this time, and it displayed the artifacts to over 3.5 million people in 326 cities and towns. Sometimes people stood in queue for over 6 hours, only to see them. Photograph of Original Train Car Exterior of Freedom Train Photo Credit \nPhotograph of Original Train Car Interior of Freedom Train Photo Credit \nOn one occasion, when the train was stopped in Brooklyn, New York, few bored schoolgirls amused themselves by planting red lipstick kisses on the train. \nThe white stripe on the side of the engine was completely gone and replaced by a stripe of red lipstick. Photograph of the Freedom Train Around the Corner Photo Credit \nPhotograph of the Freedom Train at a Station Photo Credit \nPhotograph of the Freedom Train in Florida. Taken Circa 1948 Photo Credit Taken on November 23rd, 1950 Photo Credit \nWhile some cities stated that would hold separated exhibitions for white and black people, the American Heritage Foundation told them that they would either have integrated exhibitions or none at all. \nIn 1960, the train was taken back to its Livery and finally retired.",

      "text": "(Picture Facebook) It’s a tragic story of lost love – between a lonely man on Facebook and a rubber sex doll with alarmingly large breasts, which ended up cut to bits. \nDog saves life of boy with Down's Syndrome who got stuck in tumble dryer It’s one of the most hilarious climbdowns ever – from a tall story about the doll being abducted by a ‘meth addict’, to a final, terrible confession. \nYouTuber ‘Josh’ got sent a sex doll by his fans – so far, so 2016. \nBut then it got stolen, he claimed, ‘So I got up early to go job hutning and when I got back to my place the front door was unlocked and my sex doll was stolen. \nThen Josh said a meth addict had stolen the doll – and done TERRIBLE things to do it. \n\nHe said, ‘Long story short they found enough meth in this dude’s car to put him in a prison for life and on top of that the dude was chopping up my sex doll to get to the metal skeleton. I guess I don’t deserve happiness.’ \npost 3 But then, finally, the truth came out. \n‘Josh’ says, ‘Got to come clean. ‘A couple of fans sent me an awesome sex doll. So of course I was having sex with it. \n‘The doll’s p***y ripped while I was f***ing it and I got mad and threw it away after cutting it up.’ \npost 4 ‘I am sorry for lying to friends and fans.’ \nCan it actually be true? Can you even have sex with a doll so hard that you break it? Josh certainly looks pretty apologetic. \nWell it looks like I’m not getting my doll back. The police found her in the back of some dudes car when they pulled him over for a traffic violation. ",

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nNEW YORK (AP) — Facebook is under fire for failing to rein in fake and biased news stories that some believe may have swayed the presidential election. Its predicament stems from this basic conundrum: It exercises great control over the news its users see, but it declines to assume the editorial responsibility that traditional publishers do. \nOn Monday, Facebook took a minor step to address the issue, clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won’t display ads on sites that run information that is “illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news.” The company said it was merely making explicit a policy that was already implied. \nIts move followed a similar step by Google earlier on Monday, after the search giant acknowledged that it had let a false article about the election results slip into its list of recommended news stories. \nIn the case of both companies, the aim is to discourage fake-news sites by depriving them of revenue. \nFacebook is also said to be facing brewing internal turmoil over its influence and what it can and should do about it. \nEmployees have expressed concern over Facebook’s role in spreading misinformation and racist memes largely associated with the alt-right, according to The New York Times and BuzzFeed. Some have reportedly formed an unofficial task force to investigate the role the company played in the election. \nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, however, insists that Facebook remains a neutral technology platform where its users can share anything they want, with only a tiny fraction of it fake or problematic. \nLast week, Zuckerberg called the idea that voters might have been influenced by what they saw on Facebook — fake, uber-partisan stories, such as a false one about Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump for president — “pretty crazy.” \nFACEBOOK CONTROL \nPeople update to Facebook so frequently that the company has no choice but to filter what everyone sees in their news feeds — the main artery through which users see posts from their friends, family, businesses, news sources and celebrities they follow. \nThe company’s secret algorithms are designed to deliver the posts from friends and other sources that will draw people in and lead them to read and click and “like” and share — “maximizing their engagement,” in Facebook’s jargon. \nFacebook frequently tweaks its algorithm to improve engagement. Various changes have been aimed at shutting out sites that promote clickbait and other garbage that users say they don’t want to see, even as they click on it and share away. When users are surrounded by posts they want to see, they’re more likely to stick around. \nThat’s key to Facebook’s advertising business. But it can be problematic when it comes to false but highly interesting posts. \nFacebook’s news feed “maximizes for engagement. As we’ve learned in this election, bulls–t is highly engaging,” former Facebook product designer Bobby Goodlatte wrote in an Election Day post . “Highly partisan, fact-light outlets” on both the right and the left, he wrote, “have no concern for the truth, and really only care for engagement. … It’s now clear that democracy suffers if our news environment incentivizes bulls–t.” \nSocial media companies today have to acknowledge that they are news organizations, said Jeffrey Herbst, president and CEO of the Newseum, a journalism museum in Washington. “Not like news companies of the 20th century,” he added. “But not just pipes where people get their news. They determine what is news.” \nIn a post Saturday night, Zuckerberg rejected that idea. \n“News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,” he wrote. “Facebook is mostly about helping people stay connected with friends and family.” \nFACEBOOK AS NEWSPAPER — NO, SCRATCH THAT \nBack in 2013, Zuckerberg said he wanted Facebook to be people’s “own personal newspaper,” one that delivers the stories most interesting and important to them. That’s still the company’s goal — though minus any reference to itself as a media company of any kind. \nOf course, fake stuff has existed on the internet long before Facebook. And under the law, Facebook is no more responsible for what appears on its site than “the paper mills that print newspapers are responsible for their content,” said Steve Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who studies communication technology. \nAt the same time, Jones said he thinks the broader issue of Facebook’s responsibility is one that’s going to be “debated forever.” \n“Even the notion of truth is something that’s highly contested at this point,” he said. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP) By JOHN RABYTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS \nCLAY, W.Va. — A West Virginia mayor resigned Tuesday following a backlash after she posted a response to a racist comment about first lady Michelle Obama on Facebook. \nThe Clay Town Council accepted Mayor Beverly Whaling’s resignation in a meeting late Tuesday afternoon and said it would act quickly to name a replacement for the remaining three years of her term. \nThe resignation came after another woman whose racist post Whaling responded to was placed on leave as director of the Clay County Development Corp. \nCouncil member Jason Hubbard issued a brief statement condemning the “horrible and indecent” post and said racism and intolerance “isn’t what this community is about.” He apologized on behalf of the town to Michelle Obama and anyone who was offended. \n“This community is a helpful, hopeful, empathetic and God-loving community,” Hubbard said. “Please don’t judge the entire community for one or two individual acts.” \nClay County Development director Pamela Ramsey Taylor made the post following Republican Donald Trump’s election as president, saying of incoming first lady Melania Trump: “It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House. I’m tired of seeing a Ape in heels.” \nWhaling responded: “Just made my day Pam.” \nTown council member Joyce Gibson said that after news of the post circled the globe, the small office’s voicemail system quickly filled to capacity with irate callers. \nAn online campaign calling for Taylor and Whaling to resign drew tens of thousands responses. \nGibson wants anyone who judges the town to “come see us. Spend a day with us.” \nThe nonpartisan town council has five members, plus the town recorder and mayor. Whaling’s seat was empty during the meeting in a small office attended by a few local residents along with several journalists and some people from outside the area who wanted to see justice served. \nAnnie Thacker of Barrackville drove 117 miles to the meeting. \n“I saw what was happening in small town West Virginia,” she said. “I’m from small town West Virginia. I wanted to see hate put down in West Virginia, especially after this election cycle. Everyone’s watching.” \nLish Greiner of Belpre, Ohio, said she had volunteered during flood cleanup in West Virginia over the summer and returned for the town council meeting because “I will not tolerate hate in my home and in my area.” \nWhaling earlier issued a written apology to news media outlets saying her comment wasn’t intended to be racist. \n“I was referring to my day being made for change in the White House! I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused! Those who know me know that I’m not in any way racist!” \nTaylor, who told WCHS-TV on Monday night that she was put on leave, did not return a call seeking comment. \nThe nonprofit Clay County Development Corp. provides services to elderly and low-income residents in Clay County. It is funded through state and federal grants and local fees. It is not affiliated with the town of Clay, which is about 50 miles east of Charleston. \nThe uproar occurred as the town of about 500 residents is still trying to recover from severe flooding in late June along the nearby Elk River. Clay County also has been hit by hundreds of layoffs in the coal industry this decade. \nGibson was asked what was worse, the flood or the backlash from the Facebook post. \n“I’ll have to think about that,” she said. “This (backlash) will go away.” \nLast week in Kentucky, Republican Dan Johnson won state House of Representatives seat from Bullitt Count despite a series of posts he put on Facebook depicting President Barack Obama and his wife as monkeys. \nAnd last month in West York, Pennsylvania, the town council accepted the resignation of Republican Mayor Charles Wasko after an uproar over racist posts on his Facebook page, including two depicting apes with captions referring to Barack Obama and his family.",

      "text": "\n\nFake news is the news right now.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg released a statement on Saturday following speculation that false information on the social media platform influenced the outcome of the presidential election.\nThen on Monday, both Facebook and Google announced new policies to restrict advertising revenue for phony news sources.\nSo a lot of people are concerned about fake news and how to keep misinformation from spreading online. Some solutions are emerging — at a recent hackathon held at Princeton University, a group of four students developed a Google Chrome browser extension to classify stories as verified or non-verified.\nBut even if the Internet gets better at shutting down bogus stories, it’s never going to be perfect. Here are seven easy ways to protect yourself and your timeline.\n1. CHECK THE DATE This happens all the time — old news stories are repackaged and reposted to generate a fresh wave of clicks, and they get spread around Facebook in a flash. Do you remember seeing your friends posting a story after Donald Trump’s election that President Obama had moved to permanently protect Planned Parenthood? The story is true, with the caveat that the rule has not yet gone into effect — but it was originally posted in September. When it resurfaced last week, it created the impression that the measure was in direct response to Trump’s election, which is not the case.\nWhile old news may well be accurate and not actually fake, resharing it often takes it out of context, which can turn it into accidental misinformation.\nSo before you do anything else, check the publication date of the story, or run a quick web search of the headline to see when the event it’s about originally happened.\n2. CHECK THE SOURCE AGAINST ITSELF Maybe the story itself seems plausible (“Hillary Clinton hospitalized following a stroke”) but when you check the source’s other stories, you get things like “Area woman cures HIV through harmonica music” and “Something good happened in Florida.” That’s a dead giveaway that the source is trying out a little (fake) legitimacy to bring in (and trick) readers.\nAnd speaking of the source …\n3. LOOK CLOSELY AT THE WEBSITE Check out the source’s site before you blindly repost. Does it look like it was designed by a kindergartner on a sugar high with a basic knowledge of HTML? Steer clear.\nYou should also pay attention to the domain name — sometimes it will look like a legitimate domain, but with just a few letters changed. Also look out for top-level domain extensions (com, org, edu) that you don’t recognize, and labels that are a little too on the nose; if a story about the miraculous healing power of cinnamon buns takes you to cinnamoncouncil.org, it’s probably shady.\nEveryone knows The Onion , but some satirical sources (WeeklyWorldNews.com, The Borowitz Report ) are less well-known. Others (DailyCurrant.com, DrudgeReport.com.co, MSNBC.co) self-protect by calling themselves satire but try to pass as legitimate.\nLook for tiny disclaimers hiding in corners and copyrights. Snopes has a good list of these sites here . And on that note …\n4. VERIFY WITH FACT-CHECKING SITES Snopes is a great one. Factcheck.org and PolitiFact are others. Don’t hesitate to use them.\n5. CHECK THE SOURCE AGAINST OTHER SOURCES Let’s say your possibly legitimate story about Clinton’s stroke came from a possibly legitimate source, but you’re not sure. Check to see who else is reporting on it. If the New York Times , the Washington Post , USA TODAY, CNN or other reputable sources haven’t picked it up, chances are good it’s not valid.\nRelated: About the rumor that Harambe got over 10,000 votes … And even if they have, check to see if they’ve done their own reporting; if every story links back to the same original source, it’s completely possible there will be a batch of corrections issued the next day when something turns out to be false.\n6. USE REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH For hoax sources, a legit-looking photo can be a great tool for tricking inattentive readers. Find the photo’s original source by using TinEye or Google’s reverse image search to determine if it has been misrepresented.\nAlso, speaking of images, this should probably go without saying, but memes are not a reliable news source.\n7. BEWARE OF EXTRAVAGANCE Clickbait is called bait for a reason — it has to be interesting enough to break the scrolling cycle and take you to a new page. This means pulling out all the psychological stops, appealing to your humor, sympathy and frustration.\nAny time a story seems to be too funny, too uplifting, too terrifying or infuriating, that should trip an alarm in your head. Then follow up with your new arsenal of tricks, and it’s almost impossible to go wrong.\nJillian Vandiveer is a Brooklyn College student and a USA TODAY College digital producer. ",

Facebook. \nBrittany Daughenbaugh couldn’t sleep, so the Capital University student decided to go on a Pokemon Go hunt in the early hours of Thursday morning. She had seen the men across Francis Street but paid them no mind. She was on the trail of a good catch. \n“Suddenly, they’re behind me,” Daughenbaugh, 20, said Monday. One man wore a “Make America Great Again” hat and the other a “Trump-Pence” sweatshirt. \nShe said the sweatshirted man grabbed her arm and told her, “Don’t you worry, honey. President Trump says this is OK.” He then punched her in the face and the arm. She fell, hit her head on the pavement and blacked out. \n[…] \nShe wrote a lengthy Facebook post Friday about the attack, in part as a warning to other Capital students to be careful, but also to encourage only nonviolent opposition to the bigotry and aggression. \n“Protest and fight, but do it peacefully. Do not burn the flag. Do not vandalize. Do not fight hate with hate,” she wrote. “The only way to fix this is with willpower, passion and love.” \nHer post drew scores of comments of support, but one man wrote that the facial bruise in her Facebook photo was a “terrible makeup job.” \n“Take your agenda and lies someplace else and quit trying to get attention and smear someone’s name,” he wrote. \nFull story at The Columbus Dispatch . Racist graffiti was found on the side of the house that is part of the Martin Luther King Jr. center in the Perry district on Tuesday morning Nov. 15, 2016. (Jesse Tinsley / The Spokesman-Review) \nThe day a racial slur was discovered spray-painted on Spokane’s Martin Luther King Jr. Family Outreach Center, dozens of people gathered in solidarity to denounce the act and paint over the red graffiti. \nStaff at the center found the graffiti on the side of the building when they came in to work Tuesday morning. Freda Gandy, the center’s director, said some of the children saw it before heading to school. \n“Our kids should not have to see this,” she said. “It’s not OK.” \nAt noon, Gandy and Phil Tyler, president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, spoke to a crowd of people that included Spokane Mayor David Condon and Assistant Fire Chief Brian Schaeffer, in addition to police officers and community members. \nGandy said she shouldn’t have to worry about shielding children from seeing the N-word spray-painted on their building before school. \n“We didn’t ask for this,” she said. “Our kids didn’t ask for this.” \nTyler addressed the crowd and asked for them to all look at the red letters in front of them and see “racism’s ugly face.” \n“I say to the individuals who did this: ‘You did not break us,’ ” he said to the crowd. “You strengthened our resolve. You strengthened our resolve.” \nWSU student finds his car covered in slurs .

Out of nowhere, she said, she was hit with a brick. Soon after, she started to have difficulty breathing. \n“I just thought to myself, if I pass out from not being able to breathe and I hit the ground, it’s over,” Stevens recalled. \nAs she struggled with the pain, Stevens said she could hear people yelling. The words her attackers used shocked her. \n“I heard someone yell ‘Stupid n b****,’” she said. “Then they yelled ‘Are you scared? Are you scared now? Because you should be,’ and then they said ‘Now we got a president who finally feels how we feel.’” \nStevens said the 3 men in their 30s and 40s told her they’d rape her and even made references to President-elect Donald Trump. \nWhen they drove off, Stevens said no one stepped in to help. \nPlease, everyone, BYSTANDER INTERVENTION.* Full story at KOIN 6 . Greg Abbott (Facebook) \nWasting no time, Texas legislators filed three abortion-restrictive bills and the first anti-LGBTQ piece of legislation this filing period, assuring another heated fight for pro-choice advocates and LGBTQ allies beginning Jan. 10, the first day of the 2017 legislative session. \nIn the start of a likely avalanche of anti-choice legislation, Rep. Byron Cook , R-Corsicana, has introduced the bill version of the proposed Health and Human Services Commission rule that forces women to cremate or bury their fetal remains after an abortion or miscarriage. House Bill 201 would impose penalties on providers if they don’t follow the draconian rule, including a fine of up to $1,000 and the threat of license revocation. Reproductive health advocates have slammed the rule as another ideologically-motivated impediment to abortion access and flat-out unconstitutional during a series of public hearings . \nAnother bill, HB 87 presented by Rep. Matt Schaefer , R-Tyler, would remove the current exception allowing women with severe, irreversible fetal abnormalities to obtain abortion care. (Abortion is illegal at 20 weeks of pregnancy, as imposed by the remaining parts of HB 2.) Schaefer also proposed a bill to increase the reporting frequency at abortion facilities. Lawmakers are clearly undeterred by the smackdown delivered by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Texas-based Whole Woman’s Health case, which reinforces that women’s health laws must be backed by science and medical necessity – but how far the bills go in light of the ruling remains to be seen. \nOn the anti-LGBTQ front, Sen. Bob Hall , R-Edgewood, proposed Senate Bill 92 , a bill that would prevent a city, county, or political subdivision from adopting or enforcing anti-discriminatory protections “on a basis not contained in the laws of this state.” (Texas law offers no protection on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.) Further, Hall’s bill would repeal local ordinances already in effect. Hall’s bill is sure to be one of many anti-LGBTQ pieces of legislation: Stay tuned for the anticipated and misleading “ Women’s Privacy Act .” Touted by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick , the bill would prevent transgender residents from using the facilities that align with their gender identity. The anti-LGBTQ act stands as Item 6 in Patrick’s Top 10 priorities of the legislative session list, released today. The fetal tissue law and a ban on partial-birth abortion come in at No. 8. \nFull story at the Austin Chronicle . Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant [KIRO-TV] \nA well-known Seattle city councilwoman has been on the receiving end of vicious threats and racist comments after encouraging protesters to shut down President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, reports Q13 Fox . \n[…] \nAfter a video of Sawant’s speech went viral, she was deluged with over 200 phone calls to her Seattle office. \n“A staffer was told on phone: ‘I will come and tattoo a swastika on your head and on that b*tch’s head,’” Council spokesperson Dana Robinson Slote stated in an email. \n“Go back to India b*tch,” one email read. “I am tired of being shamed because I’m a white male. You automatically think I’m a racist. How about you go the f*ck back to India or wherever you came from?” \nAnother emailer complained that conservatives didn’t riot when Barack Obama was elected, before adding, “Stop being such a cry baby bitch and go hang yourself.” \nVia Raw Story .

      "title": "Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg Pinterest Account Hacked Again",
      "text": "Hacking news , Technology Mark Zuckerberg’s Pinterest Account Hacked For The Second Time This Year \nIn the month of June , we had reported how a hacker group named OurMine had claimed responsibility for gaining access to Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Instagram accounts. \nFor the second time this year, Zuckerberg’s Pinterest account has been hacked by OurMine again. OurMine is reportedly a group of teenage hackers based in Saudi Arabia who target social media accounts of top Silicon Valley executives in order to ‘raise awareness’ about internet security. It brings out the security flaws in a user’s account by gaining access to them, says OurMine team. \nApparently, OurMine mailed folks at CNET who claimed to have hacked Zuckerberg’s Pinterest account. They claimed to have a discovered a vulnerability on Pinterest that allowed them to hijack Zuckerberg’s account. By exploiting it, they were able to deface his profile. \nAccording to the report, Facebook CEO’s bio on Pinterest temporarily read, “Don’t worry, we are just testing your security.” While the group did not disclose how it carried out the hack but they did say it wasn’t through from any of the databases that were leaked this year after some mega breaches. “When pressed, OurMine said it has an “exploit on Pinterest” but gave no details,” says the report. \nOurMine group also mailed CNET the username and password of Zuckerberg’s Twitter account. The group claimed that Facebook chief’s current Twitter password was his former personal Gmail password, which he changed six months ago. The group also revealed that Zuckerberg switched to two-factor authentication on Twitter after his account was hacked earlier this year. “The phone number associated with the account ended in ’86,’ according to the hackers,” CNET wrote . \nOurMine had previously claimed responsibility for hacking Pokemon Go servers in July, Twitter account of John Hanke; the CEO of the US – based software company, Niantic that created the popular GPS – based augmented reality game, Pokemon Go, along with the Japanese company, Nintendo. In June this year, the group had also hacked Twitter’s chief executive officer (CEO), Jack Dorsey’s and Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai’s social media accounts. OurMine had also hacked the Twitter account of Evan Williams, the micro blogging site’s co-founder and former CEO, during March this year.",

      "text": "Philippine Daily Inquirer / 01:20   “Adventures of the Crazy Yellow Kia.” That’s how a Facebook post called Friday night’s incident at Rockwell. —VIDEOGRAB FROM KITT LAPEÑA’S FACEBOOK PAGE \nThe driver of a yellow Kia compact car who held off pursuing security personnel in Makati City for over an hour by ramming into their vehicles, leaving four of them injured, has received a subpoena from the Land Transportation Office (LTO). \nThe subpoena sent on Monday ordered Jamie Camille Brojan to attend a hearing today on her possible liability under Republic Act No. 4136 or the “Land Transportation and Traffic Code.” \n“Your failure to appear … shall be construed as a waiver of your right to be heard and contravene the allegations made against you, leaving this office to resolve the complaint based on available evidence,” LTO intelligence and investigation division chief Martha Fortades said. ADVERTISEMENT \nAccording to Fortades, this may lead to the revocation of Brojan’s license. Depending on the agency’s findings, penalties may also be meted out against the 28-year-old resident of San Juan City. \nOn Friday afternoon, Brojan was approached by Rockwell security personnel for illegal parking on Amorsolo Drive, Makati City. A chase which lasted for more than an hour ensued after she tried to flee. \nBefore Brojan was cornered, she hit a barangay service vehicle and several other cars on Kalayaan Avenue. She also struck the motorcycles of her pursuers, leaving four of them injured. \nA portion of the incident was captured on video by Kitt Lapeña who was walking on Rockwell Drive at the time of the commotion. The video titled “Adventures of the crazy yellow Kia” posted on Facebook has since been viewed over four million times. \nHowever, charges were not filed against Brojan after she agreed to shoulder the medical expenses of the injured security personnel. She also promised to pay for the damage she caused to all the vehicles she hit.",

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google November 16, 2016 Estimate of 20 Billion Barrels of Oil in Texas’ Wolfcamp Shale Formation which is largest estimate of continuous oil by USGS in the US ever Twitter The Wolfcamp shale in the Midland Basin portion of Texas’ Permian Basin province contains an estimated mean of 20 billion barrels of oil, 16 trillion cubic feet of associated natural gas, and 1.6 billion barrels of natural gas liquids, according to an assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey. This estimate is for continuous (unconventional) oil, and consists of undiscovered, technically recoverable resources. The estimate of continuous oil in the Midland Basin Wolfcamp shale assessment is nearly three times larger than that of the 2013 USGS Bakken-Three Forks resource assessment, making this the largest estimated continuous oil accumulation that USGS has assessed in the United States to date .“The fact that this is the largest assessment of continuous oil we have ever done just goes to show that, even in areas that have produced billions of barrels of oil, there is still the potential to find billions more,” said Walter Guidroz, program coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program. “Changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable, and that’s why we continue to perform resource assessments throughout the United States and the world.” Although the USGS has assessed oil and gas resources in the Permian Basin province, this is the first assessment of continuous resources in the Wolfcamp shale in the Midland Basin portion of the Permian. Since the 1980s, the Wolfcamp shale in the Midland Basin has been part of the “Wolfberry” play that encompasses Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Lower Permian reservoirs. Oil has been produced using traditional vertical well technology. However, more recently, oil and gas companies have been using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, and more than 3,000 horizontal wells have been drilled and completed in the Midland Basin Wolfcamp section. The Wolfcamp shale is also present in the Delaware Basin portion of the Permian Basin province, but was not included in this assessment. The Permian Basin province includes a series of basins and other geologic formations in West Texas and southern New Mexico. It is one of the most productive areas for oil and gas in the entire United States. Continuous oil and gas is dispersed throughout a geologic formation rather than existing as discrete, localized occurrences, such as those in conventional accumulations. Because of that, continuous resources commonly require special technical drilling and recovery methods, such as hydraulic fracturing. Undiscovered resources are those that are estimated to exist based on geologic knowledge and theory, while technically recoverable resources are those that can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices. Whether or not it is profitable to produce these resources has not been evaluated. USGS is the only provider of publicly available estimates of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and gas resources of onshore lands and offshore state waters. The USGS Wolfcamp shale assessment was undertaken as part of a nationwide project assessing domestic petroleum basins using standardized methodology and protocol. SOURCES - USGS ",

      "text": "show chapters \nIsaacson on fake news: Useful to have humans in the equation\nWalter Isaacson, president & CEO of The Aspen Institute and CNBC Contributor, discusses Google and Facebook cracking down on fake news on their platforms.\nIsaacson on fake news: Useful to have humans in the equation      3 Hours Ago | 04:01 As Facebook scrambles to address fake news and faulty metrics, it might show the limits of algorithms, and the advantage of humans, when it comes to nuanced judgment calls, one industry watcher said. \n\"I sometimes wonder whether humanity can survive the internet,\" said Walter Isaacson, president and CEO of the Aspen Institute, who has documented the lives of influential business leaders like Steve Jobs. \"It's been such a wonderful 20 year, 30 year run on the internet, and now you see the proliferation of fake news, hate sites, that sort of thing.\" \nCritics have homed in on Facebook's role distributing misinformation. After analyzing 1,000 posts, BuzzFeed News found that 38 percent of all posts on hyperpartisan right-wing Facebook pages were either a mixture of true and false or mostly false, while 19 percent of ultra left-wing posts were either a mixture of true and false or mostly false. \nFacebook's Mark Zuckerberg has wavered on the social media platform's role in swaying the recent U.S. presidential election, calling the idea \"pretty crazy.\" But internally, Facebook employees have reportedly developed tools to stem the spread of false news and have organized a renegade task force . And Facebook and Google have vowed to cut off fake news sites from advertising tools . \nDavid A. Grogan | CNBC Walter Isaacson After surfacing false results after the election, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the BBC that \"there should be no situation by which fake news gets distributed.\" \nHaving humans debunk which stories to feature could help, the way Yahoo and Facebook have done in the past, Isaacson told CNBC's \" Squawk Alley \" on Wednesday, Another solution is to have algorithms favor stories that are widely \"pointed to,\" like what Google does, Isaacson said. \n\n\"it sounds very reasonable until we try to figure out how to do that,\" Isaacson said, adding: \"As much as we think that machine learning and artificial intelligence and algorithms can sort out the wheat from the chaff, it's actually something that human judgment is better at. I would think we might want to go back to having some humans in the loop.\" \nStill, that solution also has serious drawbacks. Facebook axed human-written descriptions from its \"trending topics\" after facing accusations of suppressing conservative news . \n\"This is not one with an easy solution,\" Isaacson said. \"There are all sorts of shades of truth, and frankly, I don't want anybody, whether it's Facebook or CNBC, telling me this is the only news I can hear. I want to have a wide range of choices.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook, the No. 2 power in digital advertising, according to eMarketer, has struggled to correct errors in its measurements of its reach. The company announced on Wednesday that it would open up more third-party verification of its data after the discovery of a bug. \nIsaacson defended Facebook, which also reported a bug in its video metrics earlier this year. \n\"This does not look like it was an intentional mistake,\" Isaacson said. \"It certainly didn't affect ad rates at all so I think that they're trying to get it right and we're in a new age here, and they're being open and honest. They're the ones who revealed this information.\" \nThe pressure on Facebook comes as it faces looming competition from ephemeral messaging app, Snapchat. Snapchat's parent company, Snap, confidentially filed for an IPO that could value it at $20 billion to $25 billion. \n\"It's much broader than just quick conversations that disappear,\" Isaacson said. \"To me, the ultimate test of a tech company like this is not just, 'Do you have a cool service,' but 'Do you have a platform upon which other people can build good products and good services?' That's, of course, what made the iPhone so great, is it became a platform. I think what they're doing with Snap now, is making it a platform.\" \n\nOver the next two months, Snap will show investors if it can really execute on great new products, and move beyond a flash in the pan, Isaacson said. \n\"Customers are going to value knowing what's true or not, and eventually it will sort out,\" Isaacson said.",

      "text": "Facebook, Google Announce New Policies To Fight Fake News Courtesy CBS News \nCALIFORNIA (CBS News) — Two of the world’s biggest internet companies, Google and Facebook, are taking new steps to fight the rising tide of fake news — in other words, conspiracy theories and misleading information from no-name sites masquerading as news— that exploded on their platforms during this campaign cycle. \nThe problem has grown to the point that it is now too big to ignore. Both companies have come under fire for widely-shared fake news stories that spread false information about the candidates. \nIn a move disclosed Monday, Google said it will withhold lucrative digital ads from appearing on any sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” The new policy could give news and information sites greater incentive to avoid false headlines or risk losing revenue. \nGoogle was on the defensive after it was discovered that the top search result for “final election numbers,” “final election results,” “who won the popular vote” and similar phrases, directed users to a fake news blog called “70news” which falsely claimed that Donald Trump had won the popular vote by 700,000 votes. In fact, although Trump won the Electoral College , he is losing the popular vote; according to the latest CBS News figures, Hillary Clinton leads by more than 798,700 votes nationwide. \nAs for Facebook, in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump’s election, the company minimized the role fake news played in shaping public opinion in this unprecedented and vitriolic election cycle. Speaking at a conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif., on Friday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election outcome is “pretty crazy.” \nNow, Facebook appears to be turning a corner and taking a more direct approach to curb the tide of fake news. The company confirmed that, like Google, it will work to keep advertising dollars away from fake new sites. \n“We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive , which includes fake news,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday to CBS News. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.” \nFacebook’s latest steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not affect fake news content shared by individuals on their own News Feeds. \nFor the world’s largest social network, fake news is proving to be a complex disease with no easy cure. And it’s a significant concern since a 2016 Pew study found that 44 percent of Americans read or watch news on Facebook. \nThis presidential campaign coincided with the meteoric rise of hundreds of highly partisan, Facebook-only pages that attracted millions of views and extremely high levels of user engagement, and often trafficked in half-truths and outright fabrications. A New York Times investigation called these hundreds of Facebook pages, from Occupy Democrats to Fed-Up Americans to RightAlerts to Addicting Info, the “most disruptive, least understood force in media.” \nFacebook has had other missteps involving false information in its “Trending Topics” section. In August, Facebook apologized after its Trending section promoted a fake story claiming Fox News had fired anchor Megyn Kelly for being “a closet liberal who actually wants Hillary to win”; it came from the right-wing website End The Fed. In September, news organizations sounded the alarm after Trending promoted a so-called “9/11 truther” circulating the false claim that bombs and not terrorist-piloted planes brought down the Twin Towers in Manhattan. In both cases, Facebook removed the story from Trending. \nOn the eve of last week’s election, President Obama specifically pointed to the role of social media to help explain the current political climate. \n“People, if they just repeat attacks enough, and outright lies over and over again, as long as it’s on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it’s on social media, people start believing it,” he said. “And it creates this dust cloud of nonsense.”",

(Photos provided) featured Woman connects with man who potentially saved her from burning car in New Buffalo Minutes earlier, his trip was derailed when an owl slammed into his windshield By Stan Maddux Tribune Correspondent 10 min ago ( … ) South Bend Tribune \nMichael French, left, and Donnette Williams, right, are now Facebook friends after French rescued Williams from a burning car Nov. 6 along I-94. (Photos provided) \nDonnette Williams gave the Buchanan man who may have saved her life a big shout out on social media. \nNow, she and Michael French, who had never met each other before, are Facebook friends. \nWilliams, 34, of Niles, said she can't help but think what would have happened had her three young children, Dayon, 11, J-Lionna, 5, and Nylah, 2, been in the burning car with her. \nShe barely escaped herself without having to take the time to get them out of the now-charred older model Pontiac. \n''I'm grateful God placed him there and I have my life to be at home with my kids,'' said Williams, a nurse at Cass Family Clinic in Cassopolis. \nOn Nov. 6, at about sunrise, Williams was heading home from Blue Chip Casino in Michigan City. \nShe was on Interstate 94 when smoke began rising up from from the hood of her car. \nAs it began sputtering, she pulled onto the shoulder of the highway and called her stepfather. \nShe initially thought the smoke was from moisture or oil burning off the engine block. \nIt wasn't until French came running toward her from across all three eastbound lanes that she realized something serious was wrong. \nThe 31-year old French said he saw fire coming from the car's engine and yelled several times for her to get out. \nWilliams said as soon as she got out and shut the door, the passenger compartment began going up in flames. \nFrench stayed until firefighters arrived then left for his job at Sullivan-Palatek just outside Michigan City. \nThe next day, Williams searched for French's name on Facebook and found his page. \nShe sent him a message thanking him and calling him a hero. \nFrench said he appreciates the sentiment, but he called soldiers and emergency responders like police and firefighters the real heroes because of what they do ''day in and day out and get no recognition for it.'' \nHe said his actions were more of a one-time encounter to help somebody he came across in need. \nWilliams, though, said French didn't just simply drive by like all of the other passing motorists. \n''Nobody stopped With the car blazing, they would just drive past. Whatever,'' she said. \nJust a half hour prior to the encounter, an owl flew into the windshield of French's Ford F-350 pick up truck just a few miles to the north along the interstate. \nHe's attributed the timing of that incident to his passing by at precisely the right time to alert Williams to her car fire. \nFrench previously told The Tribune ''If I wouldn't have hit the bird, then I probably would have never seen the lady with her car on fire. It all happens for a reason.\" Tags",

      "text": "× Like Love Meow on Facebook \nA shelter cat with the saddest face had given up hope, sitting quietly in the cage until a couple came to rescue him. What a difference adoption can make in just an hour! \nMeet BenBen the cat! Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \nA sad little ginger stray came to the shelter with a crushed spine, several deep lacerations, and a cauliflower ear. The tomcat had a rough life fending for himself in the wild. \n\"It appears he was attacked by a large animal... His face permanently looks sad because he has a lot of excess skin on the face, and no one knows why,\" BenBen's human dad shares with Love Meow . \nThe shelter gave him a place to stay and cared for him for a while until a family adopted him, but soon returned him because of his medical needs. \n\"At that point he was deemed 'un-adoptable'. The vets said he'd never walk and he'd be on pain meds for the rest of his life.\" Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \nSo the shelter decided to schedule him to be put down... \nA kind woman, who works for an ER vet clinic learned about the ginger boy and the his plight, and knew she had to save him. Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \nTime was running out, so she and her boyfriend went to the shelter to take the kitty to freedom. \n\"We managed to get everything sorted out the day before his scheduled euthanization and brought him to his forever home.\" Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \nThe couple was told that when BenBen was at the shelter, he wouldn't eat, drink or even move. \"Almost as if 'he knew he was going to die and had just given up hope'.\" \nAs soon as they got him out, everything changed... Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \n\"When we first brought him home we brought him into the bathroom to give him a moment to adjust to our other cats,\" the couple told Love Meow. \n\" We sat down with him for about an hour and he was instantly full of purrs, smiles, and 'thank you' cuddles. \" First day at his forever home Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \n\"I like to think he knew he was safe and had his forever home at that moment. \n\"It only took about an hour for him to start getting curious about his surroundings.\" Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \nFrom that day on, BenBen became a different kitty. \nHe is a little supurrvisor in the house, always wants to know what his humans eat at every meal. Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \n\"And even though the vets said he would never walk again he was determined to prove them wrong.\" \nNot only can BenBen walk, but he can run and even jump small distances! Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \n\"He's doing so well! No one who knew him before can believe he's turned out so awesome.\" Courtesy: @ benbencatcat \nIt's been nine months since his rescue. BenBen still has a sad face, but he knows underneath he's the happiest kitty in the world. \n\"We're so proud of this little monster.\" ",

      "text": "Segun Olarinmoye November 16, 2016 0 Share on Facebook \nThere is this disconnect that usually exists between a non-technical CEO and the technical team. Often, this results in frustration on both sides – the CEO wonders why the team is not delivering, and the team feels the CEO is asking for things to be done in an impossible time frame. \nAnd many times, because of how little technical knowledge the CEO has, this communication gap cannot be effectively breached – and the company ends up producing a bad product that cost 10 times of what it should cost. \nHere is a little guide on how, as a non-technical CEO, you can achieve success when dealing with developers. These principles can be adapted to handling with technical staff in general. \nStep 1: Always get a complete design first. \nA design is not HTML; a design is done in Photoshop or a similar tool. It’s a bunch of images that show the entire look of the website. Before you start any form of coding, be sure to get the full design. \nStep 2: Do not let the developer determine the technology he wants to use. \nThe technology to be deployed is a business decision; it’s not a technical decision. Most technologies are interchangeable – what you can do in Ruby On Rails, you can do it in PHP. But from a business point of view, Ruby on Rails developers can be 5x more expensive and rare than PHP developers. \nSo look at how easy it will be to hire developers before picking your technology. \nStep 3: Understand the basics of infrastructure. \nFor example, you should be able to differentiate between hosting your product on a cloud service (like Amazon) versus having your own server. This is a semi-business decision and should not be decided by developers alone. \nStep 4: Evaluate developers based on the points they deliver. \nAsk them to list out all features in the software and assign them points. Points are usually based on time required to complete the tasks. Then watch how many points each developer delivers per week. Do not just let developers work. Plan. List out features and get estimates on when those features will be delivered. \nStep 5: Do not rewrite. \nEvery time you bring in a new developer, they will always say they want to rewrite. Mostly it’s because it’s hard to understand the old person’s code, not because their code will really be any better. If your platform runs, is stable and it’s just small fixes you need, and then don’t rewrite it. A rewrite will take far longer than you think and will be far more expensive and the output will be exactly the same as the original one. \nRead more on Markessien.com",

      "text": "Tenn. official resigns after Facebook post saying KKK ‘more American’ than Obama By Mark Hensch - 11/16/16 12:15 PM EST © Getty Images \nA Tennessee corrections official is no longer employed after he posted several incendiary Facebook messages about President Obama, according to a new report. \nDavid Barber offered his resignation on Wednesday after serving 17 years as Shelby County’s deputy director of corrections, CNN said . ADVERTISEMENT CNN reported backlash erupted against Barber when the public learned of several private Facebook posts he authored.\n“The KKK is more American than the illegal president,” he said in one, comparing Obama to the Ku Klux Klan. \n“If Trump wins and Obummer cannot start martial law, he will run to his new mansion in Arab world to hide,” Barber said in another, referencing Donald Trump Donald Trump Mexican government launches plan to protect immigrants Budowsky: Dems secret 2018 weapon Anti-Semitism for the sake of Israel in the era of Trump MORE , now the president-elect. \n“Hopefully the Muslims will eliminate him and Mooshell as queers,” he added, seemingly referring to first lady Michelle Obama Michelle Obama Tenn. official resigns after Facebook post saying KKK ‘more American’ than Obama W.Va. mayor resigns over Michelle Obama Facebook post School lunches, served with a side of scare tactics MORE . \nBarber wrote “arrest, convict, hang and confiscate all assets” in a third post alluding to the Obamas, according to CNN. \n“I am concerned that media using mixed race couples in ads as normal is one way liberals are trying to eliminate the white race,” he said in a fourth post. \nThe Shelby County Commission Chairman on Wednesday fiercely rejected Barber’s language. \n“We must put an end to the racist rhetoric in this country and come together,” Melvin Burgess said. \"It was not alright and was unacceptable to make racist statements supporting the Ku Klux Klan.” \nShelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell, meanwhile, said Tuesday that Barber seemingly did not violate county policy as the posts were on his private page. Shelby County is now examining whether it should create a social media policy. \n“Anyone in a leadership position at Shelby County government is held at a high standard of behavior, both on and off the job,” he told CNN’s local affiliate WREG. 1 day 1 Sanders named to Senate leadership...

Some say they need a break Some members of Facebook Nation are taking time after a contentions election.  //usat.ly/2fy8Nc1   A Facebook timeout? Some say they need a break Jon Swartz , USA TODAY 5:51 p.m. EST November 16, 2016 Ben Galbraith plans on staying away from Facebook until 2017. (Photo: Sakshi Verma, for USA TODAY) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Some members of Facebook Nation are taking time off from the social network, or leaving it outright, after a contentious election that has left nerves frayed and tempers short. \n“I need a breather for my personal sanity,” says Beth Swinson, 40, a stay-at-home mom of four in Charlotte, N.C., who voted for conservative third-party candidate Evan McMullin. Scathing comments from both sides and wide-scale misinformation left her \"angry and frustrated.\" She plans to take a month off from the social network. \n“None of it is positive. It’s exhausting, and the election seemed to last forever,” says Donald Trump supporter Lydia Fielder, 49, who manages a social-media platform for paper crafting in Austin. She’s unfollowed all but 50 of her 2,033 Facebook friends. \nLydia Fielder has unfollowed all but 50 of her 2,033 Facebook friends. (Photo: Lydia Fielder, for USA TODAY) \nBen Galbraith, a Google executive who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., has vowed to skip Facebook until 2017. \n\"I'm seeing lots of posts that fill me with anger and require several moments of conscious relaxation to prevent me from writing something that I’ll regret. I’m tired of expending so much mental and emotional energy,\" he says. \nIn interviews, Facebook users cited frustration and fatigue over vitriolic political comments from friends and acquaintances, compounded by fake news, news slants and conspiracy theories, as various reasons to take a break. \nAny hiatus by a cluster of politics-weary U.S. Facebook users isn't likely to do much to dent Facebook's massive and rapidly growing user base. Of the 1.79 billion users, 88% come from outside the U.S. A year ago, Facebook had 1.55 billion members and 1.35 billion two years ago. \nBut the anecdotes reflect how Facebook had become synonymous with the election, and how big a role social media played in determining its winners. President-elect Trump has credited Facebook and Twitter with helping him win races where his Democratic rival heavily outspent him. President Obama , a day before the election, blamed social media for deepening political divisions. \nBeth Swinson needs a break from Facebook for her \"personal sanity.\" (Photo: Beth Swinson, for USA TODAY) \nThe abrupt decision to turn off the social media spigot of news — 62% of U.S. adults get their news from it , says the Pew Research Center — as well other media that covered the polarizing election resembles reactions people have after a car crash or assault. \n“It’s almost like a trauma response,” says Dr. Suzanne Wallach, a psychotherapist in Los Angeles. “This election has prompted a level of denial in people. They feel traumatized and ostracized.” \nFacebook says 115.3 million members worldwide generated 716.3 million likes, posts, comments and shares just from election day, Nov. 8. By comparison, it took two weeks for the Summer Olympics to generate double that interaction, or 277 million people to post 1.5 billion likes, posts, comments and shares globally. \nThe election, the No. 1 topic of conversation on the social network last year, undoubtedly will be again this year, according to Facebook. \nThe campaign was all there in Facebook News Feeds every minute of every day for months, the frequently toxic tone a reminder that President-elect Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were among the least-popular candidates ever. \n\"Whether Facebook wants to accept it or not, it became as influential as a TV network or national newspaper,\" says Drew Margolin, a communication professor at Cornell University. \"It can't hide from the influence it has.\" \nFacebook says it does not keep data on unfriending and unfollowing, and it is unaware of any significant migration of members up to and during the presidential election. According to Pew Research, more than half of Facebook users, 53%, say that there is a mix of political views among the people in their networks. \nBut any diversity may have been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of like-minded posts. \nClinton supporters, who had expected a victory, were especially jolted. They say they were misled in their view of the election from the protective cocoon of their like-minded friends and cultural reinforcement. \n\"I’m realizing now that I was in a bubble — it was an utter shock to realize that so many people don’t share the ideals that were so prevalent in my Facebook feed and my real life social circle, of course,\" says Colleen Wickwire, 38, a marketing consultant in San Francisco. \"It felt like my entire worldview collapsed, and Facebook really contributed to that.\" \nJudi Rosenthal is signing off Facebook for a while. (Photo: Judi Rosenthal, for USA TODAY) \nWhether sports, politics or religion, members have aligned themselves with like-minded people friends, affirming their belief systems and views of the world. But when events collide with that protective view — as it did with Trump's win — it can be jarring and deflating. \nAfter five years of continuous use, Judi Rosenthal, a 44-year-old financial-services consultant in New York, is taking an extended break. \nOn Monday, Rosenthal posted: “I am signing off facebook for a little while because I really need to focus on my kids and my work. I need to reclaim all the time I have been spending on social media, so I can think of what I want to actually DO about my feelings for my country and the people I want to see served # nomorehate .” \nA proliferation of fake news contributed to polarized views of the world. In the weeks leading up to the election, it was a breeding ground for stories that were quickly fact-checked as wrong — but not before they were shared thousands of times. Among the most prominent: Pope Francis' endorsement of Trump. \nWith criticism mounting, Facebook and Google vowed to pull ads from fake news sites appearing on their platforms. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged such news may have influenced Trump’s win, though Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the notion as “crazy.” \nBacklash over Facebook's surfacing of fabricated news has sent shock waves through its Menlo Park, Calif., campus, prompting an insurgent task force to put an end to the practice. \n\"I do blame Facebook sand Twitter for this election outcome,\" says Wickwire. \"Trump spread his message through social, and what people see is all very one-sided.\" \nDessa Brennan has taken time off from Facebook several times the past few years. (Photo: Neil Gates, for USA TODAY) \nThere is a historical precedence for taking a breather. Just ask Carol King, 56, a book editor of London who supported Clinton from afar. \"I backed off Facebook during Brexit,\" she says. \nAll the name calling and cyberbullying during the most divisive of elections fed into what Obama, the first social media president, calls social media’s corrosive effect on people. \nQuitting Facebook is old hat for Dessa Brennan, who's ditched it several times the past few years. \n\"There is nothing wrong with finding a cohort of like-minded people and connecting and sharing with them, as Facebook enables,\" she says. \"However, when it comes to social and political issues, there is something very scary about only getting feedback from and exposure to people just like you.\" \nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.

(AP) — A Lancaster man who escaped from police and posted on Facebook while on the run has been sentenced to 10 years in prison after he was accused of committing sex crimes against a minor. The Herald of Rock Hill ( http://bit.ly/2fWNEsJ ) reports that 25-year-old Deqwon Blackmon pleaded guilty to assault and battery Tuesday in connection with a June 2014 charge of criminal sexual conduct toward a minor. While free on bond two years ago, police say Blackmon shot and injured three people during an August 2014 shooting near a Lancaster Waffle House . He was arrested, but escaped from loose handcuffs and posted to Facebook that he had to kiss his children. Blackmon was caught in his mother's home in September 2014 following a three-week manhunt. The shooting charges are still pending. ___ Information from: The Herald, http://www.heraldonline.com Latest News Video ",

Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates.

(AP) - When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a weekslong demonstration outside the governor's mansion and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective.

By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITIAssociated Press \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a weekslong demonstration outside the governor's mansion and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis.
