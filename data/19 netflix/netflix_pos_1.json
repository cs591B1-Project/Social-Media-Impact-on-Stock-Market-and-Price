      "text": "Netflix grabs award-winning doc “Bellas de Noche” November 8, 2016 - 18:27   Vying for a top award at the Los Cabos Int’l Film Festival’s Mexico First competition with her maiden docu-feature “Bellas de Noche” (“Beauties of the Night”), Maria Jose Cuevas comes with prizes and top festival berths already under her belt. \nAfter participating in Los Cabos’ Work in Progress program last year, her docu screened at the Ambulante and Telluride film fests after which Netflix snapped it up before it participated in Toronto, Variety reports. Exhibition grandee Cinepolis plans to release it in late November, after which it rolls out on Netflix, most likely in February. \nAt the Morelia Int’l Film Fest in October, “Bellas de Noche” won best documentary, the Premio Guerrero Press Award and best documentary by a woman, the latter an apt win given the subject matter of her docu: In “Bellas de Noche,” Cuevas explores the past and present lives of Mexico City’s showgirls, pop culture celebrities in the ‘70s and ‘80s. \nA graphic designer, photographer and video artist, Cuevas was about 10 years old when her father, a famous painter, took her to cabarets and into the dressing rooms of these showgirls. After meeting one of her docu subjects, Princess Yamal, 10 years ago, she was inspired to interview more of them and start researching for her docu, which she produced along with Cinepantera and Detalle Films. \n“The massive 1985 earthquake in Mexico City destroyed these cabarets, which were never rebuilt, so they are the last generation of these showgirls,” said Cuevas. She filmed some 180 hours of film, gaining the confidence and trust of her five subjects, one of whom, Lyn May, will attend Los Cabos. \n“Thanks to my privileged access to them, I feel I learned how to celebrate life; understand what gives life meaning and makes us alive,” she mused. She credits her sister, video artist Ximena Cuevas, for skillfully editing her doc. “She’s the only one who understood me completely and what direction I wanted to take,” she said. \nHer next docu will deal with something even closer to home: her father Jose Luis Cuevas whose young wife has isolated him from everyone, including his family. But that is just the takeoff point of her main theme, mental manipulation. \n“What I like are portraits of human beings; to explore the human condition, discover and understand it.” Related links:",

      "text": "Watch the official trailer for 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' \nLast time Gilmore Girls fans saw Rory and Lorelai, Rory was just beginning her exciting new career in journalism while Lorelai was rekindling her romance with Luke. However, when the upcoming Netflix revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , picks up eight years later, a lot has changed. Yes, Luke and Lorelai are still together, but let’s just say that Rory will no doubt have been affected by big changes in the journalism industry. \nLauren Graham and Alexis Bledel sat down with EW to discuss what their characters have been through — most importantly, of course, is losing Richard Gilmore, who was played by the late Edward Herrmann. The stars previewed Rory’s return to Stars Hollow, Emily as a widow, and Lorelai’s midlife crisis. Watch their interview above. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hits Netflix Friday, Nov. 25. ",

The pressings come courtesy of Austin-based memorabilia company Mondo , which has made a name for itself as a purveyor of gorgeous film posters, and increasingly has been licensing soundtracks for limited-run vinyl releases — the aforementioned Luke Cage soundtrack included. \nMore: Jessica Jones director to helm first two episodes of The Defenders on Netflix \nAll three of Marvel’s popular online TV series come with extremely pedigreed scores. The Luke Cage soundtrack was written by A Tribe Called Quest’s Ali Shaheed Muhammad and composer Adrian Younge, the Daredevil soundtrack was penned by John Paesano, and the Jessica Jones soundtrack won composer Sean Callery an Emmy award for the show’s jazzy main theme. Each show’s music is captivating in different ways, taking heavy sonic cues from the different demeanor of each subject hero. \nWhichever super sounds are your favorite, the packaging for both new releases fits the same style that appeared on the initial Luke Cage vinyl prints. Each double-LP sleeve opens up to reveal gorgeous full-sized artwork of the villain from each series — courtesy of one of Mondo artist Matthew Woodson, with the main character appearing on the front cover. Mondo \nBoth new releases will be available for purchase online starting Wednesday, November 9, and there will be a free special release event the same day at Brooklyn’s recently opened Alamo Draft House theater, complete with a live DJ set from Adrian Younge himself.",

More netflix: 50 Best Stand-Up Specials on Netflix \nThis special was filmed at The Wilbur Theatre in Boston, MA and you can watch the trailer to get a glimpse of what to expect in the full set below. \nYou’ll want to watch this to see Carvey joke about his family, including his teenage son who was a typical teenager when they were vacationing in Rome and he was grumpy they had to see one of the most beautiful and historic cities in the entire world. \nFrom kids and family to politics where Carvey breaks out his famous George W. Bush impression and doubles down with some riffs on Donald Trump. He even found time for a Bill Cosby impression and they are all so spot-on, it is uncanny! \nI was especially happy to hear his perspective on millennials and how he is perceived as a straight white male who is 60 years old. Check it out if you need a laugh because Carvey definitely delivers. Top Stories ",

Post to Facebook Watch 'A Year in the Life' by 'Gilmore Girls' rules 'The Gilmore Girls' revival hits Netflix early morning on Friday, Nov. 25. Read our guide on binge-watching the series — in true Gilmore style.  //on.cpsj.com/2fCTAEL   Watch 'A Year in the Life' by 'Gilmore Girls' rules x Share Lorelai, Rory, and the whole gang return to Stars Hollow for Netflix's new series 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.' NETFLIX Lauren Graham, left, and Alexis Bledel star in 'Gilmore Girls.' (Photo: ANDREW ECCLES/Warner Bros./Gannett file) \n​​ \nThe long-awaited \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" revival is almost here, after months of counting down and scouring the web for spoilers and on-set photos. It is a moment nine years in the making, and marks the return of show creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. \nSo, in the early hours of Friday, Nov. 25, when you can open Netflix finally and hit play, make sure to really revel in it with these Gilmore-inspired tips. \nConsider your wardrobe carefully. You want to look cute, of course, but also be comfortable in a \"hey, let-me-just-toss-on-these-cutoffs-and-this tie-dye-shirt-with-my-cowboy-boots-and-drive-you-to-Chilton'' way. Encouraged: A Bangles T-shirt or any other T-shirt Lane would envy. (Extra points for a vintage The Clash tee). Also good: Your favorite adorable mismatched jammies, a hat that makes you look fabulous or anything with Yale written on it. Banned: Nothing from Harvard, Talbot's or a Renaissance Festival. \nChoose your company wisely. Just as Rory always had Paris (or Lane) and Lorelai always had Sookie, it's worth it to watch with your BFF if at all possible. It's also best to watch with another die-hard fan. You don’t want to be catching someone up on everything they missed in \"Stars Hollow'' from 2000 and 2007. Or dealing with anyone who keeps asking why they talk so fast and why Kirk has so many jobs. And no one named T.J. or Digger allowed! \nYou will want to try to watch 'A Year in the Life' with your BFF, and please, do we even need to say it? No cell phones. (Photo: SCOTT HUMBERT, WARNER BROS) \nLoving you the way I do ... Please note: This is NO time for a first date, least of all a first date with your mother tagging along. In the eternal words of Rory Gilmore, this is meant to be simple, “Watch movie, eat junk, go to bed feeling sick. End of story.” \nPrepare a pre-party viewing soundtrack : Paul Anka, of course. The Bangles, see above. But also Joe Strummer, The Shins, XTC, Bjork and Carole King. (Extra credit for a Grant-Lee-Phillips hidden track). \nYes, eating is crucial . Maybe you’ll start watching early Friday morning over coffee and Pop-Tarts. Coffee, coffee, coffee. But you can’t watch this without massive amounts of junk food. Pizza, Chinese food or burgers from Luke’s are all good starting points. Maybe it's Thai take-out night at Al's Pancake World? Chocolate, jelly beans, cookie dough, ice cream, popcorn and spray cheese – and don’t forget the Red Vines! \nFood, and especially coffee, are vital to a 'Gilmore Girls' viewing experience. The show stars (from left) Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and Scott Patterson. (Photo: Warner Bros./Gannett file) \nGet situated. Squish around and make sure you’re comfortable, because there’s no squishing allowed once you start watching. If you have your very own Paul Anka, make sure he (or she) got a walk before you hit play. \nShhhh! OK, so you’re comfortable, you have enough snacks to see you through the weekend (or a night if you have the metabolism of a Gilmore). Lorelai and Rory would forbid any bathroom breaks during a classic like “Casablanca” or “Hardbodies,” but the four episodes of the reboot add up to a total of 360 minutes, or six hours, so everyone gets a pass on that rule. However, there is no talking once the movie begins. Unless you’re on your second viewing. Or the third viewing — just don’t talk through the parts you talked through before. \nMelissa McCarthy (center), shown here with Lauren Graham (left) and Alexis Bledel, played Sookie in the 'Gilmore Girls' TV series, which debuted in October 2000 on The WB network. It was a nail-biter, but Sookie is back for the Netflix reboot. (Photo: RICHARD CARTWRIGHT, RICHARD CARTWRIGHT, XXX THE WB) \nWe should not have to say this, but no cell phones. Luke will not have it, first of all, and unless there is a real urine-mint-awkward-date crisis to troubleshoot, there’s no answering the phone. That would disrupt the, um, flow. Definitely don’t answer the phone if Emily Gilmore is calling. Now, by 2016, the Gilmore women might have decided it’s permissible to text, but make sure those messages don’t contain any spoilers. \nCheers? We don't necessarily think of this as a drinking game. After all, we don't want any repeats of that lost weekend Rory spent during one of her breakups with Logan. But if you do plan to imbibe, consider drinking every time you get into a Dean-Jess-Logan fight on Twitter. Better yet, back away from the bottle and the phone. (Go, Jess!) \nKeep your tissues handy. Whatever the fate of our favorite girls, we already know that larger-than-life portrait of Richard Gilmore (the late Edward Herrmann) is going to do us in. \nPlan your exit strategy. As long as six hours of television is, it will end. This is not like when Lorelai broke her engagement to Max: It's actually going to hurt. You need to emotionally prepare for this ahead of time. And this may be the time to turn your cell phone back on and accept calls from the Miss Pattys, Babettes and especially Sookies in your own life. So, take a moment. Revisit the Red Vines. Or, hey, we won't judge ... go out for coffee and come back and watch again. \n'Wedding Bell Blues' (Episode #513) starred Kelly Bishop as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrmann as Richard Gilmore. Herrmann passed away on New Year's Eve 2014. He will be remembered in the new mini series. (Photo: Warner Bros./Gannett file) Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/2fCTAEL TOP VIDEOS",

      "title": "17 Times Luke From Gilmore Girls Was a Flawless Human Being",
      "text": "Happy Gilmore Month! On Nov. 25, our favorite mother-daughter duo returns in Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . To celebrate, we're counting down until the bingefest begins, revisiting the show's best moments, debating Rory's boyfriends, and going all-out Gilmore every day for 25 days. Here, 17 reasons why Luke Danes was the best. Ever.\nEverybody knows that Luke and Lorelai are one of the greatest love stories of our time – even people who are unfamiliar with Gilmore Girls know this essential fact to be true. But Luke Danes was way more than Lorelai Gilmore's happily ever after. If you look at the entire run of Gilmore Girls , Luke is basically the lynchpin of Stars Hollow, the town grouch with a secret heart of gold who can't resist helping out anyone in need.\n Here are 17 of Luke's most flawless moments throughout the show.\n1. When he made Lorelai a Santa burger.\nWARNER BROS. TELEVISION Because he knew she was sad after being \"uninvited\" from her parents' Christmas dinner, and she wanted something festive. Luke tried to play it off as no big deal but it clearly meant so much to Lorelai. HE HAS A HAT AND EVERYTHING.\n2. When he fixed everything.\nWARNER BROS. TELEVISION Everything. Always. No matter how small or how large. Every time something broke in the Gilmore household, Luke was there to fix it. When the house had a termite infestation that caused $15,000 of damage, Luke offered Lorelai a loan to cover it — she declined, but the offer in itself was comforting.\n3. When he showed up to Rory's graduation. And cried. Luke's devotion to Rory was one of his most endearing traits, and at her graduation from Chilton, it became clear once again just what a big softie he was. There wasn't a dry eye in the house during Rory's emotional speech — not even Luke could hold it together, because he really is a huge softie and loves Rory like a daughter. (In contrast to her actual father, who added the graduation to the long list of things he failed to show up for. Ugh, Christopher.)\n4. When he came through for Lorelai during Richard's hospital stay. Both times — once in season one, and again in season seven, even though Luke really hates hospitals. In season one, Richard collapses during Christmas dinner and Luke drives a freaked-out Lorelai to the hospital, keeps her and her whole family company, and is all-around the greatest. (He even has a really sweet bonding moment with Emily in this episode, which makes her behavior toward him in later seasons kind of weird.)\n In season seven, when Richard suffered an actual heart attack, Luke came through for the Gilmores again despite barely being on speaking terms with Lorelai at the time. Note the contrast to Lorelai's actual husband at the time, Christopher, who failed to show up because why break the habit of a lifetime? (Ugh, Christopher.)\n5. When he took Jess in.\nWARNER BROS. TELEVISION Jess acted like an ungrateful brat about being sent to live with Luke in Stars Hollow, but Luke stoically put up with his crap and gave him the firm, stable parental influence he was so desperately lacking. Despite his insecurity about being a surrogate parent, Luke was always pretty great at knowing how to handle a troubled kid like Jess, who sometimes needed validation, sometimes needed discipline, and sometimes just needed to be pushed into the goddamn lake .\n6. When he danced with Lorelai like this.\nALL OF THE FEELINGS.\n7. When he made coffee cake for Rory's birthday. Because he understands the importance of coffee in the Gilmore girls' lives. He also blew up balloons for her. To Quote: the birthday girl herself: \"Luke, you old softie.\"\n8. When he helped Kirk find his lost Easter eggs. Kirk is maybe secretly the most tragic character in Gilmore Girls , a fact that caught Luke's attention late in season four. At Taylor's behest, Kirk hid a bunch of Easter eggs around Stars Hollow but forgot to draw a map of their locations, which became a problem when the eggs started to rot. A dumb mistake, sure, but Kirk tried really hard to fix it and Taylor was really unnecessarily cruel to him about it — in front of Luke.\nKirk looked increasingly like a kicked puppy throughout this whole exchange, and Luke clearly felt bad for him. So later on, as a sleep-deprived Kirk staggered around town trying in vain to find the remaining 12 eggs, Luke came to his rescue, handed over the eggs, and told him to take credit for finding them. Kirk's screams of \"I LOVE YOU, LUKE DANES\" echo the entire audience in that moment. What. A. Sweetheart.\n9. When he promised Jess he'd always be there.\nWARNER BROS. TELEVISION In just three years, Jess changes more significantly than just about any other character on Gilmore Girls , and there's no way he could have matured into such a success story without Luke's influence. This heartwarming scene, in which Jess finally admits how grateful he is to Luke, emphasizes how much Jess has learned to be a better man from his uncle's example.\n 10. When he told Lorelai to just stand still…\nWARNER BROS. TELEVISION That. Kiss. Though.\n11. …And then went to take care of Kirk. Because even at this moment, when he was finally kissing Lorelai after four long seasons of waiting, Luke's still going to go where he's needed. In this case, he was needed to prevent a naked Kirk from terrorizing the entire town mid-night terror. Luke is basically Stars Hollow's honorary psychotherapist, at this point.\n12. When he kept the horoscope Lorelai wrote him the first day they met. During their first ever official date in season five, Lorelai tried to remember how she and Luke met — a day which Luke remembered very, very clearly. The very first time Lorelai burst into the diner, she made an impression by writing Luke a faux horoscope that said, \"You will meet an annoying woman today. Give her coffee and she will go away.\" Eight years later, Luke still had that horoscope in his wallet.\n13. When he gave Rory his mother's necklace. At Rory's 21st birthday party Luke gave her a gorgeous family heirloom, and though he tried to play it off like it was no big deal, she knew that it was. This gesture felt all the more meaningful because of the rift between Rory and Lorelai at the time — Luke brought the gift in part because he wasn't sure if Lorelai would bring one.\n14. When he went to Jess's open house at Truncheon Books. And told Jess he was proud of him, because you know Jess's deadbeat dad didn't bother to go all the way to Philly. Jess is surprised and touched that Luke showed up, because an indie bookstore featuring abstract sculptures and a performance space is not necessarily Luke's scene — but show up he did. (Admittedly he also brought April along, making the whole thing a little less enjoyable, but let's choose to ignore that.)\n15. When he ran to Lorelai's side no matter what. In season five, Luke and Lorelai went through a pretty ugly breakup, thanks to the unholy alliance of Emily and Christopher. Luke called it quits and Lorelai was a mess afterward, so desperate to get Luke back that she left him a tearful, totally out-of-character voicemail that immediately alarmed him.\nShe regretted the voicemail before she even finished leaving it, and ran over to Luke's house to try and steal the tape before he heard it — only to arrive home and discover him frantically breaking down her door because he was so worried. \"I was hurting, and I knew if I called you you'd come. I never should have done that,\" she said, promising to respect his wishes and keep her distance from now on. Here's the kicker: The reason Luke had to break her back door lock to get in was because he'd done such a good job of fixing her loose windows.\n 16. When he was willing to do anything to keep Rory in school. Rory dropping out of Yale was one of the worst things ever to happen in Gilmore Girls , and Luke knew it immediately. When Lorelai told him the news, he immediately leapt into action with a whole laundry list of imaginative plans for keeping Rory in school — everything from kidnapping her to camping outside her classes. \"She is not quitting school, this was her dream! I am not going to let this happen!\" he insisted, again demonstrating just how completely devoted a father figure he was. Lorelai then distracted him by proposing, so the plans kind of went on the back-burner, but the thought was there.\n17. When he quietly threw Rory the greatest going-away party.\nAnd stayed up all night to make the whole thing happen, while trying to keep his involvement a secret. Upon discovering this, Lorelai sought Luke out and kissed the hell out of him, which was absolutely the only reasonable thing to do at that point.\nFrom: ELLE\n Share Tweet Email",

      "title": "‘Stranger Things’ Director Confirms A Third Series Is Already Underway",
      "text": "  \n‘Stranger Things’ was definitely one of the most successful Netflix series of 2016, which is why the world was stoked to find out that they’re bringing out a second one . Featured Image VIA \nBut I don’t think anyone was quite expecting to hear the news that the third series is happening yet, let alone to find out that its makers have already started working on it. \nThat’s why we were pleasantly surprised to see that producer/director Shawn Levy has admitted that the team is already prepping for the third instalment as they ‘don’t like to rush things.’ He said: \nWe are not gonna be caught off guard and we don’t wanna be making stuff up like the day before we have to write it and make it. \nWe are definitely optimistic and we have started thinking ahead. Image VIA \nTo be fair, I think that this is a smart idea. Perhaps he learned from the mistake of ‘True Detective’. That show saw wide success and yet, the second series was a bit of a let down. \nHBO’s President of Programming Michael Lombardo said that he was to blame for this atrocity, as he asked for the series to be delivered in a very short time frame. This in turn caused Nic Pizzolatto to rush the script, resulting in an average second season. Looks like Levy is not going to make the same mistake with ‘Stranger Things’ – we can’t wait to see the result. \nIn the meantime, to make your own ‘Stranger Things’ logo, click HERE .",

      "text": "\nPhoto via Netflix Peter Morgan's gorgeous period epic is just the starting line. \nNetflix recently premiered its latest original, the ambitious, expensive period drama The Crown . Created by Peter Morgan ( The Queen , Frost/Nixon ), The Crown follows the life of Queen Elizabeth II (Claire Foy), from her wedding in 1947 up through the present. The cast also includes Doctor Who ’s Matt Smith as Prince Phillip, Mad Men ’s Jared Harris as King George VI, and John Lithgow as Winston Churchill. The Crown is sumptuous, addictive, and bingeworthy, just as we’ve come to expect from Netflix’s best. \nBut it’s only 10 episodes long. It will leave you wanting more. And since it’ll be at least a year before a hypothetical second season, we’ve scoured the streaming landscape to find some other royal-related programming to soothe your Crown withdrawals. Here are five shows about royalty to binge after The Crown . 1) Blackadder (1983 - 1989) Netflix’s The Crown and most of the other entries on this list tend to take themselves pretty seriously—much like most royals themselves. Blackadder , however... takes a different approach. \nCreated by Richard Curtis ( Love Actually ) and starring Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean himself), Blackadder follows the history of the ignominious Blackadder clan down through centuries of British history. Each season focuses on a different generation’s Blackadder, all played by Atkinson, as the family’s fortunes fall from royalty to servanthood to eventual service in the first World War. \nThe first season is set in the Middle Ages, with the cowardly Duke of Edinburgh constantly scheming to gain power and avoid personal responsibility, all while adopting the nickname “The Black Adder”—which is far more intimidating than he deserves. It’s worth watching for Brian Blessed’s performance as King Richard IV, and it sets up the template for everything that will come after: Blackadder is a cowardly but clever narcissist, always accompanied by the good-hearted dullard Baldrick (Tony Robinson), and together they scheme for great things that rarely seem to work out. \nThe show really found its stride in the second season, set during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. This and all the following seasons let Atkinson play a slightly more charismatic version of his antihero, and unleash the full fury of his withering British condescension and acrobatic dialogue. \nAll four seasons are available streaming on Hulu , although this doesn’t include the specials such as Blackadder’s Christmas Carol . 2) The Tudors (2007 - 2010) If anyone could challenge Lord Blackadder for sheer arrogance and self-involvement, it would have to be King Henry VIII. Over the course of four seasons, Showtime’s The Tudors tracks the early years of Henry’s reign, back when he was still spry and before he ballooned into the portrait-filling form we all know from the history books. Jonathan Rhys Meyers chews every bit of available scenery as the lusty, arrogant Henry, a role that earned him a Golden Globe nomination.\nThe Tudors was created by Michael Hirst, a veteran English screenwriter with a knack for historical drama in particular. In addition to The Tudors , his resume includes the 1998 film Elizabeth , starring Cate Blanchett, and its 2007 sequel, The Golden Age . He also created the hit History Channel drama Vikings . In addition to Meyers, the Tudors cast includes a revolving door of familiar faces, including Peter O’Toole, Max von Sydow, Henry Cavill ( Man of Steel ), and Natalie Dormer ( Game of Thrones ). \nThe Tudors is a heady mix of costume drama and soap opera, with Henry’s selfish whims and changes of mood often betraying even those closest to him, and infamously sending several of his six wives toward poor ends. The Tudors is addictive, enthralling, and visually gorgeous. \nYou can stream all four seasons on Netflix Instant , or on Amazon Prime or Hulu with a Showtime add-on subscription. 3) The White Queen (2013) Starz built its original content empire on the success of Spartacus: Blood & Sand , and has continued to produce ambitious period epics like Black Sails and Outlander . One historical show that most likely flew below your radar, however, was 2013’s The White Queen . Set during the 15th century “War of the Roses,” The White Queen follows the machinations of three powerful women as they attempt to maneuver through a bitter and violent war for the throne that has pit the House of York against the House of Lancaster.\nThe women in question are Elizabeth Woodville (Rebecca Ferguson), consort to Edward IV of England; Margaret Beaufort (Amanda Hale) of the House of Lancaster; and Anne Neville (Faye Marsay), queen consort to Richard III. The White Queen is based Philippa Gregory’s series of historical novels, which began in 2009’s book of the same name. Woodville, Beaufort, and Neville were the protagonists of each of the first three books in the series, respectively, but the show merges material from the books into one 10-episode series. \nThe White Queen is perfect for binging, and since Margaret Beaufort was the grandmother of Henry VIII, you could even watch it as a sort of “prequel” before diving into The Tudors . And if the show leaves you craving more, there’s good news: Philippa Gregory confirmed earlier this year that Starz had greenlit a sequel series based on her 2013 novel The White Princess . \nYou can watch The White Queen on Amazon Prime . 4) Reign (2013 - present) If you like your royal drama to skew a bit more CW than BBC, there’s always Reign . Created by Laurie McCarthy ( Ghost Whisperer ) and Stephanie SenGupta ( The Good Wife ), Reign has aired three seasons on the CW, and is set to return for a fourth sometime in 2017. The show follows the life of Mary, Queen of Scots...with some liberties taken. The show begins in 1557, exploring Mary’s (Adelaide Kane) years spent in the court of France, where she was betrothed to marry Prince Francis.\nThis is a CW show, so expect lots of melodrama among young, ridiculously pretty people... although The Tudors has plenty of that, too, so we can’t take too many cheap shots at Reign ’s CW heritage. Although we are going to take a moment to chuckle about the fact that the show’s theme song is by the Lumineers, because of course it is. \nCritics have needled the show for its lack of historical accuracy, but let’s be honest: This is the CW, not PBS. If you’re in the mood for a campy, melodramatic period soap opera full of sex, scandal, and gorgeous costuming, Reign may well scratch your itch. This is a show that pissed off the Parents Television Council for having a character masturbate in a stairwell, so that’s worth some bonus points in and of itself. \nYou can watch Reign streaming on Netflix Instant . 5) The Royals (2015 - present) If we’re judging Reign by its network, it’s only fair to point out that The Royals is the first scripted series created by E!, a network built on celebrities behaving badly. Expect it to wear its over-the-top soap opera shenanigans with pride. Created by Mark Schwahn ( One Tree Hill ), The Royals abandons the days of yesteryear to follow a fictional group of modern monarchs as they navigate political rivalries, sex scandals, and paparazzi.\nElizabeth Hurley stars as Queen Helena Henstridge, wife of King Simon. Their eldest son Robert is heir to the throne, leaving Simon and Helena’s younger offspring, the twins Liam and Eleanor, to enjoy all the perks of being royalty without actually having to worry about the eventual weight of a crown. Except then Robert is killed—possibly in suspicious circumstances—and Liam is suddenly faced with the reality that his future may be very different than what he expected. Also in the mix is Simon’s brother, Cyrus, who has his own machinations in play. \nThe Royals has aired two seasons on E!, and the network picked it up for a third earlier this year. In the meantime, you can watch the show’s full run on Amazon Prime . ",

      "text": "Netflix is bringing Stars Hollow to life with a very special “Gilmore Girls” festival If you’re in the process of packing your bags right now, keep packing. You’ve got to hop on a flight ASAP and make your way to sunny California immediately. Next weekend, Netflix is throwing their own Gilmore Girls festival and turning UCLA’s campus into Stars Hollow for two days, and two days only. There will be Luke’s coffee, twinkling lights, and most importantly, A GAZEBO.\n~The Festival of Four Seasons~ will take place at UCLA’s Dickson Court, and Netflix is sparing no expense when it comes to making Stars Hollow an IRL thing for us . Netflix also promises us there will be a GIANT BANNER, which is a must. And that Luke’s Coffee? It’ll be FREE. FREE LUKE’S COFFEE !\nWhat have we done to deserve this Gilmore Girls treat from Netflix?! Here’s exactly what’s happening: Netflix Now here’s the fine print: It’s happening at UCLA, and only UCLA. Also, you have to RSVP for the event, and you can do so right here . Once inside Stars Hollow, you will only have 45 minutes to poke around, so don’t expect this to be a full day thing, because we’ve got to make sure EVERYONE gets to experience this, you know? It’s also first come, first serve, so know you might be waiting a while and you might not get in, but Netflix will surely try their hardest to make sure all Stars Hollow enthusiasts get to check it out.\n…it also sounds like some real-life Stars Hollow residents will show up, so show up and show up EARLY. You can read all about the event over on Stars Hollow’s website (didn’t know Stars Hollow had a website, huh?). See you guys at the Gazebo!!\nThe post Netflix is bringing Stars Hollow to life with a very special “Gilmore Girls” festival appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "‘225’: Louisiana teen actors make splash in new Netflix shows Daily Report Staff November 11, 2016 \nIn recent years, the Baton Rouge-based Gaudet’s Young Screen Actors studio has churned out a number of young actors who are landing life-changing roles. \n225 recently spoke to two of the actors—Peyton Wich and Toby Nichols—about how they ended up on major Netflix shows, and how the Gaudet Young Screen Actors studio prepared them for their roles. \nWich, a 13-year-old New Orleans native, landed the role of Troy, the school bully of the Netflix smash hit Stranger Things . Nichols, a 14-year-old St. Francisville native and Young Artist Award winner, stars as young Daniel Rand in Marvel’s upcoming Netflix show Iron Fist . \n“Miss Debby (Gaudet) is so amazing. I’ve learned so much being in her studio for about a year and a half. It’s a feeling of family there. Everyone is close. Acting-wise, I feel like she really helped me in terms of improving and then being able to land the role of Troy,” Wich tells 225 . \nThe young actor says the first role he booked was a 2014 movie in called Impact Earth , which filmed in Biloxi but was never released. \nNichols has been cast in Iron Fist , a new show being released on Netflix in March 2017. \n“Well, when you go to audition, you don’t know you’re going for something for Marvel. It’s very secretive, and it seems like it’s a regular audition,” Nichols says. “After you do it, they’ll let you know that it’s Marvel, and they give you the real script. I did a couple auditions and got the role. I was really, really extremely excited after I found out I got cast as Daniel.”",

      "text": "Drafthouse Films/\"The Act of Killing\" \nOne of the great things about Netflix is that it has brought thoughtful, compelling documentaries to a much wider audience that filmmakers could only dream of a decade ago.\nAnd with binge-worthy titles like “Making a Murderer” and the vast ESPN “30 for 30” library being just a click away, you can get a lot of great nonfiction viewing any night of the week. You'll learn a lot more about the world, but don't worry — you'll also be entertained.\nHere are 23 documentaries we think you should stream right away on Netflix: \n1. \"13th\" Netflix \nDirector Ava DuVernay looks at the history of the American prison system and shows how it relates to the nation's history of racial inequality.\n\n\n2. “30 for 30” ESPN movies ESPN \nPretty much any “30 for 30” title is worth your time. The documentaries that highlight moments in sports that you may or may not be aware of are both entertaining and filled with emotion. A few we highly recommend: “No Crossover: The Tale of Allen Iverson”; “June 17th, 1994,” which looks at everything that happened in the world of sports at the time of O.J. Simpson's Bronco chase; “I Hate Christian Laettner”; and likely available in 2017 will be ESPN’s new masterwork, \"O.J.: Made in America.\"\n\n\n3. “The Act of Killing” Drafthouse Films/\"The Act of Killing\" \nJoshua Oppenheimer’s Oscar-nominated doc looks at the Indonesian genocide by having death-squad leaders reenact their mass killings. The results are both comical and heart-wrenching. \n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "print \nDrafthouse Films/\"The Act of Killing\" \nOne of the great things about Netflix is that it has brought thoughtful, compelling documentaries to a much wider audience that filmmakers could only dream of a decade ago. \nAnd with binge-worthy titles like “Making a Murderer” and the vast ESPN “30 for 30” library being just a click away, you can get a lot of great nonfiction viewing any night of the week. You'll learn a lot more about the world, but don't worry — you'll also be entertained. \nHere are 23 documentaries we think you should stream right away on Netflix: 1. \"13th\" Netflix \nDirector Ava DuVernay looks at the history of the American prison system and shows how it relates to the nation's history of racial inequality. 2. “30 for 30” ESPN movies ESPN \nPretty much any “30 for 30” title is worth your time. The documentaries that highlight moments in sports that you may or may not be aware of are both entertaining and filled with emotion. A few we highly recommend: “No Crossover: The Tale of Allen Iverson”; “June 17th, 1994,” which looks at everything that happened in the world of sports at the time of O.J. Simpson's Bronco chase; “I Hate Christian Laettner”; and likely available in 2017 will be ESPN’s new masterwork, \"O.J.: Made in America.\" 3. “The Act of Killing” Drafthouse Films/\"The Act of Killing\" \nJoshua Oppenheimer’s Oscar-nominated doc looks at the Indonesian genocide by having death-squad leaders reenact their mass killings. The results are both comical and heart-wrenching. 4. \"Amanda Knox\" Amanda Knox Netflix \nThe murder trial of American exchange student Amanda Knox (now free) in Italy captivated the world in the early 2000s. Now this Netflix original looks back at the case and gets the perspective of Knox and others closely involved. 5. “Blackfish” Magnolia Pictures \nWhy is Sea World going to end killer-whale shows? It’s because of this incredible movie that looks at the abuse these magnificent creatures have endured for decades. 6. “Cocaine Cowboys” Magnolia Pictures \nIn the late 1980s, cocaine invaded Miami and the world has never been the same. This documentary looks at the blood-soaked era and the people who were responsible. 7. “Food, Inc.” Magnolia Pictures \nThis powerful look at how the food we put into our mouths is really produced is shocking and scary. You’ll probably want to change your eating habits after watching it. 8. “Hell and Back Again” New Video \nThere has been no more honest look at what it feels like to be a solider who has come home from war than this visually stunning work by director Danfund Dennis. 9. “Indie Game: The Movie” Cinedigm \nThere’s a world of gamers outside of those who play “Call of Duty” and the “Madden” NFL games. Here we look at the creators behind indie games and the struggles they go through to make work that’s different but also profitable. 10. \"Into the Inferno\" Netflix \nDirector Werner Herzog travels to the corners of the world (including North Korea) to examine the beauty and danger of active volcanoes. 11. \"Janis: Little Girl Blue\" Jess Mills/FilmRise \nThe legendary singer Janis Joplin is examined with help from the many letters she wrote over her sudden rise to fame. 12. “Killing Them Safely” Courtesy of Nick Berardini \nA movie that gets more topical as the months pass, director Nick Berardini's doc examines the excessive use of the TAZER gun by US police. 13. “Last Days in Vietnam” PBS \nThis Oscar-nominated doc by director Rory Kennedy looks at the final weeks of the Vietnam War and the exodus of Saigon by not just American soldiers and diplomats, but the South Vietnamese who helped the US during the war. 14. \"Life Itself\" Magnolia/Life Itself trailer \nSteve James gives a touching look at the life and work of film critic Roger Ebert as well as capturing his final months alive. 15. “Lost in La Mancha” IFC Films/\"Lost in La Mancha\" \nTerry Gilliam’s doomed attempt to make “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote” makes for an incredible all-access look at filmmaking at its most chaotic. 16. “Making a Murderer” Netflix \nThis true-crime tale about the murder case of Steven Avery became an instant Netflix binge when it hit the streaming service. Filmed over a 10-year period, it will no doubt prompt your own theory about what's really true. 17. \"Man on Wire\" Magnolia Pictures \nWinner of the best documentary Oscar in 2009, it gives a powerful retelling of Philippe Petit's illegal high-wire walk across the Twin Towers in 1974. 18. \"What Happened Miss Simone?\" Netflix \nThis Oscar-nominated doc by Liz Garbus looks at the powerful career of Nina Simone, who went from chart-topping singer to rights activist. 19. “The Overnighters” Drafthouse Films \nJesse Moss explores the modern-day gold rush: Men desperate for work who head to the North Dakota oil fields to find it. Many come with just the clothes on their backs and troubled pasts. A local pastor is the only one who will take them in, but he has demons of his own. 20. “Room 237” YouTube/havas79 \nYou think you know everything about Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining”? Once you see this incredible look at almost every theory that’s been devised about the movie, you’ll sing a different tune — and appreciate the original masterpiece even more. 21. \"Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine\" Magnolia Pictures \nIf the biopic \"Steve Jobs\" didn't give you the insight you wanted, give this Alex Gibney doc a try. Gibney uses archival footage and interviews with those who knew Jobs best to examine his life (which was in many ways his work). 22. \"Super Size Me\" Roadside Attractions \nMorgan Spurlock's directorial debut that looks at the dangers of fast food, in which he eats only McDonald's for a month, didn't just make him an instant star. It also caused the fast-food chain to eliminate its supersize menu. 23. “The Thin Blue Line” The Criterion Collection \nBefore “The Jinx” and “Making a Murderer,” there was Errol Morris’ groundbreaking investigation of a man wrongly convicted for the murder of a police officer in Texas. The new findings in the movie led to the release of the man. Still want more? Here are others to check out: \"Biggie and Tupac.\" Roxy Releasing \n“Biggie and Tupac” — A look back at the East Coast/West Coast hip-hop rivalry that resulted in the deaths of two icons. \n“Happy Valley” — A look inside the crumbling of the Penn State football program and the legacy of head coach Joe Paterno following the child sexual-abuse charges against a former assistant coach. \n“The Hunting Ground” — An emotionally powerful account of rape crimes on US campuses and the despicable cover-ups that take place so the schools can save face. \n“Kumaré” — Before becoming a Vice correspondent, Vikram Gandhi made this documentary in which he impersonates an Indian Guru and builds a following in Arizona. The reveal at the end is something the best screenwriter couldn’t come up with. \n“Meet the Patels” — Actor Ravi Patel is through with the “American” way of finding a wife, so he turns to his family who put him through the traditional Indian way. \n“The Wolfpack” — Confined to their apartment for most of their childhood, six brothers learn everything they know about the outside world through the movies they watch and then reenact with homemade costumes.",

      "text": "\nWhether you are in the mood for a comedy, a riveting story, an action-packed adventure, or you want to be terrified, some of the best movies on Netflix can be found to fit your mood. The titles featured on this list are highly-rated by both audiences and critics alike, and they are some of the best movies on Netflix. Some of the films listed are well known to longtime Netflix subscribers, while others are often overlooked or are newer additions.\nThe Best Dramatic Movies on Netflix Spotlight \nThis Best Picture Oscar winner is based on a powerful true story.\nPulp Fiction \nCoalescing drama, comedy, and action, this Quentin Tarantino classic remains one of the most popular movies on Netflix.\nThe Usual Suspects \nKevin Spacey is in top form in the movie that stated, “The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist.”\nThe Guest \nThis film offers a dramatic story while delivering plenty of action and suspense.\nReservoir Dogs \nAnother Tarantino classic, Reservoir Dogs put the creative director on the map!\nThe Big Short \nThough the story it is based on is anything but funny, this drama provides plenty of wit.\nNo Country for Old Men \nTommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, And Woody Harrelson blew audiences away in this Coen brother’s masterpiece.\nQuiz Show \nBased on the true story of the rigged game show Twenty One , John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes deliver stellar performances.\nBarton Fink \nAnother picture featuring the work of the Coen brothers and John Turturro, the film co-stars John Goodman and it is one of the most overlooked movies on Netflix.\nThere Will Be Blood \nThis is the perfect film for those in the mood for a slow-paced drama, and it is often referred to as a masterpiece.\nThe Imitation Game \nBased on a true story, The Imitation Game plays both as a political-thriller and a powerful drama.\nNightcrawler \nAs disturbing as it is spellbinding, this dramatic-suspense flick is one of Jake Gyllenhaal’s best movies.\nSling Blade \nThe Washington Post describes why Sling Blade is one of the best movies on Netflix .\n“Like the eloquent, darkly funny dialogue, the film’s characters, setting and cadences draw us into its world, with all its terrors and tenderness. What emerges is a masterpiece of Southern storytelling that draws a sharp line between good and evil.”\n[Image by Miramax Films] The Best Comedies on Netflix Swingers \nSwingers is as warm as it is funny, and it was the launching pad for the careers of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn.\nBernie \nAlthough this movie is highly acclaimed by critics, it remains one of the most overlooked movies on Netflix.\nMoonrise Kingdom \nThis is one of Wes Anderson’s best movies, and considering his long list of hits, that’s saying a lot.\nFerris Bueller’s Day Off \nThis is the ’80s film that captured the adventurous spirit of being young and having fun.\n[Image by Paramount Pictures] St. Vincent \nThis Bill Murray movie provides plenty of laughs, sentimental emotions, and the end is likely to not leave a dry eye in the house.\nThe Princess Bride \nFor the same reason it was adored so much upon its release, The Princess Bride remains one of the most popular movies on Netflix. This is the movie that tells the story of adventure, ridiculous comedy, and of course, true love.\nIn the Loop \nIf you’re tired of politics then perhaps a satire poking fun at bureaucracy is the answer for you. This laugh-out-loud comedy features the late James Gandolfini, and it is surprisingly refreshing for a movie centered on two major governments.\nMother \nAlbert Brooks plays a twice-divorced man who moves back in with his mother (Debbie Reynolds) to get to the root of his issues. This is the type of comedy you laugh at because you relate to it, rather than slapstick punch lines.\nBig Trouble in Little China \nIn one of the best action-comedies of the ’80s, this John Carpenter classic is truly unique.\nSixteen Candles \nNetflix offers some of the best movies from the ’80s, but this one stands out because it features The Brat Pack. Molly Ringwald is absolutely charming in this sweet and funny movie.\nThe Best Horror Movies On Netflix Nothing new to see here folks; unlike other categories that Netflix has to offer, they lack a great selection of high-quality horror movies. But the old fodder listed below is some of the best of the genre, and the films may be unknown to newer subscribers. They are all highly regarded by critics and audiences, and many are worth revisiting.\nJaws \nThis Steven Spielberg classic remains one of the most terrifying movies to feature a shark.\nHush \nThis cat-and-mouse thriller will leave audiences on the edge of their seat. With a score of 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, Hush remains the highest rated horror movie on Netflix .\nHousebound \nRegarded as one of the best comedy-horror movies of 2014, Housebound will make you laugh while terrifying you often at the same time.\nCreep \nThe “found footage” subgenre of horror movies are often overdone and generic, but this one found a way to make it unique again.\nI Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House \nIn one of the newest additions to Netflix original movies, this ghost story is more of a drama with elements of horror.\nWes Craven’s New Nightmare \nThough some didn’t like Freddy Krueger’s new look, almost everyone enjoyed this addition to the horror franchise.\nThe Den \nUsing only the view from computer screens, this unique horror story is very suspenseful.\nOTHER NETFLIX ARTICLES FROM THE INQUISITR \nBest Horror Movies On Netflix: Review Of ‘I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives In The House’ \nNetflix Movies: Review Of ‘True Memoirs Of An International Assassin’ \nThe Top 10 Best, Highly Rated Thriller And Horror Movies On Netflix \nThe 20 Best Movies On Netflix To Watch After A Long Day At Work \nFrom Spotlight to The Den , some of the best movies are on Netflix.\n[Featured Image by Open Road Films]\nThe Best Movies On Netflix—The Dramatic, The Hilarious, And The Horrifying [Trailers] is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "For those who prefer Redbox over Netflix, and have wondered just what the inside of a machine looks like, these pictures should provide a clue. Basically, the discs are all commercially-pressed discs placed in plastic sleeves, which are then loaded into a multi-tiered rotating carousel by a human operator. When a disc is selected, the carousel rotates to the right position, and a robot arm moves up or down to transport it to the dispensing slot. Just before the disc is pushed out the slot, the QR code is read to make sure it's the correct one. Continue reading for more interesting pictures from around the web.\n",

      "text": "SPOILERS BELOW.\nNetflix\nThe \"San Junipero\" episode of \"Black Mirror\" has been hailed as brilliant and one of the few in the series with an optimistic vision of the future . (Again: major spoiler warning).\nThe series, now produced by Netflix, presents science-fiction short films about how tech could change the world in the near future.\n\"San Junipero\" imagines a world where people can upload their brains into computers. Old people can live out fantasies in the virtual reality city of San Junipero. Dying people can be \"uploaded to the cloud\" and live there forever.\nFuturist Robin Hanson, who wrote extensively about uploaded brains in \" Age of Ems ,\" saw the episode and wasn’t impressed.\n\"As usual, it misses the huge implications to focus on minor ones,\" Hanson wrote in a message.\nHanson, an associate professor of economics at George Mason University who has a background in physics and computer science, predicts that we’ll be able to upload brains within 100 years and that we'll have extensive virtual reality, so he thinks the show is believable there.\n\"The unrealism is in assuming the rest of the world stays the same, only effect is a new form of retirement,\" Hanson writes.\nThe rest of the world doesn’t seem to have changed much in \"San Junipero\"— at least the parts that we see.\nHanson’s prediction, by contrast, sees whole brain emulations (aka ems) radically and rapidly changing human society.

      "text": "SPOILERS BELOW.\nNetflix \nThe \"San Junipero\" episode of \"Black Mirror\" has been hailed as brilliant and one of the few in the series with an optimistic vision of the future . (Again: major spoiler warning).\nThe series, now produced by Netflix, presents science-fiction short films about how tech could change the world in the near future.\n\"San Junipero\" imagines a world where people can upload their brains into computers. Old people can live out fantasies in the virtual reality city of San Junipero. Dying people can be \"uploaded to the cloud\" and live there forever.\nFuturist Robin Hanson, who wrote extensively about uploaded brains in \" Age of Ems ,\" saw the episode and wasn’t impressed.\n\"As usual, it misses the huge implications to focus on minor ones,\" Hanson wrote in a message.\nHanson, an associate professor of economics at George Mason University who has a background in physics and computer science, predicts that we’ll be able to upload brains within 100 years and that we'll have extensive virtual reality, so he thinks the show is believable there.\n\"The unrealism is in assuming the rest of the world stays the same, only effect is a new form of retirement,\" Hanson writes.\nThe rest of the world doesn’t seem to have changed much in \"San Junipero\"— at least the parts that we see.\nHanson’s prediction, by contrast, sees whole brain emulations (aka ems) radically and rapidly changing human society. Once brains can be uploaded to computers, he argues, we'll make countless copies of the most effective brains, running them at a thousand times human speed: soon ems will take over almost every job on the planet, while also building their own super-dense cities and evolving their own strange civilization. For more on Hanson’s vision, read our interview with him .\nThat is, of course, a pretty dramatic vision of change in the next century, but Hanson is not alone in predicting that radical changes will follow the next major breakthrough in compu ting (whether that's human-level AI or brain uploading).\nWhile\"San Junipero\" doesn’t reveal much about the broader world, there’s not much evidence of radical social change.

      "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. , Nov.   With the return of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Netflix is giving mothers and daughters another way to bond. A recent survey revealed more than half of women (53%) wish they spoke to their mother more often.  On November 25 , fans all over the world can reconnect through the mother of all TV shows...because even reading this release will make you realize how much you want to call your mom.\nMore than half of mother-daughter duos surveyed (59%) report that post-show discussions are the best part of sharing a show together. In fact, watching together is so important that despite the distance, almost half of moms and daughters (41%) think watching together brings them closer. Even though one third of moms and daughters surveyed live thirty or more minutes apart, over half have gone out of their way to physically watch together on many occasions.\nContinue Reading\nDate Night with Mom. The ultimate mother-daughter pair, Rory and Lorelai, know the benefits of sharing show-inspired inside jokes and witty one-liners. Whether you and mom are die-hard fans or looking for your next binge together, Netflix is letting you send an invite for Date Night with Mom .\nNo matter what kind of mother-daughter relationship it is, Gilmore has something for you. The survey found that globally, almost equal portions of mother-daughter relationships fall into the following three groups:\n39% of respondents say they're two peas in a pod, and are BFFs like Rory and Lorelai . 31% say they may be polar opposites like  Lane and Mrs. Kim , but they just want what's best for each other. 30% know it can be complicated like Lorelai and Emily , but they can't imagine life without each other.

      "title": "The ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival is far from perfect. Luckily for Netflix, fans won’t care",
      "text": "Let's cut right to the chase, \"Gilmore Girls\" fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favourite supporting characters. The bad news: It's not perfect. It's actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plot lines start to drag — and characters' flaws go from endearing to irritating.\nThe best news: Fans won't care. Because \"Gilmore Girls\" is back.\nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like \"Gilmore Girls,\" which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn't reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the \"real\" ending.\nAs someone who has rewatched \"Gilmore Girls\" more times than I care to admit, hitting \"play\" on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of \"Gilmore Girls\" is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cosy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series?\nI'll be honest — it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements.\nBut here's what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right.\nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming \"Gilmore\" world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year.\nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory — the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent — she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign.\nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launch pad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series, it doesn't come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (\"I heard. You should become a blacksmith,\" Lorelai deadpans), although she's clearly terrified about her future.\nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist's office. She's not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She's also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soulmate, aren't all smooth sailing — even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss.\nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai's father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years.\nShe's devastated, but still, she's Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: \"Luke.\" Luke: \"Yes?\" Emily: \"That was just my way of saying goodbye.\") And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there's a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016.\nIn the years since \"Gilmore Girls\" went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show's lack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory's best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same — and there's a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture.\n\"Body shaming! Trigger warnings!\" Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she's eating tacos before a full dinner. \"War on Christmas!\"\nOne of the downsides of rewatching your favourite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women rewatch \"Gilmore Girls\" and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time — and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying.\nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it's all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices.\nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting.\nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don't necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow's typically terrible stage productions, there's enough time to stretch it out for much longer.\nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can't get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller's (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane's band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris.\nThat's the one benefit of a \"Gilmore Girls\" minimovie — with extended time and producers' creative freedom, it's a veritable buffet of every \"Gilmore\" experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that's all the fans really care about, anyway.",

      "text": "Netflix and Neil Patrick Harris's A Series of Unfortunate Events trailer is everything we'd hoped it'd be and more. Basically a cross between The Royal Tenenbaums and Edward Scissorhands, the delightfully grim adaptation of the Lemony Snicket book is bound to become your next Netflix obsession. Neil Patrick Harris wears many faces - all of them creepy as hell! - as Count Olaf, the schemer who's bent on stealing the orphaned Baudelaire children's fortune. Related: Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events gets a Netflix launch date - AND a first-look teaser True Blood writer Mark Hudis's gorgeous adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events has a sensationally quirky cast - with Catherine O'Hara, Joan Cusack and Alfre Woodard all popping up in the teaser. Let's not forget Seinfeld and The Tick's Patrick Warburton as the series' way-too-aloof narrator Lemony Snicket, a pseudonym for the author Daniel Handler. Of course, Neil Patrick Harris steals the show as the devilish Count Olaf - a wealthy manipulator willing to say or do absolutely anything to achieve his greedy goals. Sound familiar? Harris has some big shoes to fill since Jim Carrey gloriously brought the evil Count Olaf to life in the original 2004 live-action movie Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. The telly version of A Series of Unfortunate Events will finally arrive on Netflix on January 13, 2017. That's Friday the 13th - a very appropriate date if we do say so ourselves!

      "text": "'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life': Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel bring 'more' to Netflix series Kelly Bishop, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Latest News , Last Updated: 2:58 PM ET \nWhat does football have to do with the return of Gilmore Girls ? \nA number of years ago, a friend of mine was telling me that he was going to attend a U.S. college football game, taking place in one of those picturesque American college towns. And he was bringing his wife with him. \nI didn't know his wife was a football fan. He said she wasn't necessarily a football fan, but he explained the attraction. \n“She just loves that certain slice of Americana,” my friend explained. “You know, Gilmore Girls Americana.” \nGot it. Bingo. I knew exactly what he meant. \nI relayed that exact story to Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, stars of the original series as well as the new four-part project Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , which debuts Friday, Nov. 25, on Netflix. \n“Is that the small-town experience?” Bledel asked. \nGraham added, “Kind of simple and happy ... ” \nYes, it's all that. The term Gilmore Girls Americana brings something specific to mind. And now we'll get to see how much of it still feels relevant in 2016, with the four new episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life encompassing specific seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall). \n“Oh boy, I don't know if it fits today, but I think people maybe appreciate that aspect of it,” Graham said. “I start to sound like Old Lady Jackson when I say, 'There's nothing on, there's nothing soothing to watch, I don't want to watch this violence and this meth lab and this, you know, whatever.' But I don't all the time. And I don't want reality TV to be our only option, as an actor. \n“So I think there are a number of reasons why the show has stuck around. But at the end of the day, there's something to be said for something you want to watch with a family member or friend, that isn't too stressful, but still is so intelligent and is really about something.” \nThe original Gilmore Girls TV series aired for seven seasons, from 2000 to 2007. It focused on the lives and relationships of single-mom Lorelai Gilmore (Graham) and her then-teen daughter Rory (Bledel). Lorelai was only a teenager herself when she gave birth to Rory, so they were peers as much as they were mother-daughter, and usually Rory was the mature one. \nI guess Gilmore Girls always was a “dramedy,” even back before that term was so common. \nAnd it was a beloved “dramedy,” too. But it never got a proper ending. \nThese days, to be honest, just about every long-running show that falls into the general category of “beloved” gets to have some sort of ending, if the creators want one. Fans demand such things. But a decade ago, that wasn't always the case. Beloved, long-running shows could be cancelled on short notice amid contract complications between networks, studios and actors, as was the case with Gilmore Girls. \n“The whole thing was unfinished,” Graham said. “We didn't know it was the end. Our director just mimicked a shot from the pilot, she was like, 'I gotta give people something, if it's going to be the end.' We were all up in the air. \n“So that, to some degree I think, is why we're sitting here (talking about Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life). It's not a grab for attention. It's just that, really, we didn't get to end the show. In Amy (Sherman-Palladino, series creator and executive producer) and Dan (Palladino, Amy's husband and also an executive producer), we have people who not only have more to say, they have 'more more' to say. She's like, 'I can't even put it all in these four episodes.' \n“It's like anyone who writes a successful character. It's why Batman is still around. Somebody's got something else to say about it. And it just happened that the world has evolved in such a way that a place to put it exists (Netflix).” \nBledel said the cast and creators of Gilmore Girls had stayed in touch over the years, even as everyone was doing other things. \nGraham went on to star in Parenthood, which ran for six seasons on NBC. And Bledel did a number of self-described “strange” movie roles to test her boundaries. Her most memorable TV appearance was on Mad Men, where she played Beth Dawes, a disturbed young woman who had an affair with Pete Campbell (played by Vincent Kartheiser, who happens to be Bledel's real-life husband). \nAnyway, among the core group of Gilmore Girls alumni, the subject of revisiting this world obviously kept coming up. \n“Amy and I would talk sometimes, she'd check in with me and see what I was working on,\" Bledel said. \"She expressed an interest in taking these characters further, and we talked about different possibilities from time to time. I knew she was interested in a more satisfying conclusion. But not even so much of a conclusion, it was that these characters still were very much alive for her. \n“So you can't ignore someone's creative impulses when it comes to something like that. We just kept talking about it.” \nAnd here we are, finally, back in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. \nThe series is returning “in real time,” so to speak, so eight or nine years have passed since we last saw Lorelai and Rory. \n“I think it's more like nine years, I'm not sure why it's being written as eight everywhere,” Bledel said. “But nearly a decade is enough time for everybody to change quite a bit.” \nNot to the point of being unrecognizable, though. \nLorelai still runs the Dragonfly Inn. And Rory, now in her 30s, has had some ups and downs in her journalism career. The last time we saw her, she had just graduated from Yale and was poised to cover Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. I don't think Rory could have predicted who's president now, huh? \n“(Rory) has been working hard, as she does,” Bledel said. “She started her work as a journalist at the same time as newspapers were going away. Her field changed dramatically as she was just kind of getting up and running. \n“So that's what we pick up with her. She has been living a bit of a vagabond lifestyle, kind of chasing each story that she becomes passionate about and wants to tell. So kind of crashing on couches and staying with friends, not necessarily planting roots anywhere.” \nWe all know where Rory's roots are. Lorelai's, too. And in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, it doesn't take long for enduring, endearing, familial, familiar patterns to emerge. \n“The language, it has its own voice, you know?” Graham said. “And I learned this over the years, after I did the show, it was like, 'Now I have to find another part as good.' And then it was like, 'Wait a minute, that doesn't happen.' I found a world and a show (Parenthood) that was fantastic, but this particular kind of sense of humour, and mix of comedy and drama, it's Amy's thing. \n“So to have perspective on that, and then get to come back and feel a little more collaborative, we're all grown up now, we all can have a conversation about how great we want it to be. It just felt like we earned that over time. \n“This feels like the (original) show, but grown up. It was all nostalgia, and back to work, which was also nostalgia in its own way.” \nThat's Gilmore Girls Americana for you. \nKickoff is on Friday, Nov. 25. See you at the tailgate party. My friend and his wife will be there. ",

It’s available in 130 countries, and has been producing its own original movies and TV shows since 2013, back when House of Cards first arrived. \nSince then, Netflix has moved from strength to strength, and is now one of the most popular ways to consume media. With slick design, an incredible roster of content, and a unceasing willingness to innovate. It's little wonder then that it won this Readers' Choice category, \nOur Home Technology Editor and binge-watcher extraordinaire Ced Yuen had this to say: \n\"From mailing out videos, to streaming third-party content, to creating its own TV shows and movies, Netflix has shown that it’s always keen to try new things. Netflix has had a lasting impact on the media industry as a whole, and there’s no denying its incredible success over the past two decades.” \nBetter still, Netflix trumped some formidable rivals to take home the big prize, beating out Spotify, amazon Prime Video and Google Music for first place. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week \nWho do you think should have won this award?

      "text": "Comedian Colin Quinn is headed back to Netflix with another standup special.\nDirected by Jerry Seinfeld, Colin Quinn: The New York Story, hits the streaming service tomorrow, November 18th. It’s actually Quinn’s off-broadway show, which tackles the history of New York and the people who make the city great.\n\nWe had the chance to chat with Colin this morning about the special. If you love New York, you will love his show. He also added, if you hate New York, you will love this show. To say that Colin is excited about the show would be an understatement. He told us he just saw a poster for the show with his face on it…it was a small one on the subway, but he was excited nonetheless.\nWe also had to talk about SNL, since the shows have been so amazing during the election. We were just wondering if he missed being on the show. He doesn’t necessarily miss the show, but he would love to have been there after this epic election year.\nWe also brought up his friendship with Amy Schumer and he called her a brat! Ha!",

I thought, ‘I’ve never had this before.’”\nFor more from the issue, visit EW.com right now!",

      "text": "Netflix \n\"Black Mirror\" is known for dystopian visions of our tech-enhanced future. The episode everyone is talking about, though, is different.\n\"San Junipero\" is the fourth episode of the Netflix-produced third season of the short film series.\nPut it on and you may be struck, first, by the retro feel. Second, you may wonder what is sci-fi about it: the first act features no world-changing tech, only subtle hints in dialogue, music, and scenery that there's more than meets the eye. Finally, the ending is unlike any other in the series.\nWe've pulled highlights from the opening below. See if you can tell what's going on.\nThe episode opens in 1987, with a theater playing \"The Lost Boys,\" a movie about two brothers who realize their California town is filled with vampires. Is that a clue? From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \n\nA car radio is playing the contemporary hit, \"Heaven is a Place on Earth.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \n\nEnter our protagonist, Yorkie, played by Mackenzie Davis from \"Halt and Catch Fire.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "print \nNetflix \n\"Black Mirror\" is known for dystopian visions of our tech-enhanced future. The episode everyone is talking about, though, is different. \n\"San Junipero\" is the fourth episode of the Netflix-produced third season of the short film series. \nPut it on and you may be struck, first, by the retro feel. Second, you may wonder what is sci-fi about it: the first act features no world-changing tech, only subtle hints in dialogue, music, and scenery that there's more than meets the eye. Finally, the ending is unlike any other in the series. \nWe've pulled highlights from the opening below. See if you can tell what's going on. The episode opens in 1987, with a theater playing \"The Lost Boys,\" a movie about two brothers who realize their California town is filled with vampires. Is that a clue? From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero A car radio is playing the contemporary hit, \"Heaven is a Place on Earth.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Enter our protagonist, Yorkie, played by Mackenzie Davis from \"Halt and Catch Fire.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \"Am I dreaming?\" asks a guy on a TV display. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero In walks the other lead, Kelly, played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, with a guy hassling her. He says: \"Could you please stop? We’ve only got a couple of hours so let’s use it.\" She replies: \"I am using it.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Moments later in a club, Kelly sits down next to Yorkie to try to lose that guy. \"Go along with whatever I say,\" Kelly says. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \"I need to talk with my friend here, ok?\" Kelly says. \"She’s sick. Like 'sick months to live' sick.\" Yorkie chimes in: \"five, actually.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero The two women get a drink. Kelly says she likes Yorkie’s glasses: \"People try so hard to look how they think they should look. They probably saw it in some movie. But I like these. They’re authentically you.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \"So you’re new here?\" Kelly asks. \"Wow, ok! Oh my God! We have to dance to this.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Yorkie lasts about 20 seconds on the dance floor before running outside. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Kelly joins her: \"Sorry I pushed you into it,\" she says. \"Saturday night’s once a week. It’s like no time. I get impatient.\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Yorkie says everyone was looking at them—two girls dancing. Kelly tells her people are less uptight than they used to be. Yorkie confesses that she’s never been on a dance floor before, that she never does anything fun, and that she is engaged. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero But her fiancé isn’t here. \"Wanna go to bed with me?\" Kelly asks. \"We could be back at mine in like [snap].\" From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Yorkie, clearly torn, says she can’t. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero Yorkie walks alone in the rain. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero The camera pans down to a full moon in a puddle and cuts. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero The show jumps forward in time. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero 13 minutes have passed, and we still have almost no idea what’s going on. Yet there's an engaging story and something mysterious happening. As the show continues, we see how radically different this world is from ours—yet how realistic it might be. From \"Black Mirror\" San Junipero \nThe other unusual thing about this episode? It's got an optimistic ending. \n\"I really wanted to create something that felt different from what we’re used to at the moment, and I think that’s what’s really refreshing about it,\" director Owen Harris told The Hollywood Reporter . \"It’s this world where you’re allowed to dance around to Belinda Carlisle, it’s a world of guilty pleasures but, because of the look and the feel of it, it’s larger than life, which makes everything a little bit more optimistic.\" \nSimply said, we wouldn't mind if someone really made San Junipero.",

      "text": "‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ Netflix revival will hopefully give longtime fans the ending they deserve ‘Gilmore Girls’ Netflix revival will give fans a true ending   \n“Gilmore Girls” is finally getting a true ending. \nThe beloved series that followed quirky, fast-talking, coffee-loving mom-and-daughter pair Lorelai and Rory Gilmore ended its seven-season run in 2007 — but Netflix is bringing it back starting Nov. 25. \nThe show's plot was left open-ended when it first went off the air, before creator Amy Sherman-Palladino could make the finale she envisioned. So fans are ecstatic. \n“It’s hard to not get your hopes up,” Kevin Porter, co-host of the “Gilmore Guys” podcast, tells the Daily News, adding that it’s not easy to recreate “lightning in a bottle.” \nPredictions for the ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival \n“There’s a reason for it to come back,” Porter continues. “(Sherman-Palladino) had a vision for a finale — there’s been dot, dot, dot at the end of this series forever. And we are finally going to get a period.” It’s just like old times! Rory and Lorelai enjoy takeout at the kitchen table in a scene from “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.” (Saeed Adyani/Netflix/Saeed Adyani/Netflix) \nNow, fans who once related to teenage Rory (Alexis Bledel) are approaching the age of her independent, single mother, played by Lauren Graham, who was in her early 30s show's outset. \n“I saw a little of myself in Rory,” die-hard fan Kate Goodin says of her earliest memories watching the gals. “Now that I’m older, I relate more to Lorelai. She’s my favorite character. She’s spunky, smart and totally true to herself.” \nGoodin, 30, who lives in Jersey City and is part of the community’s Gilmore Girls Appreciation Society — says it’s become even more interesting to follow Lorelai’s attempts at adult life, including how she navigated starting her own business and handled her dating life. \n“What would Lorelai do?,” Goodin said she always asked herself while dating. What will come of Lorelai and Luke in the revival? Fans are dying to know. (Saeed Adyani/Netflix) \nPorter believes everyone who watched the gals could relate with one of them in some way. \n“It reminds them of their own life, their relationship with their mothers or families ... or ‘I dated a Jess once,’ or ‘I dated a Logan,’” he says. \nRory’s boyfriend choices were also a highly debated part of the series, leading fans to become so invested that they chose teams. See: Team Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), Team Logan (Matt Czuchry) and Team Dean (Jared Padalecki). The finale of what fans expected to be the last season ended with Rory turning down a proposal from her latest boyfriend, Logan.",

      "text": "‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ Netflix revival will hopefully give longtime fans the ending they deserve ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival will hopefully give fans what they want Saturday, November 19, 2016, 5:00 AM \n“Gilmore Girls” is finally getting a true ending. \nThe beloved series that followed quirky, fast-talking, coffee-loving mom-and-daughter pair Lorelai and Rory Gilmore ended its seven-season run in 2007 — but Netflix is bringing it back starting Nov. 25. \nThe show's plot was left open-ended when it first went off the air, before creator Amy Sherman-Palladino could make the finale she envisioned. So fans are ecstatic. \n“It’s hard to not get your hopes up,” Kevin Porter, co-host of the “Gilmore Guys” podcast, tells the Daily News, adding that it’s not easy to recreate “lightning in a bottle.” \nPredictions for the ‘Gilmore Girls’ revival \n“There’s a reason for it to come back,” Porter continues. “(Sherman-Palladino) had a vision for a finale — there’s been dot, dot, dot at the end of this series forever. And we are finally going to get a period.” It’s just like old times! Rory and Lorelai enjoy takeout at the kitchen table in a scene from “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.” (Saeed Adyani/Netflix/Saeed Adyani/Netflix) \nNow, fans who once related to teenage Rory (Alexis Bledel) are approaching the age of her independent, single mother, played by Lauren Graham, who was in her early 30s show's outset. \n“I saw a little of myself in Rory,” die-hard fan Kate Goodin says of her earliest memories watching the gals. “Now that I’m older, I relate more to Lorelai. She’s my favorite character. She’s spunky, smart and totally true to herself.” \nGoodin, 30, who lives in Jersey City and is part of the community’s Gilmore Girls Appreciation Society — says it’s become even more interesting to follow Lorelai’s attempts at adult life, including how she navigated starting her own business and handled her dating life. \n“What would Lorelai do?,” Goodin said she always asked herself while dating. What will come of Lorelai and Luke in the revival? Fans are dying to know. (Saeed Adyani/Netflix) \nPorter believes everyone who watched the gals could relate with one of them in some way. \n“It reminds them of their own life, their relationship with their mothers or families ... or ‘I dated a Jess once,’ or ‘I dated a Logan,’” he says. \nRory’s boyfriend choices were also a highly debated part of the series, leading fans to become so invested that they chose teams. See: Team Jess (Milo Ventimiglia), Team Logan (Matt Czuchry) and Team Dean (Jared Padalecki). The finale of what fans expected to be the last season ended with Rory turning down a proposal from her latest boyfriend, Logan.",

(Photo : Kevin Winter/Getty Images) \nNetflix's \"Gilmore Girls\" revival stars walked the red carpet in L.A. for its official premiere. Four new episodes called 'A Year in the Life' returns after being gone a decade ago in 2007. What's amazing is, the personalities did not age at all. Advertisement \nLauren Graham (Lorelai), Kelly Bishop (Emily), Alexis Bledel (Rory), Scott Patterson (Luke), Matt Czuchry (Logan), Liza Weil (Paris), David Sutcliffe (Christopher), Yanic Truesdale (Michel), Keiko Agena (Lane), are seen during the event who were also at Stars Hollow sets previously, as per TV Line. \nThe early episodes of \"Gilmore Girls\" are trying to recreate the tiny Connecticut town of Stars Hollow in the original season. There's Luke (Scott Patterson) who gets impatient with freeloaders who request for his wifi password. Kirk (Sean Gunn) is fascinated with the money-making scheme. \n\"Gilmore Girls\" can depend on Lauren Graham for its success. She still attacks Amy Sherman-Palladino's brilliant dialogue perfectly for her character as Lorelai Gilmore. Two annoying women Lorelai, Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) get on the nerves of viewers for their selfishness. \n\"A Year in the Life\" foundation is somewhat thorny and painful. The Gilmore women mourn the demise of Emily's husband, Richard. He has a vital role in the clan and it is justifiable spending ample time to celebrate his life. It is indeed a good tribute also to actor Edward Herrmann, for the versatility of Richard all throughout those years. \nThe heart of the episode revolves around Lorelai's feeling rejected by her own mother, Emily. She has never come to terms with her daughter's high spirit. She even condemned her when she got pregnant when she was still16 years old. Emily turns to Lorelai when she's afraid at the moment. They still argue just for the sake of wanting to control the family's story, according to Variety .   Related Articles",

The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favourite supporting characters. The bad news: It’s not perfect. It’s actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plot lines start to drag — and characters’ flaws go from endearing to irritating.\nThe best news: Fans won’t care. Because Gilmore Girls is back.\nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like Gilmore Girls , which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn’t reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical storylines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the “real” ending.\nAs someone who has re-watched Gilmore Girls more times than I care to admit, hitting “play” on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of Gilmore Girls is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cosy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series?\nI’ll be honest — it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or ... any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements.\nBut here’s what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right.\nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming Gilmore world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year.\nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory — the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent — she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential campaign.\nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launch pad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series, it doesn’t come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (“I heard. You should become a blacksmith,” Lorelai deadpans), although she’s clearly terrified about her future.\nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist’s office. She’s not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She’s also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favourite choice for her soulmate, aren’t all smooth sailing — even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss.\nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai’s father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years.\nShe’s devastated, but still, she’s Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: “Luke.” Luke: “Yes?” Emily: “That was just my way of saying goodbye.”) And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there’s a storyline with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016.\nIn the years since Gilmore Girls went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show’s lack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory’s best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same — and there’s a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture.\n“Body shaming! Trigger warnings!” Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she’s eating tacos before a full dinner. “War on Christmas!”\nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favourite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch Gilmore Girls and realise they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time — and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying.\nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it’s all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices.\nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute Gilmore Girls episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting.\nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don’t necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow’s typically terrible stage productions, there’s enough time to stretch it out for much longer.\nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can’t get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller’s (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane’s band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris.\nThat’s the one benefit of a Gilmore Girls mini-movie — with extended time and producers’ creative freedom, it’s a veritable buffet of every Gilmore experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that’s all the fans really care about, anyway.\nDon’t miss it\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (four episodes) begins streaming on November 25 on Netflix.",

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/GilmoreGirls) \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" will premiere on Nov. 25 on Netflix. \nThere are only a few days left before \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" arrives on Netflix. And ahead of the momentous occasion, a second trailer has been released, a premiere party reunion was witnessed, and reviews have started pouring in. \nThe cast recently reunited for a Netflix revival premiere party in Los Angeles. Almost everyone was there — from the titular Gilmore ladies, Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, and Kelly Bishop, to supporting cast members like Liza Weil, Scott Patterson, and Keiko Agena. \n\"I'm just so thankful! I'm so thankful we made it,\" Graham told Entertainment Tonight . \"And it's been such a big part of my life. I just got the feeling today, like, 'Oh, we can start to enjoy it now and share it with fans and not have to say no comment after we're asked any question.' So, it just feels really good.\" \nBut that's not the only thing that's good. The reviews are in, and they have mostly been overwhelmingly positive. Fans of the original series will love the revival as it takes them back to a familiar place filled with the usual fast-paced dialogue and pop culture references. And while it can sometimes feel like too much, Maureen Ryan of Variety says that \"it is television at its most warm and reassuring.\" Advertisement \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" currently holds a 92 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes . \nA second trailer was also released and it manages to strike nostalgia into fans while making them excited about what's to come. The mother-daughter dynamic is back and better than ever. But one thing that has caught the eyes of many is that only Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) gets a speaking line in the trailer out of the three main men in Rory's life. \n\"I could have been a contender,\" Rory tells him. \"You're still a contender,\" Jess replies. \nAnd while it may not seem like much, it was certainly enough for fans of the pairing to go wild with excitement that Jess and Rory may finally end up together. Furthermore, it was previously revealed that Rory and Dean (Jared Padalecki) only have one scene together. \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" will premiere on Nov. 25 on Netflix.  ",

      "text": "I smell snow (Picture: Netflix) The Gilmore Girls revival is finally here.\nStay warm with this apple cider and honey hot toddy recipe For those who have been waiting for years, rewatching the inhabitants of Stars Hollow live their safely comforting, eccentric, happy lives, this week is going to be better than Christmas.\nFor those who have been living under a coffee cart or have been so incapacitated with excitement that you are no longer able to read, the four-part Gilmore Girls revival arrives this Friday on Netflix and will consist of four hour-long episodes, one for every season of the year.\n‘Yes, Emily, you may go first’ *sobs* (Picture: Netflix) All our favourite characters are back and you will once again be able to stroll the Connecticut streets with them, clutching takeaway coffee cups and boxes of cornstarch.\nOf course, a huge part of the show involves the food that Lorelei and Rory eat while they’re at town hall meetings, opening their own inns and working at The Franklin\n(Picture: Netflix) While it may not be the healthiest food ever, the enjoyment that the Gilmore girls get from food and the bond that it creates between characters makes the show oh-so-cosy, comforting and fulfilling – much like a burger from Luke’s, in fact.\nSo, to feel as close to being a Stars Hollow citizen as is humanly possible (especially for us stuck in the UK who sadly can’t access any of the fabulous looking events being held by Netflix across the pond), here’s a list of foods to eat while you watch adoringly/sobbing/chuckling.\nPop Tarts (Picture: Giphy) A recurring theme, these delicious breakfast items are enjoyed by Rory and Lorelei on days when they don’t have time to get to Luke’s.\nPop tarts helped Lorelei to break away from her overbearing parents, signalling freedom and independence when she first tried them at a friend’s house.\nMORE: Gilmore Girls’ Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel ‘shocked’ after discovering the show’s biggest secret \nCheap and enjoyable, they’re a perfect entry level food to snack on while watching TV if you’re too anxious about whether Rory will choose Jess to eat a full meal (although frankly, I’m not sure you can call yourself a Gilmore Girls fan if you can’t put away a huge amount of junk food at a moment’s notice).\nPizza (Picture: Giphy) The classic, the unbeatable, the reliable, the saviour. Make like the Gilmore women and make pizza and TV your default fallback option.\nCopy Lorelei helping Rory get over Dean the first time and get one with everything on it.\nIf that’s not your thing, go plain and simple like a snowed-in Emily and Richard with a frozen cheese and tomato offering.\nBut, whatever you choose, make sure to grate extra parmesan on top and don’t, for Gilmore’s sake, eat it with salad.\nWe’re not trying to emulate Dean here.\nDessert sushi Dreaming of some delicious candy sushi, Lorelei? (Picture: Netflix) Get to the next junk food level by creating your own sushi made of sweets.\nCopyrighted by Lorelei, who made it to comfort Rory when she found out she wasn’t able to go to Asia with Logan because he had to go and work for his Dad, they are an inspired and vaguely disgusting concoction.\nTo make the sushi, acquire a pack of Fruit Winders (and flash back to junior school) and your desired candy-based filling.\nMore: Food Could you eat this 8,000 calorie sandwich stuffed with kebab meat? \nMcDonald's has killed off its classic festive pie and Christmas is ruined \nThis restaurant's response to a moaning customer is brilliant \nLorelei favours a combo of red liquorice, chocolate chips, gummy sweets and mints but we feel sure that she would support any desires to cook up your own unique dessert sushi recipe.\nUnroll the Winder and cut into appropriate size lengths for rolling, then apply some kind of sweet spread as glue – Marshmallow Fluff, Nutella or Biscoff spread would all be ideal – then pile on your sweets in a visually appealing pattern.\nRoll up, Instagram and feel smug that you’ve made a nutritious and balanced dinner without even turning the oven on.\nBlueberry pancakes (Picture: Giphy) Ideally, you’d want Luke to make these for you (and then conveniently forget to charge you for them as you rush out the diner on a whimsical errand), but if you have to be the Luke of your own life then just use any American pancake recipe.\nAfter you’ve poured the batter into small pancake rounds in the pan, sprinkle blueberries on top before flipping them to cook through.\nServe with whipped cream, crispy bacon and maple syrup before dashing off to catch the bus to Chilton.\nThe devil’s starchy fingers (chips) (Picture: Giphy) A Mrs Kim special, Lane feeds Kyon, the Korean exchange student staying with her mother, a plate of fries to sustain her during Mrs Kim’s flaxseed muffin month.\nGet them delivered, stick some frozen ones in the oven or go the whole potato and deep fry your own to enjoy a delicious plate of the devil’s starchy fingers on the comfort of your sofa.\nEverything on the menu from your local Chinese (Picture: Giphy) Toast the return of your favourite show with the food held in your chopsticks!\nChinese takeout food appears again and again in this show as a weeknight staple, in a welcome-to-Yale buffet and as a way for Paris and Rory to get over their ex boyfriends.\nFor extra authenticity, order every chicken dish on the menu then serve it up cold the next day to the boy your daughter is pretending not to have a crush on while he’s taking a break from cleaning out your rain gutters.\nCoffee, coffee, coffee with a shot of cynicism, served intravenously Don’t we all, Rory (Picture: Giphy) The only drink to wash down all the junk food with, except perhaps for an sensible single cup of Founder’s Day punch made by Miss Patty.\nWhether you eat it, shoot it, drink it or snort it, ingest as many giant mugs of the Gilmore Girls chosen elixir as possible to keep you on the edge of your seat while you watch the reboot.\nCopperboom, everyone! See you for Friday night dinner in Stars Hollow *sobs with anticipation*. MORE: When does Gilmore Girls start on Netflix? And everything else you need to know… \nMORE: Gilmore Girls cast refuse to call the Netflix revival ‘an ending’ sparking hope for fans ",

      "text": "Warner Bros. \n\nWhoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey both made their film debuts in this adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. 2. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo Columbia Pictures \nBefore the American adaptation with Rooney Mara, there was this Swedish version with Noomi Rapace. 3. Forrest Gump Paramount Pictures \nThe movie is so iconic that you might not have even known that it was based on a novel. 4. Into The Wild River Road Entertainment \nEmile Hirsch is absolutely captivating as Chris McCandless in this adaptation of Jon Krakauer's nonfiction book. 5. A Walk to Remember Warner Bros. \nEven if you're not normally a Nicholas Sparks fan, you know you cried when Mandy Moore sang \"Only Hope\" in this movie. 6. Silver Linings Playbook Weinstein Company \nThe book was published just four years before Bradley Cooper and J.Law brought its protagonists to life on the big screen. 7. A Clockwork Orange \"A Clockwork Orange\"/Warner Bros./Columbia-Warner Distributors/Screenshot \nAnthony Burgess hated Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his novel, but hey, you might like it. 8. The Shawshank Redemption \nOne of the most highly-acclaimed films of the '90s was adapted from a Stephen King novella called Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption . 9. Anna Karenina Universal Pictures \nThey somehow made an 864-page novel into a 129-minute movie, with Keira Knightley as the star. 10. The Kite Runner \nThis moving film was based on the novel of the same name by Khaled Hosseini. 11. The Great Gastby Warner Bros. \nFitzergald fans might find that this 1974 adaptation with Robert Redford feels a little more faithful to the famed novel than the 2012 remake does. 12. Full Metal Jacket \nKubrick's famous war film was based on Gustav Hasford's semi-autobiographical novel The Short-Timers . 13. To Kill A Mockingbird Universal \nGregory Peck gave an unforgettable performance as Atticus Finch in this 1962 film. 14. The English Patient \nThis adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's novel won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1996. 15. The Boy In The Striped Pajamas Miramax \nI would only recommend watching this movie if you've already read the book and know exactly what to expect. 16. The Perfect Storm The Perfect Storm \nThis movie was an adaptation of the nonfiction book of the same name by Sebastian Junger. 17. Philomena ABC \nYou'll fall in love with Judi Dench as Philomena in this adaptation of The Lost Child of Philomena Lee. 18. What's Eating Gilbert Grape \nLeonardo DiCaprio received his first Academy Award nomination for his role in this movie. 19. Valley Of The Dolls Red Lion \nThis cult film is almost as famous as the 1966 book upon which it was based. 20. Twelve Gaumont \nI'm still not totally sure why 50 Cent was in this adaptation of Nick McDonell's book. 21. Atonement Universal Pictures \nSaoirse Ronan was only 12 when she won the role of Briony in this dramatic film. 22. As I Lay Dying Picture Entertainment \nWilliam Faulkner's famous 1930 novel was the basis for this film, which James Franco wrote, directed, and starred in. 23. Holes Walt Disney Pictures \nShia LaBeouf starred in this beloved '00s adaptation of Louis Sachar's YA novel. \nYou really can't go wrong with so many options for great movies that are based on books. Who said that the words \"Netflix\" and \"literature\" have to be mutually exclusive? Read the original article on Bustle . You can also check them out on Facebook and Pinterest . Copyright 2016.

After spending millions on two Chris Rock comedy specials in October, the site announced today that it will release three — count 'em, three — Dave Chappelle comedy specials. Netflix's order includes one all-new performance to be produced by the service, and two never-before-seen specials from Chappelle's \"personal comedy vault\" — though Chappelle has started to perform stand-up more often recently and even host SNL , Netflix's trio of shows will represent the comedian's first taped concert appearances in 12 years. The specials will all be released simultaneously in 2017, as the world moves from Peak TV to Peak Comedy.",

      "text": "Netflix And Dave Chappelle To Bring Three New Comedy Specials Chappelle’s coming back in a big way. By Evan Saathoff Nov. 21, 2016 \nIf anyone was wondering what Dave Chappelle would do next after his high-profile SNL hosting gig, here’s your answer. The guy’s about to come out with three new standup specials, all of them for Netflix, the official place where dreams come true. \nOne of these specials will be brand new. The other two will be older performances, one from Austin City Limits, the other from The Hollywood Palladium. Those latter two will come out at the same time next year. We don’t yet know when the brand new special will arrive. \nAs his SNL proved, Chappelle’s still hilarious but doesn’t hold back from speaking his mind, even at the risk of saying something unpopular. It’ll be interesting to see how much of either hallmark these three specials have to offer. I certainly can’t wait to find out.

      "text": "Tom Hanks in \"Forrest Gump,\" now available on Netflix. YouTube\nThe INSIDER Summary:\n• Movie adaptations of books can bring them to life or ruin them.\n• Here are some of the best book-to-movie adaptations on Netflix right now.\n• Highlights include classics like Forrest Gump and tearjerkers like A Walk To Remember.\nThere are a wide variety of movies based on books on Netflix , so that means there are plenty of chances to either love or detest seeing your favorite literary works in cinematic form. After all, bookworms often have a love-hate relationship with movie adaptations of books. On the one hand, there's the excitement of seeing your favorite authors' work get recognized in such a big way, and watching their stories and characters come to life on the big screen. On the other hand, there's an uncomfortable conflict if the portrayals onscreen don't match the story you pictured in your head, particularly if it's a book that you've read many times (and therefore probably have some very set feelings about).\nAdditionally, sometimes a movie is already \"ruined\" for you if you've read the book and therefore know how the story ends. For example, the movie Fight Club would have a very different impact on someone who had already read the book than it would on someone who was going in fresh. It's also worth nothing that not all book-to-movie adaptations are created equal, and sometimes the screen version of a certain novel is just bad. It's disappointing when that does happen, but the good news is that there are plenty of other adaptations that are worth watching. Here are some movies available to stream on Netflix that any bookworm will enjoy.\n 1. The Color Purple Warner Bros.\nWhoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey both made their film debuts in this adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.\n2. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo Columbia Pictures Before the American adaptation with Rooney Mara, there was this Swedish version with Noomi Rapace.\n3. Forrest Gump Paramount Pictures The movie is so iconic that you might not have even known that it was based on a novel.\n4. Into The Wild River Road Entertainment Emile Hirsch is absolutely captivating as Chris McCandless in this adaptation of Jon Krakauer's nonfiction book.\n5. A Walk to Remember Warner Bros. Even if you're not normally a Nicholas Sparks fan, you know you cried when Mandy Moore sang \"Only Hope\" in this movie.\n6. Silver Linings Playbook Weinstein Company The book was published just four years before Bradley Cooper and J.Law brought its protagonists to life on the big screen.\n7. A Clockwork Orange \"A Clockwork Orange\"/Warner Bros./Columbia-Warner Distributors/Screenshot Anthony Burgess hated Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his novel, but hey, you might like it.\n8. The Shawshank Redemption Columbia Pictures via YouTube One of the most highly-acclaimed films of the '90s was adapted from a Stephen King novella called Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption .\n9. Anna Karenina Universal Pictures They somehow made an 864-page novel into a 129-minute movie, with Keira Knightley as the star.\n10. The Kite Runner Dreamworks SKG This moving film was based on the novel of the same name by Khaled Hosseini.\n11. The Great Gastby Warner Bros. Fitzergald fans might find that this 1974 adaptation with Robert Redford feels a little more faithful to the famed novel than the 2012 remake does.\n12. Full Metal Jacket YouTube/Jimmy Jammz Kubrick's famous war film was based on Gustav Hasford's semi-autobiographical novel The Short-Timers .\n13. To Kill A Mockingbird Universal Gregory Peck gave an unforgettable performance as Atticus Finch in this 1962 film.\n14. The English Patient Miramax This adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's novel won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1996.\n15. The Boy In The Striped Pajamas Miramax I would only recommend watching this movie if you've already read the book and know exactly what to expect.\n16. The Perfect Storm The Perfect Storm This movie was an adaptation of the nonfiction book of the same name by Sebastian Junger.\n17. Philomena ABC You'll fall in love with Judi Dench as Philomena in this adaptation of The Lost Child of Philomena Lee.\n18. What's Eating Gilbert Grape Paramount via YouTube Leonardo DiCaprio received his first Academy Award nomination for his role in this movie.\n19. Valley Of The Dolls Red Lion This cult film is almost as famous as the 1966 book upon which it was based.\n20. Twelve Gaumont I'm still not totally sure why 50 Cent was in this adaptation of Nick McDonell's book.\n21. Atonement Universal Pictures Saoirse Ronan was only 12 when she won the role of Briony in this dramatic film.\n22. As I Lay Dying Picture Entertainment William Faulkner's famous 1930 novel was the basis for this film, which James Franco wrote, directed, and starred in.\n23. Holes Walt Disney Pictures Shia LaBeouf starred in this beloved '00s adaptation of Louis Sachar's YA novel.\nYou really can't go wrong with so many options for great movies that are based on books. Who said that the words \"Netflix\" and \"literature\" have to be mutually exclusive?\nRead the original article on Bustle . You can also check them out on Facebook and Pinterest . Copyright 2016.

(Photo by Scott Roth/Invision/AP) Scott Roth Previous Next \nNEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\"''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle is officially, 100%, totally and completely back.\nThe comedian, who received rave reviews for his Saturday Night Live hosting stint on November 12, has signed a pretty major deal with Netflix.\nScroll down for details...\nThe streaming company has announced on Twitter that it will release a trio of new comedy specials from Chappelle at various points in the near future.\nNo release dates have been revealed as of this writing.\nHowever, we can confirm that one of the specials will be an original set filmed exclusively for Netflix, while the remaining two wil be from “Chappelle’s personal comedy vault” and were filmed at Austin City Limits Live and the Hollywood Paladium.\nThe following Tweet is the extent of the information Netflix has provided us with:\n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy - searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, VP of Original Documentary and Comedy said via statement, adding:\n“Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.”\nAlways a beloved and respected comedian, Chappelle struck it huge in 2003 with his Comedy Central sketch program, Chappelle's Show\nIt was a critical and ratings hit and the network at the time offered him $50 million to film three more years of the series.\nAfter initially agreeing to this deal and setting May 31, 2005 premiere date for Season 3, Chappelle stunned fans and the entertainment industry when he abruptly left during production and took a trip to South Africa.\nIt was reported by some at the time that he suffered some kind of nervous breakdown.\n\"Coming here, I don't have the distractions of fame. It quiets the ego down,\" he said at one point during his international sabbatical.\n\"I'm interested in the kind of person I've got to become. I want to be well-rounded and the industry is a place of extremes. I want to be well-balanced. I've got to check my intentions, man.\"\nChappelle remained mostly out of the spotlight ever since taking this hiatus.\nBut he hosted SNL for its first show after Donald Trump was elected President, striking the perfect balance of seriousness, comedy and insight and pretty much announcing his comeback in the process.\nNow, thanks to his deal with Netflix, he's likely on his way back to making up for a lot of the $50 million he left on the table over a decade ago.",

Their latest announcement fits into both categories. The streaming provider took to Twitter to announce three new Dave Chappelle comedy specials will be coming soon. \nThe last special the comedian was involved in outside of the wildly beloved \"Chappelle’s Show,\" came in 2004, and soon after he discontinued his work on the sketch comedy show that shared his name, to much media speculation. Since then, Chappelle has continued to perform stand-up, which is his first love, playing surprise dates all over the country. Most recently, the comedian revived his sketch comedy genius on Saturday Night Live , delivering scathing political commentary, when the country needed it most. \nAlthough Netflix hasn’t given any details about the timing or theme of the new specials, but at this point, his fans will just be happy to see him on their TVs again.

Two other unreleased projects will come from Chappelle's vault -- one produced out of the Austin City Limits venue, the other from a performance at the Hollywood Palladium.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nThe projects from the vault are set for release simultaneously next year. There's no premiere date yet for the new special.\nChappelle is coming off a strong performance earlier this month as host of \"Saturday Night Live,\" which generated the show's highest ratings in three years. He is among the most prolific and successful touring comics in country, staging some 500 shows during the past three years.\nNetflix made headlines last month by setting a $40 million deal with Chris Rock for two new comedy specials.\nRELATED STORIES:\nDave Chappelle is the perfect host for the first 'Saturday Night Live' in Trump's America\nFake Donald Trump returns to 'SNL,' and the real one is not happy\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\n ",

      "text": "Netflix is bringing three new Dave Chappelle comedy specials to you Posted by Kevin McGuire on Nov 21, 2016 13:40 Not long after Dave Chappelle served as host of Saturday Night Live comes word Chappelle is set to have three brand new comedy specials airing exclusively on Netflix. News: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 \nIt’s been a long time coming for Chappelle fans. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Netflix Vice President of Original Documentary and Comedy (that is quite a title) Lisa Nishimura. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.” \nThey will absolutely be anticipated. The last time Chappelle had a comedy special on TV was 12 years ago. It should be expected he will have plenty of material to use since his last special. Stan Latham will be the producer and will co-direct with Chappelle for a brand new, original comedy special. \nTwo others will actually be pulled from archives to show off performances from Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium. Those two specials from the vault are due out in the next year, but a date for the original special has not been announced at this time. \nThis country is going to need some laughter in 2017 and beyond, and Chappelle will be there to help provide it. \n[ Variety ] About Kevin McGuire Contributor to NBCSports.com's College Football Talk, Athlon Sports and The Comeback.

      "text": "November 21, 2016 3:00 AM 'Gilmore Girls' makes triumphant return to Netflix By LUAINE LEE Tribune News Service Order Reprint of this Story BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. \nJust when we thought the Gilmore Girls had shuffled off to the TV bone yard, they are back, chatting like rappers on speed and proving you can go home again. \nCreator-writer, Amy Sherman-Palladino, has assembled most of the original cast of the long-running \"Gilmore Girls\" series for four new 90-minute episodes. They transport the audience over the course of a year in \"Gilmore Girls: a Year in the Life.\" The series begins streaming Friday on Netflix. \nIt's been 10 1/2 years since the young single mom (Lauren Graham) and her precocious daughter (Alexis Bledel) bonded their way into adulthood, while on-again-off-again boyfriend (Scott Patterson) bided his time. \n\"It's not a story about a little girl anymore, who's in high school,\" says Graham, 49, who has since costarred in \"Parenthood,\"\"Web Therapy,\"\"The Odd Couple.\" \n\"It's a story about a young woman and kind of the struggles she faces. Yet the dynamics ... between these two characters, they've grown up, but they're the same. And that kind of foundation of 'Here are the people you have to rely on' can take you through any age. I think that's what this show continues to tell us about family anyway,\" she says. \nSherman-Palladino didn't harbor much hope that her girls would ever see the quaint town of Stars Hollow again. \"When Netflix popped up and decided to storm the world and just take over overnight, we thought, 'Well, what a great opportunity to delve into a different form, to tell stories in a different way using beloved characters that we loved'\" she says. \n\"And we get back in a room with these three actors and to be able to go at it again, but in a completely different way ... There was no grand Master Plan. It was just, 'Hey, there's a Netflix now, which means we could do a billion minutes because we have a lot of words, and ... it was a different form. \n\"You're writing not to commercials or to sell soap or tampons. Nobody gives a s_. It's really just there to tell stories. And it was just such an exciting challenge, and form, and a way to get us all back together again and put on a show.\" \nBledel, who's 25 and has since costarred in \"Mad Men,\"\"Us & Them,\"\"Jenny's Wedding,\" says falling back into the role was like riding a bike. \"It really was as if no time had passed,\" she says. \n\"It's all on the page. Amy's writing just informs you right away. You know how it's supposed to be said, and it's all there for you ... It's amazing to know that people are eagerly awaiting the release of these episodes, and that they have loved the show all these years ... It's why we do this, to be able to communicate something that people are going to love and talk about and enjoy it together.\" \nIt's more than just enjoyment, says Patterson, 58, who has costarred in \"Aliens in America,\"\"Meth Head,\"\"The Event.\" He says the original show has left its indelible mark on those we least expect. \n\"I was walking through the Austin airport, and a fellow walked up to me and just started crying, and he said he was in a sniper battalion in Iraq, in Fallujah, and he had done four tours. And they watched 'Gilmore Girls' obsessively. It's a safe place for them. It's like nothing bad can happen while they're watching that show. He even got his commanding officer on the cell phone, who was in Fort Bragg and about to be shipped back over. And he said, 'I'm standing here with Luke.' And he goes, 'F_ no!' I mean, it was just this huge reaction. It was kind of amazing.\" \n\"I do want to say what was so great about this (project) is I really feel like we got to do it together,\" says Sherman-Palladino. \n\"The first show was, like: You cast. You get on a plane. You don't know anyone. You're in Canada. It's cold. You're wandering around. It's like you're exhausted. There's elevensies. I don't know what it is, it's like 'Lord of the Rings.' And then you're in this whirlwind of production, and you're tired, and you're sick, and you don't feel well, and you're throwing up, and you don't remember when you got your hair done last, and then it's over. \n\"And this time I felt like, because we would talk, and we were all in contact, and it felt like we got to sit and say, 'Do we want to go on this journey together? Do we want to band together and like - Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland, this s _?' And for me ... there will be nothing else in my career like what we got to do.\" \nHOLIDAY SPECIALS FOR THANKSGIVING WEEKEND \nThere will be plenty of holiday specials to watch Thanksgiving weekend once that turkey has nestled in your stomach and you have begun to ease on down to the couch. ABC will feature \"The Wonderful World of Disney: the Magical Holiday Celebration\" at 8 p.m. \nYou can march to a different drummer with the \"Thanksgiving Day Parade\" on CBS or NBC in the morning. How about joining \"The Simpsons\" for their 24-hour marathon on FXX or recite along with the cast of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" on IFC? \nFriday CBS will dish out two 30-minute \"Frosty the Snowman\" shows, CW will describe how \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\"\"Terrific Trucks Save Christmas' will skid over to Sprout and ï¿½ in case you don't remember that far back - \"The '90s: the Last Great Decade\" will air its marathon all day on NatGeo Channel. And don't forget that PBS sports a brand new version of \"Anne of Green Gables\" airing Thursday. (Check local listings). \nALAN THICKE TO HOST NEW SHOW \nAlan Thicke will be back in the thick of things when he hosts \"Entertainment Weekly Presents: '80s Stars - Where are They Now?\" (long enough title?) on REELZ starting Nov. 30. \nThicke, who starred in \"Growing Pains\" and hosted his own talk show, tells me he's done standup comedy too. \"But that's really not my background. It's one thing to be witty or clever or fast. It's another thing to have the rhythm that's involved in the art - and I do consider it an art - of standup comedy. Those guys succeed where the rest of us fail. I was very successful in daytime in Canada with a (talk) type show because of the ability to react, be light on my feet and have a quip and whatnot - but not to have to score all the time yourself - being able to share spotlight with your guests.\" \nDAMON WAYANS STARTED OUT ON THE WRONG FOOT \nDamon Wayans and his partner Clayne Crawford are two of the most popular guys on TV with their new fall show on Fox, \"Lethal Weapon.\" Wayans, who's known for his comedy timing and creativity from \"In Living Color,\" says it all started out wrong for him. \n\"I got thrown out of three different high schools. 'Yea! I'm pretty funny.' I was the class clown and had a running commentary on everything, whatever anyone threw out I had a response. That came from insecurity. When I first started out in comedy you tend to do that, you want to prove your wit, everything someone says, you try to find comedy in it.\" \n(Luaine Lee is a California-based correspondent who covers entertainment for Tribune News Service.)

      "text": "November 21, 2016 12:00 AM 'Gilmore Girls' makes triumphant return to Netflix By LUAINE LEE Tribune News Service Order Reprint of this Story BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. \nJust when we thought the Gilmore Girls had shuffled off to the TV bone yard, they are back, chatting like rappers on speed and proving you can go home again. \nCreator-writer, Amy Sherman-Palladino, has assembled most of the original cast of the long-running \"Gilmore Girls\" series for four new 90-minute episodes. They transport the audience over the course of a year in \"Gilmore Girls: a Year in the Life.\" The series begins streaming Friday on Netflix. \nIt's been 10 1/2 years since the young single mom (Lauren Graham) and her precocious daughter (Alexis Bledel) bonded their way into adulthood, while on-again-off-again boyfriend (Scott Patterson) bided his time. \n\"It's not a story about a little girl anymore, who's in high school,\" says Graham, 49, who has since costarred in \"Parenthood,\"\"Web Therapy,\"\"The Odd Couple.\" \n\"It's a story about a young woman and kind of the struggles she faces. Yet the dynamics ... between these two characters, they've grown up, but they're the same. And that kind of foundation of 'Here are the people you have to rely on' can take you through any age. I think that's what this show continues to tell us about family anyway,\" she says. \nSherman-Palladino didn't harbor much hope that her girls would ever see the quaint town of Stars Hollow again. \"When Netflix popped up and decided to storm the world and just take over overnight, we thought, 'Well, what a great opportunity to delve into a different form, to tell stories in a different way using beloved characters that we loved'\" she says. \n\"And we get back in a room with these three actors and to be able to go at it again, but in a completely different way ... There was no grand Master Plan. It was just, 'Hey, there's a Netflix now, which means we could do a billion minutes because we have a lot of words, and ... it was a different form. \n\"You're writing not to commercials or to sell soap or tampons. Nobody gives a s_. It's really just there to tell stories. And it was just such an exciting challenge, and form, and a way to get us all back together again and put on a show.\" \nBledel, who's 25 and has since costarred in \"Mad Men,\"\"Us & Them,\"\"Jenny's Wedding,\" says falling back into the role was like riding a bike. \"It really was as if no time had passed,\" she says. \n\"It's all on the page. Amy's writing just informs you right away. You know how it's supposed to be said, and it's all there for you ... It's amazing to know that people are eagerly awaiting the release of these episodes, and that they have loved the show all these years ... It's why we do this, to be able to communicate something that people are going to love and talk about and enjoy it together.\" \nIt's more than just enjoyment, says Patterson, 58, who has costarred in \"Aliens in America,\"\"Meth Head,\"\"The Event.\" He says the original show has left its indelible mark on those we least expect. \n\"I was walking through the Austin airport, and a fellow walked up to me and just started crying, and he said he was in a sniper battalion in Iraq, in Fallujah, and he had done four tours. And they watched 'Gilmore Girls' obsessively. It's a safe place for them. It's like nothing bad can happen while they're watching that show. He even got his commanding officer on the cell phone, who was in Fort Bragg and about to be shipped back over. And he said, 'I'm standing here with Luke.' And he goes, 'F_ no!' I mean, it was just this huge reaction. It was kind of amazing.\" \n\"I do want to say what was so great about this (project) is I really feel like we got to do it together,\" says Sherman-Palladino. \n\"The first show was, like: You cast. You get on a plane. You don't know anyone. You're in Canada. It's cold. You're wandering around. It's like you're exhausted. There's elevensies. I don't know what it is, it's like 'Lord of the Rings.' And then you're in this whirlwind of production, and you're tired, and you're sick, and you don't feel well, and you're throwing up, and you don't remember when you got your hair done last, and then it's over. \n\"And this time I felt like, because we would talk, and we were all in contact, and it felt like we got to sit and say, 'Do we want to go on this journey together? Do we want to band together and like - Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland, this s _?' And for me ... there will be nothing else in my career like what we got to do.\" \nHOLIDAY SPECIALS FOR THANKSGIVING WEEKEND \nThere will be plenty of holiday specials to watch Thanksgiving weekend once that turkey has nestled in your stomach and you have begun to ease on down to the couch. ABC will feature \"The Wonderful World of Disney: the Magical Holiday Celebration\" at 8 p.m. \nYou can march to a different drummer with the \"Thanksgiving Day Parade\" on CBS or NBC in the morning. How about joining \"The Simpsons\" for their 24-hour marathon on FXX or recite along with the cast of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" on IFC? \nFriday CBS will dish out two 30-minute \"Frosty the Snowman\" shows, CW will describe how \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\"\"Terrific Trucks Save Christmas' will skid over to Sprout and ï¿½ in case you don't remember that far back - \"The '90s: the Last Great Decade\" will air its marathon all day on NatGeo Channel. And don't forget that PBS sports a brand new version of \"Anne of Green Gables\" airing Thursday. (Check local listings). \nALAN THICKE TO HOST NEW SHOW \nAlan Thicke will be back in the thick of things when he hosts \"Entertainment Weekly Presents: '80s Stars - Where are They Now?\" (long enough title?) on REELZ starting Nov. 30. \nThicke, who starred in \"Growing Pains\" and hosted his own talk show, tells me he's done standup comedy too. \"But that's really not my background. It's one thing to be witty or clever or fast. It's another thing to have the rhythm that's involved in the art - and I do consider it an art - of standup comedy. Those guys succeed where the rest of us fail. I was very successful in daytime in Canada with a (talk) type show because of the ability to react, be light on my feet and have a quip and whatnot - but not to have to score all the time yourself - being able to share spotlight with your guests.\" \nDAMON WAYANS STARTED OUT ON THE WRONG FOOT \nDamon Wayans and his partner Clayne Crawford are two of the most popular guys on TV with their new fall show on Fox, \"Lethal Weapon.\" Wayans, who's known for his comedy timing and creativity from \"In Living Color,\" says it all started out wrong for him. \n\"I got thrown out of three different high schools. 'Yea! I'm pretty funny.' I was the class clown and had a running commentary on everything, whatever anyone threw out I had a response. That came from insecurity. When I first started out in comedy you tend to do that, you want to prove your wit, everything someone says, you try to find comedy in it.\" \n(Luaine Lee is a California-based correspondent who covers entertainment for Tribune News Service.)

Their latest announcement fits into both categories. The streaming provider took to Twitter to announce three new Dave Chappelle comedy specials will be coming soon. \nThe last special the comedian was involved in outside of the wildly beloved \"Chappelle’s Show,\" came in 2004, and soon after he discontinued his work on the sketch comedy show that shared his name, to much media speculation. Since then, Chappelle has continued to perform stand-up, which is his first love, playing surprise dates all over the country. Most recently, the comedian revived his sketch comedy genius on Saturday Night Live , delivering scathing political commentary, when the country needed it most. \nAlthough Netflix hasn’t given any details about the timing or theme of the new specials, but at this point, his fans will just be happy to see him on their TVs again.

Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said.Chappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" \"Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season.Earlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "November 21, 2016 12:00 AM 'Gilmore Girls' makes triumphant return to Netflix By LUAINE LEE Tribune News Service Order Reprint of this Story BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. \nJust when we thought the Gilmore Girls had shuffled off to the TV bone yard, they are back, chatting like rappers on speed and proving you can go home again. \nCreator-writer, Amy Sherman-Palladino, has assembled most of the original cast of the long-running \"Gilmore Girls\" series for four new 90-minute episodes. They transport the audience over the course of a year in \"Gilmore Girls: a Year in the Life.\" The series begins streaming Friday on Netflix. \nIt's been 10 1/2 years since the young single mom (Lauren Graham) and her precocious daughter (Alexis Bledel) bonded their way into adulthood, while on-again-off-again boyfriend (Scott Patterson) bided his time. \n\"It's not a story about a little girl anymore, who's in high school,\" says Graham, 49, who has since costarred in \"Parenthood,\"\"Web Therapy,\"\"The Odd Couple.\" \n\"It's a story about a young woman and kind of the struggles she faces. Yet the dynamics ... between these two characters, they've grown up, but they're the same. And that kind of foundation of 'Here are the people you have to rely on' can take you through any age. I think that's what this show continues to tell us about family anyway,\" she says. \nSherman-Palladino didn't harbor much hope that her girls would ever see the quaint town of Stars Hollow again. \"When Netflix popped up and decided to storm the world and just take over overnight, we thought, 'Well, what a great opportunity to delve into a different form, to tell stories in a different way using beloved characters that we loved'\" she says. \n\"And we get back in a room with these three actors and to be able to go at it again, but in a completely different way ... There was no grand Master Plan. It was just, 'Hey, there's a Netflix now, which means we could do a billion minutes because we have a lot of words, and ... it was a different form. \n\"You're writing not to commercials or to sell soap or tampons. Nobody gives a s_. It's really just there to tell stories. And it was just such an exciting challenge, and form, and a way to get us all back together again and put on a show.\" \nBledel, who's 25 and has since costarred in \"Mad Men,\"\"Us & Them,\"\"Jenny's Wedding,\" says falling back into the role was like riding a bike. \"It really was as if no time had passed,\" she says. \n\"It's all on the page. Amy's writing just informs you right away. You know how it's supposed to be said, and it's all there for you ... It's amazing to know that people are eagerly awaiting the release of these episodes, and that they have loved the show all these years ... It's why we do this, to be able to communicate something that people are going to love and talk about and enjoy it together.\" \nIt's more than just enjoyment, says Patterson, 58, who has costarred in \"Aliens in America,\"\"Meth Head,\"\"The Event.\" He says the original show has left its indelible mark on those we least expect. \n\"I was walking through the Austin airport, and a fellow walked up to me and just started crying, and he said he was in a sniper battalion in Iraq, in Fallujah, and he had done four tours. And they watched 'Gilmore Girls' obsessively. It's a safe place for them. It's like nothing bad can happen while they're watching that show. He even got his commanding officer on the cell phone, who was in Fort Bragg and about to be shipped back over. And he said, 'I'm standing here with Luke.' And he goes, 'F_ no!' I mean, it was just this huge reaction. It was kind of amazing.\" \n\"I do want to say what was so great about this (project) is I really feel like we got to do it together,\" says Sherman-Palladino. \n\"The first show was, like: You cast. You get on a plane. You don't know anyone. You're in Canada. It's cold. You're wandering around. It's like you're exhausted. There's elevensies. I don't know what it is, it's like 'Lord of the Rings.' And then you're in this whirlwind of production, and you're tired, and you're sick, and you don't feel well, and you're throwing up, and you don't remember when you got your hair done last, and then it's over. \n\"And this time I felt like, because we would talk, and we were all in contact, and it felt like we got to sit and say, 'Do we want to go on this journey together? Do we want to band together and like - Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland, this s _?' And for me ... there will be nothing else in my career like what we got to do.\" \nHOLIDAY SPECIALS FOR THANKSGIVING WEEKEND \nThere will be plenty of holiday specials to watch Thanksgiving weekend once that turkey has nestled in your stomach and you have begun to ease on down to the couch. ABC will feature \"The Wonderful World of Disney: the Magical Holiday Celebration\" at 8 p.m. \nYou can march to a different drummer with the \"Thanksgiving Day Parade\" on CBS or NBC in the morning. How about joining \"The Simpsons\" for their 24-hour marathon on FXX or recite along with the cast of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" on IFC? \nFriday CBS will dish out two 30-minute \"Frosty the Snowman\" shows, CW will describe how \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\"\"Terrific Trucks Save Christmas' will skid over to Sprout and ï¿½ in case you don't remember that far back - \"The '90s: the Last Great Decade\" will air its marathon all day on NatGeo Channel. And don't forget that PBS sports a brand new version of \"Anne of Green Gables\" airing Thursday. (Check local listings). \nALAN THICKE TO HOST NEW SHOW \nAlan Thicke will be back in the thick of things when he hosts \"Entertainment Weekly Presents: '80s Stars - Where are They Now?\" (long enough title?) on REELZ starting Nov. 30. \nThicke, who starred in \"Growing Pains\" and hosted his own talk show, tells me he's done standup comedy too. \"But that's really not my background. It's one thing to be witty or clever or fast. It's another thing to have the rhythm that's involved in the art - and I do consider it an art - of standup comedy. Those guys succeed where the rest of us fail. I was very successful in daytime in Canada with a (talk) type show because of the ability to react, be light on my feet and have a quip and whatnot - but not to have to score all the time yourself - being able to share spotlight with your guests.\" \nDAMON WAYANS STARTED OUT ON THE WRONG FOOT \nDamon Wayans and his partner Clayne Crawford are two of the most popular guys on TV with their new fall show on Fox, \"Lethal Weapon.\" Wayans, who's known for his comedy timing and creativity from \"In Living Color,\" says it all started out wrong for him. \n\"I got thrown out of three different high schools. 'Yea! I'm pretty funny.' I was the class clown and had a running commentary on everything, whatever anyone threw out I had a response. That came from insecurity. When I first started out in comedy you tend to do that, you want to prove your wit, everything someone says, you try to find comedy in it.\" \n(Luaine Lee is a California-based correspondent who covers entertainment for Tribune News Service.)

      "text": "After an amazing performance on Saturday Night Live , the world can thankfully expect to see a lot more Dave Chappelle. The comedian has partnered with Netflix with plans to deliver three new stand up specials to be released on the streaming service.\nNews: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016 \n\nLisa Nishimura, Netflix’s vice president of original documentary and comedy, said in a statement, “Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential. Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.”\nChappelle has not performed a stand up special on television in over 12 years. He left the country at the height of his Chappelle’s Show popularity and has widely avoided the public spotlight since the show’s end in 2006.\nOne of the three specials will be an original filmed for Netflix, while the other two will constitute previous performances at Austin City Limits Live and the Hollywood Palladium. Those two will be released simultaneously in 2017.\nThis news comes on the heels of Netflix already ordering two specials from Chris Rock, who is making a reported $40 million from the company. While most were shocked at the initial amount, Netflix has stated their plans to spend at least $6 billion on future content, more than both NBC and CBS.\nThis year, Netflix has already released specials from comedians Aziz Ansari and Patton Oswalt, the latter of which won an Emmy.\nVia Huffington Post \n",
