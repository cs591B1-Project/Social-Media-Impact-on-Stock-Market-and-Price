(Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) \nSEATTLE (AP) — Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

Here’s a look at what we found after searching far and wide through Amazon’s extensive sale but, before you browse, keep in mind that these only exist while supplies last. As soon as they allocated number of units is sold – and we don’t know how many of each are available – it’s curtains for the sale.\nBest of luck.\n20 percent off of the Moto G Play, typically priced at $99 $20 off Moto G4 with 16GB of storage $40 off Moto G4 with 32GB $100 off the Honor 8 with 64GB of storage, typically priced at $399 20 percent off Samsung Galaxy S5 (AT&T) certified pre-owned 50 percent off Galaxy Note 4 (AT&T) certified pre-owned 31 percent off of unlocked LG G5 9 percent off unlocked Xperia X Performance (32GB) $59 off unlocked Xperia X 9 percent off unlocked Sony Xperia XA Ultra 20 percent off unlocked Sony Xperia XA $150 off unlocked Sony Xperia XZ 10 percent off unlocked ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser Be sure to check Amazon’s Black Friday page throughout the holidays, however, as more deals will continue to pop up in the coming days. Who knows, maybe you’ll find something else you like.\n\n\nSource : Amazon ",

      "text": "  In early October Amazon stated that it would prohibit incentivized reviews [webmasterworld.com] from its system. Well, in a little over a month the company has made good and is doing more than prohibiting, it's deleting \"incentivized\" reviews. Analysts have discovered Amazon has deleted over half a million reviews already, of which almost three quarters of that were clearly \"incentivized.\" What the figures seem to indicate is that, though Amazon is deleting a large number incentivized reviews, it hasnt managed to catch all of them. Part of the problem could be that incentivized reviews are still rolling in, despite Amazons ban. That said, the number of incentivized reviews has dropped significantly following the ban, and this, in turn, has lowered the average rating for all reviews. The day before the ban was enacted, for instance, the average rating for all reviews that day was 4.73; on November 1, the average rating for all reviews had dropped to 4.65. Amazon Deletes 500,000 \"Incentivized\" Reviews [techcrunch.com] I'm glad to see the back of them as i've found a number of them misleading, and downright false, imho.",

      "text": "amazon deletes incentivized reviews ratings dont change prime packages More Jeramey Lende/123RF\nAmazon’s decision to clean out product reviews written by people who got stuff free in exchange for writing those reviews sounds like a good move to help consumers know what real buyers think. Amazon has been busy deleting incentivized review for a couple of months now. It turns out, however, according to a recent study by ReviewMeta , that product rating changes aren’t changing much, if at all, as reported by Tech Crunch .\nIncentivized reviews involved vendors either giving away or heavily discounting products in return for a promise to write an “unbiased review.” Incentivized reviews may have created more of a perception problem than actual rating rigging, but earlier ReviewMeta research did show a difference in the reviews that resulted. The study found that incentivized reviews rated products on average 4.74 stars (out of five) compared to 4.36-star average ratings for reviews that were not incentivized.\nMore: Amazon has finally banned those pesky ‘incentivized’ reviews\nWould a 4.74-star rating differ all that much from a 4.36-star review in your decision to buy a product? Maybe or maybe not, but the greater issue was that all those reviews, and some products, especially new ones, often had a high proportion of identified incentivized reviews. And so the appearance in those cases was that the reviews and ratings were essentially bought and paid for and therefore couldn’t be trusted. This in turn gave the overall impression that Amazon’s ratings themselves weren’t maybe all that trustworthy.\nSo Amazon cracked down. ReviewMeta analyzed roughly 65 million reviews of a bit more than 32,000 product categories. The researchers found that more than 500,000 reviews were deleted in the crackdown, of which 71 percent were incentivized. The average star rating for the deleted reviews was 4.75, higher than average. Just before the ban and mass deletion program began in early October the average daily product review was 4.73 stars, and on November 1, the overall average daily review dropped to 4.65 stars,\nYou’d think then that the product ratings would have changed and ended up significantly lower because of the dumped ‘seems-like-paid’ reviews and lower review star averages. But that didn’t happen. Why not?\nIt turns out Amazon wasn’t counting incentivized reviews in calculating overall product ratings, and instead utilized reviews and ratings from “Verified Purchasers” (except with brand new product where there weren’t yet many reviews that were not incentivized). So the overall ratings didn’t change much if at all. Shoppers could pretty much depend on the overall star ratings coming from people who actually paid for the products they reviewed.\nBut that still didn’t take care of the perception problem. Sweeping out the incentivized reviews now means that shoppers won’t see them at all, and won’t question either the product rating or ratings and reviews overall.\nThe sweep, which is ongoing, has also had the effect of putting a halt to companies that started incentivized review businesses. According to Tommy Noonan, ReviewMeta CTO, “It’s obviously not 100 percent perfect. It seems [Amazon has] removed a majority of the incentivized reviews and [has] pretty much put an end to more being created. They effectively killed this industry,”\nHuami’s Amazfit PACE fitness tracker will launch in the U.S. at $129 Amazon has finally banned those pesky ‘incentivized’ reviews Withings’ Steel HR brings smartwatch brains to a gorgeous analog watch",

      "text": "A warehouse the size of eight football pitches will be built on Coventry’s former Jaguar site after planning chiefs gave the green light.\nMore than 1,600 jobs will be created at the 40,000sqm warehouse – which will be home to online retailer Amazon – at the site off Browns Lane.\nAround 150 objections were lodged by angry residents citing issues including noise, pollution and congestion as the plant could welcome lorries 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nHowever, Coventry City Council’s planning committee voted in favour of the plans, which developers say could be up and running in less than a year.\nThe public gallery at the council house was packed to the rafters for the emotion-filled meeting which lasted for around two hours. There were shouts of “shame on you” after committee members granted the plans by six votes to three.\nSpeaking before the vote, Paul Liggins, a resident and member of the Allesley and Coundon Conservation Society, told the planning committee:\nThe Jaguar site on Browns Lane Credit: ITV News Central We are told this is a high quality design which improves the area. But how does a 50ft high tin shed the size of three football pitches improve the area. Some people will say this is NIMBY-ism, but it isn’t. We want the site to be used for manufacturing development.\n– Paul Liggins, Allesley and Coundon Conservation Society Speculation over who would be based at the warehouse has been rife ever since the plans were first revealed. Although council bosses and Amazon remain tight-lipped, the Telegraph understands from sources that the online retailer is the intended user.\nThe site will be the height of three double decker buses and include space for 127 lorries, offices and parking for 700 cars, 36 motorcycles and 64 bicycles.\nCoun Glenn Williams, who represents Bablake ward, challenged the number of jobs that the application will create, stating he believes the real number may be half of the 1,600 estimated.\nCouncillors and residents are not against jobs. We want to see this site developed for skilled, manufacturing and engineering jobs. Large warehouses like this are largely automated and where is the guarantee that these jobs are for Coventry people?\n– Cllr Glenn Williams Giving his support for the plans, Coun Jim O’Boyle, the city council’s cabinet member for jobs, stated the jobs would not include zero hour contracts and he has been “guaranteed that every employee will be able to have an apprenticeship if they want it”.\nHe added: “By granting these plans you give nearly 2,000 young people a job in the city.\n“I believe this is one of the most important planning applications that has come before this committee in the last ten years. We are giving 1,650 people in this city a job. It represents an investment in our city and will be a catalyst for future investment.”\nLast updated Fri 25 Nov 2016 Coventry West Midlands",

      "text": "Amazon and Currys unveil Black Friday deals for the UK Amazon and Currys unveil Black Friday deals for the UK If you're hungering for a deal for your Christmas shopping this week, Amazon and some of the UK's largest tech retailers have you covered. Amazon and Currys unveil Black Friday deals for the UK 0 \nGet your Amazon Echo for less. Photo by CNET \nLove it or hate it, and I suspect that you're in the latter camp, Black Friday has landed in the UK with retailers like Amazon, Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse jumping into fray. No, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to have Black Friday when there's no Thanksgiving before it, but it's still a day to grab great deals. So if you can stomach that sense of rampant materialism, read on. And don't forget to check out CNET's Christmas Gift Guide for fantastic gift ideas. Amazon \nOn Friday, 24 November, Amazon will sell its Amazon Echo speaker for £119.99 (down from £149.99) and the Amazon Echo Dot for £39.99 (saving you £10). \nBoth the Echo and Echo Dot arrived in the UK in September with promises that the Alexa personal assistant would be able to speak like a Brit. Watch our video below to see if that's really true. Can the Amazon Echo speak British? We test out Alexa, Amazon's voice-controlled assistant, to see how well she understands British words, phrases and accents. Tally-ho chaps! by Richard Trenholm ",

      "text": "In the market for a robust budget-conscious Android smartphone this gift-giving season? The popular Moto G4 family includes three such stellar options, and if you’re a proud member of the Amazon Prime club, you can nab the “standard” 32GB SKU for an all-time low price today.\nLockscreen offers and (discreet) ads bring the non-Play, non-Plus 5.5-incher down to just $139.99 with plenty of internal storage space, as well as microSD support. The non-Prime 32GB Moto G4 variant normally costs around $230, so you’re looking at pretty massive $90 savings here.\nIf you want to cough up even less, the fourth-generation Moto G4 Prime Exclusive Edition goes for $129.99 with 16GB local digital hoarding room, down from a $200 list price. But you’ll probably agree 10 extra bucks are money well spent to double that modest ROM.\nMeanwhile, the unlocked low-end Moto G4 Play for all (i.e. not just Amazon Prime subscribers) will set you back $130 after a small $20 discount, and a G4 Plus, again in a non-Prime configuration, can be yours in exchange for $200 with 16GB storage ($50 off list), or $230 when you get a spacious 64GB ROM ($70 savings in store).\nNot exactly the Black Friday deals of a lifetime , which is why they’re not explicitly said to expire later today, but you should still hurry if they tickle your fancy.\nThe post Amazon lets you save up to $90 on Prime exclusive Moto G4 for limited time appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Reply The_Goon Can you control different bulbs with the switch? We already have some colour bulbs and would be good to have a switch to use (turn on and dim, don't need colour from the switch) but obviously this is useless if it's locked to the bulb it comes with or can't be used on colour ones. EDIT: Looks like you can. Also same price at B&Q by the looks of things. Each switch can be used to control up to 10 bulbs without Hue Bridge.. if all paired with Hue Bridge, then it can control as much as bulb as the bridge supports (I think Gen 2 Bridge can pair 50 lights)",

      "text": "The new Amazon Prime commercial this holiday season, featuring a priest and imam meeting for tea, must have hit a nerve for comments to be disabled on the official YouTube video. (Amazon) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   5:48 AM \nIn the UK, Christmas ads are produced and consumed with the same hyper intensity as our Superbowl commercials. Christmas Day in the UK usually involves the family crowding around the television — “Doctor Who,” “Call the Midwife,” and “Downton Abbey” are the most popular Brit programs in the U.S. — so companies from across the pond put some extra muscle into their pitches. \nThe ads typically toss out direct advertising of their store or product in favor of telling a holiday themed story that makes you laugh, cry, or want to sing along. \nHere are some of 2016’s best Christmas ads: \nWhy beloved special ‘A Charlie Brown Christmas' almost never was \nAmazon’s ad is probably the most talked about of the season, considering the heated political climate in the U.S. and in the UK over Islam and immigration. In the ad, a Catholic priest and an Imam — both getting up in age — affectionately find common holy ground and give each other the same gift: a knee cushion/brace for their prayers. It has over a million views on YouTube and comments are disabled. \nCan’t wait for this holiday ad about two faiths coming together to tear us all apart. \nMarks and Spencer “Christmas with love from Mrs. Claus” \nMarks and Spencer gives Mrs. Claus the credit she deserves. Mrs. C saves Christmas for a young boy who wants to surprise his sister with the replacement to the shoes their dog ruined. Mrs. C sends Santa off in his reindeer, then hops in her blazing red helicopter, to get the present under the tree and herself back in her cozy spot all before Santa returns.",

You may be done perusing all the links we provided you but here are two more awesome deals from the top e-commerce site–the Fire Tablet and Fire HD 8 Tablet both below $60.\nThe 7-inch Amazon Fire Tablet was launched with a $49 price tag. It was lowered to $39.99 back in February and now Amazon is slashing a few more dollars off. This Black Friday weekend, the tablet is available for only $33.33. That’s for the Wi-Fi 8GB model. Meanwhile, the all-new Fire HD 8 Tablet Wi-Fi 16GB model is now $59.99, down from the original $89.99.\nTo review, the Amazon Fire Tablet comes equipped with a 7-inch IPS screen, 1.3 GHz quad-core processor, 8GB or 16GB of onboard storage, and microSD card slot for expansion (200GB max). Tablet can last up to 7 hours and allows Prime members unlimited access to Amazon’s massive library of songs, TV shows, movies, Kindle e-books, and videos. Device is ready for the Alexa cloud-based voice service.\nThe all-new Amazon Fire HD8 is slightly bigger. It also lasts longer up to 12 hours.

      "text": "China’s smart home market is anticipated to reach $22.8 billion by 2018, so it’s no wonder they have their virtual assistant. The LingLong DingDong is China’s answer to the Amazon Echo with Alexa.\nSimilar to the Echo, the LingLong can track schedules, play music, and give information about the weather and stocks. This powerful little tool could help introduce voice-activated technology including the Echo into Chinese markets.\nIts design is simple, standing 9.5 inches tall and weighing only three pounds. It features a round top that transitions into a square base and comes in three different colors. Everything about the design is meaningful. The physical design is meant to represent the idea that heaven is round and earth is square, a concept that is central to the design language of the LingLong. The colors also have various meanings: white for purity and red for posterity.\nThe device costs the equivalent of $118 and is available in two languages: Mandarin and Cantonese. Due to the complex nature of each language, it was not feasible to feature them both within the same device. With all the variety in dialect and accent, achieving 100 percent voice recognition was a challenge, but the creators are confident that at least 95 percent of users will be understood.\nMore: Control the new Neato smart vacuum by voice via Alexa\nView photos\nlinglong-dingdong_1 More While development of the LingLong was already underway when the Amazon Echo made its debut in 2014, the creators still looked to the device for inspiration. While they were unable to obtain a physical Echo, they were able to learn from the marketing materials provided by Amazon.\nCharlie Liu, LingLong’s senior marketing manager, said, “Their launch influenced us a lot.” While the LingLong is primarily used to stream music, the company is looking toward the future. They will be unable to expand without third-party support such as Amazon has received for the Echo. Where LingLong has about 10 third-party services, Amazon boasts more than 4,000.\nThe device is not without its setbacks with some users reporting challenges connecting to Wi-Fi and being challenged by certain speech limitations, but they hope with the support of other companies they can continue to improve. The company hopes that one day Amazon will want to launch Echo in China and could use their existing voice engine to do so.\nAs Matt Damon scales ‘The Great Wall,’ China is building a bridge to Hollywood Primed for growth?

      "text": "This embed is invalid\nKNOXVILLE (WATE) — Amazon Prime has a new competitor in the online shopping market: Google Express. Google Express allows shoppers to purchase items from a variety of retailers, like Walgreens, Whole Foods and Bed Bath & Beyond, in one place online. Media General affiliate WATE ordered the same items on both sites on the same day to see how the prices and delivery time compared.\nBefore ordering, shoppers can decide to order as a member or non-member. Membership on both Amazon Prime and Google Express free shipping on eligible orders. It costs $95 dollars a year on Google Express for free shipping. However, for an order to be eligible for free delivery, it has to reach the store minimums before taxes or fees in select delivery areas. Most store minimums are $15. If you are not a member of Google Express, delivery of eligible orders starts at $4.99 from each store you shop. In comparison, a membership on Amazon Prime costs $99 per year. If shoppers do not order as a member, shipping can cost $8.99 for same-day delivery.\nFor this test, WATE ordered the same three items on both sites as a member – hairspray, headphones and dog treats. The total on Google Express was $37.10 after shipping costs and taxes were included. The total on Amazon Prime was $43.26 after shipping costs and taxes were included.\nTwo days after the order, all three items from Google Express arrived. However, only one order from Amazon Prime came. We still had to wait for the hairspray and dog treats from Amazon Prime. Those items came a day later, which was three days after the order was placed.\nFor the three items we purchased, we found Google Express was cheaper and faster than Amazon Prime as a member.\n5 online shopping tips to save you money Shop on the right day : Several studies show that Sunday is the best day to shop for plane tickets. A study released by Airlines Reporting Coporation found the average plane ticket price on Sunday was more than $70 cheaper than the prices on Monday, the most expensive day. Leave items in your cart: Retailers do not like unclosed deals. Stores that will send coupons or deals the next day include JC Penny, Office Max and Bed Bath & Beyond, Find a coupon: Online promo codes and paper coupons are a great way to save money. You can find most promo codes on aggregation sites which include Coupons.com, CouponFollow and DealsPlus. Get more coupons by creating more email addresses: Stores love to send coupons and deals to your email. Imagine how much money you would save if you got several newsletter copies from multiple email accounts. Compare prices: To prevent overpaying, get the PriceBlink browser add-on. It is available for Chrome, Mozilla, and Safari. The browser saves you time by pulling prices for the same product from a number of retailers.

      "title": "This Small Business Saturday, I'm Shopping at Amazon",
      "text": "This Small Business Saturday, I'm Shopping at Amazon Yes, Amazon. Watch Now November 25, 2016 \nSmall Business Saturday is coming. It’s the day after Black Friday and, if it is as successful as last year, it will yield more than $16 billion in sales for small and local merchants across the country. Small Business Saturday is a great marketing promotion that American Express created a few years ago. As a small business owner and one who writes about and speaks to small businesses, I’m a big supporter. \nRelated: 7 Pitfalls to Avoid When Launching on Amazon (Infographic) \nEven so, I’m shopping at Amazon. \nAmazon? Yes. The giant behemoth that’s slaying small businesses left and right? The big company that has put small booksellers, clothing stores, shoe shops and soon (probably) local grocery stores out of business? The giant that builds distribution centers the size of planets filled with products from floor to ceiling that are moved through to shipment by robots instead of people? The evil empire that hopes to deliver products by drone, controls your content and reads your mind using a little box in your living room voiced by that Alexa sexpot? That Amazon? Yes, that Amazon. \nAmazon is a big business. But, like most big businesses, Amazon provides work, sales and jobs for thousands of small businesses and their employees. \nAccording to reports from Fortune and Business Insider 83 percent of Amazon’s products are sold by third party retailers – these are mostly small companies. Its fulfillment services for small merchants delivered more than one billion products in 2015 while helping small businesses who have few resources with storage, delivery and shipping. The company helps their small merchants navigate the complexities of international trade in more than 185 countries. \nRelated: Here's How Amazon is Making Their Fulfillment Businesses More Valuable \nAmazon has a customer reach of more than 50 million with its Prime members . The company provides its resellers with an enormous amount of demographic and sales data to help improve their sales. It also offers marketing and advertising advice for better positioning. In fact, in 2015 the number of sellers using Amazon’s advertising services doubled. The company wants its small merchants to succeed because when they do, it does. \nAnd they do succeed. According to a survey that was done earlier this year by Web Retailer, about a third of the small merchants who sell on Amazon markup their products between 25 and 50 percent. More than a third use the platform to sell used items. Two-thirds rely on Amazon ads to promote their products. These small companies aren’t completely beholden to Amazon either -- 43 percent of them sell their products on other channels like eBay, Rakuten or their own websites. \nAmazon is a big company that provides a livelihood for many small companies. But it’s not just Amazon. All big companies do this. Take a closer look at the largest employers in your hometown -- from Coke to GE to Microsoft to Caterpillar -- and you’ll start to see the microcosm of small organizations that support them. There are landscapers, maintenance services, parts suppliers, staffing firms, transportation companies, training organizations -- the list goes on. \nThe employees who work for these large companies go to their homes after work and order pizza. They go to local restaurants, hire electricians, plumbers and contractors. They get their hair cut, nails done and dry cleaning -- all from local merchants. On Small Business Saturday, these people will be spending their money at these local merchants, from their paychecks earned from their large company employers. \nRelated: If You Aren't Already Prepping for the Holidays, You Should Be \nSmall Business Saturday is a great idea. I am a small business. I love small businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of the country. I could go on and on, and it’s all true. But when you really think about it, what would small businesses be without the big corporations and their employees who use them?

      "text": "Reply Had one of these for about 6 month, I use the pressure cooker, saute and slow cooker features all the time. It's very handy to be able to fry your meat/veg right there in the pot with saute before enabling the pressure or slow cooker. Then when done you can use the saute to get rid of excess liquid. I would suggest you get the glass lid for it though (£12.99), it's a must have imo. Edited By: Gormond on Nov 25, 2016 12:14",

      "text": "November 25, 2016 6:10 pm JST Japan pension titan scoops up more Facebook, Amazon shares \nKENTARO IWAMOTO, Nikkei staff writer GPIF spokesman Shinichiro Mori announces the fund's 2.37 trillion yen quarterly profit in Tokyo on Nov. 25. \nTOKYO -- Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest pension fund, added large batches of Facebook and Amazon shares to its massive portfolio in the year ended in March, according to data released on Friday. \nThis is only the second time the GPIF, which manages 132 trillion yen ($1.16 trillion), has disclosed its stock list. This past July, the world's largest pension fund revealed its holdings as of March 2015. The number of Facebook shares rose 31.4% in the ensuing 12 months, while the Amazon shares increased 19.3%. \nFor much of the year, the global stock market was hampered by China's economic problems and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy. Friday's disclosure shows the Japanese fund increased its holdings in promising IT companies amid the tough conditions. Close A giant \"like\" icon is seen at the Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. \nOverall, the GPIF owned stakes in 2,591 foreign companies at the end of March. Apple remained atop the list in terms of value, with the fund holding 520 billion yen worth of its shares. The GPIF also added to its Apple holdings, which increased at a slower pace of 5.3%. \nThe fund's Facebook shares were worth 234 billion yen, while the value of its Amazon holdings came to 223 billion yen. Those tallies were good enough for sixth and eighth place on the value list, respectively -- up from 19th and 30th the previous year. \nThe GPIF invests in stocks indirectly through other organizations. It explained that some 80% of its stock portfolio is for passive investment, typically index investing. Big companies, therefore, tend to dominate the list. \nAs for Asian stocks, Samsung Electronics ranked 33rd, with shareholdings worth 124 billion yen. That would put the GPIF's stake in the South Korean conglomerate at about 0.6%. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. came next, at 98 billion yen. The fund's holdings in Hong Kong insurer AIA Group were worth 91 billion yen. \nAmong Japanese companies, Toyota Motor led the way, with the fund holding 1.14 trillion yen worth of its shares. \nAlso on Friday, the GPIF posted a 2.37 trillion yen profit for the July-September quarter, marking its first quarterly profit since the October-December term of 2015. The return for the latest quarter was 1.84%. \nShinichiro Mori, a spokesman for the fund, told reporters that Japanese stocks performed well for the quarter, with a return of 7.14%. This boosted the fund's overall performance. \nAs of the end of September, foreign stocks accounted for 21% of the portfolio. Japanese stocks made up 21.59%, domestic bonds amounted to 36.15% and overseas bonds accounted for 12.51%. Asia300 ",

That's $100 or 25% down from the usual retail price of $399.99. Note that the deal is good for the GSM/LTE unlocked version of the Sony Xperia X, a handset that will work on GSM networks such as AT&T and T-Mobile. If you're on Verizon or Sprint, you'll have to look elsewhere. All of the four Sony Xperia X color options - Black, White, Lime Gold, and Rose Gold - are available at this discounted price. At $299.99 unlocked, the Sony Xperia X is an attractive proposition. The raw hardware specs include a 5-inch IPS display running at 1080 by 1920 pixels, Snapdragon 650 chipset with a hexa-core CPU and an Adreno 510 GPU, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of expandable integrated storage space, and a 2620mAh battery. In the camera department, the Xperia X comes with a 23MP primary camera as well as a 13MP secondary sensor on the front.

      "text": "Downloads \n105.3 k Amazon Underground is Amazon Appstore's new official app. Just like the last version, it lets you download thousands of Android apps. Plus, it helps you find deals and apps that are free for a limited time. The app's design is alright; it's not ugly, but it's not all that great to look at either. The drop-down menu on the left side gives you quick access to all of Amazon's sections. However, this seems counterproductive since there are so many sections, it's almost distracting. In addition to Amazon Underground's apps, you can also find washing machines, books, televisions, video game consoles, etc. Amazon Underground is an interesting alternative to Google Play that you can use to download all types of apps. The best part is definitely all the paid versions of apps that are offered for free. Opinions about Amazon Underground No opinions about Amazon Underground . Be the first! Comment",
