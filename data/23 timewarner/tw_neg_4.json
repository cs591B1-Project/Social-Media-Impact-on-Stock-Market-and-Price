      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer Updated \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate Updated: December 7, 2016 — 12:03 AM EST Share MARCY GORDON The Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Published: ",

      "text": "AT&T, Time Warner to Face Questions on Merger at Senate Hearing Updated: December 6, 2016 — 5:24 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Ted Johnson \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The chieftains of AT&T and Time Warner will pitch the benefits of their merger to a Senate antitrust subcommittee on Wednesday, as they face a new regulatory environment of the incoming administration of Donald Trump. \nThe big question is, what will that be? \nDuring the campaign, Trump said that he would block the merger of the two corporate giants, saying that it was \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" But there has been speculation that since he won the presidency, his choices for antitrust enforcement at the Department of Justice will take a much more favorable view of the transaction. \nAt a Business Insider conference on Tuesday, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said that \"anytime the president-elect of the United States comes out and says they are not in favor of something you are trying to do you have to pay attention. That is a serious issue. I really don't know what part of it he was referring to. I hear rumors he is not happy with CNN, that is part of the deal that we are buying. And I don't know how much of that came into play with it.\" \nBut he said that a big factor in why it should be approved is that it is a vertical merger in which neither company competes against the other. \n\"I don't think you can find an example, either in the media and entertainment and the telecom business, where such a merger has been denied,\" he said. \nIn fact, Stephenson said that the incoming administration would be a \"positive development\" that would cut back on unnecessary regulation. \nStephenson donated primarily to Republicans in the most recent cycle, including to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), House Speaker Paul Ryan, and committees to election Senate and House GOP members. He gave $50,000 in September to the Senate Leadership Fund, with a goal of expanding the Republicans' Senate majority. \nOn Wednesday, he will be joined on Capitol Hill by Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, who gave only to Time Warner and cable industry political action committees during the recent campaign. \nAt the Business Insider conference, he dismissed fears that a Trump administration will pose a threat to First Amendment issues. Instead, he said that it was Democrats who posed a threat to the First Amendment because of the party platform that called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling. That relaxed rules that prevented corporate- and union- funded outside groups from spending money on their own media advertising to support or oppose a candidate in the weeks before an election. During the campaign, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton railed against Citizens United for unleashing a cascade of money into politics, while its defenders have treated it as a freedom of speech issue. \nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who chairs the antitrust subcommittee, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), its ranking member, announced the hearing shortly after AT&T and Time Warner unveiled the merger in October. Another member of the committee, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), has said that he has \"serious reservations\" about the transaction. He has grilled representatives from other media companies as they have come before the committee for other mergers, including Comcast and NBCUniversal and later Comcast and Time Warner Cable. \nStephenson and Bewkes will be joined by a panel that includes Mark Cuban, who supports the deal, and Daphna Ziman, the president of Cinemoi, who has recently spoken out against the transaction. Also scheduled is Gene Kimmelman, the president and CEO of Public Knowledge, which also has been critical of the transaction.

      "text": "The top executives of AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) will defend their proposed $85B merger before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today, arguing that by combining, they will \"disrupt\" the long-established cable TV model in ways that will benefit consumers. However, the tie-up has already raised concerns from the right and left and taken flak from President-elect Donald Trump over its potential impacts on the industry as well as its sheer size. Economy\nChina's foreign exchange reserves fell for a fifth straight month in November, tumbling $69.06B to $3.052T - the lowest since March 2011, as authorities struggled to shore up the sliding yuan in the face of a relentlessly rising dollar. Adding to pressure on the currency, President-elect Trump has vowed to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office and threatened to impose huge tariffs on Chinese goods. \nAmid steep falls in business investment, housing construction and public spending, Australia's economy shrank for the first time in more than five years in the third quarter. The local dollar slipped 0.5% to $0.7421 against the greenback after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that GDP fell 0.5% during the period, leaving the year-on year increase at 1.8%. \nThe Reserve Bank of India has kept its policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25%, despite calls for action as an intense cash shortage threatens to slam the brakes on the world's fastest growing major economy. Analysts had expected a rate cut of at least 25 bps after India scrapped two high denomination bank notes to thwart counterfeiters and undo the country's underground economy. \nThe BOJ and the ECB have agreed to launch a joint project to study the possible use of a technology underpinning digital currencies for market infrastructure. The project will look into distributed ledger, a technology best known for supporting bitcoin digital currency, and the two central banks are expected to release their main findings next year. \nUkraine feels \"betrayed\" by the EU for not keeping to a promise to give its citizens visa-free travel in the bloc, deputy foreign minister Olena Zerka and presidential advisor Anders Fogh Rasmussen told Reuters. The nation was promised visa liberalization if it met a number of conditions, including steps to tackle corruption, but it hasn't yet materialized as the EU wants to put an emergency suspension mechanism in place first. \nCuba and the United States will draw up a roadmap for deepening their detente today in the first meeting since the election of Donald Trump and the death of Fidel Castro. The fifth bilateral commission comes at a time of increased uncertainty about normalizing relations given Trump's promise to end ties if Cuba is \"unwilling to make a better deal.\" \nStocks\nItaly is preparing to take a €2B controlling stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (OTCPK: BMDPY ), which the bank hopes will attract private investors to fill the gap in rescue funding. According to Reuters, the government plans to buy junior bonds to boost its stake to 40%, making it the biggest shareholder by far. Questions whether this amounts to state aid will surely arise in Brussels. \nMore action from Margrethe Vestager... The European Commission has fined Credit Agricole ( OTCPK:CRARY ), HSBC (NYSE: HSBC ) and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) a total of €485M for their part in a cartel to fix the Euribor benchmark interest rate. Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB ), RBS , and Societe Generale ( OTCPK:SCGLY ) admitted guilt in December 2013, while Barclays (NYSE: BCS ) avoided a fine because it alerted the Commission. HSBC +1.5% premarket. \nCredit Suisse +4% premarket after the Swiss bank lowered profit targets at its asset management business and ramped up its cost cuts amid challenging conditions in key Asian markets. The move will slash over 6,000 jobs and result in more than 1B Swiss francs in extra cost cuts as Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS ) CEO Tidjane Thiam looks to adjust his turnaround plan. \nIn its first insider trading ruling in two decades, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of prosecutors, saying that gifts of confidential information from business executives to relatives violate securities laws even if the former don't receive anything in return. The case, Salman v. United States, concerned trading by Bassam Salman based on information from his future brother-in-law, then a member of Citigroup's (NYSE: C ) healthcare investment banking group. \nMasterCard is boosting its quarterly dividend by 16% to $0.22 a share and setting aside an additional $4B to buy back stock. Both moves are in line with increases the company made a year ago to its dividend and repurchase plan. The company has about $1.3B left under that authorization and a market capitalization of about $114B. MA +1% premarket. \nBelgian chemicals group Solvay has agreed to sell its Acetow unit, which makes material used in cigarette filters, to Blackstone (NYSE: BX ) for €1B, including debt. \"Acetow is a commodity business that is going through a decreasing market,\" said Pascal Juery, head of the Solvay ( OTCPK:SOLVY ) division. \"It didn't fit the group's strategy anymore.\" \nAmid troubled Project Wing efforts, Alphabet's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) X division plans to create an online exchange named \"Wing Marketplace\" where people can get drone deliveries from retailers and restaurants within minutes, WSJ reports. X would charge customers a $6 drone-delivery fee and has already met with Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ), Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ) and a series of other companies about the project. \nRoyal Dutch Shell and Total will sign initial agreements today to develop oil and gas fields in Iran, in the first European petroleum deals in the country since sanctions eased earlier this year. But the plans open both companies to potential risks from the incoming Trump administration. Though Total (NYSE: TOT ) is French and Shell ( RDS.A , RDS.B ) is jointly headquartered in London and The Hague, both companies have substantial American operations. \nBP is shipping almost 3M barrels of U.S. crude to customers across Asia, pioneering a lengthy and complex operation likely to become more popular after OPEC last week announced deep production cuts. Using its global shipping and trading network, BP was able to grapple with U.S. port limitations and the need to transfer oil between ships off Malaysia to split up cargoes, according to sources in Thomson Reuters Eikon. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4B. Cancel order!\" President-elect Donald Trump tweeted early Tuesday, sending the planemaker's stock down in early trade and igniting a media firestorm. While Boeing doesn't have an actual order to build the plane, it has a $170M contract to begin development work. Shares recovered to end slightly in the green by the market close. \nSouth Korea's Fair Trade Commission will seek criminal charges against five former and current Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) executives and fine the German carmaker's unit 37.3B won ($32M) for false advertising on vehicle emissions. The penalty, a record for false advertising in the Asian country, reflects a toughening stance after South Korea banned most VW sales in August. \nBritain's Competition and Markets Authority has fined Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) a record £84.2M for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy medication by as much as 2,600%. The drugmaker used to market Epanutin itself, but it sold distribution rights to privately-held Flynn in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and its price soared. Pfizer plans to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nBack in September, Square (NYSE: SQ ) rolled out virtual payment cards: Digital debit cards that pull directly from a user's Square Cash account. Now those payment cards work with Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The move means that users can take money from their Square Cash account to buy things anywhere Apple Pay is accepted. \n\"While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined,\" iPhone assembler Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ) is in in preliminary discussions to expand its operations in the United States. On Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Softbank's ( OTCPK:SFTBY ) Masayoshi Son would invest $50B in the U.S. and create an additional 50,000 new jobs, raising new hopes of a Sprint (NYSE: S ) deal with T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ). \nThe upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 may become the next popular phone to forgo the headphone jack, according to SamMobile. The decision will not only help keep the device thin, but will also allow it to pack in a bigger battery. It's also speculated that the Galaxy S8 ( OTC:SSNLF ) is ditching the home button for an optical finger recognition system inside of the display - giving Android users an edge-to-edge screen. \nToday's Markets \nIn Asia , Japan +0.7% .

      "text": "Washington: The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers.\nThey can expect a sceptical audience.\nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion (Dh313.4 billion) merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues.\nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal because it concentrates too much “power in the hands of too few.”\nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump’s public opposition.\nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest US telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it.\nClose scrutiny\nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn’t have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers’ computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner’s programmes and films, hurting consumers.\nBecause of Time Warner’s shows and movies — including Game of Thrones and the Harry Potter films — and AT&T’s ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.\nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition.\nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday’s hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favour.",

      "text": "The top executives of AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) will defend their proposed $85B merger before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today, arguing that by combining, they will \"disrupt\" the long-established cable TV model in ways that will benefit consumers. However, the tie-up has already raised concerns from the right and left and taken flak from President-elect Donald Trump over its potential impacts on the industry as well as its sheer size. Economy\nChina's foreign exchange reserves fell for a fifth straight month in November, tumbling $69.06B to $3.052T - the lowest since March 2011, as authorities struggled to shore up the sliding yuan in the face of a relentlessly rising dollar. Adding to pressure on the currency, President-elect Trump has vowed to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office and threatened to impose huge tariffs on Chinese goods. \nAmid steep falls in business investment, housing construction and public spending, Australia's economy shrank for the first time in more than five years in the third quarter. The local dollar slipped 0.5% to $0.7421 against the greenback after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that GDP fell 0.5% during the period, leaving the year-on year increase at 1.8%. \nThe Reserve Bank of India has kept its policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25%, despite calls for action as an intense cash shortage threatens to slam the brakes on the world's fastest growing major economy. Analysts had expected a rate cut of at least 25 bps after India scrapped two high denomination bank notes to thwart counterfeiters and undo the country's underground economy. \nThe BOJ and the ECB have agreed to launch a joint project to study the possible use of a technology underpinning digital currencies for market infrastructure. The project will look into distributed ledger, a technology best known for supporting bitcoin digital currency, and the two central banks are expected to release their main findings next year. \nUkraine feels \"betrayed\" by the EU for not keeping to a promise to give its citizens visa-free travel in the bloc, deputy foreign minister Olena Zerka and presidential advisor Anders Fogh Rasmussen told Reuters. The nation was promised visa liberalization if it met a number of conditions, including steps to tackle corruption, but it hasn't yet materialized as the EU wants to put an emergency suspension mechanism in place first. \nCuba and the United States will draw up a roadmap for deepening their detente today in the first meeting since the election of Donald Trump and the death of Fidel Castro. The fifth bilateral commission comes at a time of increased uncertainty about normalizing relations given Trump's promise to end ties if Cuba is \"unwilling to make a better deal.\" \nStocks\nItaly is preparing to take a €2B controlling stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (OTCPK: BMDPY ), which the bank hopes will attract private investors to fill the gap in rescue funding. According to Reuters, the government plans to buy junior bonds to boost its stake to 40%, making it the biggest shareholder by far. Questions whether this amounts to state aid will surely arise in Brussels. \nMore action from Margrethe Vestager... The European Commission has fined Credit Agricole ( OTCPK:CRARY ), HSBC (NYSE: HSBC ) and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) a total of €485M for their part in a cartel to fix the Euribor benchmark interest rate. Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB ), RBS , and Societe Generale ( OTCPK:SCGLY ) admitted guilt in December 2013, while Barclays (NYSE: BCS ) avoided a fine because it alerted the Commission. HSBC +1.5% premarket. \nCredit Suisse +4% premarket after the Swiss bank lowered profit targets at its asset management business and ramped up its cost cuts amid challenging conditions in key Asian markets. The move will slash over 6,000 jobs and result in more than 1B Swiss francs in extra cost cuts as Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS ) CEO Tidjane Thiam looks to adjust his turnaround plan. \nIn its first insider trading ruling in two decades, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of prosecutors, saying that gifts of confidential information from business executives to relatives violate securities laws even if the former don't receive anything in return. The case, Salman v. United States, concerned trading by Bassam Salman based on information from his future brother-in-law, then a member of Citigroup's (NYSE: C ) healthcare investment banking group. \nMasterCard is boosting its quarterly dividend by 16% to $0.22 a share and setting aside an additional $4B to buy back stock. Both moves are in line with increases the company made a year ago to its dividend and repurchase plan. The company has about $1.3B left under that authorization and a market capitalization of about $114B. MA +1% premarket. \nBelgian chemicals group Solvay has agreed to sell its Acetow unit, which makes material used in cigarette filters, to Blackstone (NYSE: BX ) for €1B, including debt. \"Acetow is a commodity business that is going through a decreasing market,\" said Pascal Juery, head of the Solvay ( OTCPK:SOLVY ) division. \"It didn't fit the group's strategy anymore.\" \nAmid troubled Project Wing efforts, Alphabet's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) X division plans to create an online exchange named \"Wing Marketplace\" where people can get drone deliveries from retailers and restaurants within minutes, WSJ reports. X would charge customers a $6 drone-delivery fee and has already met with Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ), Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ) and a series of other companies about the project. \nRoyal Dutch Shell and Total will sign initial agreements today to develop oil and gas fields in Iran, in the first European petroleum deals in the country since sanctions eased earlier this year. But the plans open both companies to potential risks from the incoming Trump administration. Though Total (NYSE: TOT ) is French and Shell ( RDS.A , RDS.B ) is jointly headquartered in London and The Hague, both companies have substantial American operations. \nBP is shipping almost 3M barrels of U.S. crude to customers across Asia, pioneering a lengthy and complex operation likely to become more popular after OPEC last week announced deep production cuts. Using its global shipping and trading network, BP was able to grapple with U.S. port limitations and the need to transfer oil between ships off Malaysia to split up cargoes, according to sources in Thomson Reuters Eikon. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4B. Cancel order!\" President-elect Donald Trump tweeted early Tuesday, sending the planemaker's stock down in early trade and igniting a media firestorm. While Boeing doesn't have an actual order to build the plane, it has a $170M contract to begin development work. Shares recovered to end slightly in the green by the market close. \nSouth Korea's Fair Trade Commission will seek criminal charges against five former and current Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) executives and fine the German carmaker's unit 37.3B won ($32M) for false advertising on vehicle emissions. The penalty, a record for false advertising in the Asian country, reflects a toughening stance after South Korea banned most VW sales in August. \nBritain's Competition and Markets Authority has fined Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) a record £84.2M for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy medication by as much as 2,600%. The drugmaker used to market Epanutin itself, but it sold distribution rights to privately-held Flynn in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and its price soared. Pfizer plans to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nBack in September, Square (NYSE: SQ ) rolled out virtual payment cards: Digital debit cards that pull directly from a user's Square Cash account. Now those payment cards work with Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The move means that users can take money from their Square Cash account to buy things anywhere Apple Pay is accepted. \n\"While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined,\" iPhone assembler Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ) is in in preliminary discussions to expand its operations in the United States. On Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Softbank's ( OTCPK:SFTBY ) Masayoshi Son would invest $50B in the U.S. and create an additional 50,000 new jobs, raising new hopes of a Sprint (NYSE: S ) deal with T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ). \nThe upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 may become the next popular phone to forgo the headphone jack, according to SamMobile. The decision will not only help keep the device thin, but will also allow it to pack in a bigger battery. It's also speculated that the Galaxy S8 ( OTC:SSNLF ) is ditching the home button for an optical finger recognition system inside of the display - giving Android users an edge-to-edge screen. \n  +0.7% .

      "text": "The top executives of AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) will defend their proposed $85B merger before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today, arguing that by combining, they will \"disrupt\" the long-established cable TV model in ways that will benefit consumers. However, the tie-up has already raised concerns from the right and left and taken flak from President-elect Donald Trump over its potential impacts on the industry as well as its sheer size. Economy\nChina's foreign exchange reserves fell for a fifth straight month in November, tumbling $69.06B to $3.052T - the lowest since March 2011, as authorities struggled to shore up the sliding yuan in the face of a relentlessly rising dollar. Adding to pressure on the currency, President-elect Trump has vowed to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office and threatened to impose huge tariffs on Chinese goods. \nAmid steep falls in business investment, housing construction and public spending, Australia's economy shrank for the first time in more than five years in the third quarter. The local dollar slipped 0.5% to $0.7421 against the greenback after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that GDP fell 0.5% during the period, leaving the year-on year increase at 1.8%. \nThe Reserve Bank of India has kept its policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25%, despite calls for action as an intense cash shortage threatens to slam the brakes on the world's fastest growing major economy. Analysts had expected a rate cut of at least 25 bps after India scrapped two high denomination bank notes to thwart counterfeiters and undo the country's underground economy. \nThe BOJ and the ECB have agreed to launch a joint project to study the possible use of a technology underpinning digital currencies for market infrastructure. The project will look into distributed ledger, a technology best known for supporting bitcoin digital currency, and the two central banks are expected to release their main findings next year. \nUkraine feels \"betrayed\" by the EU for not keeping to a promise to give its citizens visa-free travel in the bloc, deputy foreign minister Olena Zerka and presidential advisor Anders Fogh Rasmussen told Reuters. The nation was promised visa liberalization if it met a number of conditions, including steps to tackle corruption, but it hasn't yet materialized as the EU wants to put an emergency suspension mechanism in place first. \nCuba and the United States will draw up a roadmap for deepening their detente today in the first meeting since the election of Donald Trump and the death of Fidel Castro. The fifth bilateral commission comes at a time of increased uncertainty about normalizing relations given Trump's promise to end ties if Cuba is \"unwilling to make a better deal.\" \nStocks\nItaly is preparing to take a €2B controlling stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (OTCPK: BMDPY ), which the bank hopes will attract private investors to fill the gap in rescue funding. According to Reuters, the government plans to buy junior bonds to boost its stake to 40%, making it the biggest shareholder by far. Questions whether this amounts to state aid will surely arise in Brussels. \nMore action from Margrethe Vestager... The European Commission has fined Credit Agricole ( OTCPK:CRARY ), HSBC (NYSE: HSBC ) and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) a total of €485M for their part in a cartel to fix the Euribor benchmark interest rate. Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB ), RBS , and Societe Generale ( OTCPK:SCGLY ) admitted guilt in December 2013, while Barclays (NYSE: BCS ) avoided a fine because it alerted the Commission. HSBC +1.5% premarket. \nCredit Suisse +4% premarket after the Swiss bank lowered profit targets at its asset management business and ramped up its cost cuts amid challenging conditions in key Asian markets. The move will slash over 6,000 jobs and result in more than 1B Swiss francs in extra cost cuts as Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS ) CEO Tidjane Thiam looks to adjust his turnaround plan. \nIn its first insider trading ruling in two decades, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of prosecutors, saying that gifts of confidential information from business executives to relatives violate securities laws even if the former don't receive anything in return. The case, Salman v. United States, concerned trading by Bassam Salman based on information from his future brother-in-law, then a member of Citigroup's (NYSE: C ) healthcare investment banking group. \nMasterCard is boosting its quarterly dividend by 16% to $0.22 a share and setting aside an additional $4B to buy back stock. Both moves are in line with increases the company made a year ago to its dividend and repurchase plan. The company has about $1.3B left under that authorization and a market capitalization of about $114B. MA +1% premarket. \nBelgian chemicals group Solvay has agreed to sell its Acetow unit, which makes material used in cigarette filters, to Blackstone (NYSE: BX ) for €1B, including debt. \"Acetow is a commodity business that is going through a decreasing market,\" said Pascal Juery, head of the Solvay ( OTCPK:SOLVY ) division. \"It didn't fit the group's strategy anymore.\" \nAmid troubled Project Wing efforts, Alphabet's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) X division plans to create an online exchange named \"Wing Marketplace\" where people can get drone deliveries from retailers and restaurants within minutes, WSJ reports. X would charge customers a $6 drone-delivery fee and has already met with Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ), Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ) and a series of other companies about the project. \nRoyal Dutch Shell and Total will sign initial agreements today to develop oil and gas fields in Iran, in the first European petroleum deals in the country since sanctions eased earlier this year. But the plans open both companies to potential risks from the incoming Trump administration. Though Total (NYSE: TOT ) is French and Shell ( RDS.A , RDS.B ) is jointly headquartered in London and The Hague, both companies have substantial American operations. \nBP is shipping almost 3M barrels of U.S. crude to customers across Asia, pioneering a lengthy and complex operation likely to become more popular after OPEC last week announced deep production cuts. Using its global shipping and trading network, BP was able to grapple with U.S. port limitations and the need to transfer oil between ships off Malaysia to split up cargoes, according to sources in Thomson Reuters Eikon. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4B. Cancel order!\" President-elect Donald Trump tweeted early Tuesday, sending the planemaker's stock down in early trade and igniting a media firestorm. While Boeing doesn't have an actual order to build the plane, it has a $170M contract to begin development work. Shares recovered to end slightly in the green by the market close. \nSouth Korea's Fair Trade Commission will seek criminal charges against five former and current Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) executives and fine the German carmaker's unit 37.3B won ($32M) for false advertising on vehicle emissions. The penalty, a record for false advertising in the Asian country, reflects a toughening stance after South Korea banned most VW sales in August. \nBritain's Competition and Markets Authority has fined Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) a record £84.2M for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy medication by as much as 2,600%. The drugmaker used to market Epanutin itself, but it sold distribution rights to privately-held Flynn in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and its price soared. Pfizer plans to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nBack in September, Square (NYSE: SQ ) rolled out virtual payment cards: Digital debit cards that pull directly from a user's Square Cash account. Now those payment cards work with Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The move means that users can take money from their Square Cash account to buy things anywhere Apple Pay is accepted. \n\"While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined,\" iPhone assembler Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ) is in in preliminary discussions to expand its operations in the United States. On Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Softbank's ( OTCPK:SFTBY ) Masayoshi Son would invest $50B in the U.S. and create an additional 50,000 new jobs, raising new hopes of a Sprint (NYSE: S ) deal with T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ). \nThe upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 may become the next popular phone to forgo the headphone jack, according to SamMobile. The decision will not only help keep the device thin, but will also allow it to pack in a bigger battery. It's also speculated that the Galaxy S8 ( OTC:SSNLF ) is ditching the home button for an optical finger recognition system inside of the display - giving Android users an edge-to-edge screen. \nToday's Markets \nIn Asia , Japan +0.7% .

It will have to get approval from federal regulators before it is complete.

The head of the Japanese investment firm Masayoshi Son made the announcement with President-elect Donald Trump in New York.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers.\nThey can expect a skeptical audience.\nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues.\nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal because it concentrates too much “power in the hands of too few.”\nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump’s public opposition.\nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it.\nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn’t have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers’ computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner’s programs and films, hurting consumers.\nBecause of Time Warner’s shows and movies — including “Game of Thrones” and the “Harry Potter” films — and AT&T’s ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.\nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition.\nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday’s hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor.",

The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. The CEOs, Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016, before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \nWASHINGTON | The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal because it concentrates too much “power in the hands of too few.” \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump’s public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn’t have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers’ computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner’s programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner’s shows and movies — including “Game of Thrones” and the “Harry Potter” films — and AT&T’s ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday’s hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Innovation or a monopoly?

      "title": "AT&T-Time Warner Merger: 4 Obstacles Faced as a Battle for Trump's Blessing Begins",
      "text": "COMMENTS Getty; iStock Hearings kick off for the $85.4 billion deal as it confronts intense scrutiny from lawmakers and an unexpected president, who has previously pushed back against the proposal as \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nWhen the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee summoned the CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner to testify Dec. 7 about their proposed merger, it mistakenly sent an invite to former Time Warner Cable CEO Robert Marcus. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes later was invited, but the error might be a metaphor for the intricacies and confusion surrounding the planned $85.4 billion deal. \nNow Bewkes and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson are beginning the long process of government approval under an Obama administration, but will conclude it under President-elect Donald Trump. During his campaign, Trump called AT&T-Time Warner \"a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" But Bewkes told Wall Street analysts Dec. 6 that \"when it becomes clear what we're doing, it will become clear to everyone that it will be pro-competitive, pro-consumer and improve competition in advertising.\" \nHere are four top obstacles AT&T and Time Warner face: \n1. TRUMP'S TEMPER \nAT&T's lobbying apparatus is legendary. It spent $12.7 million in 2016, about six times what Time Warner spent. But the telecom noticeably was biased against Trump: Its employees and PAC gave his campaign $22,219 compared with $289,931 for Hillary Clinton. If Trump's initial Cabinet appointments are any indication, he doesn't forget his friends and foes. Further, Trump has accused Time Warner's CNN of unfair coverage (though he has close ties with its leader, Jeff Zucker). AT&T's 100 lobbyists, therefore, have some serious fence-mending ahead. Trump's objections, though, are meaningful due to optics more than process, says Tomer Sade, CEO of Wise Data Media. \"It absolutely means something as consumers are eager to find out what happens next,\" he says. \n2. LAWMAKER LAMENT \nBeyond convincing the Federal Trade Commission and senators — including liberal antitrust subcommittee member Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., who has said he is \"skeptical\"— the companies must woo the Department of Justice. (It's unclear what Trump nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., thinks of the deal.) \"We have seen Trump say one thing and do another, so it's not clear what will happen at the FTC,\" explains Aija Leiponen, professor of economics at Cornell University. The FCC also would need to bless a merger if it involves the transfer of broadcast licenses, though Time Warner likely will sell its lone TV station, thus avoiding such scrutiny. And even then, the FCC might choose to weigh in with a nonbinding opinion. \n3. DIVERSITY DILEMMAS \nSimilar to Comcast's 2013 purchase of NBCUniversal, lawmakers may demand the companies recommit to diversity, including more nonwhites in executive ranks, movies and TV shows. Worse, the committee might choose to punish AT&T and Time Warner for the relative inaction by Comcast on those promises. Activists such as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson likely will weigh in, as they did with Comcast-NBCU. \n4. CONSUMER CONCERNS \nOn Nov. 30, AT&T launched DirecTV Now, a streaming TV service that will be \"zero rated\" for AT&T customers, meaning they won't be charged for the extra data used to watch content on mobile devices, while customers of other services will. The deal has little to do with the service, notes former FCC official Fred Campbell, now a director at Tech Knowledge, but net neutrality advocates will object. He says: \"If you're opposed to the merger and the facts and laws aren't on your side, you look for a popular hook. With zero rating, you've got some built-in noisemaking.\" \nA version of this story first appeared in the Dec. 16 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.",

      "text": "Jeffrey Bewkes, chairman and CEO of Time Warner (Photo: Lionel Cironneau / AP) \nWashington — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers.\nThey can expect a skeptical audience.\nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues.\nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal because it concentrates too much “power in the hands of too few.”\nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump’s public opposition.\nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it.\nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn’t have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers’ computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner’s programs and films, hurting consumers.\nBecause of Time Warner’s shows and movies — including “Game of Thrones” and the “Harry Potter” films — and AT&T’s ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.\nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition.\nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday’s hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor.",

      "text": "By MARCY GORDON\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers.\nThey can expect a skeptical audience.\nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues.\nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\"\nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition.\nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it.\nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers.\nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.\nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition.\nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor.\n__\nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.\n ",

They can expect a skeptical audience. The CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. Other critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump , who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" Stephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition.

(AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, File) \nWASHINGTON • The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers.",

Baig , USA TODAY 10:09 a.m. EST December 7, 2016 Randall Stephenson, CEO of AT&T (Photo: Win McNamee) \nNEW YORK—AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and his Time Warner counterpart Jeffrey Bewkes are Capitol Hill-bound Wednesday morning as the two top executives attempt to convince a Senate subcommittee that their proposed $85.4 billion merger will ultimately be good for consumers. \nIt won’t be an easy sell. \nSeveral GOP and Democratic lawmakers have voiced antitrust concerns surrounding the proposed merger, as did candidate Donald Trump who said the blockbuster deal would concentrate too much power in the hands of too few. \nIn this June 18, 2014, file photo, Jeffrey Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, attends the Cannes Lions 2014, 61st International Advertising Festival in Cannes, southern France. The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. The CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016, before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. (AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, File) ORG XMIT: CAET552 (Photo: Lionel Cironneau, AP) \nBut AT&T has expressed optimism that regulators would ultimately decide in its favor. The Justice Dept. in a new Trump administration is expected to take the lead on the deal, though the Federal Communications Commission may also weigh in. \nThe billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks Mark Cuban is also scheduled to appear before Senate subcommittee, apparently as a proponent of the deal. \nTelecom giant AT&T is the nation’s second largest wireless carrier and also a major player in the pay-TV space as the owner of DirecTV. Time Warner has HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN among the assets in its entertainment and media portfolio. A potential concern is that AT&T might give preferential treatment to its own content, either by withholding access or raising the costs of such programming to rivals. \nHow Donald Trump as president might view big time mergers remains to be seen. The President-elect met with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Sun on Tuesday, possibly raising the possiblity that the thwarted merger talks between T-Mobile, and Softbank-owned Sprint might be revived. \nFollow USA TODAY tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Published December 07, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Time Warner Inc CEO Jeff Bewkes discuss his companies proposed merger with AT&T at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S., October 25, 2016.  (Reuters) \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes believes the Democratic Party was a bigger threat the the First Amendment during the 2016 election, not Donald Trump.\nBewkes was asked about the President-elect's campaign promise to open up libel laws at Business Insider's IGNITION conference.\n\"Do you worry about that at all,\" Business Insider's Henry Blodget asked Bewkes of Trump's threats towards CNN which is owned by Time Warner. The then-candidate said he wanted to change American libel laws to make it more difficult for the press to publish inaccurate stories.\nBewkes responded saying he doesn't \"think that's a serious thing\" and that if anyone is trying to change free speech it's the Democrats who \"had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform.\"\nBewkes was referring to Hillary Clinton's campaign platform to overturn the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling which stated that free speech extends to unions and corporations.\n\"And that was worrying me more,\" Bewkes said. \"The press tends to miss that because they tend to lean that way, and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing — I think overly charitably — as something in cleaning up money in politics when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices.\"\n\"Democrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo,\" the Democratic Party's 2016 platform stated .\n\"So I thought the real threat to the First Amendment came from the Democrats' side more,\" Bewkes concluded. \"There's not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.\"",

      "text": "Mark Cuban tells Washington to let AT&T buy Time Warner, so they can compete with Google and Facebook And Snapchat, and Apple, and Amazon, and Microsoft... Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images AT&T needs to buy Time Warner, says Mark Cuban. The investor and reality TV star thinks Washington should sign off on AT&T’s proposed $86 billion Time Warner deal, so the combined company can compete with the likes of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon. He is making the argument today at a Senate hearing, where other witnesses include AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes. Cuban’s argument isn’t a surprise, since he made the same case to Recode’s Kara Swisher last month . But now you can read an expanded version of it, via the prepared remarks he submitted to the Senate judiciary committee this morning; it’s embedded at the bottom of this post. The tldr: “We need more companies... with the ability to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Delivering content to consumers in this app driven world is not easy, it is very expensive and difficult... Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete with any of the companies I've mentioned. Together it will be still be difficult, but a combined entity at least gives them a chance to battle the dominant players in the market place and increase consumer choice and competition for consumer attention.” And here’s a new wrinkle we haven’t heard from Cuban before: Letting AT&T buy Time Warner is good for beer drinkers who want to pick which show they want to watch. “I would also like to point out one other important element of consumer choice that an AT&T and Time Warner merger would improve. Each of the largest content companies I have mentioned so far, FaceBook, Google, Amazon, MicroSoft and Apple present much if not all of their content algorithmically. As a FaceBook user I don’t get to pick what content I get to see in my newsfeed. I can try to influence it, but FaceBook algorithms control what I see. In the future, it won’t be algorithms that choose what we see, our choices will be driven by some form of Artificial Intelligence learning from trillions of disparate inputs. Meanwhile, for those of us who still enjoy our TV the old fashioned way, on our couch, cold beverage in one hand and remote in the other, there is a lot to be said for having a company that can afford to continue to offer us that choice. As much of a geek as I am, I like having the choice of searching through a programming guide to see what’s on rather than an algorithm telling me what I should watch. I think a lot of consumers would like to see that choice continue as well.”",

      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer 10 hrs ago ( … ) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.",

      "text": "Cinémoi's Ziman Slams White Male AT&T-Time Warner Witness Table Exec takes deal complaints to Hill in person 12/07/2016 9:19 AM Eastern Follow @eggerton Dapna Ziman, president of Cinémoi, participated in an April FCC workshop on access to indepedendent programming. \nDaphna Ziman, president of Cinémoi, the women-owned high-end lifestyle programming network, is taking her complaints about the AT&T-Time Warner Inc. merger to Capitol Hill in person, and even has a complaint about the other panelists at a Hill hearing where she is testifying. \n\nZiman is a witness in the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee hearing Wednesday (Dec. 7) on the proposed merger, and according to a copy of her testimony for the hearing obtained by Multichannel News , she will testify that the merger will make an already tough environment for independent programmers that much tougher. \n\nZiman also will take aim at the diversity, or lack of it, of the other witnesses at the hearing. \"The idea that opportunity is lacking for women and minorities in media isn't hypothetical, it is very clearly symbolized by the witnesses here today.\" \n\nScheduled witnesses for the deal are Gene Kimmelman of Public Knowledge, billionaire media entrepreneur Mark Cuban, Time Warner's Jeff Bewkes and AT&T's Randall Stephenson. \n\n\"Look at the panel testifying today,\" her testimony reads. \"It is supposed to represent a broad cross section of the media industry, yet it is dominated by white men.\" \n\n\"This vertical transaction does not do anything to eliminate the challenges in the pay TV marketplace, but it does give AT&T the means and incentive to discriminate against independent programmers like Cinémoi,\" her planned testimony says. \n\nZiman last week sent letters to members of Congress outlining her concerns. \n\nZiman says in her testimony that Cinémoi competes with Time Warner's Turner Classic Movies and that \"when AT&T owns Time Warner, if an independent network begins to win market share, AT&T’s best recourse is not more investment in Time Warner channels, it is to eliminate the competitive threat by restricting an independent network’s access to viewers.\" \n\nZiman also cites the FCC's current signal that AT&T's DirecTV Now zero-rating business plan could disadvantage competing content and thus violate net-neutrality rules. Zima says zero rating \"creates an artificial incentive for consumers to stream TCM over Cinémoi \" given that the former would not count against their data caps and the latter would. \n\nShe also says in her testimony that if the Trump Administration rolls back the FCC's network-neutrality rules, as it is expected to, the combined company \"will have every incentive to demand payment from Cinémoi just so AT&T Internet customers receive a watchable stream.\" \n\nIt is not yet clear whether AT&T and Time Warner will have to seek FCC approval of the deal -- an AT&T source said it remained an open question and that AT&T still may submit the deal to the FCC. AT&T only has a handful of satellite licenses -- for internal communications, between CNN news trucks and studios, for example. If there is a way to get out from under those, the deal would only get an antitrust review at Justice rather than the public-interest review at the FCC, though the FCC would likely contribute its expertise to a DOJ review anyway. \n\nZiman slammed that prospect: \"AT&T is doing everything in its power to avoid a review by the FCC, the one agency that will review this merger through a public-interest lens. So, the question for policy makers is this – does a company that will go to great lengths to avoid public-interest scrutiny really care about diversity?\" \n\nZiman is a familiar indie access advocate in D.C. She was among the panelists at an FCC workshop last April on issues related to independent programmers and access to distribution. Want to read more stories like this? Get our Free Newsletter Here!

      "text": "The top executives at Time Warner and AT&T went to Capitol Hill Wednesday to make their case for a proposed $85.4 billion merger between the companies. In a written statement submitted to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the deal would result in myriad benefits for the consumer. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers, and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said. \nJeff Bewkes, the CEO of Time Warner, echoed that, saying the deal would be good for the companies and for consumers. \n\"We believe that combining Time Warner's ability to create great video content with AT&T's physical distribution in satellite, broadband, and mobile, will help us bring consumers more choices in how they enjoy their favorite TV shows, films, video games, and other content from Time Warner and a vast array of other creators -- and do so more quickly,\" Bewkes said. \"By joining forces, we will accelerate the development and delivery of the next generation of video services that provide consumers with greater choice, convenience, value, and affordability.\" \nCritics of the proposed merger have raised concerns that the deal would concentrate too much power and could actually raise prices for consumers. Sen. Al Franken (D-MN), a member of the subcommittee, said in October that he had \"serious reservations\" about the deal, which he said \"could have a lasting effect on the quality and affordability of programming available to consumers across America.\" \n\"And I'm skeptical of any further consolidation in the media and telecommunications industries that could lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service for Americans,\" Franken said at the time. \nThe fate of the merger appeared uncertain last month after Donald Trump pulled off a stunning upset over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Trump had criticized the deal on the campaign trail, describing it as \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" Positioning himself as a working class champion, Trump said the merger was \"an example of the power structure I am fighting.\" \nSince the election, however, many analysts have come to believe that the incoming administration -- already filled with elite billionaires -- will actually support the merger. \n\"AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner likely has a higher probability of getting approved given the impending power shift in Washington, D.C.,\" Eric Handler of MKM Partners said last month. \"We now view the likelihood of AT&T/Time Warner getting approved as a 70/30 proposition based on a recent expert discussion we held.\" \nBewkes and Stephenson have also expressed optimism about the merger's prospects for approval . Appearing at the Business Insider Ignition conference in Manhattan on Tuesday, Stephenson said \"the merits of the law suggest it's a deal that gets done.\" \n\"This is a vertical merger,\" he said. \"We compete nowhere. I don't think you can find an example where such a merger has been denied... Generally, vertical mergers are viewed as consumer friendly.\" \nStephenson also suggested that Trump's opposition to the deal as a candidate may have stemmed from his ill-will toward CNN, which is owned by Time Warner. \n\"Look, anytime the president of the United States comes out and says they're not in favor of what you're trying to do, you have to pay attention,\" he said. \"But I don't know what part of the deal he's referring to. I've heard rumors he's not happy with CNN, so that might have come into it.\" \nStephenson said in his written statement on Wednesday that AT&T is \"committed to continuing the editorial independence of CNN.\" \n\"That independence is what makes CNN so popular and valuable, and we will not do anything to change that,\" he said. \nCNNMoney (New York)   10:30 AM ET",

(AP Photo/Lionel Cironneau, File) \nThe CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are telling Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony that, \"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband.\" \nStephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes are making their case before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, saying that the deal will lead to new innovation, and that it will better serve consumers.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Tags",

      "text": "Innovation or monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend deal By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nThe panel's chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues. \nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony. \nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump. \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate subcommittee doesn't possess the authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to question why the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers, among other things. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films. \nThat, critics say, could limit consumer choice. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO, would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, joined the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He says the merger would enhance competition. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray \nKicking off a day of testimony by AT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) regarding their proposed combination, Mark Cuban , who once sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo! ( YHOO ) for a lot of money, told Congress why the deal should be allowed. \nCuban, reading from prepared remarks, painted for the Congress a picture of a media landscape dominated by a handful of big companies who control content today, chief among them Facebook ( FB ), but also Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google , because they dominate the apps that people use to “avoid boredom.”\nCuban said that TV was always the dominant medium because it allowed people to avoid boredom “while pretending we were doing something.”\n“The idea TV is the dominant content delivery medium no longer is valid,” said Cuban.\nFacebook, and smartphone apps, and virtual reality platforms such as Facebook’s Oculus Rift headset, now offer consumers “any kind of content, in any manner the consumer would like to receive it,” better than television can do.\n“Facebook is in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for delivery of content.”\nCuban told congressmen to imagine what would have happened had Facebook not bought WhatsApp, Oculus, and Instagram. “The market would be far more competitive,” he concluded.\nIn addition, said Cuban, “ Snapchat is taking over millennials as the best alternative to boredom.”\nAmidst all this, “TV is losing viewers to other dominant content players,” he said, citing Apple, and Google’s YouTube . He made a point of noting that YouTube, for instance, was an “acquired property.” He also referred to Google’s search business as the “ultimate programming guide.” \nCuban said it was serious that there are “Two companies, Google and Apple, that are the sole gatekeepers to content.”\nHe then went on to say that “Neither AT&T nor Time Warner are “in any sort of dominant position,” and that “alone they will have a very difficult time controlling their destinies.”\n“We need more companies to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon ( AMZN ) and Facebook,” continued Cuban. “They have all established dominant positions, and that’s why this is an important, strategic content acquisition.”\n“Together, they will have a chance to battle the dominant players,” he concluded of AT&T and Time Warner.",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) By MARCY GORDON The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nThe CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nThe panel's chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues. \nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony. \nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump , who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump. \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate subcommittee doesn't possess the authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to question why the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers, among other things. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films. \nThat, critics say, could limit consumer choice. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO, would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, joined the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He says the merger would enhance competition. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Copyright The Associated Press \nThere are no comments yet.

AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend deal Posted: By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nThe panel's chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues. \nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony. \nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump. \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators.

Live Live Analysis: AT&T-Time Warner Merger Hearing Last Updated Dec 7, 2016 at 11:20 am ET \nCEOs Randall Stephenson and Jeffrey Bewkes are among the witnesses testifying at the hearing. SHARE \nAT&T's Stephenson Promises 'Better Priced Options' Than Today \nWhy a Merger Deal Instead of a Content Partnership? \nSen. Lee to Witnesses: Talk to Me About Lower Prices \nChart: Media Behemoths \nCinémoi Chief Emphasizes Impact of Diversity of Programming \nDeal Opponent Kimmelman: 'Too Few Players Already' See only Highlights Highlights AT&T's Stephenson Promises 'Better Priced Options' Than Today \nMs. Klobuchar pushes AT&T on whether this merger specifically would lower prices to consumers on cable, mobile phone and other products. \nMr. Stephenson says through the \"virtue of innovation,\" that \"we will bring the consumer better priced options than they have today.\" \n\"We're going against a cable provider to compete,\" he says, noting that the company is likely to be competing against entrenched cable distribution companies. Byron Tau Highlights Why a Merger Deal Instead of a Content Partnership? \nMr. Kimmelman makes the point that the stated benefits of this deal could also come from partnerships between the companies, rather than through an outright merger that might risk less consumer-friendly behavior. This point, that AT&T could gain access to differentiated content by reaching some sort of agreement with Time Warner, was made by some on Wall Street just after the deal was announced. AT&T has countered that it can move faster with “innovation” by owning the company, but it hasn’t given details on what types of services could come from this. Byron Tau Twitter Bew-Kuss Not Byooks \nOops. Mr. Lee keeps pronouncing Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes’s name as “Byooks.” It’s actually pronounced “Bew-Kuss.” From a fellow hard-to-pronounce last name, you’re welcome, Mr. Bewkes. Shalini Ramachandran Highlights Sen. Lee to Witnesses: Talk to Me About Lower Prices \nMr. Lee, the chairman of the subcommittee, asks Mr. Stephenson, the AT&T executive, how the merger would benefit customers in the form of lower prices. \nMr. Stephenson points to the AT&T acquisition of DirecTV which now offers customers the chance to subscribe and consumer mobile content on their phone through a new product called DirecTV Now. He says that innovation and bundling could bring down prices for consumers. \nMr. Kimmelman says that AT&T could contract with services to offer similar bundles rather than a merger. Byron Tau \nHere's a chart we ran in October on media concentration: Highlights Twitter Cinémoi's Ziman Points to Conglomerates' Control \nMs. Ziman, president of the network Cinémoi, notes that “90% of the content on TV is controlled by six conglomerates,” and the merger could disadvantage independently-owned networks. While the internet TV market offers new business opportunities for small channels, she notes that “relying on OTT [over-the-top internet distribution] is a one-way ticket to bankruptcy,” because linear television distribution is still so important for reaching consumers. Pointing to the panel, “dominated by white men,” she says “the idea that opportunity is lacking for women and minority in media isn’t hypothetical.” Shalini Ramachandran Highlights Cinémoi Chief Emphasizes Impact of Diversity of Programming \nMs. Ziman, president of the network Cinémoi, is offering up her thoughts on the impact of the merger on the diversity of independent programming — including on minority or women-owned networks and programming. \n\"More consolidation is not the answer,\" she says, adding that the survival of independent programming is already tenuous in the current marketplace and the merger could make it worse. She adds that the merger could hurt minority and women-owned voices. \n\"Women deserve presence in the media. The airwaves AT&T utilizes belongs to the American people,\" she says. Byron Tau Reporters Pressed AT&T's Stephenson Ahead of Testimony John McKinnon \n\"Alert, alert,\" AT&T Chairman Randall Stephenson's entourage barked earlier in the Senate hallway as they neared the Senate hearing room and waiting reporters approached. Mr. Stephenson stopped to answer a few questions, but didn't shed a lot of new light, although he did suggest in response to one question that the decision on the merger would be up to the Justice Department. By implication, that appeared to suggest AT&T would try to avoid Federal Communications Commission review of the deal. AT&T likely has the ability to do that by dumping Time Warner's FCC licenses, and it's believed the company will try that approach. In response to a followup question, Mr. Stephenson tried to backtrack, saying no decision has been made yet about whether to avoid FCC oversight by dumping Time Warner's FCC licenses. Facebook Highlights Deal Opponent Kimmelman: 'Too Few Players Already' \nMr. Kimmelman, who is testifying on behalf of the advocacy group Public Knowledge and Consumer Federation of America, is up next. He argues in his opening statement that the merger will give too much power to companies that already control a great deal of market share. \n\"There are too few players already in these markets,\" Mr. Kimmelman says. He urges regulators to \"reject this merger\" unless concerns can be mitigated. Byron Tau Twitter Cuban, a Trump Antagonist, Has Emerged as Deal Supporter \nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban has emerged as a supporter of AT&T’s merger with Time Warner. In his prepared remarks, he notes that “neither is in any sort of dominant position” compared to big tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. He said he believes it will be “very difficult, if not impossible” for AT&T or Time Warner standalone to compete against the tech giants. Also of note: Mr. Cuban was a big Hillary Clinton supporter. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, left, speaks with AXS TV Chairman and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban before a Senate Judiciary Committee antitrust subcommittee hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner in Washington Dec. 7. Reuters Shalini Ramachandran Mark Cuban: 'Media World Has Changed' \nMr. Cuban is up next, saying that \"the media world has changed.\" \nMr. Cuban says that consumers used to go to their media by coming home and watching content on television. \"Today our media comes to us,\" he says. \nHe adds that while television often was the best alternative to boredom in the past, today companies like Facebook and others who create mobile apps are instead some of the most appealing content delivery systems. \nMr. Cuban cites Facebook, Snapchat, Minecraft, and other apps as the cutting-edge content delivery systems — which are controlled mostly by Apple and Google, through their industry-leading mobile operating systems. \nMr. Cuban says that AT&T and Time Warner are not in the dominant position of content delivery anymore and that the merger is a matter of survival for them in a changing industry. Byron Tau Highlights Bewkes: Deal Will Help Innovation \nA main argument from Time Warner’s Mr. Bewkes: Combining with AT&T will help us innovate faster. Case in point is a concept called “TV Everywhere,” which Mr. Bewkes championed in June 2009 as a way to allow people to take their pay-TV subscriptions with them and watch TV on mobile devices by “authenticating” with their cable operator’s credentials to stream channels like TNT live. But that effort wasn’t able to gain traction quickly enough, as cable operator and networks tangled over the terms of those agreements and who would own the customer. Many TV executives have bemoaned that Netflix’s rise was aided by the industry’s inability to get it together on “TV Everywhere.” Shalini Ramachandran Up Next, Bewkes Touts Content \nMr. Bewkes of Time Warner is up next with his opening statement. \nHe emphasizes that the company does not own any distribution networks — rather it produces contents through its media properties like Warner Bros., HBO, CNN and others. Mr. Bewkes notes that Warner Bros. produces shows for every broadcast network, as well as online distribution services like Hulu and Netflix. He touts that that HBO has offered consumers options to buy its content outside of a cable subscription, while the parent company of CNN, Turner, has also offered content in bundles outside of cable companies. Byron Tau Highlights Witnesses Sworn In -- AT&T's Stephenson Up First \nAfter all five witnesses have been sworn in by Mr. Lee, Mr. Stephenson of AT&T is up first with his opening statement. \nMr. Stephenson says AT&T is a communications company that distributes content, while Time Warner is a content creator. The merger \"eliminates no competitor,\" he says — a classic vertical merger. \n\"We want to get the most content to the most people at the lowest prices,\" he says. \nMr. Stephenson also adds that the merger will help contribute to \"innovation.\" He cites the experience of the iPhone, which was initially only available on AT&T — crediting it for telecommunications companies to upgrade from 2G cell phone networks to 3G and 4G cell networks. \nHe says some things will not change: AT&T will continue to be a \"leading investor\" in America, will encourage independent journalism (CNN is owned by Time Warner), and will not disadvantage the content of competitors. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, left, Time Warner Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes, center, and AXS TV Chairman Mark Cuban are sworn in. Reuters Byron Tau Twitter Net Neutrality Back on the Table \nSenator Leahy was talking about net neutrality, the idea that all all traffic on the internet should be treated the same, and it is sure to come up again. That means no blocking, no paid prioritization and a number of other rules. Telecom and cable companies were generally against the FCC codifying those rules by reclassifying broadband service with public utility like oversight last year. Mr. Trump and his advisers are expected to change or repeal those rules. Thomas Gryta Highlights Leahy: Will Internet Remain a Free and Open Space? \nMr. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, says the merger \"can dramatically transform our nation's telecommunications and media landscape,\" saying that the combination involves two \"titans\" in the telecommunications space. \nMr. Leahy says his top concern is ensuring that the Internet remains a free and open place — a position that is sometimes called \"net neutrality\" or the rule that telecommunications companies cannot favor some kinds of Internet traffic over another kind. He raises the possibility that AT&T might act as a \"bias gatekeeper\" for its own content after the merger. \n\"Any weakening of these rules are going to cause serious harm to consumers,\" Mr. Leahy says. Byron Tau Twitter Grassley Finds Middle Ground \nChuck Grassley , the Republican chairman of the full Judiciary Committee, is up next with his opening statement. \n\"This industry is going through a transformation in a disruptive time,\" said Mr. Grassley. \"We want to make sure that this revolution in technology and in content continues to evolve and thrive.\" Mr. Grassley, a U.S. senator from Iowa, also says he wants to ensure that rural consumers benefit as well. \nMr. Grassley strikes a middle ground on the questions about the merger — saying that Congress must be sensitive to the impact on consumers but also be careful not to stifle innovation. Byron Tau Twitter How the Antitrust Review Will Work \nAT&T and Time Warner will have to apply to the Justice Department for an antitrust review, a process they say has already begun. Traditionally telecom mergers also get FCC review because the agency must approve a transfer for airwave licenses. Time Warner’s license holdings means the FCC should be involved, but the companies may be able to find a way to transfer the licenses to avoid an FCC review. FCC is typically tougher because it is a review of the public benefit of a deal. AT&T said this week that it still hasn’t determined its path on the issue. Thomas Gryta Twitter Also: It's a Vertical Deal, Not Horizontal \nThe companies will often highlight that this is a so-called vertical deal, a distributor buying a supplier, rather than a horizontal deal of two competitors merging. In 2011, AT&T was blocked from buying T-Mobile because it would eliminate competition. AT&T’s CEO Mr. Stephenson has often contended that people would be hard pressed to find a vertical deal that has been blocked and that regulatory concerns could be solved by putting conditions on the deal. Yesterday he said “the day after we close this deal there will be no fewer competitors in any market in the United States than there are today in distribution or media and entertainment.” Sen. Klobuchar was questioning that idea in her remarks. Thomas Gryta ",

      "text": "Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner December 07, 2016, 11:05:  Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner \nU.S. lawmakers on Wednesday expressed wide-ranging concerns about AT&T Inc.'s blockbuster $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc., a reaction that suggests the deal could come under renewed political pressure. \nSen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), in a Senate antitrust subcommittee hearing on the proposed merger, said the deal could lead to \"potential anticompetitive favoritism.\" \nThe merger's potential impact could include price and access problems for competitors seeking Time Warner's prized content, such as HBO, Mr. Lee said. \nSen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) also noted questions about the merged company's ability to employ \"'bullying' tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks.\" Mr. Grassley cited \"concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate,\" as well as \"concern about the merger's implications for a free and diverse press.\" \nAntitrust enforcers in the Trump administration will ultimately decide whether to approve the deal or block it as anticompetitive, so the senators will have little or no say in the outcome. However, members of Congress can both reflect and contribute to the public mood regarding the merger of such large, high-impact businesses. \nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the committee's top Democrat, also expressed concerns. But the worries of the Republican lawmakers, who are often apt to take a pro-business approach, was especially notable, and may reflect in part a recent surge in populist sentiment in both parties. \nWrite to John D.

      "text": "Innovation or monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend deal Posted: By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nThe panel's chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues. \nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony. \nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump. \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate subcommittee doesn't possess the authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to question why the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers, among other things. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films. \nThat, critics say, could limit consumer choice. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO, would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, joined the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He says the merger would enhance competition. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Innovation or monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend deal By Marcy Gordon Published: Dec. 7, 2016 9:15 a.m. Updated: 21 minutes ago CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to sell merger to skeptical Senate \nWASHINGTON — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nThe panel's chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues. \nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony. \nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump. \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate subcommittee doesn't possess the authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to question why the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers, among other things. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films. \nThat, critics say, could limit consumer choice. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. Comment on this story \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO, would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, joined the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He says the merger would enhance competition. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Related Link",

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts 1/2 left right Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Time Warner Jeffrey Bewkes (L) speaks with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Randall Stephenson before a Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2016. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts 2/2 \nWASHINGTON AT&T Inc ( T.N ) Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that his company's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) would increase innovation, bring \"better-priced options\" to consumers \nand \"reshape the competitive landscape.\" \n\"By owning Time Warner content, we will be able to innovate more quickly, experiment more readily, tweak our offerings as we gauge customer response and bring consumers the options they seek,\" Stephenson said at a Senate hearing. \nSenator Mike Lee, a Republican who chairs the panel that held the hearing, said the antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department would be \"very fact-intensive.\" \n\"Consumer welfare is maximized by protecting competition, not necessarily by protecting competitors,\" Lee said. \nThe Justice Department will determine whether the deal is legal under antitrust law. If the agency decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree. \nSenator Amy Klobuchar, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, expressed concern that the deal would create incentives for AT&T to refuse to license Time Warner content to competitors. She also said AT&T could favor its own movies and television shows over independent content. \nTime Warner owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros film studio. \nStephenson said at a New York conference on Tuesday that the Justice Department had begun reviewing the deal, which was announced in October. \"This obviously will require extensive analysis,\" he said. \nThe Federal Communications Commission would also review the deal if AT&T decides to assume any of Time Warner's licenses, he added. \n\"They own a number of licenses here and there, everything from walkie-talkie, wireless licenses to satellite licenses on bands for CNN,\" he said. \nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose administration will decide whether to approve the merger, had said during the campaign that it should be blocked. \nStephenson told Reuters before the hearing that he had no contact with Trump. \nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban told the Senate panel that the merger would create another competitor against large companies like Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), Google ( GOOGL.O ), Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) and Facebook Inc ( FB.O ). \n\"Delivering content to consumers in this app-driven world is not easy,\" he said in written testimony. \"Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete.\" \n(Reporting by David Shepardson and Diane Bartz; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "The top executives of AT&T (NYSE: T ) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) will defend their proposed $85B merger before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee today, arguing that by combining, they will \"disrupt\" the long-established cable TV model in ways that will benefit consumers. However, the tie-up has already raised concerns from the right and left and taken flak from President-elect Donald Trump over its potential impacts on the industry as well as its sheer size. Economy\nChina's foreign exchange reserves fell for a fifth straight month in November, tumbling $69.06B to $3.052T - the lowest since March 2011, as authorities struggled to shore up the sliding yuan in the face of a relentlessly rising dollar. Adding to pressure on the currency, President-elect Trump has vowed to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office and threatened to impose huge tariffs on Chinese goods. \nAmid steep falls in business investment, housing construction and public spending, Australia's economy shrank for the first time in more than five years in the third quarter. The local dollar slipped 0.5% to $0.7421 against the greenback after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that GDP fell 0.5% during the period, leaving the year-on year increase at 1.8%. \nThe Reserve Bank of India has kept its policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25%, despite calls for action as an intense cash shortage threatens to slam the brakes on the world's fastest growing major economy. Analysts had expected a rate cut of at least 25 bps after India scrapped two high denomination bank notes to thwart counterfeiters and undo the country's underground economy. \nThe BOJ and the ECB have agreed to launch a joint project to study the possible use of a technology underpinning digital currencies for market infrastructure. The project will look into distributed ledger, a technology best known for supporting bitcoin digital currency, and the two central banks are expected to release their main findings next year. \nUkraine feels \"betrayed\" by the EU for not keeping to a promise to give its citizens visa-free travel in the bloc, deputy foreign minister Olena Zerka and presidential advisor Anders Fogh Rasmussen told Reuters. The nation was promised visa liberalization if it met a number of conditions, including steps to tackle corruption, but it hasn't yet materialized as the EU wants to put an emergency suspension mechanism in place first. \nCuba and the United States will draw up a roadmap for deepening their detente today in the first meeting since the election of Donald Trump and the death of Fidel Castro. The fifth bilateral commission comes at a time of increased uncertainty about normalizing relations given Trump's promise to end ties if Cuba is \"unwilling to make a better deal.\" \nStocks\nItaly is preparing to take a €2B controlling stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena (OTCPK: BMDPY ), which the bank hopes will attract private investors to fill the gap in rescue funding. According to Reuters, the government plans to buy junior bonds to boost its stake to 40%, making it the biggest shareholder by far. Questions whether this amounts to state aid will surely arise in Brussels. \nMore action from Margrethe Vestager... The European Commission has fined Credit Agricole ( OTCPK:CRARY ), HSBC (NYSE: HSBC ) and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ) a total of €485M for their part in a cartel to fix the Euribor benchmark interest rate. Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB ), RBS , and Societe Generale ( OTCPK:SCGLY ) admitted guilt in December 2013, while Barclays (NYSE: BCS ) avoided a fine because it alerted the Commission. HSBC +1.5% premarket. \nCredit Suisse +4% premarket after the Swiss bank lowered profit targets at its asset management business and ramped up its cost cuts amid challenging conditions in key Asian markets. The move will slash over 6,000 jobs and result in more than 1B Swiss francs in extra cost cuts as Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS ) CEO Tidjane Thiam looks to adjust his turnaround plan. \nIn its first insider trading ruling in two decades, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of prosecutors, saying that gifts of confidential information from business executives to relatives violate securities laws even if the former don't receive anything in return. The case, Salman v. United States, concerned trading by Bassam Salman based on information from his future brother-in-law, then a member of Citigroup's (NYSE: C ) healthcare investment banking group. \nMasterCard is boosting its quarterly dividend by 16% to $0.22 a share and setting aside an additional $4B to buy back stock. Both moves are in line with increases the company made a year ago to its dividend and repurchase plan. The company has about $1.3B left under that authorization and a market capitalization of about $114B. MA +1% premarket. \nBelgian chemicals group Solvay has agreed to sell its Acetow unit, which makes material used in cigarette filters, to Blackstone (NYSE: BX ) for €1B, including debt. \"Acetow is a commodity business that is going through a decreasing market,\" said Pascal Juery, head of the Solvay ( OTCPK:SOLVY ) division. \"It didn't fit the group's strategy anymore.\" \nAmid troubled Project Wing efforts, Alphabet's ( GOOG , GOOGL ) X division plans to create an online exchange named \"Wing Marketplace\" where people can get drone deliveries from retailers and restaurants within minutes, WSJ reports. X would charge customers a $6 drone-delivery fee and has already met with Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ), Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ) and a series of other companies about the project. \nRoyal Dutch Shell and Total will sign initial agreements today to develop oil and gas fields in Iran, in the first European petroleum deals in the country since sanctions eased earlier this year. But the plans open both companies to potential risks from the incoming Trump administration. Though Total (NYSE: TOT ) is French and Shell ( RDS.A , RDS.B ) is jointly headquartered in London and The Hague, both companies have substantial American operations. \nBP is shipping almost 3M barrels of U.S. crude to customers across Asia, pioneering a lengthy and complex operation likely to become more popular after OPEC last week announced deep production cuts. Using its global shipping and trading network, BP was able to grapple with U.S. port limitations and the need to transfer oil between ships off Malaysia to split up cargoes, according to sources in Thomson Reuters Eikon. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4B. Cancel order!\" President-elect Donald Trump tweeted early Tuesday, sending the planemaker's stock down in early trade and igniting a media firestorm. While Boeing doesn't have an actual order to build the plane, it has a $170M contract to begin development work. Shares recovered to end slightly in the green by the market close. \nSouth Korea's Fair Trade Commission will seek criminal charges against five former and current Volkswagen ( OTCPK:VLKAY ) executives and fine the German carmaker's unit 37.3B won ($32M) for false advertising on vehicle emissions. The penalty, a record for false advertising in the Asian country, reflects a toughening stance after South Korea banned most VW sales in August. \nBritain's Competition and Markets Authority has fined Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) a record £84.2M for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy medication by as much as 2,600%. The drugmaker used to market Epanutin itself, but it sold distribution rights to privately-held Flynn in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and its price soared. Pfizer plans to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nBack in September, Square (NYSE: SQ ) rolled out virtual payment cards: Digital debit cards that pull directly from a user's Square Cash account. Now those payment cards work with Apple Pay (NASDAQ: AAPL ). The move means that users can take money from their Square Cash account to buy things anywhere Apple Pay is accepted. \n\"While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined,\" iPhone assembler Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ) is in in preliminary discussions to expand its operations in the United States. On Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Softbank's ( OTCPK:SFTBY ) Masayoshi Son would invest $50B in the U.S. and create an additional 50,000 new jobs, raising new hopes of a Sprint (NYSE: S ) deal with T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ). \nThe upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 may become the next popular phone to forgo the headphone jack, according to SamMobile. The decision will not only help keep the device thin, but will also allow it to pack in a bigger battery. It's also speculated that the Galaxy S8 ( OTC:SSNLF ) is ditching the home button for an optical finger recognition system inside of the display - giving Android users an edge-to-edge screen. \nToday's Markets \nIn Asia , Japan +0.7% .

      "text": "Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner -- Update  17:  Lawmakers Voice Concerns Over AT&T Deal for Time Warner -- Update By John D. McKinnon \nU.S. lawmakers on Wednesday expressed wide-ranging concerns about AT&T Inc.'s blockbuster $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner Inc., a reaction that suggests the deal could come under renewed political pressure. \nSen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), in opening a Senate antitrust subcommittee hearing on the proposed merger, said the deal could lead to \"potential anticompetitive favoritism.\" \nHe also worried that the deal could create a new problem for the industry and consumers in the form of AT&T's plans to exclude its online video offerings from its wireless data caps. Critics worry that could turn AT&T into a powerful gatekeeper for consumers' content, Sen. Lee noted. \nSen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) also noted questions about the merged company's ability to employ \"'bullying' tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks.\" Mr. Grassley cited \"concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate,\" as well as \"concern about the merger's implications for a free and diverse press.\" \nAT&T Inc. Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said Wednesday that AT&T is a communications company that distributes content, while Time Warner is a content creator. The merger \"eliminates no competitor,\" he says -- a classic vertical merger. \n\"We want to get the most content to the most people at the lowest prices, \" he said. \nTime Warner chief Jeff Bewkes said the deal would allow his company to continue innovating in content as well as in consumer experiences, for example by adding more interactive features to video products. Case in point is a concept called \"TV Everywhere,\" which Mr. Bewkes championed in June 2009 as a way to allow people to take their pay-TV subscriptions with them and watch TV on mobile devices by \"authenticating\" with their cable operator's credentials to stream channels like TNT live. \nAntitrust enforcers in the Trump administration will ultimately decide whether to approve the deal or block it as anticompetitive, so the senators will have little or no say in the outcome. However, members of Congress can both reflect and contribute to the public mood regarding the merger of such large, high-impact businesses. \nThe merger deal has taken flak from Mr. Trump, who criticized it on the campaign trail as too much concentration of power and promised to block it. \nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the committee's top Democrat, also expressed concerns. But the worries of the Republican lawmakers, who are often apt to take a pro-business approach, was especially notable, and may reflect in part a recent surge in populist sentiment in both parties. \nWrite to John D.

      "text": "AT&T CEO Says $85B Time Warner Deal Will Be Tremendous for Consumers Written by 7 December 2016 // 10:57 AM CET Copy This URL Randall Stephenson (L) and Jeff Bewkes (R) speaking at a conference in October. Image: Steve Jurvetson / Flickr \nAT&T’s proposed $85 billion buyout of entertainment giant Time Warner will benefit consumers and boost industry competition by creating a powerful new rival against cable companies like Comcast, top executives from the two corporate giants told US lawmakers on Wednesday. \n“Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers,” AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said in prepared testimony before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights . \nThe proposed merger would combine AT&T’s vast and wide-ranging wireless, home internet, and pay-TV networks—including its recently acquired DirecTV satellite distribution business —with Time Warner’s valuable portfolio of entertainment properties, including HBO, CNN, and Hollywood studio Warner Bros. \n“By joining forces, we will accelerate the development and delivery of the next generation of video services that provide consumers with greater choice, convenience, value, and affordability,” Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes told lawmakers in prepared testimony. \nThe $85 billion deal would be one of the largest mergers in telecom history, and would transform the media landscape by combining a distribution giant (AT&T) with a content powerhouse (Time Warner). That’s why many industry insiders and policy experts view it as a key litmus test for how other major corporate tie-ups will be handled under a Trump presidency. \nPublic interest advocates have warned that AT&T could be tempted to prioritize Time Warner content over rival programming for the telecom titan’s subscribers, or extract higher prices for HBO, CNN, or Warner Bros. content from the company’s pay-TV competitors. That could lead to higher prices for consumers. \n“The proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner could create a number of competitive harms, leading to higher costs and fewer choices for video services and lower-quality and less diverse programming,” Gene Kimmelman, President of DC-based consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said in a statement. Kimmelman testified Wednesday on behalf of the public interest. \nDuring the election campaign, president-elect Trump vowed to block the deal , in an apparent attempt to appeal to the growing, populist movement against corporate consolidation and wealth inequality that's rising up across the political spectrum. But since the election, Trump’s position appears to have softened, according to published reports , leading Wall Street investors to take a more optimistic view of the deal’s ultimate approval. \nThe proposed merger will be reviewed by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds, to ensure that the deal doesn’t run afoul of important US laws designed to ensure competitive markets. The merger could also be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission, if the transaction includes the transfer of broadcast licenses under that agency’s jurisdiction. \nBy snapping up DirecTV in 2015, AT&T surpassed cable giant Comcast as the nation’s largest pay-TV company. AT&T was already the nation’s second largest wireless service provider, after Verizon. The telecom titan’s combined customer base includes more than 100 million consumers across the United States. \n“If a single company is able to control many of the key inputs to online video, from content production to last-mile transmission, then the competitive promise of this new market could be snuffed out, or at least limited, as familiar names seek to turn online video into Cable 2.0,” Kimmelman warned. \nTime Warner and AT&T executives argue that the tie-up would better position the combined company to compete with US cable TV leader Comcast at a time when consumers are increasingly ditching traditional pay-TV bundles in favor of of internet-based, or so-called “over-the-top,” video options, especially on mobile devices. \nFor Stephenson, AT&T’s 56-year-old CEO, the merger would be the pinnacle of a thirty-year telecom career, and would transform him one of the most powerful figures in media and entertainment. For Bewkes, a successful deal could lead to an ultimate payout of more than $300 million , if he sticks around to see the pact through. \nAT&T and Time Warner executives are cautiously optimistic because the proposed deal would be an example of “vertical” integration, in which companies that offer different services merge, as opposed to “horizontal” integration, in which companies that provide similar services combine, like two cable TV companies. \nVertical mergers “are more difficult to challenge” than horizontal mergers, Glenn Manishin, a leading antitrust expert and managing director at Paradigm Shift Law, recently told Motherboard, because such deals don’t involve direct competitors joining forces. \n“It would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive,” AT&T CEO Stephenson told lawmakers on Wednesday. “AT&T's and Time Warner's businesses complement each other, and those complementary businesses, when combined, naturally result in consumer and competitive benefits.” \nThe Senate does not have the authority to approve or reject corporate mergers, but the positions of individual senators, and the questions they ask during Capitol Hill hearings, can send signals that might influence regulators at the DOJ and FCC, especially at a time when these agencies are in the process of transitioning from Democratic to Republican control.

      "text": "Innovation or monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend deal By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nThe panel's chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues. \nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony. \nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump. \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate subcommittee doesn't possess the authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to question why the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers, among other things. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films. \nThat, critics say, could limit consumer choice. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO, would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, joined the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He says the merger would enhance competition. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "show chapters Cuban: AT&T-Time Warner merger is needed by consumers      1 Hour Ago | 01:56 AT&T needs to buy Time Warner , says Mark Cuban . \nThe investor and reality TV star thinks Washington should sign off on AT&T's proposed $86 billion Time Warner deal, so the combined company can compete with the likes of Google , Facebook , Apple and Amazon . \nHe is making the argument today at a Senate antitrust hearing , where other witnesses include AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes . \nMore from Recode: \nMossberg: In tech, form too often trumps function \nApple and Spotify are generating $7 billion a year in streaming music revenue \nJack Dorsey has done a good job of hiring women into positions of power \n\nCuban's argument isn't a surprise, since he made the same case to Recode's Kara Swisher last month . But now you can read an expanded version of it, via the prepared remarks he submitted to the Senate judiciary committee this morning; it's embedded at the bottom of this post. \nThe tl;dr: \"We need more companies ... with the ability to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Delivering content to consumers in this app-driven world is not easy, it is very expensive and difficult. ... Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete with any of the companies I've mentioned. Together it will still be difficult, but a combined entity at least gives them a chance to battle the dominant players in the marketplace and increase consumer choice and competition for consumer attention.\" \nAnd here's a new wrinkle we haven't heard from Cuban before: Letting AT&T buy Time Warner is good for beer drinkers who want to pick which show they want to watch.\n\n\"I would also like to point out one other important element of consumer choice that an AT&T and Time Warner merger would improve. \nEach of the largest content companies I have mentioned so far, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple present much if not all of their content algorithmically. As a Facebook user I don't get to pick what content I get to see in my newsfeed. I can try to influence it, but Facebook algorithms control what I see.\nIn the future, it won't be algorithms that choose what we see, our choices will be driven by some form of Artificial Intelligence learning from trillions of disparate inputs. \nMeanwhile, for those of us who still enjoy our TV the old-fashioned way, on our couch, cold beverage in one hand and remote in the other, there is a lot to be said for having a company that can afford to continue to offer us that choice. As much of a geek as I am, I like having the choice of searching through a programming guide to see what's on rather than an algorithm telling me what I should watch. I think a lot of consumers would like to see that choice continue as well.\"\n— By Peter Kafka, Recode.net . \n\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",

What to expect at this week's hearing about AT&T-Time Warner deal \nWould the merger expand competition or shrink it? At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes will face questions along those lines.

In fact, it would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive.\" \nStephenson said the two firms, with no overlap in their services, would make it easier to offer innovative content and distribution in an era facing disruption from online services such as Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) and Amazon. \nBut senators offered a cautious view, saying the deal could concentrate too much power in one firm. \nSubcommittee chairman Senator Mike Lee said the deal raise questions about \"all sorts of anticompetitive abuses.\" \nLee said AT&T (Swiss: T-USD.SW - news ) \"could increase the price or reduce access to Time Warner content\" if it holds a dominant position as both a pay-TV and content provider. \nSenator Chuck Grassley raised similar issues. \n\"There's concern that a combined company will give preferential treatment -- for example, favorable channel placement and zero-rating pricing -- to Time Warner's premium entertainment programming to the disadvantage of other content producers,\" Grassley said. \n\"There's concern about the merged company?s ability to employ 'bullying' tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks. There?s concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate, resulting in higher prices and fewer programming options for consumers.\" \nGene Kimmelman of the consumer group Public Knowledge warned that allowing the deal to proceed would likely mean \"higher costs and fewer choices for video services, and lower-quality and less diverse programming.\" \nKimmelman said it remains unclear how such a deal would impact emerging giants in video like Netflix. \n\"The fact that the technology and business models of online video may allow for a better world for consumers is no guarantee that it will actually happen,\" Kimmelman said. \n\"If a single company is able to control many of the key inputs to online video, from content production to last-mile transmission, then the competitive promise of this new market could be snuffed out, or at least limited.\" An eye full of sky: a spectacular £4 million Georgian house conversion, complete with retractable roof 1 hour 36 minutes ago \nBehind the elegant facade of a row of fine Georgian houses lies a truly jaw-dropping renovation.

      "text": "Chairman and CEO of AT&T Stephenson, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner Bewkes and owner of the Dallas Mavericks Cuban are sworn in before a Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner Thomson Reuters\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that his company's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc would increase innovation, bring \"better-priced options\" to consumers\nand \"reshape the competitive landscape.\"\n\"By owning Time Warner content, we will be able to innovate more quickly, experiment more readily, tweak our offerings as we gauge customer response and bring consumers the options they seek,\" Stephenson said at a Senate hearing.\nSenator Mike Lee, a Republican who chairs the panel that held the hearing, said the antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department would be \"very fact-intensive.\"\n\"Consumer welfare is maximized by protecting competition, not necessarily by protecting competitors,\" Lee said.\nThe Justice Department will determine whether the deal is legal under antitrust law. If the agency decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree.\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, expressed concern that the deal would create incentives for AT&T to refuse to license Time Warner content to competitors. She also said AT&T could favor its own movies and television shows over independent content.\nTime Warner owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros film studio.\nStephenson said at a New York conference on Tuesday that the Justice Department had begun reviewing the deal, which was announced in October. \"This obviously will require extensive analysis,\" he said.\nThe Federal Communications Commission would also review the deal if AT&T decides to assume any of Time Warner's licenses, he added.\n\"They own a number of licenses here and there, everything from walkie-talkie, wireless licenses to satellite licenses on bands for CNN,\" he said.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose administration will decide whether to approve the merger, had said during the campaign that it should be blocked.\nStephenson told Reuters before the hearing that he had no contact with Trump.\nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban told the Senate panel that the merger would create another competitor against large companies like Apple Inc , Google , Microsoft Corp , Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc .\n\"Delivering content to consumers in this app-driven world is not easy,\" he said in written testimony. \"Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete.\"\n(Reporting by David Shepardson and Diane Bartz; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "The top executives at Time Warner and AT&T went to Capitol Hill Wednesday to make their case for a proposed $85.4 billion merger between the companies.\nIn a written statement submitted to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the deal would result in myriad benefits for the consumer.\n“Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers, and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,” Stephenson said.\nJeff Bewkes, the CEO of Time Warner, echoed that, saying the deal would be good for the companies and for consumers.\n“We believe that combining Time Warner’s ability to create great video content with AT&T’s physical distribution in satellite, broadband, and mobile, will help us bring consumers more choices in how they enjoy their favorite TV shows, films, video games, and other content from Time Warner and a vast array of other creators — and do so more quickly,” Bewkes said. “By joining forces, we will accelerate the development and delivery of the next generation of video services that provide consumers with greater choice, convenience, value, and affordability.”\nCritics of the proposed merger have raised concerns that the deal would concentrate too much power and could actually raise prices for consumers. Sen. Al Franken (D-MN), a member of the subcommittee, said in October that he had “serious reservations” about the deal, which he said “could have a lasting effect on the quality and affordability of programming available to consumers across America.”\n“And I’m skeptical of any further consolidation in the media and telecommunications industries that could lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service for Americans,” Franken said at the time.\nMark Cuban, the owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and a public supporter of the merger, is also expected to testify, as is Gene Kimmelman, the president and CEO of Public Knowledge, who opposes the deal.\nDaphna Ziman, the president of the TV network Cinémoi and another opponent of the deal, is slated to testify as well.\nFranken supplied some of the toughest questioning at the hearing on Wednesday, expressing skepticism that the merger will not unfairly disadvantage other content providers. Bewkes said in October that charging companies like Comcast more for access to Time Warner’s portfolio, which includes HBO, TNT and CNN, “would be like selling toothpaste and not putting it in Duane Reade.”\nFranken said the analogy didn’t make any sense.\n“It’s like selling Game of Thrones and not letting Comcast subscribers watch it or very likely… making Comcast pay more for the privilege of having Game of Thrones or Veep or the rest of the lineup,” the Minnesota senator said.\n“You’d have every reason to do this if you could,” he added.\nBewkes said a combined AT&T and Time Warner “would not have the incentive nor would it have the ability to do that.”\n“It would make no sense…to not sell HBO on the Comcast cable system, on the Verizon cable system,” Bewkes said.\nEarlier in the hearing, Stephenson emphasized that the merger would streamline consumer access to content.\n“Our ambition is to ensure that the customer pays for the content only one time,” Stephen said. “Pay for it one time, give the consumer the ability to watch it any time.”\nKimmelman, invited to rebut that point by the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), said the proposed deal was different than the merger between AT&T and DirecTV, which he said offered “clear efficiencies of putting together a bundle.”\nIn contrast, Kimmelman said AT&T and Time Warner “could contract to do the same things they’re talking about without the risks of the merger.”\nThe fate of the merger appeared uncertain last month after Donald Trump pulled off a stunning upset over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Trump had criticized the deal on the campaign trail, describing it as “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” Positioning himself as a working class champion, Trump said the merger was “an example of the power structure I am fighting.”\nSince the election, however, many analysts have come to believe that the incoming administration — already filled with elite billionaires — will actually support the merger.\n“AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner likely has a higher probability of getting approved given the impending power shift in Washington, D.C.,” Eric Handler of MKM Partners said last month. “We now view the likelihood of AT&T/Time Warner getting approved as a 70/30 proposition based on a recent expert discussion we held.”\nBewkes and Stephenson have also expressed optimism about the merger’s prospects for approval. Appearing at the Business Insider Ignition conference in Manhattan on Tuesday, Stephenson said “the merits of the law suggest it’s a deal that gets done.”\n“This is a vertical merger,” he said. “We compete nowhere. I don’t think you can find an example where such a merger has been denied… Generally, vertical mergers are viewed as consumer friendly.”\nStephenson also suggested that Trump’s opposition to the deal as a candidate may have stemmed from his ill-will toward CNN.\n“Look, anytime the president of the United States comes out and says they’re not in favor of what you’re trying to do, you have to pay attention,” he said. “But I don’t know what part of the deal he’s referring to. I’ve heard rumors he’s not happy with CNN, so that might have come into it.”\nStephenson said in his written statement on Wednesday that AT&T is “committed to continuing the editorial independence of CNN.”\n“That independence is what makes CNN so popular and valuable, and we will not do anything to change that,” he said.",

      "title": "Innovation or monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend deal",
      "text": "Innovation or monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend deal Posted: By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nThe panel's chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues. \nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony. \nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump. \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate subcommittee doesn't possess the authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to question why the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers, among other things. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films. \nThat, critics say, could limit consumer choice. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO, would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, joined the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He says the merger would enhance competition. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Wednesday, December 07, 2016, 11:24 a.m. ADVERTISEMENT AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend deal By The Associated Press a A Font Size \nWASHINGTON — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nThe panel's chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues. \nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\" \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony. \nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump. \nRead Thursday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.

Posted 08 Dec 2016 01:02 US senators offered a cautious view, saying the deal to merge AT&T and Time Warner could concentrate too much power in one firm. (AFP Photo) A \nWASHINGTON: AT&T argued on Wednesday (Dec 7) its US$85 billion megadeal for Time Warner would be \"pro-competitive\" as lawmakers and consumer advocates expressed skepticism over the creation of new media-tech powerhouse. \n\"Our intent is to disrupt the existing pay TV model,\" AT&T chairman and chief executive Randall Stephenson told a Senate hearing on the merger of the huge telecom and broadband provider with the media-entertainment giant. \nThe deal would give consumers \"new lower-priced options and the power to decide themselves,\" he said. \nIn his prepared statement, Stephenson said that \"because this transaction will make us a more formidable competitor to cable, it's going to increase competition. In fact, it would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive.\" \nStephenson said the two firms, with no overlap in their services, would make it easier to offer innovative content and distribution in an era facing disruption from online services such as Netflix and Amazon. \nBut senators offered a cautious view, saying the deal could concentrate too much power in one firm. \nSubcommittee chairman Senator Mike Lee said the deal raise questions about \"all sorts of anticompetitive abuses.\" \nLee said AT&T \"could increase the price or reduce access to Time Warner content\" if it holds a dominant position as both a pay-TV and content provider. \nSenator Chuck Grassley raised similar issues. \n\"There's concern that a combined company will give preferential treatment - for example, favorable channel placement and zero-rating pricing - to Time Warner's premium entertainment programming to the disadvantage of other content producers,\" Grassley said. \n\"There's concern about the merged company's ability to employ 'bullying' tactics to dictate rates and terms to other networks. There's concern that this acquisition will concentrate too much power into one conglomerate, resulting in higher prices and fewer programming options for consumers.\" \nGene Kimmelman of the consumer group Public Knowledge warned that allowing the deal to proceed would likely mean \"higher costs and fewer choices for video services, and lower-quality and less diverse programming.\" \nKimmelman said it remains unclear how such a deal would impact emerging giants in video like Netflix. \n\"The fact that the technology and business models of online video may allow for a better world for consumers is no guarantee that it will actually happen,\" Kimmelman said. \n\"If a single company is able to control many of the key inputs to online video, from content production to last-mile transmission, then the competitive promise of this new market could be snuffed out, or at least limited.\" - AFP/de",

      "text": "Mel Evans/AP/REX/Shutterstock  41AM PT \nThe CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner faced a Senate hearing on their $85 billion proposed merger on Wednesday, and at one moment were questioned about President-elect Donald Trump ’s campaign statement that he would oppose the transaction. \nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) suggested that Trump’s threat during the campaign to block the merger was motivated by unhappiness over the way that CNN, a unit of Time Warner, covered his campaign. \n“To threaten more vigorous or adverse enforcement against a company because he doesn’t like the news coverage is a threat to the First Amendment,” Blumenthal said. Related AT&T Chief Says Trump Election Is a ‘Positive Development’ \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes each said that CNN’s news coverage would not be impacted by what Trump says about the merger. But they avoided criticizing the incoming administration. \nWhen Blumenthal asked them whether they agreed with him that it was “abhorrent” for a public official to threaten to block the merger because of the news coverage of one its networks, Stephenson said, “I am a novice in the world of politics and I have struggled to engage at that level.” \nBewkes noted that a number of politicians, including Bernie Sanders, weighed in on the merger after it was announced. \nOn the October weekend when the merger was unveiled, Trump told a crowd at a rally that “as an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” Related Time Warner Chief Says Democrats, Not Trump Were Bigger First Amendment Threat \nSince then, some of Trump’s appointments to his transition team have raised speculation on Wall Street that, despite Trump’s campaign statements, the merger may ultimately be viewed more favorably by the Department of Justice, which is tasked with reviewing the transaction. \nBlumenthal said that he has “yet to be convinced that the benefits outweigh the harms to competition and consumers,” and on that level would agree with Trump. But he said that “I may well agree with Trump,” but “what concerns me is the reason he gave, which is that he is very unhappy with the CNN news coverage.” \nAt the hearing before a Senate antitrust subcommittee, Stephenson and Bewkes argued that the transaction would disrupt the marketplace in a way that will benefit consumers. Stephenson pointed to AT&T’s DirecTV Now as an example of how its acquisition of the satellite firm has led to greater innovation and more choices. DirecTV Now offers a smaller bundle of 100 channels at $35 per month. Filed Under:",

      "title": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to Sell Merger to Skeptical Senate",
      "text": "CEOs of AT&T, Time Warner to Sell Merger to Skeptical Senate \n(AP) Wednesday, 07 Dec 2016 06:36 AM Close A A \nThe CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it.\nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition.\nThe panel&apos;s chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues.\nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\"\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers.\n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony.\nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he&apos;d kill the deal \"because it&apos;s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump.\nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It&apos;s a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it.\nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nThe Senate subcommittee doesn&apos;t possess the authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to question why the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers, among other things.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers&apos; computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner&apos;s programs and films.\nThat, critics say, could limit consumer choice.\nBecause of Time Warner&apos;s shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T&apos;s ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences.

He says the merger would enhance competition.\n--\nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.\n ",

      "title": "Innovation or monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend deal",
      "text": "Broncos Mailbag: Is rookie quarterback Paxton Lynch a bust? \nWASHINGTON — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner told Congress that the merger of the two media and communications giants will benefit Americans and boost competition in cable, rather than quash it. \nThe skeptical head of the Senate antitrust panel examining the proposed $85.4 billion deal says the tie-up could restrain competition. \nThe panel’s chairman, Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah, and its senior Democrat have said the deal, one of the biggest media mergers ever, raises significant antitrust issues. \nLee opened the hearing Wednesday by saying, “The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.” \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, sitting before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. Related Articles November 8, 2016 Dish’s Sling TV braces for onslaught from internet’s goliaths \n“Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,” Stephenson said Wednesday in prepared testimony. \nCritics of the deal range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he’d kill the deal “because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” \nStephenson said Tuesday that he is confident the deal will be approved despite vocal opposition from Trump. \nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the “Harry Potter” franchise and pro basketball. It’s a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate subcommittee doesn’t possess the authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to question why the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers, among other things. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers’ computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner’s programs and films. \nThat, critics say, could limit consumer choice. \nBecause of Time Warner’s shows and movies — including “Game of Thrones” and the “Harry Potter” films — and AT&T’s ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO, would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, joined the CEOs at Wednesday’s hearing. He says the merger would enhance competition. Tags:",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators scrutinizing the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner homed in on brass tacks with the companies&apos; CEOs. OK, you say this $85.4 billion mega-deal will enhance, not quash, competition and benefit consumers. Will it actually reduce prices that consumers pay?\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson assured the members of a Senate antitrust panel Wednesday that yes, \"We will bring the consumers better price options than what they have today.\" He said, though, that it wasn&apos;t possible at this point to separate how much of the anticipated savings would go to customers of the company&apos;s DirectTV, broadband and mobile phone services.\nStephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes made the case that the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson testified.\nIn hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, the skepticism of some senators seemed to deepen over what would be one of the largest media mergers ever.\n\"I have yet to be convinced\" that the benefits of the merger outweigh the potential negative effects on competition, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes.\nPanel chairman Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah said, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\"\nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It&apos;s a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it.\nCritics of the merger range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he&apos;d kill the deal \"because it&apos;s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\nGene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official who leads the consumer-advocate group Public Knowledge, crystallized those concerns.\n\"There are too few players in these markets already. They are heavily concentrated,\" he told the panel. The concentration of market power could \"harm the democratic process\" as well as consumers&apos; pocketbooks, Kimmelman warned.\nMark Cuban, the billionaire sports and media mogul who owns the NBA&apos;s Dallas Mavericks, played evangelist for the deal in a fast-moving world of media and entertainment content. Consider Facebook&apos;s mergers with WhatsApp, Snapchat and others, he testified: Those deals are driving innovation. Old media like Time Warner can&apos;t compete with the likes of Facebook if they can&apos;t merge.\nWhat about Trump&apos;s avowed opposition?\nStephenson says he&apos;s confident the merger will be approved despite the president-elect&apos;s objection.\nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under close scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers&apos; computers, phones and TVs.\nThe concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner&apos;s programs and films.

      "text": "Jeff Bewkes Associated Press \nCritics of AT&T ’s $85 billion plan to buy Time Warner put the companies’ CEOs on the defensive this morning in a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust , Competition Policy & Consumer Rights hearing that explored whether the deal would help or hurt consumers. Time Warner Execs Cheer AT&T Deal, But Don't Know Whether The FCC Will Review \nChallengers including Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) said the media giants would have “every reason” to either limit rivals’ access to popular programming, or jack up prices. following a deal. \nOthers added that AT&T would have more leverage to keep independent services off the DirecTV or DirecTV Now line up, or create roadblocks for competing video providers that want to reach the telco’s wireless customers. \n“AT&T is one of the dominant gatekeepers,” Public Knowledge CEO Gene Kimmelman told the subcommittee. And in other cases, including Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal, the Justice Department and FCC found that “there are enormous incentives to benefit yourself…This is not just about money. It is the diversity of programming.” \nHe praised AT&T’s recent introduction of DirecTV Now, which currently offers more than 100 channels for $35 a month — something that CEO Randall Stephenson cited as evidence of his company’s desire to offer consumers additional choices and lower prices. \n“The online platform is opening up some,” Kimmelman says. But AT&T made the offering without Time Warner, suggesting to him that a deal would not necessarily benefit the public. \n“The real fear is whether the combined company, once it loooks at its overall interests, will favor itself….They may offer a better price and offer it for some time. But will the competitive process benefit?” \nAT&T also could sereptitiously throttle rival services on its wireless network without others knowing.– even if it agreed not to do so. \nThe Justice Department doesn’t “have the engineers and network experts to look at all of these issues…if there is an inclination to discriminate,” the consumer advocate says. \nAT&T’s Randall Stephenson and Time Warner’s Jeff Bewkes countered that their union would benefit consumers by making the telco’s wireless broadband more competitive with cable operators who dominate the business. \n“AT&T will continue to be a leading investor in America” including speedy 5G wireless technology, Stephenson says. “You should expect that to continue.” In addition, his company would “encourage independent journalism” as well as “a wide array of diverse high quality content across all of our platforms.” \nBewkes says the companies would have no incentive to restrict others’ access to Time Warner content. \n“We’ve been able to build our networks only because we have broad distribution,” he told the subcommittee. :If we didn’t have full coverage we couldn’t sell advertising to advertisers…We owned Time Warner Cable for 20 some odd years, and we managed it. It never occurred to us to do anything restrictive.” \nStephenson added that Hollywood talent such as Clint Eastwood or Steven Spielberg wouldn’t do business with his company of it limits access to content. “We try to open our network to all.” \nEntrepreneur Mark Cuban also testified for the deal. “We need more companies that can compete with Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook…Alone it will be very difficult if not impossible for either [AT&T or Time Warner] to compete.” ",

      "text": "AT&T, Time Warner CEOs go to Capitol Hill to stump for merger Time Warner CEO: Deal would be good for consumers Author: By Tom Kludt Shutterstock/CNNMoney NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - \nThe top executives at Time Warner and AT&T went to Capitol Hill Wednesday to make their case for a proposed $85.4 billion merger between the companies. Related Content Trump named Time Person of the Year \nIn a written statement submitted to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the deal would result in myriad benefits for the consumer. \n\"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers, and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson said. \nJeff Bewkes, the CEO of Time Warner, echoed that, saying the deal would be good for the companies and for consumers. \n\"We believe that combining Time Warner's ability to create great video content with AT&T's physical distribution in satellite, broadband, and mobile, will help us bring consumers more choices in how they enjoy their favorite TV shows, films, video games, and other content from Time Warner and a vast array of other creators -- and do so more quickly,\" Bewkes said. \"By joining forces, we will accelerate the development and delivery of the next generation of video services that provide consumers with greater choice, convenience, value, and affordability.\" \nCritics of the proposed merger have raised concerns that the deal would concentrate too much power and could actually raise prices for consumers. Sen. Al Franken (D-MN), a member of the subcommittee, said in October that he had \"serious reservations\" about the deal, which he said \"could have a lasting effect on the quality and affordability of programming available to consumers across America.\" \n\"And I'm skeptical of any further consolidation in the media and telecommunications industries that could lead to higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service for Americans,\" Franken said at the time. \nMark Cuban, the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and a public supporter of the merger, is also expected to testify, as is Gene Kimmelman, the president and CEO of Public Knowledge, who opposes the deal. \nDaphna Ziman, the president of the TV network Cinémoi and another opponent of the deal, is slated to testify as well. \nFranken supplied some of the toughest questioning at the hearing on Wednesday, expressing skepticism that the merger will not unfairly disadvantage other content providers. Bewkes said in October that charging companies like Comcast more for access to Time Warner's portfolio, which includes HBO, TNT and CNN, \"would be like selling toothpaste and not putting it in Duane Reade.\" \nFranken said the analogy didn't make any sense. \n\"It's like selling Game of Thrones and not letting Comcast subscribers watch it or very likely... making Comcast pay more for the privilege of having Game of Thrones or Veep or the rest of the lineup,\" the Minnesota senator said. \n\"You'd have every reason to do this if you could,\" he added. \nBewkes said a combined AT&T and Time Warner \"would not have the incentive nor would it have the ability to do that.\" \n\"It would make no sense...to not sell HBO on the Comcast cable system, on the Verizon cable system,\" Bewkes said. \nEarlier in the hearing, Stephenson emphasized that the merger would streamline consumer access to content. \n\"Our ambition is to ensure that the customer pays for the content only one time,\" Stephen said. \"Pay for it one time, give the consumer the ability to watch it any time.\" \nKimmelman, invited to rebut that point by the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), said the proposed deal was different than the merger between AT&T and DirecTV, which he said offered \"clear efficiencies of putting together a bundle.\" \nIn contrast, Kimmelman said AT&T and Time Warner \"could contract to do the same things they're talking about without the risks of the merger.\" \nThe fate of the merger appeared uncertain last month after Donald Trump pulled off a stunning upset over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Trump had criticized the deal on the campaign trail, describing it as \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" Positioning himself as a working class champion, Trump said the merger was \"an example of the power structure I am fighting.\" \nSince the election, however, many analysts have come to believe that the incoming administration -- already filled with elite billionaires -- will actually support the merger. \n\"AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner likely has a higher probability of getting approved given the impending power shift in Washington, D.C.,\" Eric Handler of MKM Partners said last month. \"We now view the likelihood of AT&T/Time Warner getting approved as a 70/30 proposition based on a recent expert discussion we held.\" \nBewkes and Stephenson have also expressed optimism about the merger's prospects for approval. Appearing at the Business Insider Ignition conference in Manhattan on Tuesday, Stephenson said \"the merits of the law suggest it's a deal that gets done.\" \n\"This is a vertical merger,\" he said. \"We compete nowhere. I don't think you can find an example where such a merger has been denied... Generally, vertical mergers are viewed as consumer friendly.\" \nStephenson also suggested that Trump's opposition to the deal as a candidate may have stemmed from his ill-will toward CNN. ‹ Previous",

      "text": "FRB | Wed Dec 7, 2016 | 11:48am EST AT&T touts Time Warner merger at Senate hearing By David Shepardson and Diane Bartz \nAT&T Inc Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that his company's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc would increase innovation, bring \"better-priced options\" to consumers and \"reshape the competitive landscape.\" \n\"By owning Time Warner content, we will be able to innovate more quickly, experiment more readily, tweak our offerings as we gauge customer response and bring consumers the options they seek,\" Stephenson said at a Senate hearing. \nSenator Mike Lee, a Republican who chairs the panel that held the hearing, said the antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department would be \"very fact-intensive.\" \n\"Consumer welfare is maximized by protecting competition, not necessarily by protecting competitors,\" Lee said. \nThe Justice Department will determine whether the deal is legal under antitrust law. If the agency decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree. \nSenator Amy Klobuchar, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, expressed concern that the deal would create incentives for AT&T to refuse to license Time Warner content to competitors. She also said AT&T could favor its own movies and television shows over independent content. \nTime Warner owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros film studio. \nStephenson said at a New York conference on Tuesday that the Justice Department had begun reviewing the deal, which was announced in October. \"This obviously will require extensive analysis,\" he said. \nThe Federal Communications Commission would also review the deal if AT&T decides to assume any of Time Warner's licenses, he added. \n\"They own a number of licenses here and there, everything from walkie-talkie, wireless licenses to satellite licenses on bands for CNN,\" he said. \nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose administration will decide whether to approve the merger, had said during the campaign that it should be blocked. \nStephenson told Reuters before the hearing that he had no contact with Trump. \nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban told the Senate panel that the merger would create another competitor against large companies like Apple Inc, Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc. \n\"Delivering content to consumers in this app-driven world is not easy,\" he said in written testimony. \"Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete.\" Next In FRB ",

They say the \"hiring, promotional and disciplinary policies and practices continue to have a disparate impact on African American employees.\" \nIn his lawsuit, Walker claims, \"The current workplace culture utilizes practices that discourages or prohibit minorities from exercising their rights under employment discrimination statutes.\" The use of overly broad waivers, releases and mandatory arbitration provisions impede EEOC investigations and retaliatory practices that dissuades and has a chilling effect on African Americans in the workplace from exercising their rights,\" he continued. \nCBS46 will have more as this story develops. \nCopyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

      "title": "AT&T deal to buy Time Warner would give it a bunch of major TV studios",
      "text": "Source: CBS A scene from \"The Big Bang Theory.\" \nAT&T's plan to purchase Time Warner for $85 billion would give the company far more than just a handful of popular basic cable channels — it would also include some of the most prolific television studios in the industry. \nAt a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, senators raised concerns that the deal would let the combined company charge competing distributors more for TV content — or to cut them off completely. The planned acquisition was often compared to Comcast 's 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal, which required conditions from the Federal Communications Commission. \nTime Warner 's television studios produce far more content for channels owned by its competitors, while Comcast tends to produce content for its own channels, according to a CNBC review of media industry database Variety Insight . (CNBC is a unit of Comcast and NBCUniversal.) \nA handful of studios owned by Time Warner — most importantly Warner Bros. Television and Warner Horizon Television — are responsible for more than 80 television shows, according to the Variety Insight data. About a third of those shows were made for channels owned by competitors. \nThose aren't small, unknown shows. Time Warner (which does not own a broadcast network itself) has had a hand in a hit show for each of the major broadcast networks. While Comcast's NBCUniversal is a major content producer for television, the vast majority of its output is created for its own channels. An NBCUniversal spokesperson declined to comment. \nWarner Bros. is the world's largest film and television studio and the biggest producer of prime-time broadcast series, bringing in about $13 billion last year, according to the company's filings. \nThe deal would give AT&T a strong bargaining position at two steps in the television business: The combined company would own content that is in demand on a wide variety of channels, and it would own channels that are in demand for most major distributors, including AT&T. Time Warner's TNT, TBS and CNN are among the 10 most expensive basic channels for those distributors, according to data from SNL Kagan. \nTime Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said on Capitol Hill that the company would not use its stronger negotiating position to raise prices or cut off competitors. Bewkes said the company's business is based on full distribution and that cutting off other distributors would impede the company's ability to sell advertising and to acquire hit shows and movies. Stephenson has previously committed to maintaining Time Warner's \"wide and broad distribution.\" \nThe week after the merger announcement, AT&T said it was launching a new over-the-top TV streaming option that would provide 100 channels for $35 a month — undercutting competitors in a way that Stephenson said was only possible before the company bought DirectTV last year. \nCarolyn Finger, senior vice president at Variety Insight, agreed that the revenue from selling to competing distributors is a valuable asset for the company and that it would be a bad decision to jeopardize that business. \n\"Aside from raising some sort of regulatory ire, if they choke off Fox for example, it may not be in their best interest,\" said Finger. \"They can't be entirely self-dealing.\" \nLike the NBCUniversal-Comcast merger before it, the AT&T deal will face substantial scrutiny from regulators. President-elect Donald Trump said during the recent presidential campaign that he would block the deal.",

Photograph: Joshua Roberts/Reuters Wednesday 7 December 2016 19.32 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nUS senators grilled two of the most powerful men in media on Wednesday over “anti-competitive harm” that might result from the controversial $85.4bn acquisition of Time Warner Entertainment, the owner of HBO and CNN, by AT&T. \nTime Warner chief executive Jeff Bewkes and AT&T counterpart Randall Stephenson answered questions at the Senate antitrust committee hearing about conflicts that might arise from the merger of a major media producer and a major distributor. \nConnecticut senator Richard Blumenthal pressed both men to address President-elect Donald Trump’s threat to block the merger in retaliation for perceived negative coverage by CNN. \nBlumenthal asked the pair to assure the Senate antitrust subcommittee that CNN’s coverage would not changed based on Trump’s threat to block the merger in what he called an “absolutely abhorrent” use of “the blunt instrument of the law”. \nBlumenthal said: “What troubles me deeply is that the president-elect has said that his justice department will enforce a different standard of law depending on what kind of coverage his administration receives. Will you commit that your coverage will in no way be influenced or impacted by what the president of the United States says about this transaction?” \n“Yes,” said Bewkes and Stephenson. \nTrump has been broadly critical of the merger, saying his administration would not approve it as recently as October . He cited CNN’s coverage of his campaign among other objections, saying the network was “trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people”. \nMinnesota senator Al Franken pushed Bewkes on the question of whether Time Warner would benefit from raising prices on AT&T competitors such as Comcast once it was owned by one of its distributors. “It’s not like selling toothpaste and not taking it to [New York City convenience store chain] Duane Reade,” said Franken, himself a former TV and film actor. “HBO isn’t toothpaste. It’s like CVS making the greatest toothpaste in the world and not letting Duane Reade sell it.” \nMore to the point, Franken said, “it’s really like HBO making Game of Thrones and not letting Comcast sell it. Or more likely it’s more like making Comcast pay more for the privilege of having Game of Thrones or Veep or the rest of the lineup.” Conditions had to be imposed on the merger to prevent such behavior, Franken told the executives, or else there would be no way to stop the new company from restricting access to programming in order to drive consumers to HBO or AT&T’s streaming services. “You’d have every reason to do this if you could,” Franken told Bewkes. \nBewkes disagreed: refusing to distribute through a company that paid handsomely for the privilege would cut off Time Warner’s nose to spite its face, he said. “We’ve been able to build our network only because we have broad distribution,” Bewkes told the subcommittee. “If we were to not offer our networks over any of the cable, satellite, or over the top platforms, we’d be cutting off meaningful revenue to our company. There’s no incentive for us to do that.” \nStephenson cast the proposed reconfiguration of AT&T as a force for consumer-friendly disruption in a market of established players. “As we begin to innovate with Time Warner content, giving our customers unique and different capabilities, other companies will follow,” Stephenson predicted. \nGene Kimmelman of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge that his group estimated that cable consumers were being overcharged by “at least $45 a month” already “because there are too few players”. \n“AT&T and Time Warner are excellent companies that have begun to compete in the over-the-top market,” Kimmelman said. “That’s wonderful, as separate companies contracting with each other in the marketplace.” Merged together, he told the subcommitee, “there are enormous incentives to favor yourself.” ",
