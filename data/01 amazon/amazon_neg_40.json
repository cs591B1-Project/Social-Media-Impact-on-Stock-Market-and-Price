      "text": "  13:02 PM EST Amazon AWS Price Cuts to Reduce 2017 Revenue, Profit Slightly, Says Evercore ISI In case you missed it, Amazon.com ( AMZN ) yesterday announced another one of its cuts in price for its AWS cloud computing service, in this case, the price for its “ S3 ” storage offering. The company cut prices in most regions it served, it said in a post on AWS , and also consolidated six “pricing tiers” into just three. Evercore ISI ’s Ken Sena , who rates the stock a Buy and has a $990 price target, notes that this latest cut comes just after the company \"cut pricing on several EC2 instances by 5-25% in numerous regions last week.\" This is going to cut Amazon’s revenue growth rate, he thinks, but by how much is a tricky matter. Sena reasons it’s not as bad as might at first seem: At first blush, by applying the pricing cuts across our estimate for IaaS revenues (81% of total), it yields an 8.6% AWS revenue growth impact. But we think this is two aggressive as it essentially gives little credit to other AWS services, including Compute (besides EC2), Storage/CDN (besides S3), Database, Networking, Developer Tools, Management Tools, Security, Analytics, Application Services, and Mobile Services. Conversely, while optimistic, if we evenly distribute these services and apply the reduction to just one in ten, we arrive at a much more manageable 2.8% impact to AWS revenues. In reality, we believe the answer lies somewhere in the middle, leading us to estimate a ~6% impact at the midpoint.",

The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book’s publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A.

      "text": "A A \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He told me that I’d sometimes been unfair to him, sometimes mean, sometimes really, really mean...\" \"... but that when I was he usually deserved it, always appreciated it, and keep it up. He spoke of other things; he characterized for me my career. I’d heard of his charm offensive, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say how charming, funny and frank he was—and, as I say, how modest. How actually humble. It moved me. And it hurt to a degree a few weeks later when I wrote in this space that 'Sane Donald Trump' would win in a landslide but that the one we had long seen, the crazed, shallow one, wouldn’t, and didn’t deserve to. Is it possible there are deeper reserves of humility, modesty and good intent lurking around in there than we know? And maybe a toolbox, too, that can screw those things together and produce something good?\" Kind of vulnerable to flattery, isn't she? Anyway, yeah, let's hope Donald Trump can screw us together... in a good way. Posted by Ann Althouse at 12:30 PM",

This is by Amanda Hess. It's a promising topic. But let's dig into it. Here's the set-up: While the angry tweets, therapeutic Instagram testimonials and fiery speeches may comfort their fans, these left-leaning celebrities are also inadvertently energizing the opposition. Energizing. There's that word. It came up in that big NYT interview with Donald Trump. The executive editor of the NYT, Dean Baquet, asserted that Trump had \"energized\" the people who attended that \"alt-right convention in Washington this weekend\" and asked Trump if he feels that he's \"said things that energized them in particular.\" Trump accepted the word and simply said \"I don’t want to energize the group.... and if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why.\" But I'm thinking \"energize\" is a word that's having its day as an expression that works to create a sense that one person is responsible for what someone else does. A said X and B did Y. You couldn't say A caused Y, but you might say A energized B. It's vague, but it might feel incisive. And it's a way to tangle A up in demands to denounce B or explain why A didn't lead to Y. I'm going to keep my eye on this word. It might lull people into believing things are more connected and people are less autonomous than they really are. Now, back to Amanda Hess, who took care to put \"inadvertently\" before her \"energizing.\" The celebs are trying to reach people who, they assume, feel the way they do. But others can see it too, and they expose themselves to mockery. Rich, privileged folks can look pretty silly making a spectacle of their despair over the results of an election. Conservative news outlets — most notably Breitbart News Network, the right-wing populist enclave — are perfecting the art of sapping Democratic stars’ name recognition and repurposing their words and actions into pro-Trump material.... And it's not just Breitbart, it's also \"nimble, often nameless online aggregators who quickly churn through popular culture and throw the most evocative stories to their readers, often without much commentary.\" Well, yeah, I know how that works. That's what much of the best of blogging does. But I say very short commentary can be great. Twitter is a testament to the fun of bouncing off of some news story. Hess seems most interested in Breitbart (presumably because Breitbart connects to Steve Bannon and that gets us to Trump). Hess calls attention to a Breitbart piece — which seized upon a Dunham Instagram — \"'Grieving' Lena Dunham Seeks Answers in Arizona Wilderness After Trump Win.\" Hess endeavors to make this ridicule of Dunham seem ominous. Considering Bannon's closeness to Trump, \"calling attention to Ms. Dunham’s Jewish faith feels like a bone thrown to the site’s white nationalist readers.\" Okay, let's go to the Breitbart article and see that bone in person: In a separate post on Wednesday, Dunham said she had spent days “grieving” over the “loss of our country and the woman who inspired us,” comparing her experience to that of the “shivah,” a Jewish mourning ritual. The NYT article doesn't give a link to the Breitbart article. I got that for you myself. I think it's a safe bet that the vast majority of NYT readers assumed that Breitbart gratuitously inserted a reminder that that Dunham is Jewish, but the article doesn't even say Dunham is Jewish . It just quotes an Instagram of hers describing her grieving over the election in terms of a Jewish ritual. You don't even have to be Jewish to decide to talk about 7 days as a good period of mourning after which you \"emerge from darkness\" and \"create light.\" Making fun of Dunham's treating an election loss like a death in the family is pretty far from anti-Semitism, but see how it's close enough to energize an accusation of energizing ? Another Breitbart piece highlighted in Hess's article is “‘Depressed’ Robert De Niro: Trump Election Makes Me ‘Feel Like I Did After 9/11.’” Lefty celebrities are serving up darkly hilarious bilge that doesn't even need rewriting to be funny. If I'd noticed that one, I'd have just used the quote and identified the author. It wouldn't have needed any commentary at all. Just showing it to you would have been enough to carry the message that I thought it was terrible and terribly funny. And Hess knows that: The real ideological action is undertaken by the audience, whose members read between the lines of these culture pieces and then scribble in the margins. Scribble in the margins . That's you, dear commenters. So, say what you will. I'm energizing you. And believe me, I have been attacked repeatedly — even by some of my own colleagues — for the things you say in the forum I've created. Posted by Ann Althouse at 10:54 AM",

      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal November 23, 2016 Here is an email from someone I know to be utterly trustworthy and distinctly perceptive, who doesn't want her name here but has authorized me to publish this: I just read your post linking to the NYT article. She's talking about the November 21st post that highlights a quote from a NYT articleby Mark Liebovich,\" Reince Priebus, Normalizer in Chief\" : For all his well-honed sheepishness, Priebus’s 'just a kid from Kenosha, Wisc.' shtick belies a penchant for main stages, big-ticket rooms and high-level company. No shortage of Reince Priebus photos hang on the walls of the R.N.C.’s headquarters on Capitol Hill. He can be a little star-struck. He travels far and often to appear with candidates and party dignitaries at events where his presence is not necessarily required. Priebus was giddy when I spoke to him last spring as he prepared to attend a party for Time’s '100 most influential people' at Lincoln Center. We were on the phone, him walking through the lobby of the J.W. Marriott after a packed day of fund-raising. He sounded almost out of breath, less from exhaustion than what seemed like pure excitement. He told me how stoked he was to meet the golfer Jordan Spieth and the pro-wrestler-turned-actor the Rock. 'Those are my top two,' Priebus said, especially the Rock. 'I was a big pro-wrestling fan back in the day,” he added, noting his childhood admiration for Hulk Hogan and Mad Dog Vachon.' 'Growing up in Kenosha, Wisc., being named to the Top 100 list is a pretty cool thing,' Priebus told me. At this point, I reminded him that no national party chairman would ever be named to the Top 100 except in extraordinary circumstances like these — and these were not particularly enviable ones. My emailer, who had been a student at my law school, the University of Wisconsin Law School, was provoked to write this: In August 2000 (after finishing my clerkship) I joined Priebus's firm, where he was a senior associate working as a tax attorney. He was one of the fellows designated to train and mentor the newbies. I met no one with as few pretensions, arrogances, and agendas as he had. He truly was a real \"Wisconsin\" guy. He made people feel like a welcome part of the family. Although I initially bristled at firm work, Reince had a welcome, sincere \"GOLLY! Welcome to the team\" kind attitude. Sure, he's likely been tainted by politics, but my gut trusts him. Wisconsin to the core. Kind of like Bo Ryan was (and not like Barry Alvarez). ADDED: I fixed a few mistakes in the email. Notably, I changed \"without as few\" to \"with as few.\" IN THE COMMENTS: Lawyerly said: I joined that same law firm a year later and remained for many years after that, including the year he was promoted to partner. My assessment of Reince was exactly the same. It's been remarkable watching his ascent. In my view all those photos hanging in his office aren't hung boastfully but more in the manner of a giddy 12 year old who has managed to get his picture taken with his favorite sports heroes. I believe he is a genuinely humble person, which has contributed to his success by allowing him to identify strategies with no mind for personal gain, and to pivot quickly away from strategies that aren't working without shame or regret.

      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal November 22, 2016 New York Magazine says. The group, which includes voting-rights attorney John Bonifaz and J. Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, believes they’ve found persuasive evidence that results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania may have been manipulated or hacked. The group is so far not speaking on the record about their findings and is focused on lobbying the Clinton team in private.... The Clinton camp is running out of time to challenge the election. According to one of the activists, the deadline in Wisconsin to file for a recount is Friday; in Pennsylvania, it’s Monday; and Michigan is next Wednesday.... What does it mean to say there is \"persuasive evidence\" that something \" may have\" happened? The \"may have\" takes the edge of urgency off \"persuasive evidence.\" I've read the short article at the link and doubt that the idea will tempt Clinton to pursue a challenge. ADDED: \"Shame on Liberal Journalists For Running With Baseless Election ‘Hack’ Story\": There is only one “fact” cited in the original NY Mag piece that would point to hacking, and that was immediately debunked by actual experts (per Nate Silver it doesn’t even “pass the sanity test,” Dave Wasserman calls it “pathetic”). Remarkably, the NYDN piece repeats the sole “evidence” of hacking, and then completely debunks it two paragraphs later.... So Clinton’s vote was down 7% in Wisconsin counties with electronic voting… and counties with electronic voting were also the ones most likely to vote against Clinton. In other words, literally nothing is suspicious about the election results. Posted by Ann Althouse at 8:16 PM",

      "text": "USA Network USA Network \nI’ve learned that Amazon is finalizing a deal for exclusive subscription VOD rights to Falling Water , USA Network ’s new supernatural thriller from the late Henry Bromell ( Homeland ), Brotherhood creator Blake Masters and The Walking Dead executive producer Gale Anne Hurd . The pact is a shot in the arm for the fledgling series and boosts its renewal chances. \nFalling Water had an inauspicious ratings start on USA. Possibly a better fit for sibling Syfy than general entertainment network USA, Falling Water has been averaging 450,000 viewers in Live+Same Day. Its viewership has risen above 600,000 in Live+3 with solid 30%+ lifts. \nWith its dense mythology, Falling Water is considered better suited for a streaming service than a traditional network. Additionally, its viewership has been very steady, indicating the show has built a small but devoted fan base, something VOD platforms seek. \nIf Falling Water is renewed by USA as most indications suggest, it would be the second series on the network saved by an innovative multi-platform deal. It would join comedy Playing House, which now has its premiere on VOD via a pact with Xfinity. Helping Falling Water’ s cause is the fact that it is owned by USA — the series is produced by sibling Universal Cable Prods — giving the network more flexibility to stick with a show that may not deliver on linear TV if it brings revenue to its studio. \nFalling Water would expand Amazon’s existing relationship with USA. Amazon landed the rights to the network’s signature series, cyber thriller Mr. Robot, in 2015. In 2013, in one of its first major off-network agreements, it inked an exclusive pact with NBCUniversal for a number of broadcast and cable series including USA’s Suits and Covert Affairs. \nFalling Water tells the story of three unrelated people who slowly realize they are dreaming separate parts of a single common dream. The deeper they dig, the more they come to realize that the visions found in the dream just might hold the key to the fate of the world. Lizzie Brochere, David Ajala and Will Yun Lee star. \nFalling Water is executive produced by Hurd of Valhalla Entertainment, Masters and Juan Carlos Fresnadillo who also directed the pilot. Bromell, who co-created the series, was credited posthumously as an executive producer on the pilot.",

      "text": "Amazon flooded with negative reviews of Megyn Kelly's memoir 11:42 a.m. 11:42 a.m. 0 \nSEATTLE (AP) - Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\"",

      "text": "Just about everyone is meeting or exceeding Amazon’s Black Friday/Cyber Monday offerings. \nBy Richard M. Sherwin, Amy Eller, Ted Mayo, Bob Plunkett, Jennifer Auspitz, and Susan Davis \nFor more great devices and products, please turn to our sister company, Tech50+ and their new health and wellness product section Staying Alive . \nWe’re not going to say we told you so, but we told you so! Last holiday season we got many emails, calls, and chats claiming that people were going to wait for Amazon’s anticipated sale since Amazon allegedly never runs out of stock. We said that you were better off using your Target card to get 5% off the same TV, PC, cooking machine, clothes, and toys. \nIn fact this year too, for big ticket items, Costco is matching almost all of Amazon’s prices and adding an extra 2 year warranty. BJ’s new Master Card also gives you back 4% on many items and, for the holiday season, gives you another 5 cents (total 15 cents) off your gasoline bill where available when using the BJ’s credit card. And, if you have a lot of sizes of clothes, or weird present requests, Walmart carries enough fashion (yes fashion) and Kohls and many other retailers now have the designer brands your mother-in-law loves. Even next day shipping is now almost everywhere and nearly every brick and mortar store (even Best Buy) has better prices and more reasonable return policies than Amazon. \nOur top picks so far: \n4K TVS: BJ’s Samsung 43″ 4K Smart TV. It’s a hard-to-find size and not available at other shopping clubs, so this under $450 TV is remarkable. The Hisense 55″ and LG 65″ (2016 ½ models) lead the larger sizes and the Sony Bravia 70″ (very expensive) is worth it if you can afford it. \nPCs: Apple’s new 21″ IMac and 15″ MacBook Pro can finally be had for a discount. Apple, if you are a teacher, business person, or know someone who is, will now bargain. We’ve seen some people get as much as a 15-20% or more discount on these computers if you call Apple directly. \nYou have to be very careful about buying a Mac at Best Buy and Amazon, as they often feature last year’s or even two year ago models. HP’s 15″ laptop with touch screen special model at Costco is the first time in years HP has outdone Dell, Lenovo, and Acer with this $525 family priced Christmas special. \nPrinters: Walmart’s under $125 selection of Canon Printers are a great buy for almost any family. Epson also has some budget conscious models at Target, some as low as $69. \nMobile Phones and Services: Insiders claim that Verizon is losing its battle with tier two and three providers like T-Mobile, Sprint, and Consumer Cellular. Verizon, which dropped the ball not only on price but on unlimited service, is bouncing back right before Christmas with some great sales of its own. AT&T has also dropped prices drastically when combined with DirecTV service, creating an outstanding mobile phone/TV service deal. \nAs far as hardware goes, so far everyone we know with an iPhone 7 has complained about repairs, non-improved features, so maybe it’s time to go “Other Android” with a Motorola (owned by Lenovo); LG (very underrated), and other off brands which are offering better guarantees. Included in the new recommended list are HTC, Huawei, and ZTE. The new, much anticipated Google model heavily pushed by Verizon (because they dropped Samsung), is just not worth the price unless you get it absolutely free which you sometimes can. \nTablets: Once again this is the hottest selling category. And in this arena we recommend you go with the better-known manufacturers. Our best bet is the 8″ Samsung Galaxy Model A (formerly $200), which is only $99 at BJ’s. It’s fast, has a great screen, holds as much as 120 GB on a micro SD card, and frankly is now easier than the 8″ iPad, which is almost three times the cost with less memory and features. \nLG, Lenovo, Dell make almost competitively good tablets, but alas have not dropped their prices enough in our opinion. We didn’t love the Acer (which while priced right hasn’t been updated in almost two years). We still think the Amazon Fire (any edition) has too many built in ads and DOES NOT RUN all the great Apps on Android. And no matter how many times you see the Microsoft Surface on NFL games, outside of a free copy of Office, we haven’t found one person who likes it. \nVoice Controlled Speaker: Amazon Echo was first, Triby, a little French-NYC company, was second, and now Google has entered the market with its version using Hi Google command like you do with your Android Phone or Tablet. Can Apple and Sony be next to ask for music, shopping, news, operating automated home controls and more? \nSo far the $179 Triby has the most possibilities because it has a screen to deliver written messages and because it can be hung on a refrigerator, but the $49 Amazon Echo Dot has met or exceeded expectations. Some alleged industry experts like Google’s voice search, but we think the extra Apps built into Amazon Echo are superior. We are hoping that Triby gets rid of its bugs (it uses Amazon’s Alexa voice) as we want the little guy to succeed here. \nSound Bar: As we reported a few weeks ago, Polk, LG, and Yamaha were the best in class in the under $500 category. Bose, Sony, and Samsung models (all former best sellers at a steep price) are now all available at shopping clubs, but you must make sure that you are buying this year’s model. \nPain Relief Devices: We’ve tried them all – from Omron, Quell, Aleve and store branded electronic stimulation devices and they all provide some temporary relief for arthritic knees, sore arms, neck, and legs. However, we’ve shown these devices to some top pain specialists in New England and New York and have been laughed at almost unanimously. All dubbed “TENS” (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) a short term fad and not to be thought of as a long term pain relief therapy. There are several variations of this pain therapy technology and while DFA was lucky enough to test almost every brand, we suggest you make sure whether you buy it at drug store or online, that your device is returnable if it doesn’t help. \nNoise Cancelling Headphones: We’ve always liked the underdog in this still very popular category and this year is no different. Sony and Bose make acoustically clear over the ear headphones that connect via Bluetooth to your mobile phone, tablet, or component audio system. But Plantronics wins again with its new model, the $200 BackBeat Pro 2. This version of the award winning headphone has even longer battery life (20 hours), but its noise cancelling technology is equally adaptive whether you are listening to Bach, calling home, or watching the ball game. We found this version of the BackBeat Pro even more comfortable than its predecessor and, like its predecessor, it seems to carry bass very well without boosting the audio. It also doesn’t discriminate against low tones for those with more traditional audio listening tastes. Our favorite feature is that the device turns off when you take it off your head and automatically back on when you put it back on your head. Yes, we’ll still quibble with the controls which take a few minutes to learn, but all in all, it’s a great buy.",

The Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. Kelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. Publisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews. Seattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. Company spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" Latest News Video ",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray In case you missed it, Amazon.com ( AMZN ) yesterday announced another one of its cuts in price for its AWS cloud computing service, in this case, the price for its “ S3 ” storage offering.\nThe company cut prices in most regions it served, it said in a post on AWS , and also consolidated six “pricing tiers” into just three.\nEvercore ISI ’s Ken Sena , who rates the stock a Buy and has a $990 price target, notes that this latest cut comes just after the company “cut pricing on several EC2 instances by 5-25% in numerous regions last week.”\nThis is going to cut Amazon’s revenue growth rate, he thinks, but by how much is a tricky matter. Sena reasons it’s not as bad as might at first seem:\nAt first blush, by applying the pricing cuts across our estimate for IaaS revenues (81% of total), it yields an 8.6% AWS revenue growth impact. But we think this is two aggressive as it essentially gives little credit to other AWS services, including Compute (besides EC2), Storage/CDN (besides S3), Database, Networking, Developer Tools, Management Tools, Security, Analytics, Application Services, and Mobile Services. Conversely, while optimistic, if we evenly distribute these services and apply the reduction to just one in ten, we arrive at a much more manageable 2.8% impact to AWS revenues. In reality, we believe the answer lies somewhere in the middle, leading us to estimate a ~6% impact at the midpoint.\nHe ends up cutting his Amazon AWS revenue outlook for 2017, and for profit, but bear in mind there’s still some “elasticity” in the business to account for:\nWhile we suspect that these price cuts may have been factored already in Amazon’s 4Q guidance (which was issued less than a month ago), we are electing to lower our 4Q AWS revenue 1% to $3.71bn (54% y/y), a 200bp impact to growth, since the pricing changes will be in effect for just one month. This leaves Amazon total revenues effectively unchanged, given that AWS only represents 8% of revenues, albeit ~50% of CSOI. In turn, we are reducing our CSOI 2% to $2.02bn (16% y/y, 4.5% of revenue), which moves us to $1.16bn in GAAP EBIT, now slightly below the high end of the company’s guidance range. As we look to the impact of these cuts on 2017, where a full-year of cuts get factored, we are lowering our 2017 AWS revenue 2% to $17.76bn (43% y/y), or a ~350 bp impact to growth as we contemplate some elasticity, which flows through to a 4% reduction to CSOI, assuming the lost revenue represented 100% margin.\nAmazon shares today are down $6.51, or 0.8%, at $778.82.",

      "text": "Amazon and Google want you to get a digital home assistant for Christmas — even if you didn't ask for one Amazon Echo AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File This 2015 file photo shows Amazon's Echo -- a device facing big competition from Google this holiday season. This 2015 file photo shows Amazon's Echo -- a device facing big competition from Google this holiday season. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Tracey Lien \nThe holidays have traditionally been an important time for the consumer tech world, with electronics makers placing big bets that shoppers will venture into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales with open minds and open wallets. \nBut for some manufacturers, this year might be more important than others. \nProducts in categories that consumers aren’t yet familiar with — think digital home assistants, like Amazon’s Echo — tend to bank the most on a successful holiday season, according to retail analysts. \nBut those encountering competition for the first time — again, think Amazon’s Echo — face a double whammy. First, they need to convince the public their product is more than a novelty, then they convince the public to choose theirs and not its rivals. \n“There’s clearly some overlap between the Echo and Google Home,” said Craig Johnson, president of retail consulting firm Consumer Growth Partners. “I’m not convinced people have room for both devices in their lives.” \nAmazon’s virtual home assistant has been around for three years, but this will be the first year it has a direct competitor in Google Home. Neither product is likely to win a monopoly this holiday season, according to analysts, who believe the category of virtual home assistants is still too new and poorly-understood to have that kind of penetration. But if one company gains the lead, it could lock the other out from some households. \nBoth Google and Amazon have ramped up their marketing efforts in the lead-up to Thanksgiving. Google will temporarily discount its virtual home assistant at retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Walmart during Thanksgiving week from $129 to $99, nearly half of what a full-priced Echo costs. \nAmazon has given its line of virtual home assistants — including the recently-launched lower-cost Echo Dot — prime placement on its website, bought TV advertisements, and splashed the Web with Echo ads. Steep discounts are expected around Black Friday, and Amazon has already tried to turn customers into Echo gift-givers by offering a buy-five-get-one-free deal on the palm-sized Echo Dot. \n“It forces them to step up their game,” said Marlene Morris Towns, a professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business. “You can see they’re investing quite a bit in its promotion.” \nThis particular holiday season is also important for both Google and Amazon because it’s an opportunity to establish the product category; a chance to finally shed the novelty moniker that devices like the Echo have carried for the past three years, and to re-introduce them to consumers as must-haves. \n“It’s reminiscent of the release of TiVo,” said Towns, referring to the digital video recorder from 1999 that let people record TV shows airing on different channels at the same time. “It was this great technology that was hard for people to get their head around. TiVo faced this challenge where it was hard to get people who hadn’t tried it to adopt it.” \nThe Echo and Google Home find themselves in a similar position, Towns said. Amazon and Google can advertise all they want, but people want to know that it’s something they can trust, she said. And one of the best ways to gain consumer trust is to have the people they trust using it. \n“When people entertain and have friends and family stay over, it’s an opportunity for exposure,” Towns said. “Thinking back to TiVo, I wasn’t sold on it until I went to a friend’s house to watch the Super Bowl. We were in awe of how it worked.” \nGift-giving is another big opportunity, said Johnson, who noted that products such as the Echo and Google Home are priced in the gift-giving “sweet spot.” Even Amazon has acknowledged this, saying in a statement sent to the Times that with the introduction of the Echo Dot, which retails for $49.99, “it is easier than ever to give the gift of Alexa this year, or add Alexa to any room of the house” (Alexa is the name of the artificial intelligence that powers the Echo). \nBut in addition to going up against each other, Johnson said both the Echo and Google Home will find themselves competing with other consumer electronics that are also priced in the gift-giving “sweet spot” of below $1,000. They’ll be up against virtual reality headsets from Oculus, Sony and Samsung. They’ll compete with new-release video games. Johnson even sees some 60-inch 4K televisions as competition for the Echo and Home. \n“In terms of wallet share, they’re competing with a broader market,” he said. \nBut there’s reason to be hopeful. In a recent survey conducted by consumer data firm Qualtrics, holiday shoppers were asked which tech toys they wanted most. The leading gadget, with 23.85% of votes, was the iPhone 7. In second place with 12.17% was the Xbox One. The Amazon Echo came in a close third at 12.05%. Google Home wasn’t included in the survey. If Amazon pulls off its holiday strategy, those people might just get what they want.

      "text": "When one thinks of efforts to bridge the gap between people of different faiths and help our nation heal during times of widening divisions, Amazon probably isn't the first organization to come to mind.\nNevertheless, the online retail giant has debuted a new holiday commercial that seems to be a direct response to the growing problem of Islamophobia in the Western World.\nSet in England, the ad features an Episcopal priest and a Muslim cleric enjoying tea and griping about shared ailments.\n\nEventually they part company and use Amazon's Prime service to send one another presents.\nEach of them gets a knee brace in the mail (presumably with free shipping) and reflects fondly on their friendship as he slips on.\nThe message is clear:\nWhether you're a Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist or atheist - getting old sucks.\nWe kid.\nAs the priest and the cleric both kneel (now with less pain), it's clear that the ad intends to remind us that we're all more alike than we are different.\nNot to get all political in our description of a warm-and-fuzzy Amazon ad, but it's an important message during a time when the media has been forced to frequently use the phrase \" Muslin ban \" in its coverage of the guy who will soon be president.\nInterestingly, some advertising industry experts believe this to be the first commercial featuring a Muslim cleric ever to be broadcast on mainstream American television.\n\"I can’t think of one. There are plenty of religious figures in televisions, especially sitcoms and police procedurals. But no ads with imams,” says Tobe Berkovitz, advertiser professor at Boston University.\nToss out that giblet if the conversation gets too political during tomorrow's feast.\n",

      "text": "Amazon Removed a Lot of Trump Troll Reviews of Megyn Kelly’s Book by Ken Meyer | 3:43   \nAmazon has taken action to eliminate a number of blatantly-negative reviews on Settle for More , the new auto-biography from Fox’s Megyn Kelly . \nKelly’s new book was released on November 15, and between her reflections on her personal growth, Kelly wrote about the challenges she experienced at the hands of President-elect Donald Trump , and her former CEO, Roger Ailes . Shortly after her book became available on Amazon, it received a flood of negative comments, many of which were linked to pro-Trump Reddit forums. \nHarperCollins, the publisher of Kelly’s memoir, told the Los Angeles Times the comments were part of “an orchestrated effort to discredit the book,” and Amazon couldn’t verify that all of the negative commenters actually purchased, and therefore read, the book. According to USA Today , over 100 politically-motivated reviews have now been erased from the site. \nEven so, some Trump-bent reviews remain, along with those that have called out Amazon for censorship: \nKelly and Trump had an enormously contentious relationship throughout the 2016 election, and the Fox host has noted that her personal life was affected from pro-Trump online trolls. A similar incident took place on Amazon this year, when Trump supporters criticized Michelle Fields ‘ book in connection with her dust-up with the Trump campaign. \nAs of the writing of this article, 30% percent of the reviewers have given Kelly’s book 5 stars, while 59% have given her 1 star. \n[Image via screengrab]",

      "text": "151.59 USD \nHere's a heartfelt Thanksgiving message for retailers: Amazon is killing you, and you are missing the best shot to fight back. \nShopping with Amazon.com Inc. has become an ingrained habit for many of the world's consumers. Thanks largely to the hugely successful Prime shopping club, many consumers automatically turn to Amazon when they need to replace their coffee filters or find new headphones. \nIts dominant position is even more pronounced this time of year. About 55 percent of Americans surveyed by Kantar Retail say they plan to shop on Amazon for holiday gifts. That's up from 41 percent two years earlier. Tipping Point For the first time, more than half of all consumers surveyed by Kantar said they would shop at Amazon for holiday gifts this year, a jump of more than 5 percentage points from 2015 Source: Kantar Retail, Bloomberg Intelligence Note: Respondents can make more than one selection. Surveyed 3,617 people in 2016 and 3,697 in 2015. \nCompetitors can trot out all the Black Friday door-busters they want, but it's now Amazon vs. everyone else, and the boys and girls in Seattle are winning. \nStill, Amazon does have a vulnerability many retailers haven't fully exploited: prices. \nAmazon built its reputation as an everything store with razor-thin profits. It has convinced shoppers it always has the cheaper choice, regardless of the reality. Amazon's Optics Walmart and Target are perceived to be fairly more expensive than Amazon Source: Boomerang Commerce Note: The price perception index factors in product popularity, such that the price competitiveness of more popular items are given more weight than less popular items. \nIt turns out Amazon doesn't actually have the lowest prices. Its special sauce is knowing how to create a low-price halo by cherry-picking the most popular products and undercutting its competitors there, while maintaining list prices on other products, according to Boomerang Commerce, which makes price-tracking software. \nPercentage Of Least-Popular Items Amazon Discounts 1% \nWhen analyzing toys and games last month, Boomerang found Amazon discounted 32 percent of its most-popular items, but only 9 percent of what it calls \"core\" items and 1 percent of the least-popular items. That let it maintain the perception of having the lowest price, without having to take margin-squeezing discounts on all its offerings. While media outlets have written about Amazon's pricing tactics , it is not common knowledge among many consumers. Balancing Act Amazon prices the most-popular products most competitively, driving consumer perception of it as a low-priced retailer, while other retailers discount across the board Source: Boomerang Commerce Note: Categories divided into the most popular 20 percent, middle 50 percent and bottom 30 percent of 1,800 items. The data was compiled during October 2016. \nRetailers this holiday season can pounce on this gap between consumer perception and price reality. They can advertise head-to-head price comparisons on their websites and in their stores. They can call out Amazon, just as Sprint's television commercials target Verizon directly, and as Apple once went after Microsoft for selling dowdy PCs. Want to stretch those holiday shopping dollars further? Turn to us, not to Amazon. \nIt's not enough to just be cheaper. Retailers have to be louder, and more targeted. Some booksellers are already doing this, putting tags on popular novels comparing their prices to Amazon's. The website of The Strand, a New York-based bookstore, has a section called Real Books Cheaper than E-Books. \nYes, it is dangerous for retailers to engage in a price war with Jeff Bezos, Amazon's famously aggressive CEO. He can simply drop the price on KitchenAid mixers if Walmart brags about undercutting Amazon. But the goal here isn't to sell more kitchen appliances. It's to plant a seed in consumers' minds that Amazon may not be the smartest place to turn first. \nRight now, they definitely are turning to Amazon, particularly during the holidays. More than a third of visits to retail websites last year were to Amazon, according to eMarketer. The next-closest retailer, Walmart, only grabbed a 6 percent share. Amazon Dominates The Discussion Top 15 U.S. Retail websites, ranked by visit share in December 2015 Source: Connexity, eMarketer \nAnd while Amazon's value perception has slipped a bit over the past year, consumers still rate it the highest among big retailers at providing good value for their money, according to YouGov BrandIndex. Value Trap Among big retailers, Amazon gets the highest rating from consumers on the question \"Does it give good value for what you pay?\" -- but that value perception is down from a year ago Source: YouGov Note: A Value score can range from -100 to 100 with a zero score equaling a neutral position. Example: A score of 35 means that 35% more people said they were positive than negative about the brand. 35,000 adults 18 and over interviewed over the past year, with a margin of error of +/- 3%. \nGetting the lowest price -- particularly around the holidays -- is still very important to shoppers. More than 50 percent of consumers surveyed by Kantar said \"getting a good deal\" was the most important holiday shopping priority, while 34 percent said the top priority was \"spending as little as possible.\" Deal Hunters Finding a good deal is still the top priority for holiday shoppers, despite dropping from a year ago Source: Kantar Retail and Bloomberg Intelligence \nIf retailers such as Walmart, Target, and Toys \"R\" Us are going to convince shoppers to open their wallets and spend with them this holiday season, they need to challenge their biggest enemy explicitly. Retailers are losing the war to Amazon. It's time they used some new weapons to fight back. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. \nDuring the holidays, Amazon prices are lower in some categories. Toys on Amazon this holiday season are 0.6 percent cheaper than at Walmart and 3.7 percent cheaper than at Toys \"R\" Us, according to a study conducted by Bloomberg Intelligence. \nThe share of shoppers who cited price as a top priority declined somewhat from prior years' surveys. \nTo contact the authors of this story: Shira Ovide in New York at Shelly Banjo in New York at \nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at Leaping Deere Leaping Deere Deere shares spiked to a record after the company reported earnings that weren't as awful as expected Source: Bloomberg ",

      "title": "Jeremy Clarkson: Amazon show is ”Top Gear’ in witness protection’",
      "text": "NEW YORK — Jeremy Clarkson is on top once again with his new Amazon show, “The Grand Tour.”\nClarkson, the former co-host of the globally popular and long running BBC show, “Top Gear,” told CNN’s “Quest Means Business” that the new series is “‘Top Gear’ in witness protection.”\n“That’s what a friend of mine said the other day, a reviewer. [This show] is different because it moves around the world, that’s really it,” Clarkson told CNNMoney reporter Maggie Lake. “But it’s still James [May], Richard [Hammond], and I. So it’s like if you have a glass of champagne and you have it in a bucket or in a glass, it’s still champagne, and that’s really what it is. It’s a different vessel, but the show is, with different elements, basically about the same.”\nAccording to Amazon, the premiere episode of “The Grand Tour” was the subscription service’s most-watched premiere since “The Man in The High Castle.”\n\nClarkson and his co-hosts are on Amazon instead of the BBC because Clarkson was fired by the BBC for punching a producer, Oisin Tymon. It was the last straw for the BBC, which had weathered a number of controversies involving Clarkson, including racist and homophobic comments he made over the years. But it doesn’t sound like Clarkson is planning on reining himself in.\n“The BBC always let us do what we wanted to do and Amazon is exactly the same,” he said. “It says say what you want to say, do what you want to do. We always were self-policed, and sometimes you tread on a landmine and sometimes you don’t, move on.”\nBut, Clarkson said, “I never want to be controversial, it just happens. I say stuff sometimes and think, ‘Oh, no.”\n\n“I try to present a TV show in the way that I hear people talking,” Clarkson said. “Not in city centers, not at agreeable dinner parties with editors and media people, but actual people talking. There was just two doors down here … there’s some people loading trucks and truck drivers and they’ve all got hoodies, visibility jackets, and hard hats on. I was just staring at them, sitting in traffic, thinking, ‘I want to hear what they talk about when they’re out and about,’ because that’s what I would like to reflect in the show. … [W]e’re not making the show for what we call in the UK ‘the sneering media elite,’ of which I am a part. I’m not making a show for my friends, my colleagues, I’m making a show for everyone else, and it turns out, as we’ve seen in recent events, that there’s millions and millions of them.”\nIt’s clear Clarkson is still not shy when it comes to speaking his mind. Asked his thoughts on President-elect Donald Trump suggesting in a tweet that UK far-right politician Nigel Farage should be named the country’s ambassador to the US, he quipped, “If he is, we’ll go back to England.”\nFor now, though, Clarkson is focused not on the success of this season of “The Grand Tour,” but the next one.\n“You’ve still got to concentrate,” he said. “You can’t rejoice, you concentrate on the next one and next one and next one. They’ve all got to be good, otherwise no point in doing it.”",

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": "Tomorrow marks Amazon Prime Day, the online retailer's biggest annual day of sales, and if you're in the market for a new tablet, there's a deal you're going to love. The impressive 7-inch Amazon Fire tablet will be available for just £34.99. That's right - for less than the price of some in-app purchase packs, you'll be able to get a shiny new tablet. A decent one at that. Starting at midnight, the Amazon Fire tablet will see almost a third slashed from its usual cost, down £15 from a usual £49.99 asking price. You'll have to act fast if you want to get your mitts on the 1.3GHz quad-core slate at a cut price rate though. The Fire's Prime Day sale will only last for one day (July 12). So what's the catch? Well, you'll need to be an Amazon Prime member to make use of the offer, the honour of which will set you back £79.99 per year. Affordability aside, what does the Amazon Fire tablet offer? Well, the slate, which is available in black, orange, blue and purple colour schemes, comes with 8GB of internal storage, a 1024 x 600 pixel display and two inbuilt cameras - a VGA snapper up front and a 2-megapixel camera on the rear. Lining up at 10.6mm thick and 313g in weight, the Amazon Fire tablet also boasts a solid 7-hour battery life. Just one of a number of Amazon's own-brand devices being offered on the cheap, the Fire tablet will line up alongside the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, down to just £79.99, and the brilliant Amazon Fire TV Stick that, for one day only, can be picked up for a bargain £19.99.",

      "text": "The Gear Knobs are no more. Earlier this week Amazon announced that its Clarkson, Hammond and May-fronted motoring show will actually be known as The Grand Tour. To celebrate this mildly disappointing branding decision, Amazon is plying your pockets with cash. OK, not quite, but it is letting you save a significant sum on a new Amazon Prime membership. Usually hitting your wallet for £79 every 12 months, the online retail giant has slashed £20 from its fee, meaning a year's subscription will now set new customers back just £59 – nice. If you want to save cut costs on a year's Amazon Prime membership, however, you'll have to act quickly. The deal, which is underway now, only runs until 11:59pm on Monday, May 16. As well as annual access to Amazon's Netflix rivalling streaming service, Amazon Prime Video, Prime members benefit from a number of additional features including free next day delivery on all of your physical orders – awesome in its own right. Then, there's free Kindle book borrowing and Amazon Music streaming, too. You can sign up to Amazon Prime here.",

      "text": "Alexa , the voice control assistant living inside Amazon's Echo , Echo Dot and Tap speakers , is extremely versatile. She can adjust your thermostat , give you news headlines from around the world and even start your robot vacuum .\nBut can she help when your Aunt Shirley starts talking about her stamp collection during Thanksgiving dinner? Actually, we think she can.\nHere are our favorite tips and tricks for overcoming awkward family conversations during the holiday season -- with Amazon 's Alexa.\n9 7 reasons Alexa is better than Google Home's built-in Assistant Game time Watching a game -- or two -- can be a great source of entertainment during a family gathering. It isn't a bad way to avoid potentially uncomfortable run-ins with relatives, either. Here are some sports-related questions you can ask Alexa, straight from Amazon.com . There's no need to enable a Skill for these.\n\"Alexa, what is the score of the Ohio State Buckeyes football game?\" \"Alexa, who is winning the Washington Nationals game?\" \"Alexa, when do the Seattle Storm play next?\" \"Alexa, who won the Chicago Bulls game?\" \"Alexa, what was the score of the Kentucky Wildcats game?\" \"Alexa, when is the next Oregon Ducks game?\" \"Alexa, how are the New York Rangers doing? Unfortunately, Alexa wasn't able to list off all of the NFL football games playing on Thanksgiving day. Get those details here .\nOther cool Alexa stuff: Hey Alexa, tell Neato to clean this place up! Amazon Alexa users now have access to 60,000+ recipes Alexa, lock my Focus: Ford to integrate Amazon Echo this year Let's play... Trade in traditional board games this Thanksgiving for one of Alexa's many game-related Skills. Here are a few we really like:\n1. Amazing Word Master\nEnable the Skill for this game and then say, \"Alexa, ask Word Master to play a game,\" or \"Alexa, open Word Master\" to start. Alexa will then say a word and you have to respond with a word that starts with the letter her word ended with. The longer your word, the higher you score.\n2. Jeopardy! J6\nEnable the Jeopardy! J6 Skill in your Alexa app and say, \"Alexa, play Jeopardy.\" She'll then give you six questions that you have to answer in the form of a question (only six are available per day). She might say something like: \"The 2002 film 'Red Dragon' featured this Anthony Hopkins villain,\" to which you'd respond, \"Who is Hannibal Lecter?\"\n3. Abra\nEnable the Abra Skill and launch the game by saying, \"Alexa, start Akinator!\" Think of a real or fictional character and Alexa will ask you a series of questions to try to guess the person. She guessed Michael Jackson and Elsa from the movie \"Frozen\" very quickly when I played with her.\nEnlarge Image You can buy an Amazon Echo Dot for just $50.\nPhoto by Chris Monroe/CNET Musical interludes If you want to play some background music during Thanksgiving dinner or simply queue up a specific song, Alexa has got you covered.

      "text": "The global tech giant Amazon has been making headlines again. According to WSJ , Amazon is very keen on carrying live sports on its Prime program as an exclusive premium channel. However, live sports contents are the most expensive content available in the world. Can Amazon really do this? Why are they interested? What would happen if they succeed? We explore these topics one by one.\n\nWhy Would Amazon Want to Do This? Amazon is intensely focused on one thing: bringing the best value to online shoppers. It is especially focused on doing so for its loyal customers under the Amazon Prime program. Prime is a subscription that costs $99 per year (or $10.99 per month) and provides perks like free 2-day shipping, music and video contents to its subscribers. After the huge success of Netflix, Amazon has been aggressively growing its Prime Video library to buff up the value of Prime to consumers. No doubt it wants to fatten up its subscription package even more to provide greater value to its customers, attract more subscribers to its platform, and reduce the number of people cancelling their subscription.\nWhy is this important to Amazon? It’s because its 60mn Prime members spend more than 2x more than other customers on Amazon. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners , Amazon Prime members spend about $1,500 per year while others spend about $625 per year. Together with the $99 of annual subscription fees, that’s about $96bn of annual revenue! To put that number into context, Amazon is expected to make about $140bn in revenue in 2016.\nTherefore, Amazon is incentivized to grow this customer base as much as possible, and make sure that they stay on the Prime platform for as long as possible. What better ways to do this than throw in more value (i.e. free stuff!)? They’ve been doing this already with Prime Videos, filled with its own set of really high quality original shows, following Netflix’s formula. According to various estimates, Prime subscribers have grown by about 50% from 2015 while retention rates are extremely high at above 90% .\nAmazon & Netflix Already Spending $10bn on Content If Amazon is successful in signing live sports content, how much would it really cost them? The short answer is that it will cost enough to potentially wipe out its earnings, at least for the short-term. First, let’s consider the data.\nEvery year, traditional media companies like Disney (i.e. ESPN), FOX and CBS spend about $40-50bn in content cost in the US. A lot of this is spent on creating new content, buying old syndicated content, and for paying for live sports rights. Live sports has been hailed as the lynch pin of the traditional media business model, and it comprises the most expensive chunk of this 50bn dollar budget.\nAnnual Spend on Content (in $mn) 2015 2016 Media Companies $44,657 $47,456 Amazon $2,500 $4,500 Netflix $4,591 $5,834 Tencent $1,299 $2,370 Alibaba (Yoku) $726 $1,306 Baidu (iQiyi) $544 $1,108 In comparison, two new entrants, Netflix and Amazon, are already spending about $10bn annually on content! This is significant because 1) these two companies have only entered the industry few years ago, 2) they are continuing to grow their spend extremely quickly (Amazon is expected to double their spend from last year) and 3) they are not even competing for live sports rights yet.\nWhat would happen if Amazon starts to bid for live sports rights? These contents are already so expensive that they could wipe out Amazon’s profits, at least temporarily. For instance, NBA’s 9-year deal with ESPN is costing then about S$2.7bn per year until 2025, while NFL’s deal with ESPN will cost them $1.9bn per year. In comparison, Amazon made $4.5bn of operating profit in 2015, and is expected to make just over $6bn of operating profit in 2016.\nWith costs involved being counted in billions (if not tens of billions), there is a possibility that margins could shrink for all of the companies involved. This sounds quite familiar to what has been happening in the online video industry of China. The big 3 internet giants BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) have been spending billions of dollars to grow their online video businesses, sometimes even spending more in content acquisitions than what they earn on those contents.\nTo make up for such a loss, Amazon will look to grow its Prime subscribers further globally in order to make up for its investment. Given its track record of aggressively spending to invest in its business and growing over time, it’s hard to argue against Amazon’s logic, will or ability to succeed. However, it’s unclear how traditional media companies will fare if and when this happens. They don’t have many other business models to rely on the way Amazon does.\nBad News for Media Companies Because of the major sports rights are signed until well into 2020’s, Amazon will not be able to make a dent in this area anytime soon. More likely, they will have to start with some of the more “minor” sports like lacrosse, cricket, etc.\nHowever, this is a really bad news for the traditional media companies over the long-run. With all the fears around “cord cutters” who prefer to watch their videos online instead of through cable TV packages, these companies have been relying on live sports to maintain their customer base. If you want to watch NBA game live, you have to watch it on TV. Because of this dynamic, media companies have been desperately bidding for sports contents, and content costs have been increasing by multiple folds every time they renew.\nOn the other hand, sports rights owners like NBA, NFL and MLB care about making the most money; they don’t care about where or how it’s watched. When renewal negotiations start sometime between 2020 and 2025, Amazon (and potentially Netfilx) likely will increase pressure in the bidding, and drive up these prices further. If they are lucky, Amazon and Netflix might be the ones quoting the highest prices (and at least Amazon already has the balance sheet to do so). Even if ESPN were to keep the sports rights, it may have to pay a significant higher cost than it would otherwise because of increased competition.\nArticle by ValuePenguin \nThe post Live Sports Deals Could Wipe Out Amazon’s Earnings (At Least Temporarily) appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": "Comment Amazon \nAmazon has just made its ' Echo ' home speaker system available to other countries outside of the U.S. This innovation which proved to be wildly popular in the U.S. is run by Alexa, Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) assistant. \nAlexa is what makes Amazon Echo a notch above all other speaker systems. Here are some of Echo's features : \n- Be part of Harry Potter's Wizardry World: a user can interact with Alexa regarding Harry Potter-related questions. The user can ask questions, in much the same way as Alexa can ask questions. A user can also \"play\" with Alexa with the Sorting Hat game and Harry Potter quiz. \n- Identify songs and build playlists: Shazam , the world's first app that can \"identify any music playing around you,\" is reinvented with Amazon Echo whereby a user can sing a tune, and Alexa can help out with identifying the title and artist of the lyrics. For example, a user may ask, \"Alexa, play the song that goes, 'I was doing just fine before I met you'.\" Then Alexa will play, \"Closer\" by The Chainsmokers. A user can also build a playlist just by singing tunes, or saying out titles of the song. Alexa can also build a playlist depending on the user's mood. The user can just say \"100 Greatest Feel-Good Classics,\" and Alexa will create a playlist to suit that need. \n- Have a weather-and fashion-forecaster: A user can ask Alexa not just the weather forecast, but also clothing suggestions for the day. Alexa can suggest specifics such as bringing a scarf, coat, or umbrella. \n- Have a time-keeper: Alexa can answer questions such as, \"What is the time?\" Along with this, a user can also ask Alexa to remember alarm times for waking up and cooking among other activities. \n- Get an Uber-caller: A user can also hail an Uber car through Alexa. Alexa can then give details to potential drivers, and price ranges of the ride. \n- Build a shopping list: Alexa can make a list of items that needs to be purchased, may it be food, clothing, or gadgets. The user can simply say out loud items that should be purchased, then Alexa can forward the order to Amazon Prime where orders can be checked out, paid for, and delivered to the user's door-all without touching any screen or keyboard. \n- Have a cooking assistant: A user in need of cooking help can also have Alexa assist, with Alexa dictating recipes that can fit with available ingredients. This is particularly helpful especially with many users reading recipes from their gadgets. \nThese are just some of the many possibilities with Amazon Echo. As one recent purchaser says, \"Amazon Echo has been a long-awaited treat for myself... Now that its' arrived, what can I say, it's completely lived up to the hype.\" \nAmazon Echo is available for $185 in black and white color options.",

      "text": "Jim Watson | AFP | Getty Images FOX news host Megyn Kelly. Amazon appeared to remove several politically motivated negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's memoir Settle for More after a flood of one-star ratings drew media attention.\nAs of early Wednesday, 17% of the reviewers on Amazon gave the book one star. At one point, as many as 76% of the reviews were one-star, Slate reported.\nGary Gershoff | Getty Images A view of the book event promotion window of 'Settle For More' by Megyn Kelly at Barnes & Noble Union Square on November 16, 2016 in New York City. The Los Angeles Times reported that many of the reviews were linked to a pro-Trump Reddit forum called \"The_Donald.\"\n\nSome commenters picked up on the removal of the negative reviews. \"Tim from MD.,\" for example, wrote a post titled \"Over 120 1 star reviews have been deleted. Are we living in a free country anymore?\" \nMore from USA Today: \nAmazon looking to expand online tickets business \nTwitter CEO Dorsey has own Twitter account suspended \nPilot strike could delay Amazon, DHL shipping \n\n\"Trump is president, but she wrote the book certain Clinton would win,\" Tim from MD. wrote. \"Now the book and her shows advertisers are getting boycotted. So apparently her attorneys have called to get negative reviews deleted. And they succeeded. I'm shocked.\" \nBrianna wrote, \"I have written many thoughtful reviews as to why this book is horrible! They have all been removed even though I am a reputable Amazon customer/reviewer which is why originally Megyn had the true rating of one and a half stars and now four and a half FIXED STARS!\" \nAmazon did not remove all the reviews that seem to focus more on the recent presidential campaign than the contents of the book. One reviewer who gave the book a single star wrote nothing more than \"Anti-Trump.\" Another wrote that she is still upset \"over trump calling her out,\" and one reviewer said, \"As unpopular and uninteresting as her show. MAGA,\" using the acronym for \"Make America Great Again.\" \nKelly's publisher, Harper Collins told the L.A. Times that the onslaught of negative reviews had \"the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book and our author Megyn Kelly,\" adding that \"We have brought it to the attention of Amazon.\"",

I don't recall Amazon ever sending out emails about upcoming prices especially on the day the said item has a price drop as this would just anger customers who ordered today? I know its only 1p but it would likely be £19.99 not £20. Im surprised mods have not removed this tbh Edited By: johnwillowlfc on Nov 23, 2016 22:06: Edit",

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum.\nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book.\nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\"\nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign.\nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "If a company gave someone a product to keep in exchange for an honest review on Amazon ( AMZN ) , do you think the review would slightly biased?\nWell, apparently that has been found to be the case and as a result, the e-commerce juggernaut is cracking down .\nThese \"incentivized\" reviews skewed product ratings, and were ultimately disappointing and in some regard misleading customers. Data shows that an incentivized review averaged a 4.74 out of 5 rating, while a non-incentivized rating received just a 4.36 average review.\nAmazon wants an online shopping experience that's quick, easy, price competitive and perhaps most importantly, honest and trustworthy. If users log in to purchase a new product and see that its rated a 4.74 out of 5, many will assume that it's of high quality and worthy of a purchase.\nBut if a majority of those reviews came from a customer who received that product for free, it's likely that they have a more positive bias. Given that Amazon has boomed into a colossal player in the retail sector, its customers' trust is ever so important.\nLosing that could lead to lost sales. And in a world where seemingly every retailer is trying to combat Amazon, that's not something the company wants to see happen.\nShares of Amazon closed at $780.12 Wednesday, down 0.7%.",

(Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) A A SEATTLE (AP) — \nAmazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir . \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews. close ",

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": "up vote -1 down vote favorite \nI have just started working with AWS in my new role and have come across setting a new test environment in AWS. As part of this new setup, I am setting up a test web server and this web server has to have an existing Barracuda(AWS) WAF service sitting in front of it. I have configured the WAF service in Barracuda as per the other services that are configured for our existing servers. The test web server is set up like a normal web server should be and I have installed an SSL certificate on it as well. \nWhen I try to access the web server(Windows server 2012 r2) internally within the server itself it is working fine over both http and https. But when I try to access it using the internet from out side, it keeps thinking for a while and throws the following error \" The requested service is temporarily unavailable. It is either overloaded or under maintenance. Please try later .\" \nI have tried telnet to port 80(I have setup a redirect service as well on WAF) and 443 for the web server IP and it works fine from any where and I can telnet into it but still get the above error when trying to go through browser. What am I missing here?? Any help would be appreciated. \nI also had a look at the debugging console in browser when I get the above error and following is the error message that I get. \nhttps://xx.xx.xx.xxx/favicon.ico (xx-- Because I cannot disclose the IP address for obvious reasons) Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 503 (Service Unavailable)",

(Photo: The Enquirer/ Carrie Cochran, The Enquirer/ Carrie Cochran, Th) \nCINCINNATI — A federal judge ordered a halt Wednesday to a strike that had grounded more than 75 air-freight flights the day before and threatened speedy package delivery just before the start of the holiday shopping season.\nJudge Timothy Black of U.S. District Court here granted a temporary restraining order at about 5 p.m. ET to ABX Air and its parent company, Air Transport Services Group of Wilmington, Ohio, against about 250 pilots represented by the Airline Professionals Association, International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 1224. The pilots must return to work immediately.\nThe union said ABX Air has violated its contract for two years by forcing pilots to work an excessive number of emergency assignments because the company doesn't have enough staff to meet the growing demands of online retail. Union members took the strike vote in May.\nUSA TODAY\nPilot strike could delay Amazon, DHL shipping\nABX is a contractor to DHL Worldwide Express, which employs 2,400 at its North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Ky., near Cincinnati. It operates about 35 flights a day for Amazon and 45 for DHL.\nGrounded flights affected as many as 20,000 individual customers for each aircraft, court documents say. And ABX Air has said that nearly 1.3 million pounds of cargo for top shipping clients has been stranded in its hangars because of the pilots strike.\nFollow Alexander Coolidge on Twitter: @alexcoolidge \nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ghbJ9Q",

      "title": "Amazon, Google make big push to sell digital home assistants to holiday shoppers",
      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The holidays have traditionally been an important time for the consumer tech world, with electronics makers placing big bets that shoppers will venture into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales with open minds and open wallets.\nBut for some manufacturers, this year might be more important than others.\nProducts in categories that consumers aren't yet familiar with -- think digital home assistants, like Amazon's Echo -- tend to bank the most on a successful holiday season, according to retail analysts.\nBut those encountering competition for the first time -- again, think Amazon's Echo -- face a double whammy. First, they need to convince the public their product is more than a novelty, then they convince the public to choose theirs and not its rivals.\n\"There's clearly some overlap between the Echo and Google Home,\" said Craig Johnson, president of retail consulting firm Consumer Growth Partners. \"I'm not convinced people have room for both devices in their lives.\"\nAmazon's virtual home assistant has been around for three years, but this will be the first year it has a direct competitor in Google Home. Neither product is likely to win a monopoly this holiday season, according to analysts, who believe the category of virtual home assistants is still too new and poorly understood to have that kind of penetration. But if one company gains the lead, it could lock the other out from some households.\nBoth Google and Amazon have ramped up their marketing efforts in the lead-up to Thanksgiving. Google will temporarily discount its virtual home assistant at retailers such as Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart during Thanksgiving week from $129 to $99, nearly half of what a full-priced Echo costs.\nAmazon has given its line of virtual home assistants -- including the recently launched lower-cost Echo Dot -- prime placement on its website, bought TV advertisements and splashed the web with Echo ads. Steep discounts are expected around Black Friday, and Amazon has already tried to turn customers into Echo gift-givers by offering a buy-five-get-one-free deal on the palm-sized Echo Dot.\n\"It forces them to step up their game,\" said Marlene Morris Towns, a professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business. \"You can see they're investing quite a bit in its promotion.\"\nThis particular holiday season is also important for both Google and Amazon because it's an opportunity to establish the product category; a chance to finally shed the novelty moniker that devices like the Echo have carried for the past three years, and to re-introduce them to consumers as must-haves.\n\"It's reminiscent of the release of TiVo,\" said Towns, referring to the digital video recorder from 1999 that let people record TV shows airing on different channels at the same time. \"It was this great technology that was hard for people to get their head around. TiVo faced this challenge where it was hard to get people who hadn't tried it to adopt it.\"\nThe Echo and Google Home find themselves in a similar position, Towns said. Amazon and Google can advertise all they want, but people want to know that it's something they can trust, she said. And one of the best ways to gain consumer trust is to have the people they trust using it.\n\"When people entertain and have friends and family stay over, it's an opportunity for exposure,\" Towns said. \"Thinking back to TiVo, I wasn't sold on it until I went to a friend's house to watch the Super Bowl. We were in awe of how it worked.\"\nGift-giving is another big opportunity, said Johnson, who noted that products such as the Echo and Google Home are priced in the gift-giving \"sweet spot.\" Even Amazon has acknowledged this, saying in a statement sent to the Los Angeles Times that with the introduction of the Echo Dot, which retails for $49.99, \"it is easier than ever to give the gift of Alexa this year, or add Alexa to any room of the house\" (Alexa is the name of the artificial intelligence that powers the Echo).\nBut in addition to going up against each other, Johnson said both the Echo and Google Home will find themselves competing with other consumer electronics that are also priced in the gift-giving \"sweet spot\" of below $1,000. They'll be up against virtual reality headsets from Oculus, Sony and Samsung. They'll compete with new-release video games. Johnson even sees some 60-inch 4K televisions as competition for the Echo and Home.\n\"In terms of wallet share, they're competing with a broader market,\" he said.\nBut there's reason to be hopeful. In a recent survey conducted by consumer data firm Qualtrics, holiday shoppers were asked which tech toys they wanted most. The leading gadget, with 23.85 percent of votes, was the iPhone 7. In second place with 12.17 percent was the Xbox One. The Amazon Echo came in a close third at 12.05 percent. Google Home wasn't included in the survey. If Amazon pulls off its holiday strategy, those people might just get what they want.\n(c)2016 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\n ",

      "title": "Amazon AWS Price Cuts to Reduce 2017 Revenue, Profit Slightly, Says Evercore ISI",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray In case you missed it, Amazon.com ( AMZN ) yesterday announced another one of its cuts in price for its AWS cloud computing service, in this case, the price for its “ S3 ” storage offering.\nThe company cut prices in most regions it served, it said in a post on AWS , and also consolidated six “pricing tiers” into just three.\nEvercore ISI ’s Ken Sena , who rates the stock a Buy and has a $990 price target, notes that this latest cut comes just after the company “cut pricing on several EC2 instances by 5-25% in numerous regions last week.”\nThis is going to cut Amazon’s revenue growth rate, he thinks, but by how much is a tricky matter. Sena reasons it’s not as bad as might at first seem:\nAt first blush, by applying the pricing cuts across our estimate for IaaS revenues (81% of total), it yields an 8.6% AWS revenue growth impact. But we think this is two aggressive as it essentially gives little credit to other AWS services, including Compute (besides EC2), Storage/CDN (besides S3), Database, Networking, Developer Tools, Management Tools, Security, Analytics, Application Services, and Mobile Services. Conversely, while optimistic, if we evenly distribute these services and apply the reduction to just one in ten, we arrive at a much more manageable 2.8% impact to AWS revenues. In reality, we believe the answer lies somewhere in the middle, leading us to estimate a ~6% impact at the midpoint. \nHe ends up cutting his Amazon AWS revenue outlook for 2017, and for profit, but bear in mind there’s still some “elasticity” in the business to account for:\nWhile we suspect that these price cuts may have been factored already in Amazon’s 4Q guidance (which was issued less than a month ago), we are electing to lower our 4Q AWS revenue 1% to $3.71bn (54% y/y), a 200bp impact to growth, since the pricing changes will be in effect for just one month. This leaves Amazon total revenues effectively unchanged, given that AWS only represents 8% of revenues, albeit ~50% of CSOI. In turn, we are reducing our CSOI 2% to $2.02bn (16% y/y, 4.5% of revenue), which moves us to $1.16bn in GAAP EBIT, now slightly below the high end of the company’s guidance range. As we look to the impact of these cuts on 2017, where a full-year of cuts get factored, we are lowering our 2017 AWS revenue 2% to $17.76bn (43% y/y), or a ~350 bp impact to growth as we contemplate some elasticity, which flows through to a 4% reduction to CSOI, assuming the lost revenue represented 100% margin. \nAmazon shares today are down $6.51, or 0.8%, at $778.82.",

      "title": "Tableau Online will run on AWS",
      "text": "It’s not a huge surprise that business software maker Tableau, now led by former Amazon executive Adam Selipsky , is putting the online version of its data visualization tool on Amazon Web Services. Selipsky, after all, had spent more than a decade helping build Amazon Web Services into the public cloud juggernaut it now is.\nBut if you dig deeper, an interesting narrative emerges—but back to that in a moment.\nThe news, to be formally announced next week at the annual AWS Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas is that Tableau Online will run on Amazon’s massive public cloud and that customers will be able to buy it through the AWS Marketplace.\nAll a prospective user will have to do is click on a few on-screen boxes to get started, Selipsky told Fortune in an interview. Until now, Tableau Online data visualization service was only available on Tableau’s own infrastructure.\nTableau also sells a version of the same software that companies can run on their own data center gear. This is called Tableau Server but Tableau Online is the company’s fastest growing product.\nThirteen-year-old Tableau, fueled the rise of what is called “self-serve analytics” which enables mere mortals, not business analysts, to show off their important data in ways that make sense. Previously, workers had to submit requests to business analysts for data reports and then wait hours or even days, for the result. It was hardly an optimal process in a fast changing business world.\nTableau competes with products from old-school companies like MicroStrategy, IBM, SAS, and Microsoft, but also with newer entrants like Qlik ( acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo last summer), Domo , and Zoomdata .\nBut more to the point here is that AWS itself is adding more of its own products, including data analytics to its product roster. Last week, it made QuickSight , its in-house analytics tool (announced at AWS Re:invent last year) broadly available.\nAnd this is the broader story. AWS started ten years ago by renting basic storage, networking, and computing power to customers but in the intervening years has added a steady stream of higher level business software to its menu. So while customers can run Oracle, Microsoft, or SAP databases on AWS, they can also forego all of those and use Amazon’s Aurora database instead.\nThis is reminiscent of the Microsoft of two decades ago that wooed third parties to build software to run on its Windows operating system while also building its own software applications.\nJust as Microsoft courted Lotus, Borland, and WordPerfect to build Windows versions of their once category-leading software packages, Amazon woos data analytics companies like Domo, Qlik, and Tableau to AWS while building its own in-house products that compete with them.\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but has anyone heard much from Lotus, Borland, or WordPerfect lately?\nOther companies are also navigating this tricky relationship. Snowflake Computing , which hosts its own data warehouse software on AWS also competes with AWS RedShift data warehouse, for example. But Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia, formerly a top Microsoft and Juniper Networks exec, told Fortune recently that AWS has good checks in place internally to guard the interests of third-party software partners. “I’m sure the RedShift team hates me, but the AWS infrastructure guys do not,” he said.\nAsked about competitive issues with Amazon, Selipsky said the potential opportunities that open up because Tableau and AWS work together far outweigh any threat. Customers can already run their Tableau Server software on Amazon and the two companies built links between Amazon RedShift data warehouse and other data sources to Tableau; and they conduct joint marketing and sales efforts.\n“Business intelligence and analytics are very large market segments. Customers will choose different offerings for different use cases,” he said.\nNote: this story was updated to correct the spelling of QuickSight.\nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com .

      "text": "Blocked Unblock Follow Following Father of Alessandro | Work @ Amazon | Ex-Nike | Love basketball and sneakers | Don’t share food | Opinions are my own 8 mins ago No, let’s not give him a chance! One of the many things contributing to my post-Trump angpression (anger + depression) is hearing many people who didn’t vote for Trump say “Now let’s give him a chance” or “He’s the president now, he deserves respect”. Well, I beg to differ. The fact that he’s been elected doesn’t change who he is, what he did and what he said. Donald Trump doesn’t deserve any respect . He offended women, Hispanics, African-Americans, gays, handicapped people and pretty much everybody except white Christian men. He’s unfit to be president and he’s a danger for the whole world. So no, I will not respect him just because he’s the president. A title doesn’t earn you respect, what you do and what you say do. So that’s that. What’s even worse though is “the chance”. The chance to do what, exactly? To destroy the rights that have been fought for and built over tens of years? To repeal marriage equality for the LGBT community? To make abortion a crime? To accelerate climate change? To deny healthcare to millions of people? To allow religious discrimination? There are really 2 options here: 1) you hope that he doesn’t do anything of what he said during his campaign, which seems unlikely, especially looking at the people he’s surrounding himself with 2) you accept that he will actually do what he promised and you’re OK with it. Well, neither option resonates with me. He put a white supremacist as his chief of staff. Wanted a creationist as head of education. Nominated a known racist to the grand jury. Declared that he will split his time between NYC and the White House, costing $1M per day to taxpayers. Mixed his personal business with his public office already…. And this is before even taking office! He doesn’t deserve a chance . He already showed his true colors and caused pain and sufferance to many people through his hate speech. Do we really want to give a racist, homophobic, misogynistic, climate change denying, narcissistic monster a chance to run one of the biggest and most influential countries in the world? I say we have to fight him in any possible way and protest everything he does. He needs to be exposed and held accountable for every mistake. He needs to realize that his title doesn’t give him the right to hurt, discriminate and predate. So no, let’s not give him a fucking chance!",
