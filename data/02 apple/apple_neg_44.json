      "text": "It all starts with the host introducing the drop test, saying Google and Apple’s 2016 flagships are going to be suspending 1,000 feet in the air by a drone before being released and going into free fall. Ouch! That had to hurt. \nNeither the Pixel nor the iPhone 7 survive the drop test. Both displays shatter into an unusable state, which isn’t a surprise. If we had to pick one that looked less damaged, it’d be the Pixel. The iPhone 7’s back was full of scratches and dents while the Pixel’s remained largely undamaged. \nThere’s no way any phone in the world today would survive a 1,000-foot drop, but it’s fun to watch thousands of dollars worth of phones be blown away on the obvious. \nIf you’re curious to see the fate of other devices going through drop tests, check out UnlockRiver’s channel on YouTube for more videos.

An issue affecting iMacs shipped between December 2012 and July 2014 could cause the display to stop adjusting properly and tilt forward, with repairs often costing around $100.\nThis information comes from an apparent internal service document, obtained by MacRumors : \nUnlike some of Apple's other Exchange and Repair Extension Programs listed on its website, the details of this program have not been made publicly available. Apple has instead sent internal communication to Apple Authorized Service Providers with information about repairs and refunds.\nSince Apple hasn't made details of this program public, you might want to try contacting Apple Support for help if your iMac is among the eligible models.\n",

      "text": "Apple announces winter iTunes Connect downtime slated for Dec. 23-27  33 am PT (01:33 pm ET) Apple has reminded developers that the annual iTunes Connect winter closure is approaching, with the 2016 holiday scheduled for Dec. 23 through Dec. 27. The Apple developer's portal suggests that app makers submit new content and updates now as they will be unable to do so during the week-long closure. Developers will still be able to access data during that time frame, but nothing will be accepted for review, or approved for publication, during that time period. Releases can be scheduled to become available during the shutdown, however, if desired. iTunes Connect is an online tool to help developers manage apps, updates, pricing, and App Store assets. The service is also used for book publishers to sell their books through the Apple iBookstore. Topics:",

      "text": "Kwikset debuts Kevo Convert smartlock, Canary brings security cam footage to iPad & Apple TV  00 am PT (01:00 pm ET) Kwikset this week announced a new smartlock, the Kevo Convert, while security camera maker Canary brought its software to the iPad and the Apple TV. The Kevo Convert notably attaches onto existing deadbolts from the interior of a house or apartment, making it an option for renters as well as homeowners. For friends and other guests who need to get in, \"eKeys\" can be sent through the Kevo app for iPhone and Android. Another feature is auto-lock, which if toggled on will automatically secure a door 30 seconds after it's unlocked. People using a phone to control the Convert are normally limited to Bluetooth range. A Kevo Plus upgrade —costing $99.99 —is required for remote access. The accessory doesn't support Apple's HomeKit platform, but it does integrate with a variety of other devices, including Android Wear watches, Nest and Honeywell thermostats, and video doorbells by Ring and SkyBell. The Convert can be preordered for $149 from the Kwikset website or Home Depot. Canary On the Apple TV, Canary and Canary Flex owners are presented with dashboard letting users switch between live and recorded feeds, or select a specific camera if they have more than one installed. Incidents with detected movement are grouped into \"events,\" and can be replayed and bookmarked. The company's free iOS app should be updated with iPad support later today. On top of monitoring and recording, the app sends push notifications for suspicious movement, and can be used to track indoor air quality and temperature, call local emergency services, or even sound a 90-decibel siren.

      "text": "I've owned the fourth-generation Apple TV for over a year now. It's good, but in my opinion, it's not better than the older versions of the Apple TV. \nApple \nThis shouldn't be the case. The new Apple TV is faster and snappier, has an App Store, and has Siri so you can search and navigate using only your voice, if that's your thing. It even has a touch-sensitive trackpad on the remote (touch gestures make everything better, right?). It can even do gaming! \nUnfortunately, these features sound way better on paper than they are in practice. Let me go through each of them one by one, based on my experience: The new Apple TV is indeed faster and snappier. This is probably the only thing I really like about it. The App Store is fine, but like the iOS App Store, it feels outdated. It's relatively intuitive, but I rarely go looking for new apps and games — I think that's because people don't use TVs the way they use phones or tablets. Unless there are new apps that happen to have programming I wouldn't have been able to watch otherwise, which is never the case, I don't really have a reason to visit the App Store. Games on the Apple TV are basic at best, and not a great experience. These feel mostly like phone games ported to the TV, nothing near console quality (like 40+ million other people, I own a PlayStation 4 for gaming; many others own Xbox and Nintendo consoles, so the Apple TV isn't really fulfilling any kind of gaming need, unless you really want to play \"Angry Birds\" on the big screen. But I can't think of anyone who would want that.) Siri is fine, but not great. It's useful on occasion — you can ask for any movie or TV show, regardless of what you're looking at, and get results from all the various apps you have downloaded. My favorite feature is the ability to ask, \"What did s/he just say?\" and have Siri automatically play back the last 15 seconds, but with added subtitles. That's clever . Everything else is par for the course. Siri takes a second or two to activate, then a second or two to hear you , and then it responds. Often times, it misunderstands me. It's far from natural-feeling, unlike the Amazon Echo in my home. The trackpad is downright awful. There are zero redeeming qualities about the Apple TV's glass touchpad, which, Apple admits, is not the same kind of tactile, satisfying glass used for its iPhone displays. It's hypersensitive and difficult to control — even though you can adjust the sensitivity settings, and mine are set to the lowest setting, and it's still a bad experience. Whether it's typing or navigating, the touchpad is just awful. You can tap or swipe — I recommend tapping, because swiping is so laughably inaccurate. I find it appalling that this made it through Apple's design house. Every time someone accidentally touches the remote — which happens all the time since the remote is small and slick and rolls around the couch quite easily — it activates, and usually starts playing content I don't want it to play. It's a major step backwards from the click controls of the previous Apple TV remote (that metallic beauty at the top of the page). \nThe fourth-generation Apple TV should be so much better than it is, which is inaccurate and generally unpleasant. It doesn't help that the set-top box itself is bigger than past models for no apparent reason (Siri can't take up that much space, can it?), and that the remote control is not intuitive, with excessive, non-intuitive controls . (Did you know you can make the Apple TV go to sleep by pressing and holding that TV button? I did not, until someone who actually helped develop the Apple TV told me over the phone.) \nIn general, I can't help but feel like this is where Apple products are heading. \nIn the case of the Apple TV, it feels like newness is prioritized over usefulness and intuitiveness. But \"new,\" in the Apple TV, only means slight improvements, with few meaningful innovations. You can draw parallels to Apple's other recent products: \nApple AirPods are displayed during a media event in San Francisco Thomson Reuters The iPhone 7 is a modest update from the iPhone 6s, which is a modest update from the iPhone 6. The differences between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 6? It's water-resistant, its cameras are slightly better, and it shows a slightly wider color gamut. As someone who upgraded from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone 7, I hardly notice any differences at all, experience-wise. One exception: I did notice the lack of a headphone jack when I lost my Lightning EarPods last weekend while going through security at the airport, and had no viable replacement for my 6-hour flight. The Apple Watch Series 2 is also water-resistant, and adds GPS. Otherwise, it's by-and-large the same old Watch. It does not fix any of the problems of the first-generation model, like battery life, or the relatively useless digital crown, or its dependence on the iPhone. AirPods — Apple's yet-to-be-released wireless earbuds — are hardly better than the company's wired pair, which are significantly cheaper ($30 vs. $160) and more useful. Both AirPods and EarPods let you listen to music and answer phone calls, but AirPods can't play or pause your music, or change the volume, without using Siri, which is just plain awkward to do in public. The design also looks lazy, like they just cut the cords off from the EarPods and called it a day. The iPad Pro is basically a bigger, faster iPad. The only ways in which it's more useful than other iPads involve optional accessories you'd need to buy : the $99 Apple Pencil, and the Smart Keyboard, another add-on that costs anywhere between $150 and $170 (you're better off with Logitech's version, in my opinion, which is cheaper and has better features). But the tablet itself hasn't changed much, if at all. The new MacBook Pro is faster and thinner than ever, and the new Touch Bar can do some nifty tricks, but it's not so useful — especially for professionals, its intended audience — as to justify its astronomical price. We asked a video editor if they liked the Touch Bar, and he said it wouldn't change how he works. So while the Touch Bar looks cool, its use cases are niche at best. Oh, and you'll need to shell out extra for Apple's various dongles if you want to connect your external devices, like your camera. Oh, and its battery life isn't quite what Apple advertised. \nWe got a pro video editor to try the new MacBook Pro: He liked how the Touch Bar keys changed as he moused over certain options in Final Cut Pro, but wished the app let him customize which keys would show up. Darren Weaver \nIf you're noticing a trend here, it's that Apple's newest products do offer some basic improvements, but are still loaded down with their own respective issues — again, it feels like newness is given priority over usefulness. For every positive in these new products, there's at least one negative. As someone who's used and owned Apple products all my life, it's a worrying trend: It feels like Apple's approach to products is altering course, moving away from minimalism and perfectionism, and moving towards cost-effectiveness and novelty. The company's latest products are good, not great. \nPerhaps Jony Ive, Apple's design chief, really is making his gradual exit from Apple , after 25 years of working there. Or perhaps the current leadership, led by CEO Tim Cook, favors the company's bottom line over its product designs, as a means to appease shareholders. Regardless, don't expect a mea culpa from Apple; I do believe the company is listening to fans and users, and is making concerted efforts to give people what they want, but Apple would never admit its products are anything less than perfect. Let's just hope Apple is listening, that next year's products fix some of the biggest issues, and that the company's more exciting plans (VR, AR, cars) come to fruition. Because Apple, and many of its products, used to be great. But right now, they're all just good.",

Developers are encouraged to submit any updates well in advance of that time period to make sure that customers can get them before the holidays.\nFrom Apple :\nThe busiest season on the App Store is almost here. Make sure your apps are up-to-date and ready for the winter holidays. New apps and app updates will not be accepted December 23 to 27 (Pacific Time), so any releases should be submitted, approved, and scheduled in advance. Other iTunes Connect and developer account features will remain available.\nCustomers will still be able to access and download apps from the store (many of them will be unwrapping brand new iPhones, after all), but they shouldn't expect much in the way of updates during that period.\n",

UBS on Tuesday cautioned of near-term weakness in iPhone sales, a trend that could put a dent in Apple 's biggest source of earnings. \n\n\"Procurement estimates for F1Q-2Q/17 [Fiscal quarters 1 and 2 in 2017] are down YoY [year over year], putting current consensus estimates for unit shipments growth in Dec and Mar at risk. We still believe the guide for Dec implies at least moderate unit growth,\" equity analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a note to clients. \nIn the past four quarters, iPhone sales accounted for about 63 percent of Apple's total earnings, according to data from FactSet. The stock is off 6 percent this year, compared with a gain of 8 percent for the S&P 500 index.",

For all we know this is a feature, not a flaw. Apple would never make something that offers a less-than-magical experience. Maybe you are just holding it wrong? \nI got a lot of replies. It turns out I'm not alone in getting what I've come to know as notification spam. Apparently, it's possible for spammers to email a calendar invite and something (I'm still not completely sure of the mechanism) then puts that invite into the MacOS calendar. According to some of my correspondents, the same thing happens with iOS. I don't use the iOS calendar, either, so I didn't see it in iOS.",

National Football League, case no. 16-283 and Armstrong v. National Football League . Both are scheduled to be considered by the Court at its December 9, 2016 conference. \nThe petitions arise from In re: NFL Players Concussion Injury Litigation , filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Both arrived at the Court after the Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s orders overruling objections to its orders certifying the class and approving its settlement with the NFL. \nThe class consisted of over 20,000 retired players, and the settlement broadly provided for “(1) an uncapped Monetary Award Fund that provides compensation for retired players who submit proof of certain diagnoses; (2) a $75 million Baseline Assessment Program that provides eligible retired players with free baseline assessment examinations of their objective neurological functioning; and (3) a $10 million Education Fund to instruct football players about injury prevention.” The “Qualifying Diagnoses” entitling class members to monetary recovery include a “Level 1.5 Neurocognitive Impairment,” providing for a maximum award of $1.5 million; a “Level 2 Neurocognitive Impairment,” $3 million maximum; Parkinson’s Disease, $3.5 million maximum; Alzheimer’s Disease, $3.5 million maximum; death with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (“CTE”), $4.5 million maximum; and ALS, $5 million maximum. \nIn turn, the class members released all claims against the NFL “arising out of, or relating to, head, brain and/or cognitive injury, as well as any injuries arising out of, or relating to, concussions and/or sub-concussive events,” including CTE-related claims. \nIn Gilchrist , petitioner, the son of a former NFL player who died from CTE, objected to the settlement because it placed a lower monetary value on death with CTE than it did on ALS, and also because he claimed that “the assessment, analysis, and ascribed value of the various conditions suffered by retired NFL players were fundamentally unfair and not justified by the science.” He asks the Court to determine “under what circumstances Daubert must be satisfied for a class to be certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 when challenged expert testimony is at issue.” He also asks this: \nIs it fundamentally wrong and an abdication of fiduciary duties to absent class members under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 for the lower courts to have approved the NFL’s head trauma class action settlement where there was no adversarial discovery on, and no definitive assessments about, the disputed “scientific” propositions regarding head trauma that were the basis for vastly disparate relief to class members along with a comprehensive release of claims? \nIn Armstrong , petitioners took issue with the fact that the settlement provided no monetary benefits for those receiving a post­ -settlement CTE diagnosis while those with a pre -settlement CTE diagnosis could receive up to $4 million. They argued that the settlement was negotiated on the class members’ behalf “by lawyers representing clients with current injuries” (emphasis added), and asked the Court to determine “whether approval of such a settlement is consistent with Rule 23’s adequacy-of-representation requirement and due process.” \nWe’ll be following these cert petitions and will keep you posted, while we stay tuned to the tsunami of college and pro football awaiting us in the weeks and months ahead. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Benesch Benesch on: \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email…\" Your first step to building a free, personalized, morning email brief covering pertinent authors and topics on JD Supra: * By using the service, you signify your acceptance of JD Supra's Privacy Policy. - hide Privacy Policy (Updated: October 8, 2015) : \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through its website (the \"Website\") as well as through other sources.

COSDENT by SLC Makeover Your Smile via Flickr \nApple just released the fourth macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta. It's now available for developers and public beta testers. The latest update to the macOS Sierra can be downloaded through the Mac App Store or Apple Developer Center. It will probably be released to the public before this year ends. \nApple's latest Mac operating system macOS Sierra was launched back in September. Since then, the macOS 10.12.1 was released to the public. It was followed by the first macOS 10.12.2 beta in late October. The third 10.12.2 beta was released two weeks prior to the most recent update. According to the Mac Rumors , the recent update might address some previous issues by providing bug fixes and performance enhancements. \nMac users should expect new emoji as it includes Unicode 9.0 character support. This means that you will be able to use emoji like clown face, fox face, animals such as owl, shark, butterfly and foods as avocado, pancakes, croissant and bacon. It's akin to those in the iOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.1.1. There are also a number of changes and improvements with the current emoji. They were enhanced to look as real as possible. \nAccording to 9to5Mac , the macOS 10.12.2 beta 4 will also have four wallpapers that are present in iOS 10.2 for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and more recently in the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar marketing material. They are named Color Burst 1, Color Burst 2, Color Burst 3 and Abstract Shapes. Among the colors seen are pink, yellow, blue, green, purple and red. It will likely be released to the public next month after the developer and public beta. As they have to test these pre-release versions first. \nThe macOS Sierra is Apple's newest OS for Mac. It has features like support for Siri, Apply Pay for the web, Universal Clipboard, Apple Watch auto unlocking, improved iCloud Drive integration and picture-in-picture video playback. Particularly, the integration of the personal digital assistant Siri is a great addition for Mac users. \nIt basically has the same capabilities that iPhone users get to enjoy. For instance, it will search through documents or Photos to find certain files. It can also be used to set reminders and initiate FaceTime calls. Meanwhile, the iCloud integration will allow the user to access his/her documents stored on Mac using his/her other devices through the iCloud Drive app, according to Mac Rumors . These features offer convenience to Mac users. ",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe winter holidays are fast approaching and, just like other workers, many folks in the tech industry are looking forward to their vacation days. But, before employees can celebrate and unwind, companies have to adjust their schedule accordingly and prepare their customers for the limited (or lack of) office hours. \nApple announces its schedule today, advising developers to submit their updates and new apps for approval in time, to avoid any delays and inconveniences. \nBetween December 27 and December 27, Pacific Time, Apple says that it will not validate any updates or new apps, \"so any releases should be submitted, approved, and scheduled in advance\". That is, unless developers do not mind waiting for the App Store reviewers to come back to work on December 28. \nFor Apple, the winter holidays are extremely busy in terms of App Store activity, and the company is sure to have staff ready in case of emergencies. Many customers will be configuring their new iPhones, iPads and Macs and installing loads of apps on them, and I would not be surprised to hear of new records afterwards. \nBut for what can be considered non-essential personnel, the winter holidays are still the winter holidays and many of its employees will probably want to be doing anything else than working in those couple of days. This schedule only affects developers, as you can probably tell, so for everyone else it will be business as usual.",

      "text": "By Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it is likely to deny four local banks permission to collectively bargain with Apple Inc <AAPL.O> in relation to its mobile digital payments system.\nBut the preliminary decision was \"finely balanced\" and could be reversed if the banks make a convincing case before a final opinion is due in March, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims told Reuters.\nLosing the case would be a setback to the banks' hopes of bypassing Apple's in-house payments system and rolling out their own iPhone versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia.\nUnder Australian law, bargaining cartels can be formed as long as they have permission from authorities, and the banks are seeking the ability to offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones - the first major challenge to Apple Pay of its kind.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia <CBA.AX>, Westpac Banking Corp <WBC.AX>, National Australia Bank Ltd <NAB.AX> and smaller rival Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd <BEN.AX> also want to bargain with Apple over charging customers extra fees for transactions made through Apple Pay.\nA successful application would allow the banks - which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market - to collectively boycott Apple Pay for up to three years as a negotiating tactic.\nApple has argued that third parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. The company's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year.\nIn their application, the banks argue that there is an information imbalance weighted in Apple's favor due to the secret nature of the terms Apple has agreed with competitors over the use of Apple Pay, including fees.\nSims said that if the ACCC determines that the heart of the banks' complaint lies with fees, then it would be difficult for them to win the case. But if it is more about access to Apple's contactless payment technology, then they had a stronger case.\nA representative for the banks behind the application, Lance Blockley, said there would be effectively no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone if the draft determination stood. The banks would continue to argue their case with the ACCC, he said.\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZ.AX> is the only one of Australia's \"Big Four\" banks to have a digital wallet agreement with Apple, betting that being one of the first to offer the service would help bring in more customers.\n(Reporting by Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates and Edwina Gibbs)",

      "text": "Reddit \nThis week the folks at Apple have been tipped to add several models of old Mac computers to their list of vintage and obsolete products. Being added to this list would effectively kick devices off the repair availability charts for Apple Stores around the world. Once a device has been added to the vintage and obsolete products list, users will be unable to access hardware service or new parts from official Apple sources. \nThe list has been tipped by an anonymous source within Apple speaking with MacRumors . There, the list has grown with four hardware models in the Mac lineup from 2009 and 2011. This list of obsoleted products now includes the following devices. \n• MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) • MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) • Mac mini (Early 2009) • MacBook (13-inch, Mid 2009) \nOn the plus side, if this list turns out to be legitimate, come the end of the year they’ll be a lot cheaper. Not through Apple, mind you – they wont suddenly become available anywhere they weren’t before. But through 3rd-party sources, these devices might soon be kicked down to bargain-basement prices – with good reason. \nOnce a product is no longer supported by its manufacturer, it’s effectively on its own. No more software updates and no more support on hardware means the product is no longer as secure as it once was. It also means that any repairs that need to be made will end up costing large amounts of cash. \nBeing on an obsolete and/or vintage list means not all software will necessarily run, or run well. Oddly it would appear that the document referenced above suggests that these products will continue to be provided repairs and documentation for “up to two years”– December 31st, 2018 at latest – per local laws. \nThe products above will likely be rendered vintage or obsolete by the 31st of December, 2016. These will be turned obsolete in the United States (except California), Canada, the EU, Latin America, Japan, and the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. Story Timeline",

      "text": "– A + Supply chain data suggests Apple slightly cutting iPhone 7 orders, endangering growth forecasts By Mike Wuerthele \nTuesday, November 29, 2016, 12:03 pm PT (03:03 pm ET) \nA new supply chain report suggest that Apple may be reigning in build orders for iPhone 7 family of devices, potentially putting some year-over-year growth projections in danger.\n\n\n\n\nA note issued on Tuesday by UBS Global Research, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider , claims that procurement estimates for the iPhone 7 over the current quarter and next quarter are down.\n\nWhile analyst Steven Milunovich believes that the Apple's first fiscal year quarter ending in December will still see growth, it is \"too soon to make a call\" on the following quarter's sales. He believes Apple may be tightening the chain to avoid a glut of stock, like it experienced with the iPhone 6s family.\n\nAt present, UBS estimates that production numbers for the quarter ending in December has dropped from 75 million to 74 million units, with March estimates falling to 42 million versus 43 million in 2016. As a result of the iPhone SE being nearly a year in March, average selling prices should remain higher than all but the first quarter of 2016.\n\n\n\n\nBuild orders do not equal sales, however. Apple is estimated to sell 76 million iPhones in the holiday quarter, an increase year-over-year of over one million units.\n\nIn other areas of the company, UBS is expecting a 2 percent drop in units sold in the first fiscal quarter of 2017, compared to a year ago, with no change in Mac average selling price to speak of. It is also expecting a 5 percent fall in iPad units versus the holiday quarter a year ago, with an increase of 8 percent in average selling price.\n\n\n\n\nThe company retains its view that upgrades will pick up in the end of 2017 and 2018 with a re-design of the iPhone. A possibility of new products \"required to excite investors beyond a trade\" exists in augmented reality and virtual reality technologies on the distant horizon, according to the analyst firm.\n\nOther perspectives \n\nIn September, T-Mobile's CEO and an assortment of South Korean analysts claimed record sales of the Apple iPhone 7 family, with the South Korean analysts expecting 100 million sales of the new iPhone models before the end of the 2016 calendar year.\n\nOther analysts noted shortly after the iPhone 7 launch that negative reports about Apple sales after the first week were impacted by \"essentially zero\" iPhone 7 Plus models available for weekend sale, with no similar constraints for the launch of the iPhone 6S.\n\nMing-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has claimed sales of the iPhone 7 by the end of 2016 would fall between 70 million and 75 million.",

      "text": "Broadcom Stock Nears Buy Point On Bullish Report (Investor's Business Daily) \nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares have been range-bound between $93 and $123 since the middle of 2015 after they pulled back from a consolidation zone. \nApple, with a market capitalization of $596 billion, has the potential to sway the markets one way or the other and every move this tech stalwart makes could be worth watching out for. The news flow on Apple was fairly heavy on Tuesday, although the nature of the news flow, at best, would be qualified as mixed. \nAfter gap-opening lower (at $110.78 Vs. Monday's close of $111.57), the stock gradually recouped its loss, moving into positive territory by late morning and briefly going above the $112 level. Subsequently, the stock pulled back and has been holding barely above the unchanged line in a broad sideways movement. Soft Outlook \nUBS lowered its iPhone procurement estimates for December to 74 million from 75 million, down 1 percent year-over-year. This, according to the firm, places the current consensus estimate for the December and March quarter unit shipment growth at risk. \nHowever, analyst Steven Milunovich feels mix shift will support ASPs. The analyst indicated his 76 million unit sales estimate is below the 78 million unit Street estimates. The analyst maintained his Buy rating and $127 price target for shares. Apple's India Outperformance \nA report from Economic Times showed that iPhone sales rose sharply in India in the three days that immediately following demonetization, with 100,000 iPhones or about 3/4th of its average monthly sales made these three days. Strong sales orchestrated by the intent to buy the gadget by offloading canceled currency notes helped Apple to earn the distinction of being the only phone maker to meet monthly sales target in November, the report added. KGI Upbeat On iPhone 8 Sales \nKGI Securities believes the new iPhone to be sold in 2017, dubbed iPhone 8, may see sales swell to 120-150 million units in the second half of 2017, according to a report in 9to5Mac. The report noted this would mean breaking the record set by iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales. The radically designed iPhone 8 would have a large OLED display, with wireless feature expected to be part of it. Apple's Medical Foray \nA report filed by MobiHealthNews said that Apple had exchanged mails with the FDA concerning two possible products in the cardiac space. IDC Forecast Weak Smartphone Shipment Forecast for 2016 \nGlobal smartphone shipments may just manage to stay afloat in 2016 after rising 10 percent in 2015, according to the IDC. Specifically, IDC estimates shipments of 1.45 billion in 2016, up 0.6 percent. IDC said Apple could see negative annual iPhone sales growth, given the global smartphone saturation. © 2016 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.",

      "text": "App Store \nThe annual holiday shutdown gives Apple reviewers a break. \nApple announced today its annual holiday shutdown of iTunes Connect for app developers. Apple will not be reviewing new or updated apps to the App Store through iTunes Connect from December 23rd through December 27th. \nThe holiday season is the busiest time of year in the apps economy. As people get new devices for the holidays, they download new apps onto their smartphones and tablets. Historically, Christmas Day has seen the most volume of apps downloaded of any day in the entire year. \nAt the same time, Apple’s App Store reviewers take the week off during Christmas. That means that it will not publish any new apps or updates from Dec. 23 to Dec. 27th. Developers need to plan ahead if they want to submit new binaries to Apple ahead of the holiday shutdown. \nApple states : \nThe busiest season on the App Store is almost here. Make sure your apps are up-to-date and ready for the winter holidays. New apps and app updates will not be accepted December 23 to 27 (Pacific Time), so any releases should be submitted, approved, and scheduled in advance. Other iTunes Connect and developer account features will remain available. \nApple is actually taking less time off this year than previous years. In both 2014 and 2015 , iTunes Connect was closed to new apps and updates from Dec. 22 to Dec. 29. In 2016, Apple reviewers are only taking five days off instead of the full week. \nOther iTunes Connect features such as analytics, in-app purchases etc. will not be effected by the shutdown. ",

      "text": "  09:28 AM EST Tech Today: Apple’s Risks, Samsung’s Deliberation, DirecTV NOW’s Prospects Here are some things going on today in your world of tech : Shares of Samsung Electronics ( 005930KS ) closed unchanged at 1,677,000 Korean Won after the company said it would increase its shareholders payouts but resisted the appeal of activists Elliott Management to force the company to split itself into two parts, including a holding company, as my colleague Shuli Ren reported. The New York Times ’s Paul Mozur , in his write-up of Samsung's statements , reads Samsung’s statement, that it remains “absolutely neutral” about a restructuring, as being less forceful, and more amenable, to Elliott. Research firm IDC this morning reports that worldwide smartphone sales will rise 0.6% this year to 1.45 billion units, a huge fall from last year’s 10.4%. Sales of phones with 4G connections, however, are expected to rise 21.3% to 1.17 billion.",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nMobile payments have come a long way since Apple made a huge push into the space with Apple Pay in 2014. Google introduced Android Pay last year, and Samsung has joined the fray with its own mobile payment system called Samsung Pay. Here’s what you need to know about Samsung Pay.\nWhich devices support Samsung Pay? Samsung Pay Phones More Samsung Pay is limited to the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, Note 5, and Gear S2. It also now works with Samsung’s new smartwatch, the Gear S3 — and you don’t need to connect a Samsung phone for it to work.\nMore: Samsung to debut 4-terabyte 850 Pro solid state drive at CES 2017\nGear S3 owners with an Android phone can use Samsung Pay\nA recent update to the Gear manager app allows for Gear S3 users to use Samsung Pay, even if they don’t own a Samsung smartphone. Most Android devices running 4.4 KitKat and above should work, but Samsung says there are a few exceptions at the moment — notably, the Google Pixel .\nTo get started on paying with your Gear S3, you’ll need to add your cards via the Gear manager app. You can launch Samsung Pay by holding down on the back button.\n@cyberslash69 Hi there, #SamsungPay on the Gear S3 is not available with Pixel devices. (1/2)\n— Samsung Pay (@SamsungPay) November 25, 2016\nWhat’s unique about the update is that unlike the Gear S2, the Gear S3 supports MST, not just NFC. That means it will work at most payment terminals — just hold your watch near the checkout terminal when you’re ready to pay.\nSupport for the Gear S2\nSamsung announced late last year that the company’s flagship smartwatch, the Gear S2, would gain support for contactless payments. After a lengthy delay, it finally arrived in the beta program for the S2 during the summer for the Bluetooth-only model. In October, users with the cellular model of the Gear S2 reported that they are able to use Samsung Pay as well.\nWhat can you do with Samsung Pay? Samsung Pay isn’t just for typical transactions at your local grocery store or pharmacy. The Korean company is now implementing a “ Pay It Forward ” program for users that refer the service to family and friends. Samsung also continues to add new forms of payment, including everything from online payments and gift cards to taking cash out at ATMs. Of course, some of these features are only available in select countries.\nPay It Forward\nSamsung wants to reward its customers that use its payment service over rivals such as Android Pay, and it’s doing so with the High Five Referral Rewards program . Every time someone you referred makes their first “qualifying purchase,” you’ll earn $5 in Samsung Rewards, which is automatically deposited in the Samsung Pay app, the same way rewards cards are added.\nIt only applies for 30 people that you refer, meaning you’ll only be able to make $150. Still, you’ll be able to use this money at any merchant that accepts Visa debit and Samsung Pay.\nMore: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7: Which 5-inch flagship is right for you?\n“We believe that anyone who tries Samsung Pay will see the benefits for themselves. That’s why we’re encouraging our users to join us, and help pay it forward,” the company said.\nThe company says 85 percent of Samsung Pay users say they would recommend it to friends and family, according to its own customer survey.\nMembership and loyalty cards\nAs of mid-May 2016, you can now add all your membership and loyalty card accounts to Samsung Pay. Adding a card is as easy as scanning the bar code on the physical card itself or manually entering the account number.\nAll cards added will show up in a separate tab. Unfortunately, there is no search function, and cards appear in the order they were entered, not in alphabetical order. However, you can reorder the list by long pressing and dragging accounts.\nView photos\nSamsung_Pay_Loyalty_Cards_Screenshots More ATMs\nSadly, American ATMs aren’t high-tech enough yet to work with Samsung Pay, but in South Korea, you can use the service at select ATMs to take out cash. At the moment, only Samsung users who have accounts at the following banks can use the service, according to the Korea IT Times : Woori Bank, KB Kookmin Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, NH Nonghyup Bank, and Shinhan Bank.\nRelated: Samsung Galaxy S7 review | Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge review\nThe Times stated that Samsung pay works at 40,000 ATMs in the country, and Samsung has plans to bring its service to more ATMs in the future. You can even watch a transaction occur in the CNet video above.\nOnline payments\nSamsung’s Thomas Ko, co-general manager for Samsung Pay, has said the mobile payment service will be updated to cover online payments in the U.S. in 2016. In an interview with Reuters in December 2015, Ko said online Samsung Pay payments were coming to the U.S. soon, but didn’t provide an exact date outside of 2016, or mention any other countries expected to receive the new feature. Apple Pay operates online through supporting apps, while PayPal and Visa provide a more widespread online payment system already.\nGift cards\nIn October 2015, through a partnership with Blackhawk Network , a pioneer of prepaid gift cards, Samsung announced gift card support for Samsung Pay from 50 retailers including Babies R Us, Toys R Us, Domino’s, and Nike. The app also features a gift card store that allows users to buy gift cards from merchants either for themselves (which seems odd) or to be gifted to friends and family directly from the app. It’s a neat addition that certainly removes the need to carry multiple cards. In a nutshell, Samsung Pay allows you to purchase, store, pay with, and share gift cards.\nRelated: Tap to buy: A complete guide to Android Pay\nPaying with a gift card doesn’t utilize the MST technology that paying with credit or debit cards uses. Instead, as with Apple Pay or Android Pay, it provides a code that retailers can scan or type in. The company indicated that more gift card options will be added in the coming months.\nPromotions\nA new Featured area was added to Samsung Pay in mid-May 2016. It’s basically a rolling banner at the top of the app. Samsung will use this area for promotions or information on how to get more out of Samsung Pay.\nView photos\nSamsung_Pay_Featured_Banner_Screenshots More Which countries support Samsung Pay? View photos\nGalaxy S7 Edge More Galaxy S7 Edge\nJeffrey Van Camp/Digital Trends\nSamsung Pay is currently available in the U.S. on all major carriers’ networks, plus in Spain, South Korea, and China. Samsung initially promised Pay would expand to the U.K. and Canada sometime in 2016, but has now backtracked on its promise to the former. In a statement , Samsung said, “Following successful launches of Samsung Pay around the world, we are planning to launch the service in the U.K. in 2017.\nNo reason for the delay has been given, but negotiations between Samsung and U.K. banks are speculated to be the issue by The Telegraph . No exact timeframe other than 2017 has been given, meaning it may be up to two or more years after Apple Pay launched in the U.K., that Samsung joins the market. Android Pay, which launched earlier in 2016, operates on most Samsung smartphones already.\nSamsung Pay is heading to Brazil on July 19, Samsung has confirmed. It’ll be supported by the county’s largest institutions, among them Banco do Brasil, Brasil Pré-Pagos, Caixa, Porto Seguro, Satander, Banrisul, Bradesco, Nubank, and Itaú-Unibanco. And it will support both Visa and MasterCard accounts.\nThe payment service is now available in Puerto Rico as well — cards from U.S. territory’s largest bank, Banco Popular, are now supported and Samsung Pay is available on AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Claro networks.\nIn mid-June, through a partnership with Citibank and American Express, Samsung Pay formally launched on Galaxy devices in Australia. Availability varies by “local operator,” Samsung warned, but Samsung Pay users in the Land Down Under should be able to pay at any sales terminal that accepts conventional debit and credit cards.\nOn June 2, Samsung Pay went live in Spain . Unfortunately, Samsung Pay users in Spain will miss out on one major feature of the payment service: support for magnetic point of sales. In other words, Spanish residents can only use Samsung Pay at NFC terminals, with Samsung giving no indication as to whether that will change.\nAlso in June, Samsung formally brought its payment service to Singapore. The announcement came quickly after Apple Pay launched in Singapore, but only for American Express card holders. Samsung will support MasterCard and Visa, and Samsung Pay is available to customers of the DBS Bank, Standard Chartered, and Oversea-China Banking Corporation.\nOn March 29, Samsung Pay went live in China through Samsung’s previously announced partnership with China UnionPay. The deal, announced in December 2015 , is crucial, as UnionPay is China’s main credit provider. In addition, Samsung partnered up with Ant Financial Services Group, Alipay’s parent company, which will further expand Samsung Pay’s presence in China. The partnership will allow users of Alipay, China’s largest third-party payment processing service, with over 450 million users, to use Samsung handsets to pay for products and services.\nDriving these international launches forward is Samsung’s extended partnership with MasterCard overseas, helping Samsung Pay break into Europe, and for people to activate debit, credit, and reloadable prepaid cards. It will also support Visa and American Express, along with other major payment networks. The full list can be found here . Samsung has also signed a partnership with point of sale equipment company Verifone, helping adoption in the U.S. and internationally.\nWhich banks and stores support Samsung Pay? Since Samsung Pay works in different countries, the company has had to work with banks and credit card providers to ensure that the service is accessible to its users. Here’s a breakdown of the banks and card issuers that are on board for each country.\nSamsung Pay in the U.S.\nSamsung Pay works on most major U.S. credit cards, and the company is always adding more to the mix. A total of 38 banks and credit unions in the U.S. were added in mid-May 2016, including 1st United Credit Union, 1st Financial Federal Credit Union, AmegyBank of Texas, Arlington Community Federal Credit Union, Arsenal Credit Union, Bank & Trust Company, and many more.\nAn additional 39 banks and credit unions in the U.S. were added in early May 2016. They included Achieva, Alcoa Tenn Federal Credit Union, American Heritage Federal Credit Union, Bangor Savings Bank, and more.\nSamsung also added 19 new issuers of U.S. credit and debit cards in December 2015. They were Visa issuers PNC, TCF Bank, CFE Federal Credit Union, Financial Center FCU, Greater Kinston Credit Union, Keypoint Credit Union, Numerica Credit Union, Utah Community Credit Union, Amegy Bank, California Bank & Trust, PenFed; and MasterCard issuers KeyBank, AchievaCU, Associated Bank, Bayport Credit Union, Bethpage Credit Union, Cambridge Savings, USCCU, and Navy Federal Credit Union.\nMore: Which Android heavyweight should you bet on? HTC 10 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge\nThat was two months after Samsung added 14 banks in October 2015, including Citizens Equity First Credit Union, Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union, Security Service Federal Credit Union, State Employees’ Credit Union, SunTrust, Virginia Credit Union, and Navy Federal Credit Union Visa. The company also announced that Discover Cards will be supported early next year.\nsamsung-pay More Samsung announced that you can now use “eligible” Wells Fargo credit and debit cards with Samsung Pay — bringing its number of supported banks and credit unions up to 70. Recently, the Korean giant said its mobile payment service hit 5 million registered users and processed around $500 million in its first six months of existence.\nThe MST technology ensures that Samsung Pay supports private-label credit cards (PLCC), thanks to partnerships with Synchrony Financial, Blackhawk Network, and First Data Corporation. The company also joined forces with the two biggest credit card providers, the aforementioned MasterCard and Visa, in making Samsung Pay a reality. In the United States, Samsung Pay is supported by American Express, Bank of America, Citi, U.S. Bank, and JPMorgan Chase credit cards.\nThe company estimates that some 30 million merchant locations worldwide will accept Samsung Pay at launch. In other words, Samsung believes that it has come up with the only mobile payment system that is universally accepted. In contrast, both Apple Pay and Google Wallet only work at select locations where NFC is accepted. Samsung Pay won’t work everywhere — credit card readers that require a physical trigger, like U.S. ATMs and gas pumps, aren’t compatible. But Samsung says the Samsung Pay will work at 80 percent of point-of-sale systems when it debuts.\nSamsung Pay will be secured with Samsung’s own Knox security software, which is widely regarded as one of the best security systems for mobile devices, as well as ARM TrustZone. Just like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay doesn’t store personal account numbers on the user’s device, and uses tokenization to protect your credit card information whenever you make a purchase. If you should lose your phone, you can lock and disable the device remotely to turn off access to Samsung Pay, thanks to Samsung’s Find My Mobile feature.\nSamsung Pay in China\nSamsung Pay launched in China with a healthy list of supporting banks and credit card providers. These include, China CITIC Bank, China Construction Bank, China Everbright Bank, China Guangfa Bank, China Minsheng Banking Corp., China Merchants Bank, Hua Xia Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Ping An Bank. The complete list can be found on Samsung’s website here . Future compatibility with Bank of China, Bank of Beijing, and others is promised to come soon.\nSamsung Pay in Spain\nSamsung Pay launched in Spain with only CaixaBank and ImaginBank as bank partners. However, the payment service will expand to Abanca and Banco Sabadell customers in the near future. Furthermore, El Corte Inglés is the first private card issuer in the country to support Samsung Pay. Finally, at launch, Samsung Pay is compatible with business like Cepsa, Cervecería La Sureña, Domino’s Pizza, Fridays, Ginos, Grupo DIA, MediaMarkt, Mercadona, Phone House, Repsol, Rodilla, Saba, Starbucks, The Good Burger, The Wok, VIPS, VIPSmart, and 100 Montaditos, with more following in the near future.\nIt won’t work on rooted devices Now that the service is live, there is evidence that rooting your Galaxy phone will disable Samsung Pay. This isn’t surprising since a rooted device is less secure. If a user tries to use Samsung Pay on a rooted phone, they will will be prompted with a message saying, “Samsung Pay has been locked due to unauthorized modification.”\nRelated: How to root your Android phone or tablet in 2015 (and unroot it)\nRooting a device is the process of obtaining complete administrative control of the operating system, which can make it more susceptible to hacking, and less secure. There are some advantages to rooting, but the security concerns more than outweigh them for the average person.\nIf you’re wondering if your Galaxy phone is rooted, it most likely isn’t. Samsung (and most other) phones aren’t rooted out of the box, and you would have needed to go through many complicated steps in order to achieve root, of which you would probably remember.\nWill it work on Smart TVs? Samsung’s positioning Samsung Pay as a platform , not purely contactless forms of payment. To that end, the company announced Samsung Pay on TV in August 2015, a feature coming to select Samsung smart TVs that’ll expedite the process of paying for content.\nSamsung Pay on Samsung TV More Samsung\nThe service, which Samsung said was developed in partnership with PayPal, ties your credit cards, debit cards, PayPal account and other billing options to a personal identification number. After you complete an “initial registration setup,” Samsung says buying a TV show, movie, or app on your TV is as easy as entering your PIN and hitting the “Pay Now” button that subsequently appears.\nThat first-time setup could be a headache. (You’ll have to add each funding source individually to Samsung Pay on TV.) If you’ve got a Samsung mobile account with saved billing details, though, they’ll transfer automatically. Owners of the electronics giant’s 2014 and 2015 smart TVs will begin to see games that integrate Pay on TV. The list of supported titles will be quite small initially — about seven — but Samsung says it’ll add content “within new and world-renowned games” in the near future.\nHow do you set it up? Samsung Pay first became available on the Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, and Note 5 devices, and required an over-the-air update to work. In 2016, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge were added to the list. Once you’ve added credit, debit, and loyalty cards, you open the Samsung Pay app with a swipe, choose the card you want to use, and authenticate the purchase with your fingerprint.\nJust like most forms of mobile payments, Samsung Pay will use Near Field Communications (NFC) to make payments at point-of-sale systems that accept tap-to-pay. However, unlike Apple Pay and Google Wallet, Samsung Pay will leverage the same technology standard credit cards use, called Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST), which will let the system work at most cash registers, regardless of whether or not they accept NFC payments. So long as the register accepts mag-stripe credit cards, which is something that nearly every single cash register can do, Samsung Pay should work.\nArticle originally published in June 2015. Julian Chokkattu, Kyle Wiggers, Williams Pelegrin, Christian de Looper, Robert Nazarian, and Andy Boxall have contributed to this report. Updated on 11-29-16 by Andy Boxall: Added news Samsung has delayed the launch of Pay in the U.K. until 2017.\nEverything you need to know about Android Pay Samsung Pay gains new loyalty features, Masterpass integration, and more Here are all the places that support Apple Pay, now in Japan and 10 other countries",

And Apple's legendary mountain of dirt has been drastically reduced, with the earth being spread around the campus for landscaping. \nApple CEO Tim Cook told employees earlier this year that Apple planned to move the first groups into the new \"Spaceship\" campus in January 2017. \nBut the City of Cupertino, where the building will be located, announced last month that the project's completion date had been pushed back to the second quarter of 2017.The dirt pyramid at its peak in February.Youtube/Duncan Sinfield \nAnd Cupertino's engineering inspector, 4Leaf, told the city in September that it believed the project was behind schedule and prepared its own budget through June 2017, according to a document seen by Business Insider. \n\"Although we haven’t been formally notified, we understand that the AC2 project is behind its anticipated 31-month construction schedule,\" 4Leaf wrote. \nBut whether the official move-in date gets pushed back a month or two — no announcement has been made publicly — won't matter to this campus in the long run, which is an symbol of Apple's massive success over the past decade and should stand for years. \nCheck out the video below: About Us",

      "text": "What Does the Future Hold for Apple? PART 3 OF 10 Apple’s Services Segment Is Cushioning Declining Growth By Puneet Sikka | Nov 29, 2016 11:13 am EST Services segment is silver lining for Apple amid declining growth \nIn the prior parts of the series, we discussed how Apple’s ( AAPL ) revenue growth has been declining on a year-over-year (or YoY) basis over the last few quarters. The main reason for this decline is falling iPhone sales. iPhone sales account for the majority of Apple’s revenues. However, there is a silver lining to this situation for Apple, which is the strong growth that its Services segment is seeing. The Services segment for Apple is now its second-most important segment in terms of revenues, surpassing the Mac segment. \nThe Services segment’s revenues grew 24% on a YoY basis in the last quarter. As the chart below shows, this growth is not only strong but also accelerating. Apple’s Services segment includes businesses such as iTunes, App Store, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Care, and licensing. App Store, Apple Music, and Apple Pay are driving this growth for Apple. App Store revenues rose 43%, while Apple Music revenues rose 22% in the last quarter on a YoY basis. App Store generated 100% more revenues than Google Play \nApple said that according to App Annie, its App Store generated 100% more revenues than Google ( GOOG ) Play in the last quarter. This is a significant achievement from Apple since Google’s share in the worldwide smartphone operating system market is more than 80%, while Apple’s share is only around 12%, according to IDC. \nAlthough iPhone sales have fallen in the last few quarters, Apple’s Services business growth is not dependent on iPhone sales because of its growing installed base. This base surpassed 1 billion units in January this year, and revenue generated from this base is recurring in nature. Apple is also benefiting from the fact that its users continue to spend more on apps and content from its iTunes Store. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"AAPL\",\"GOOG\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Apple Inc.\",\"Google Inc\"]}",

And Apple's legendary mountain of dirt has been drastically reduced, with the earth being spread around the campus for landscaping. \nApple CEO Tim Cook told employees earlier this year that Apple planned to move the first groups into the new \"Spaceship\" campus in January 2017. \nBut the City of Cupertino, where the building will be located, announced last month that the project's completion date had been pushed back to the second quarter of 2017.The dirt pyramid at its peak in February.Youtube/Duncan Sinfield \nAnd Cupertino's engineering inspector, 4Leaf, told the city in September that it believed the project was behind schedule and prepared its own budget through June 2017, according to a document seen by Business Insider. \n\"Although we haven’t been formally notified, we understand that the AC2 project is behind its anticipated 31-month construction schedule,\" 4Leaf wrote. \nBut whether the official move-in date gets pushed back a month or two — no announcement has been made publicly — won't matter to this campus in the long run, which is an symbol of Apple's massive success over the past decade and should stand for years. \nCheck out the video below: About Us",

      "text": "There’s a reason why Apple is a leader in not only technology but customer service too. They actually provide the vehicle(s) needed to service their customers’ needs. It’s not based on what Apple wants but on what their customers’ need. Here’s how I found out.\n\nI purchased a new iPhone 6 Plus on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. After the initial plinking with my new toy I put it to rest so I can visit family for the holiday. On Friday I returned to my investigation of my new gadget. All went well.\nBut then it happened… \n\nJust like the old dreaded “ blue screen of death ” from a computer running Windows 95, my phone froze-up and I was left with an expensive paperweight. Oh no!\nI contacted my trusted friend named Google.com to find an answer. But I didn’t like what I was told. The operating system needed to be rebooted. Oh no, again.\nI just finished adding most of my contacts to the phone as well as many setting changes – I didn’t want to lose them.\nBy now it was after 5pm on the busiest shopping day of the year. There was no way I was going to be able to reach anyone at the Apple customer service for help. But I had to try.\nNote: I consider myself a “realist”, someone that understands when something can reasonably happen or when it is all a fantasy – a pipe dream and never to come to fruition. But I “had” to try…\nI went on Apple’s website and entered my phone’s serial numbers and identified what the issue was. Then, I received a prompt asking if I wanted a call back from a customer service rep. Yeah sure, “they’re never going to call me back” I thought. I entered my number and pressed “OK”.\nThree (3) seconds later my phone rang – you guessed it. It was a recorded message from Apple’s customer service department. This can’t be…\nI was thanked for contacting Apple and given a choice of music styles to listen to while I waited. Wow, that’s a nice touch. I pushed the button for classical hoping it would calm my nerves while I wait forever on the phone only to probably get disconnected an hour later.\nThen it happened: 3 minutes later “Edward” came on the line saying hello and told me he was here to fix my issue.\nNow, to say the least I was impressed; not on how quickly Edward walked me through the needed steps to reboot my phone and get me back up and running but for this:\nOn the busiest shopping day of the year, Apple has enough employees working their customer service phone lines to answer my call after 3 minutes and provide me with a prompt fix. \nNo wonder why Apple’s considered one of the top customer service businesses.\nNow, let’s go through the steps of service that Apple provides Their website is designed for easy navigation and to collect the needed information to address the issue. \nToo many businesses design their store or website based on the “look” or brand image they wish to express. But the actual shopping experience must take precedent over the look. If you can accomplish both, you have a winning design.\nYou’re given the option to use multiple ways to contact a service representative. \nOnline chat Send email to the support team Have them call you for direct vocal support Full service support must consist of numerous methods of contact. You can’t just provide an email address and expect your customers to sit back and wait for your return message.\nTheir support software allows for an automated call back. \nThis is a tough one. I doubt most businesses can provide this unless they have deep pockets like Apple. But for those that can, do they? Are they actually interested in an “immediate” remedy for a customer’s problem?\nThey have enough employees working to service the anticipated business volume. \nThis is one of the biggest measures of customer service success. Who cares how good your service is if you don’t have the employee coverage to offer it when needed? Then, are you really even providing good service?\nToo many businesses focus more on the upfront sale and not how to provide the post sale service.\nTheir service team members are trained properly and empowered to see the issue through to its resolution. \nWhen revenues fall training is postponed or eliminated. You must understand the value in highly skilled employees and provide the motivation and positive work environment needed to have them service your customers in need.\nYour products, brand image, store location, uniqueness and price are all major factors leading to the success of a business. But, \nnever forget that service and the customer experience is the driving force behind a GREAT business. \nClick To Tweet \nThanks, Apple! ",

And Apple's legendary mountain of dirt has been drastically reduced, with the earth being spread around the campus for landscaping. \nApple CEO Tim Cook told employees earlier this year that Apple planned to move the first groups into the new \"Spaceship\" campus in January 2017. \nBut the City of Cupertino, where the building will be located, announced last month that the project's completion date had been pushed back to the second quarter of 2017.The dirt pyramid at its peak in February.Youtube/Duncan Sinfield \nAnd Cupertino's engineering inspector, 4Leaf, told the city in September that it believed the project was behind schedule and prepared its own budget through June 2017, according to a document seen by Business Insider. \n\"Although we haven’t been formally notified, we understand that the AC2 project is behind its anticipated 31-month construction schedule,\" 4Leaf wrote. \nBut whether the official move-in date gets pushed back a month or two — no announcement has been made publicly — won't matter to this campus in the long run, which is an symbol of Apple's massive success over the past decade and should stand for years. \nCheck out the video below: About Us",

      "text": "Apple will cover repair and replacement of the iMac display hinge, as well as issue refunds to consumers who already obtained a repair, according to an internal announcement. Such repairs often cost more than $100.\nA quick Google search for “iMac display hinge” brings up lots of hits for people who are frustrated with its performance. Users report that the hinge makes audible popping or grinding sounds, then eventually fails to adjust. Another issue that was cited numerous times is that the screen continuously tilts forward despite attempts to adjust it.\nMore: Apple needs to eject all the misleading junk on the Mac App Store, report says\nOne user, Mr. Mo-Fo reported on the Apple support forum, “ I was just sitting watching TV when there was a loud crack and my iMac screen suddenly tilted down — now the screen will not stay where it is tilted/positioned. I was not using the iMac at the time and it was not doing anything it just broke on its own.”\nThe issue is limited to the 27-inch iMacs that were shipped between December 2012 and July 2014. As a result, Apple has extended its iMac hinge repair program to cover iMacs manufactured in late 2012 and late 2013 for up to five years after the purchase date. That’s longer than the usual three year coverage. Apple will also replace the hinge at no cost to the consumer regardless of their warranty status.\nThe details of this repair program were not made public, but rather shared internally with Apple authorized service providers. They recommend that users contact Apple via phone or email to start the refund process. Any customers who still have a product with a broken hinge can make an appointment with the Genius Bar at an Apple store or visit an Apple authorized service provider to see if their iMac qualifies to have the hinge repaired at no cost.\nSurface Studio is easy to repair and has some upgradeable parts, iFixit says LG is offering owners full refunds for a Nexus 5X hardware malfunction Apple has launched its second iPhone repair program in less than a week Apple’s ‘touch disease’ repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free You'll soon be able to walk in and out of a uBreakiFix store with a repaired Pixel or Pixel XL",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nMeizu’s smartphones became famous as they appeared to be replicas of Apple’s iPhones, and they became quite famous in mainland China, all thanks to low price tags and Android. Meizu smartphones still receive a huge response in the country due to its unique Flyme OS and elegant hardware design. The next smartphone from the company – the Meizu X – will be launched on the 30th of November 2016. Apart from this, the company has already scheduled an event on the 6th of December 2016 for the unveiling of the Meizu M5 Note. Now, two new unannounced smartphones from the company have been spotted in Geekbench’s online database, indicating that they are in the development pipeline. Geekbench can now give us a glimpse at the specifications of the Meizu M3X and the Meizu Pro 6 Plus.\nThe Meizu M3X will feature an octa-core MediaTek MT6757 processor, which also goes by the name ‘Helio P20’. It will have 3GB of RAM and will run Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Flyme OS out of the box. While the listing does not reveal any more details about the smartphone, it might be a mid-range offering from the company. The Meizu Pro 6 Plus seems to be running an unspecified octa-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz. As per the listing, it might come with 4GB of RAM and will run on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. The rumored display size of the Meizu Pro 6 Plus is 5.7 inches, and it might come with an Exynos 8890 SoC. The current Pro lineup smartphones include the Meizu Pro 6 and the Meizu Pro 6s.\nMeizu is also rumored to be developing the Pro 7, which could turn out to be the first bezel-less smartphone from the company. No more details have been spilled at the moment regarding the launch of these two smartphones, but considering that the benchmark listing has surfaced, they might be officially within months.\nSource: Geekbench 1 , 2 | Via: MySmartPrice 1 , 2\nThe post Two unannounced phones, Meizu M3X and Meizu Pro 6 Plus, spotted at Geekbench appeared first on AndroidSPIN .",

And Apple's legendary mountain of dirt has been drastically reduced, with the earth being spread around the campus for landscaping. \nApple CEO Tim Cook told employees earlier this year that Apple planned to move the first groups into the new \"Spaceship\" campus in January 2017. \nBut the City of Cupertino, where the building will be located, announced last month that the project's completion date had been pushed back to the second quarter of 2017.The dirt pyramid at its peak in February.Youtube/Duncan Sinfield \nAnd Cupertino's engineering inspector, 4Leaf, told the city in September that it believed the project was behind schedule and prepared its own budget through June 2017, according to a document seen by Business Insider. \n\"Although we haven’t been formally notified, we understand that the AC2 project is behind its anticipated 31-month construction schedule,\" 4Leaf wrote. \nBut whether the official move-in date gets pushed back a month or two — no announcement has been made publicly — won't matter to this campus in the long run, which is an symbol of Apple's massive success over the past decade and should stand for years. \nCheck out the video below: About Us",

And Apple's legendary mountain of dirt has been drastically reduced, with the earth being spread around the campus for landscaping. \nApple CEO Tim Cook told employees earlier this year that Apple planned to move the first groups into the new \"Spaceship\" campus in January 2017. \nBut the City of Cupertino, where the building will be located, announced last month that the project's completion date had been pushed back to the second quarter of 2017.The dirt pyramid at its peak in February.Youtube/Duncan Sinfield \nAnd Cupertino's engineering inspector, 4Leaf, told the city in September that it believed the project was behind schedule and prepared its own budget through June 2017, according to a document seen by Business Insider. \n\"Although we haven’t been formally notified, we understand that the AC2 project is behind its anticipated 31-month construction schedule,\" 4Leaf wrote. \nBut whether the official move-in date gets pushed back a month or two — no announcement has been made publicly — won't matter to this campus in the long run, which is an symbol of Apple's massive success over the past decade and should stand for years. \nCheck out the video below: About Us",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nApple will cover repair and replacement of the iMac display hinge, as well as issue refunds to consumers who already obtained a repair, according to an internal announcement. Such repairs often cost more than $100. \nA quick Google search for “iMac display hinge” brings up lots of hits for people who are frustrated with its performance. Users report that the hinge makes audible popping or grinding sounds, then eventually fails to adjust. Another issue that was cited numerous times is that the screen continuously tilts forward despite attempts to adjust it. \nMore: Apple needs to eject all the misleading junk on the Mac App Store, report says \nOne user, Mr. Mo-Fo reported on the Apple support forum, “ I was just sitting watching TV when there was a loud crack and my iMac screen suddenly tilted down — now the screen will not stay where it is tilted/positioned. I was not using the iMac at the time and it was not doing anything it just broke on its own.” \nThe issue is limited to the 27-inch iMacs that were shipped between December 2012 and July 2014. As a result, Apple has extended its iMac hinge repair program to cover iMacs manufactured in late 2012 and late 2013 for up to five years after the purchase date. That’s longer than the usual three year coverage. Apple will also replace the hinge at no cost to the consumer regardless of their warranty status. \nThe details of this repair program were not made public, but rather shared internally with Apple authorized service providers. They recommend that users contact Apple via phone or email to start the refund process. Any customers who still have a product with a broken hinge can make an appointment with the Genius Bar at an Apple store or visit an Apple authorized service provider to see if their iMac qualifies to have the hinge repaired at no cost.",

It wasn’t a new breakthrough in VR that lets you actually do your chores while pretending to do your chores, it wasn’t even an announcement for Pokemon Go 2 featuring a brand new footstep system. It’s a tiny, tiny little Gameboy for ants. image: hackaday/youtube \nJeroen Domburg created a Gameboy so tiny that it fits on a keychain. It’s impossible to actually read any of the text in games, but for things like Tetris you don’t need to. There’s no way a cartridge would fit inside here, so the Gameboy connects to a network and downloads the games via WiFi, and uses an Emulator to run them. \nHere’s a peek inside of the system while it’s running: image: hackaday/youtube \nIt even runs Doom, kind of. \nWe’ll include the full video of Jeroen going over the build process and showing off his hardware, head to around the 39 minute mark to catch all of the Doom stuff. image: hackaday/youtube \nBut here’s the kicker. Witcher 3 running on a tiny Gameboy: image: hackaday/youtube \nJust kidding, but it can stream from a television… image: hacksday/youtube \nHe almost went with some parts from a Galaxy Note 7, but ended up using a different battery after all. Good call, nobody wants a Gameboy keychain that you can’t even take on a airplane. \nWith the recent interest generated by the NES Classic , it’s about time Nintendo did a Gameboy Classic , featuring a stand-alone system with pre-installed titles from the entire Gameboy roster, from the original grey brick all the way up until the Gameboy Advance. We would be lining up and begging them to take our money, but they would probabally only release 5 of them in each city and they’d end up going for $500 on eBay.",

      "text": "iPhone 8 Dreaming in Full Swing   3:21 PM PT Apple's latest iPhone was barely out of the gate when rumors began percolating about the company's next new phone.\nAlthough the iPhone 7 garnered mostly tepid reviews when it was released this summer, initial inventories sold out quickly, and the company had to scramble to meet demand.\nThat demand may have peaked, though, which may be why chasers of the next big thing are looking down the road.\n\"You can rest assured that next year being the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone, Apple will come out with something special,\" said Wayne Lam, principal analyst for telecom electronics at IHS Markit .\n\"Whether it's a completely new 10th anniversary model in conjunction with the regular iteration model of the iPhone 7, we'll have to find out -- but most likely, there will be drastic design innovation coming with the iPhones in 2017,\"  \n\"Historically, Apple likes to make a big deal out of decade-length anniversaries,\" observed Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT .\n\"Since 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, it's easy to assume the company will use the opportunity to prove that it hasn't lost a step, and continues to lead the industry in both design sophistication and delivering value to its customers,\"   \nBlock of Glass and Aluminum Anticipation for the next model may be higher because the iPhone 7 failed to tick off many items on the wish lists of Apple fans.\n\"My impression is they were holding back on the 7, so they could make a whiz-bang splash on the 10th anniversary,\" said David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research .\nThe next iPhone will be Apple's vision of the smartphone of the future, he added.\n\"Long term, what the iPhone will be is a block of glass and aluminum with as few buttons, bumps and holes as it can have,\" McQueen told TechNewsWorld.\nApple may be taking a step toward that phone of the future with the display rumored for the next iPhone. It reportedly will be an OLED display that will occupy most of the front of the phone -- or all of it, by wrapping over its sides.\nThe OLED part of that rumor is a solid bet, maintained IHS' Lam.\n\"Apple's move to OLED display is all but assured through our supply-side intelligence,\" he said. \"This opens up lots of design possibilities for them on next year's groundbreaking iPhone design.\" \nEdge-to-Edge Screen OLED screens have better contrast, brightness and deeper blacks than LCD displays, and they're also more flexible, which would allow Apple to create a curved phone with an edge-to-edge screen.\n\"I find the edge-to-edge display most credible,\" Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, told TechNewsWorld.\nEmbracing OLED technology will help Apple keep pace with its competitors.\n\"Samsung has been doing curved OLED screens for years, so it's not a cutting-edge phenomenon by any stretch of the imagination,\" noted Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research .\n\"This is Apple just playing catch-up to other people,\"  \nThe beauty of the edge-to-edge screen is not expected to be marred by a home button or fingerprint reader. Both will be built into the screen itself, rumor has it.\n\"I'm particularly intrigued by the idea of a display-enabled fingerprint reader,\" Pund-IT's King said. \"That could simplify both the phone design and authentication processes.\" \nGlass Body Some Apple watchers, including widely respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, believe there will be three iPhone models: two conventional models with 4.7- and 5.5-inch displays, and one with an edge-to-edge rounded screen.\nAll of the units will have glass bodies to facilitate wireless charging.\nApple's wireless charging is expected to be truly wireless. Existing wireless chargers require a phone to be placed on the charger. Apple's charger will charge a phone through the air for short distances.\n\"Wireless charging that requires no contact would be a technology innovation,\" Technalysis' O'Donnell said.\nThere are some drawbacks to charging devices through the air, he added. It's very inefficient, so it's not the greenest way to charge a phone.\nThen there are possible safety issues.\n\"Power signals flying through the air could freak people out,\" O'Donnell said. \nNeed for a Home Run Many of the rumors about the next iPhone may be unfounded, suggested Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at Tirias Research .\n\"The iPhone 8 rumors are all over the place,\"  \nThe phone seems to have every item from everyone's wish lists.\n\"It's likely two or maybe three of these ideas will come to pass in the next iPhone, but none of them are groundbreaking innovations,\" Krewell pointed out.\n\"They're all very nice enhancements and will keep Apple's iPhone competitive with phones from other vendors,\" he added.\nHowever, that may not be what the company needs with the next iPhone.\n\"With sales slipping and margins reportedly under pressure, it's important for Apple to come out swinging with the iPhone 8. The company needs to prove that it's still an elemental force in mobile innovation -- not just one of many companies delivering quality products,\" noted Pund-IT's King.\n\"Apple is so profitable and so deeply embedded with millions of customers that the company could survive and even thrive if the iPhone 8 fails in the marketplace,\" he added, \"but the same might not be true of company executives tied to the new device. If the iPhone 8 fails to hit a home run, any number of execs could be headed for the showers.\"",

      "text": "Reddit \nGoogle’s new Pixel smartphone is apparently failing to properly display screengrabs sent from the iPhone 7 Plus . Screengrabs sent from within an app on the iPhone arrive with both dimensions and colors distorted. \nA Google support forum employee initially blamed Apple, suggesting that Pixel owners ‘reach out to Apple support’ before others pointed out that the problem had to be at the Pixel end, an apparent bug in the way that either the Pixel or Android 7.1 processes incoming MMS images. iPhone to iPhone screenshots are fine. iPhone to Pixel are not fine. How is that “confined” to iPhone? Sounds like a problem with the way Pixel is parsing the MMS. \nGoogle is now said to be aware of the issue, but has not yet said when a fix might be available. So if you own a Pixel and are receiving garbled images from iPhone-owning friends, I’m afraid it’s not them, it’s you … ",

      "text": "How To Cure Food Poisoning Fast! Lugol's Iodine Write a review Posted by Jan (Buffalo, NY) on 04/18/2008 \nI travel extensively and carry a small HDPE bottle of Lugol's for the inevitable food poisoning that occurs in restaurant food. When I get a case of it, I take 15 drops of Lugol's in water and it takes less than 15 minutes to stop the cramps. Dr. Hulda Clark does recommend Lugol's Iodine. I buy my Lugol's in pint bottles at the local pharmacy. I tell the pharmacist that I use it for staining tissue slides for microscopy. It works every time. Reply Posted by Jamie (Fairmont, Minnesota) on 12/15/2007 \nHello you WONDERFUL people! Thank you SO much for this resource! I was in the middle of my third serious bout with salmonella in a year and feeling little relief from the antibiotics after 8 days. After reading a book by Dr. Hulda Clark I am convinced that I was picking up Salmonella from milk products. Hulda says that Lugol's kills vicious stomach bacteria including salmonella so I got online looking for it when I found this site. I read through all of the comments and went looking for the iodine. Someone said I could get it at walmart so I tried. The Pharmacist had no clue about iodine deficiency and wouldn't give me the iodine he had ordered for me. How disgusting and irresponsible! I ordered the book by Dr. Brownstein, Iodine: Why You Need It and Why You Can't Live Without It along with a 2 oz. bottle of lugol's solution from amazon.com. I was very discouraged by the fact that there was no overnight shipping option available on the site. A day or two after ordering I emailed them expressing my discouragement and they responded with a toll free number that could be used to get overnight shipping. My Lugol's arrived a day earlier than expected and I tested for allergy on my foot. I knew I wasn't allergic since I have had iodized salt for ever, and I had no irritation from the iodine on my foot. So I began the dose recommended by Hulda for salmonella which is 6 drops in a half cup of juice after meals and at bed time. After reading the book by Dr. Brownstein and looking at the Optimox site I knew that 6 drops 4 times a day is equivalent to 150mg of iodine a day. The relief from the Salmonella began nearly immediately but was nearly complete after a day of the scheduled dose. I had no symptoms of taking too much iodine, so I continued to the third day at that dose (as recommended for treating Salmonella in Hulda's book). Then I cut back to 6 drops 3 times a day to counter my newly recognized iodine deficiency. Just so you know, the Salmonella are DEAD!!! And I feel ALIVE!!! \n5 years ago I should have been diagnosed with fibrocystic breast disease but was told that my lumpy bumpy breasts needed vitamin E. I didn't take it seriously as I wasn't diagnosed with anything. I had just had my first child. Over the last 6 months I have had pain in my breasts not just before a period but at intervals during the month that wouldn't even allow me to hug my (now I have 3) children. I had no idea until reading this site and the information from Dr. Brownstein that I had fibrocystic breast disease, the precursor for breast cancer (which is so prevalent in this area that it should be a CRIME that people are not handed iodine by the government in giant sized rations!) The great lakes basin is the worst in the WORLD for iodine deficiency-we are the reason salt is iodized-only well enough to fend off goiter and mental retardation which were becoming a problem in the early 1900's in this area! The actual need for iodine by your body is 13.5mg a day and that's after fixing a deficiency. And that number does not take into account the other factors we are exposed to. (Halogens which replace iodine in the body everywhere around us-chlorine, bromine, fluorine-in bread, in toothpaste, in water) THIS IS EPIDEMIC! \nTwo days into my salmonella killing spree with iodine, I began my menstrual period without cramps. I have had such terrible cramps from my period that I have a stock pile of ibuprofen. (which makes your stomach bleed and hurts your liver) but what are we to do? IODINE! I have been on Iodine for 4 days now and each morning I wake up with cramps but almost as soon as I take my 6 drops of lugol's my cramps are GONE! It's like the cramps are there because my ovaries are begging me for much needed iodine to clean me out. I am so thrilled about this! By the way,my breast pain has diminished to almost none, and they feel like 16 year old breasts. No kidding. My energy level has sky rocketed and I am losing weight. (I should mention that I am taking the iodine with a liquid B complex supplement because Dr. Brownstein says it is possible to get heart palpitations and/or symptoms of iodine allergy if you are deficient in vitamin b2 and b3 since they are needed to transport iodine throughout your body. I can feel my metabolism normalizing - it feels GREAT! \nFor a long time I have wondered why my ears hurt - I thought maybe I was taking an autotoxic (something toxic to your ears) drug, I wasn't taking any drugs other than ibuprofen, so I wasn't convinced, but I was becoming afraid that I would eventually lose my hearing. I have also become slower in the brain over the last few years. I attributed it to the mercury in my fillings after reading Dr. Clarks book, but having seen the symptoms of iodine deficiency including hearing loss and cretinism I now believe I am severely deficient in iodine and I am so excited to not get any worse. I am getting better!",

Original Price: $999.99 \nThis deal is already so low, it isn’t eligible for additional discounts/coupons. Share with Friends: Tweet Details \nThe 27\" iMac Desktop Computer from Apple is a sleek all-in-one computer with a stunning 16:9 HD display. Capable of displaying 1080p HD video at full resolution, the display features a LED backlight and IPS panel technology for superior image quality. The iMac sports a sleek aluminum and glass industrial design. The built-in FaceTime HD camera hides discreetly above the LCD screen, giving you ready access to a webcam for Internet chat and conferencing. It will let you make video calls to other Mac users with the included FaceTime app, as well as to anyone with an iPhone 4 or an iPod touch model with a built-in camera. \n27\" Display Today’s iMac has come a long way from the first 15\" iMac. Take one look and you’ll see just how far. A 27\" display with edge-to-edge glass covers nearly the entire front of the enclosure. When all you see is the display, nothing gets between you and what’s onscreen. Movies, TV shows, FaceTime HD video calls, websites, photos — everything looks stunning on the widescreen 16:9 iMac display. \nLED Backlighting The more pixels a display has, the more light those pixels need to achieve the best picture possible. And that’s exactly what the LED backlighting in iMac does: It pushes light through each pixel with remarkable brightness and efficiency. Because the LED backlight doesn’t take up much space, the iMac enclosure stays thin – even with all the high-performance components inside. \nHigh Resolution Apple engineers could simply have stretched the display found in the 21.5\" iMac up and out for the 27\" model. Instead, they took the display well beyond HD with 2560 × 1440 resolution. That’s 78 percent more pixels than the 21.5\" iMac display. \nFeatures & Specifications: Processor: Intel 2.7GHz Core i5 Quad-Core Operating System: Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan Hard Drive: 1TB 7200 rpm Warranty: 90 Days Display: 27\" glossy LED -backlit 16:9 widescreen with \"\"IPS technology\"\" and a native resolution of 2560 1440 8x SuperDrive DVD Burner, SDXC Card Slot Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512MB GPU FaceTime HD Camera Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi Ports: 2x-Thurnderbolt, 4x- USB 2.0, 1x-Firewire 800, 1x-Ethernet, 1x-Sound-in, 1x-Headphone/Sound-out Dimensions: 20.4 25.6 8.15 Model: MC813LL/A \nCondition: Grade C Refurbished Through the refurbishment process, the entire computer is tested for functionality including memory, hard drive, and keyboard.

      "text": "apple repair imac hinge landscape More Apple will cover repair and replacement of the iMac display hinge, as well as issue refunds to consumers who already obtained a repair, according to an internal announcement. Such repairs often cost more than $100.\nA quick Google search for “iMac display hinge” brings up lots of hits for people who are frustrated with its performance. Users report that the hinge makes audible popping or grinding sounds, then eventually fails to adjust. Another issue that was cited numerous times is that the screen continuously tilts forward despite attempts to adjust it.\nMore: Apple needs to eject all the misleading junk on the Mac App Store, report says\nOne user, Mr. Mo-Fo reported on the Apple support forum, “ I was just sitting watching TV when there was a loud crack and my iMac screen suddenly tilted down — now the screen will not stay where it is tilted/positioned. I was not using the iMac at the time and it was not doing anything it just broke on its own.”\nThe issue is limited to the 27-inch iMacs that were shipped between December 2012 and July 2014. As a result, Apple has extended its iMac hinge repair program to cover iMacs manufactured in late 2012 and late 2013 for up to five years after the purchase date. That’s longer than the usual three year coverage. Apple will also replace the hinge at no cost to the consumer regardless of their warranty status.\nThe details of this repair program were not made public, but rather shared internally with Apple authorized service providers. They recommend that users contact Apple via phone or email to start the refund process. Any customers who still have a product with a broken hinge can make an appointment with the Genius Bar at an Apple store or visit an Apple authorized service provider to see if their iMac qualifies to have the hinge repaired at no cost.\nSurface Studio is easy to repair and has some upgradeable parts, iFixit says Apple has launched its second iPhone repair program in less than a week You'll soon be able to walk in and out of a uBreakiFix store with a repaired Pixel or Pixel XL",

And Apple's legendary mountain of dirt has been drastically reduced, with the earth being spread around the campus for landscaping. \nApple CEO Tim Cook told employees earlier this year that Apple planned to move the first groups into the new \"Spaceship\" campus in January 2017. \nBut the City of Cupertino, where the building will be located, announced last month that the project's completion date had been pushed back to the second quarter of 2017.The dirt pyramid at its peak in February.Youtube/Duncan Sinfield \nAnd Cupertino's engineering inspector, 4Leaf, told the city in September that it believed the project was behind schedule and prepared its own budget through June 2017, according to a document seen by Business Insider. \n\"Although we haven’t been formally notified, we understand that the AC2 project is behind its anticipated 31-month construction schedule,\" 4Leaf wrote. \nBut whether the official move-in date gets pushed back a month or two — no announcement has been made publicly — won't matter to this campus in the long run, which is an symbol of Apple's massive success over the past decade and should stand for years. \nCheck out the video below: About Us",

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube \nIf you bought your iMac in between December 2012 and July 2014, you might have been afflicted by a problem in which of your iMac might have issues with its hinge where it would continuously tilt forward. Customers who have been experiencing this problem have probably sent it in for repairs and were charged upwards of $100 to get it fixed. \nThe good news is that if you are one of those who paid Apple to get the problem fixed, you’ll be pleased to learn that Apple will now be refunding you your money, or at least that’s according to MacRumors who has obtained an updated service document sent to Apple Authorized Service Providers. \nApple has yet to make this publicly known, unlike some of their other exchange and repair programs. We’re not sure if they do plan on letting customers know, but for now MacRumors says that Apple is recommending that affected customers get in touch with the company to request for a refund. \nAs for users who have yet to get their iMacs fixed, you will have to make an appointment with the Genius Bar at an Apple Store to see if your computer is eligible to be part of the repair program. The affected models seem to cover 2012-2014, but it has been noted that it seems to affect those from late 2012 to late 2013 models more. You can check out the problem for yourself in the video above. \nFiled in Apple > Computers . Read more about iMac . Related Articles",

      "text": "Apple working on \"more than 10\" designs prototypes for next iPhone Apple's iPhone 7 series may not have sold as well as expected (Source: Wikipedia Commons) Distinct new features include curved and OLED displays. by Douglas Black, 2016/11/29 Business Apple iPhone 7 iPhone 8 iPhone   Apple is prototyping over 10 distinct new iPhone designs, including OLED and curved displays, states a report from The Wall Street Journal . According to sources, Apple is asking its Asian suppliers to increase production of thin, high-resolution OLED displays to help \"differentiate [Apple's] models\" from its competitors'. Apple already uses OLED technology in the touchbar on its new line of MacBooks as well as its Apple Watch. OLED screens are thinner and have faster response times, viewing angles, contrast, power efficiency, and vibrance than IPS displays, making the move to OLED (from IPS) seem like a logical move. Apple also has several good reasons to consider curved glass, OLED, and presumably more experimental designs for the next iPhone: Next year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and it would be a great time to overhaul the iPhone's design, which (to some consumers at least) is getting long in the tooth. It is estimated that Apple's iPhone 7 family failed to outsell the iPhone 6's, according to reliable analyst at KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo. Additionally, stronger competition on the Android side — namely the Samsung S7 Edge and recently released Google Pixel and Pixel XL — may be eating into Apple's sales as well.Apple has reported strong initial order numbers for its new MacBook Pros , but a weak Q4 2016 financial quarter has likely put all the more pressure on Apple to give consumers an iPhone deserving of the 10th anniversary occasion.

      "text": "The lawsuit filed by Apple against Samsung over patents for “quick links,” “slide to unlock,” and autocorrect has reached an end. Well, only if Samsung doesn’t ask the Supreme Court to look into this case, too.\nThe chaebol lost its bid for appeal to fend off $119.6 million in damages . The full US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit applied this verdict after a three-judge panel found that Apple actually owed some money to Samsung.\nNo comment was attached to the rejection for an en banc (full court) review of the judgment.\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to take on another Apple v. Samsung case on the design of their phones .\nThe post No appeal for Samsung in Apple patent verdict, it must pay $120 million appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Apple updates Final Cut Pro X with minor bug fixes By Tuesday, November 29, 2016, 04:37 pm PT (07:37 pm ET) Apple on Tuesday pushed out a minor update for its premiere video editing tool Final Cut Pro X, addressing library and Paste Attributes issues, among other feature fixes. Final Cut Pro X version 10.3.1 brings a trio of resolutions targeting file handling and user interface issues, as well as a peculiar image cropping bug apparently tied to system language settings, according to Apple's release notes. Of note, the latest Final Cut Pro X iteration fixes an issue that presented images incorrectly when Spanish or Spanish (Mexico) was selected as the preferred language in Language & Region System Preference. Those affected by the bug saw some images appear cropped in the app's viewer. A second issue proved more urgent for a wider swath of Apple's customer base. In particular, some users ran into trouble when using the Paste Attributes tool to copy color correction tweaks between clips. Color correction is an important and often mandatory step in basic NLE workflows. The update also addressed a minor problem tied to updating file libraries. Today's update comes one month after Apple released Final Cut Pro X 10.3 with new features and a revamped user interface designed to take advantage of the company's new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar hardware. Specifically, the latest FCPX iteration brings editing tool selection, audio adjustment sliders, clip scrubbing —prominently featured in subsequent MacBook Pro TV spots —and more to the Touch Bar. Final Cut Pro X version 10.3.1 is available as a free download for existing customers, while new users can purchase the video editing suite from the Mac App Store for $299.99 . Topics:",

      "text": "0 An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015. Reuters/Mike Segar \nApple is bound to set another company milestone. The tech giant is reportedly developing its first touchscreen device that will not be including a Home button. And no, it’s not the iPhone 8. \nAccording to the latest reports, Apple is currently into the development of the new iPad and the company plans to get rid of its new tablet’s home button. If this pushes through, the iPad will be the first touch-enabled Apple device to have such feature. Previous reports have stated that the removal of the Home button was initially planned for the future iPhone 8. \nThe forthcoming 10.9-inch iPad is said to be the bearer of the new feature. According to Macotakara , the new iPad’s front-facing camera will be retained but the unlock button will not be present at the foot of the display. The removal of the Home button shall significantly enlarge the screen size, which could match that of the present 9.7-inch iPad Pro. \nREAD: Apple iPhone overheats and experiences all sorts of battery problems after iOS 10.1.1 update \nApple is also supposedly planning to reduce the size of the top and side buttons of the new iPad as well. It is likewise projected that the Cupertino-based company will make the new tablet as thick as the iPad Air 2 to create space for its battery. While Apple is likely to continue the production of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro together with the new 10.9-inch iPad, the tech giant is expected to lower the price of its current device to compete with more affordable Android tablets. \nThe new iPad, which is due to be announced early next year, is expected to target business and education sectors that consider the current 9.7-inch iPad model as too small and the rumoured 12.9-inch iPad Pro as too expensive. According to recent reports, none of the new iPads will equip OLED displays. Apple is expected to use screen advancements to enhance the 2018 iPad models instead.",

      "text": "Apple is Offering Refunds to Customers Who Paid for an iMac Hinge Repair LIKE MORE Posted 18 minutes ago by iClarified · 482 views · Translate Apple has started offering refunds to customers who paid for an iMac hinge repair or replacement, reports MacRumors. An internal document obtained by the site revealed the new policy. Apple's service document acknowledges some 27-inch iMacs shipped between December 2012 and July 2014 may be affected by an issue with the display hinge, resulting in the screen no longer adjusting and continuously tilting forward. The issue appears to be limited to late 2012 and late 2013 models in particular. The hinge problem is blamed on the use of plastic washers in the hinge's spring mechanism. Over time the washers can break under the load and cause the screen to fall forward.Check out the video below to see the issue demonstrated and contact Apple support if you have the problem or have paid to fix the problem in the past.",

      "text": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares have been range-bound between $93 and $123 since the middle of 2015 after they pulled back from a consolidation zone.\nApple, with a market capitalization of $596 billion, has the potential to sway the markets one way or the other and every move this tech stalwart makes could be worth watching out for. The news flow on Apple was fairly heavy on Tuesday, although the nature of the news flow, at best, would be qualified as mixed.\nAfter gap-opening lower (at $110.78 Vs. Monday's close of $111.57), the stock gradually recouped its loss, moving into positive territory by late morning and briefly going above the $112 level. Subsequently, the stock pulled back and has been holding barely above the unchanged line in a broad sideways movement.\nSoft Outlook UBS lowered its iPhone procurement estimates for December to 74 million from 75 million, down 1 percent year-over-year. This, according to the firm, places the current consensus estimate for the December and March quarter unit shipment growth at risk.\nHowever, analyst Steven Milunovich feels mix shift will support ASPs. The analyst indicated his 76 million unit sales estimate is below the 78 million unit Street estimates. The analyst maintained his Buy rating and $127 price target for shares.\nApple's India Outperformance A report from Economic Times showed that iPhone sales rose sharply in India in the three days that immediately following demonetization, with 100,000 iPhones or about 3/4th of its average monthly sales made these three days. Strong sales orchestrated by the intent to buy the gadget by offloading canceled currency notes helped Apple to earn the distinction of being the only phone maker to meet monthly sales target in November, the report added.\nKGI Upbeat On iPhone 8 Sales KGI Securities believes the new iPhone to be sold in 2017, dubbed iPhone 8, may see sales swell to 120-150 million units in the second half of 2017, according to a report in 9to5Mac. The report noted this would mean breaking the record set by iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales. The radically designed iPhone 8 would have a large OLED display, with wireless feature expected to be part of it.\nApple's Medical Foray A report filed by MobiHealthNews said that Apple had exchanged mails with the FDA concerning two possible products in the cardiac space.\nIDC Forecast Weak Smartphone Shipment Forecast for 2016 Global smartphone shipments may just manage to stay afloat in 2016 after rising 10 percent in 2015, according to the IDC. Specifically, IDC estimates shipments of 1.45 billion in 2016, up 0.6 percent. IDC said Apple could see negative annual iPhone sales growth, given the global smartphone saturation.\n ",

Author By Dianne de Guzman Nov 29, 2016 The latest drone footage filmed outside of the new Apple headquarters in Cupertino, CA, shows a number of developments in the construction. The glass-filled main atrium can be seen, and solar panels are noticeable on the top of several buildings, including the garage structure and main building. The video was shot last week by David Sexton and offers views of structures beyond the main \"spaceship\" including the 100,000-square-foot fitness center, massive parking structure and the underground auditorium. Landscaping also has started, with trees appearing in different areas on the new campus.

      "text": "For Apple 's(NASDAQ: AAPL) important holiday quarter, management is guiding for the company's gross profit margin to drop between 160 and 210 basis points. When viewed alongside the year-over-year declines in the three quarters before it, this underwhelming guidance for the important profitability metric could be a cause for concern for some investors.\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\nBut a closer look at what's going on with Apple's gross profit margin suggests the tech giant is probably doing better than it looks when it comes to profitability.\nWhat's affecting Apple's gross profit margin? For its first fiscal quarter of 2017, which coincides with the fourth calendar quarter of 2016, Apple management expects gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%, down from 40.1%. Even if Apple achieves the midpoint of its guidance range for gross profit margin, this would undoubtedly mark a notable decline. But investors shouldn't fret; there's good reason for the year-over-year pullback.\nWhen asked about Apple's lower-than-expected guidance for its first-quarter gross profit margin, Apple CFO Luca Maestri broke down the factors that are driving the difference in the year-ago gross profit margin and Apple's guidance:\n40 basis points in the year-ago gross profit margin were driven by a $548 million award for a patent infringement. 60 to 70 basis points of the difference between the two periods is simply due to currency headwinds. Finally, Maestri said he expected higher cost structures of new products to negatively impact the year-over-year comparison. In other words, after excluding impacts of Apple's patent infringement award in the year-ago quarter and currency headwinds, management only anticipates its first-quarter gross profit margin to decline between about 55 and 115 basis points year over year. Further, much of this expected year-over-year decline in gross profit margin is expected to be a factor of higher cost structures; so, Apple's profitability doesn't seem to be suffering from any negative secular trends -- unless, of course, this higher cost structure for the quarter is the beginning of a sustained period of rising costs.\nBut it's unlikely higher costs are here to stay. Apple has dealt with temporary higher cost structures in the past, when it launched the iPad Mini and at times when it refreshed lots of its product lines around the same time.\nZoom out Looking beyond a tough, and arguably unfair, year-over-year comparison, there's probably an even better reason for Apple investors not to be concerned: A zoomed-out view of Apple's quarterly gross profit margin over a period of several years shows that a gross margin of around 38% to 38.5% isn't really so abnormal for the company. Between the fourth quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple's gross margin has bounced around between about 37% and 40.1%.\nData retrieved from Apple SEC filings for quarters shown. Quarter with an asterisk is the midpoint of management's guidance. Chart source: author.\nSo Apple's expected gross profit margin during the first fiscal quarter of 2017 certainly isn't anything to be excited about. But it's also not worth worrying about.\nWhen should investors start worrying about Apple's gross profit margin? If the key metric ever begins to consistently trend downward for more than a few years, this could be more indicative of more secular negative factors, such as declining pricing power, permanently higher cost structures, or unfavorable products mix shifts, that could be here to stay.\nOf course, it doesn't hurt for investors to look into quarter-to-quarter volatility of Apple's gross profit margin, given how important it is to an investing thesis in Apple stock . As a cash cow, anything that hinders the company's ability to rake in high levels of profits is worth a closer look.\nIn this particular case, the driving force behind Apple's lower gross profit margin doesn't look like it's a problem. Indeed, I'd argue that Apple's gross profit margin today continues to support the company's impressive ability at sustaining pricing power and scale in evolving markets.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "How Apple Lost China to Two Unknown Local Smartphone Makers Bloomberg News November 22, 2016 — 4:00 PM EST November 23, 2016 — 4:09 AM EST Oppo and Vivo offer subsidies to sales representatives They became top vendors in China thanks to rural expansion \nHow China's Oppo, Vivo Are Pushing Apple iPhone Aside \nTwo years ago, Oppo and Vivo couldn’t crack the top five in China’s smartphone market. Now they outrank everyone after elbowing Apple aside, thanks to people like Cheng Xiaoning. \nCheng runs a thriving electronics store in the rural town of Miaoxia, tapping into her WeChat social media account to promote the brands that pay the biggest commission, and in her case that’s Oppo and Vivo. While such payments start at about 40 yuan ($6), they escalate for more expensive handsets and reach almost 200 yuan for Oppo’s high-end smartphones. \n“That’s why I like to introduce the Oppo R9 Plus to potential customers,” she said. “Business has been perfect, actually never been better.” \nCheng and tens of thousands of like-minded boosters form the vanguard of the pair’s charge against Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Working with the local stores that dominate sales in China’s far-flung provinces, Oppo and Vivo came out of nowhere to upend the industry order and squeeze out former local darling Xiaomi Corp. Their labels graced one out of every three smartphones sold within China in the third quarter, while the iPhone’s market share at 7 percent stood at its lowest in almost three years. \nOppo and Vivo trace their origins to reclusive billionaire Duan Yong Ping and employ similar strategies . That includes harnessing the spending power of rural customers away from top-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. It’s where Apple’s vulnerable given the iPhone’s lofty price tag. They eschewed e-commerce to instead court the stores where three-quarters of smartphone sales take place. Apple has been more reluctant to relinquish the retail experience to local free-agents, who sometimes charge brands for in-store displays and posters. \n“Oppo and Vivo are willing to share their profit with local sales. The reward was an extremely active and loyal nationwide sales network,” said Jin Di , an IDC analyst based in Beijing. While they declined to detail their subsidy program, she estimates the two were the top spenders in the past year. “They’re doing something different -- they do local marketing.” \nChina had for years driven Apple’s and Samsung’s growth. The U.S. company generated almost $59 billion of sales from the region in fiscal 2015, which was more than double the level just two years earlier. During that time its shares surged more than 60 percent. At its peak, Greater China yielded almost 30 percent of its revenue and Apple was neck-and-neck with Xiaomi for the mantle of market leader as users clamored for the larger iPhone 6 models. Even as the domestic economy began to sputter, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook spent a good chunk of an earnings call last year talking up the country’s promise, saying Apple’s investing there “for the decades ahead.” \nThen the country’s slowdown and regulatory tangles took their toll. Authorities intervened, blocking iTunes Movies and iBooks, ending a period of near-unimpeded growth in the country. But perhaps most crucial was the ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives. Oppo and Vivo’s gains have come mainly at the expense of lower-tier names thus far, but if they climb further into the premium segment, the U.S. company will need an answer. Some think the 10th- anniversary iPhone due in 2017 could deliver. \n“Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users,” Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah writes . Oppo and Vivo can use the time until then to cement their positions, he said. \nTogether Oppo and Vivo shipped about 40 million smartphones in the third quarter, about 34 percent of devices sold in the world’s biggest market, according to IDC. In 2012, their combined share was about 2.5 percent. IPhone shipments plunged more than a third to 8.2 million during the period -- less than half of Vivo’s. Samsung, which once led the market, now settles for roughly 5 percent, according to Counterpoint. \nAs Apple has faltered in China, Cook has stepped up his courtship of decision-makers. He visited the country several times this year, unveiled plans for research centers in Beijing and Shenzhen, and invested $1 billion in Uber rival Didi Chuxing. Cook said on his last earnings call he remains confident of a return to growth this quarter. \nSamsung declined to comment for this story, while Apple directed Bloomberg to Cook’s previous remarks on China. \nIt’s unclear how Apple can reclaim lost ground in the interim. Previous attempts to drift down-market -- with the iPhone 5c and SE, for instance -- fizzled as local users shunned seemingly inferior devices. Apple doesn’t run a vibrant online social community for users the way some of its local rivals do. And competing on price will jeopardize the industry’s fattest profit margins. \nOppo and Vivo pack high-end specs into a phone that sells for a fraction of its rival’s in China, where iPhone 7s start at 5,388 ($784). Consider the Oppo R9 plus: for 2,999 yuan, buyers get an aluminum body, 6-inch display, 16-megapixel camera and a battery that claims 19 hours of calls, photo and web browsing. Vivo’s high-end Xplay6, with a price tag of 4,498 yuan, also undercuts Apple. \n“Both companies invested heavily in marketing,” said Nicole Peng, Asia Pacific research director at consultancy Canalys. Oppo and Vivo have a strong grip on the middle market for phones from $200 to $500, she said. “Their offline channel strategy paid off.” \nThe man who’s clobbering Apple started out low on the tech spectrum. Duan made his fortune selling DVD players, telephones and game consoles similar to Nintendo’s. Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. Ltd., the parent of Vivo, emerged from a restructuring in 1999 that split his company. The billionaire later teamed with long-time colleague Tony Chen and others to found what came to be known as Guangdong Oppo Electronics Co. \nWhile Duan has kept a low profile since moving to the U.S. in 2001, he occasionally makes his way into the spotlight. In 2006, he bid a then-record $620,100 to have lunch with Warren Buffett. Oppo’s first smartphone came in 2011, when it unveiled a device with a BlackBerry-like keyboard. The same year, Bubugao created the business that would become Vivo. \nToday, Vivo touts its cameras and Oppo focuses on rapid-charging and battery life. But their offline strategies remain the same: mobilizing tens of thousands of private shop owners. Oppo said it sells its products through roughly 240,000 privately owned stores as of June -- six times the global count of McDonald’s . Vivo manages about half that, said Jin. Oppo, which doesn’t disclose sales figures, said about 90 percent of its phones were sold offline. \nWhile Xiaomi shot to international prominence with flash online promotions, that success has been concentrated in densely packed cities. That doesn’t work so well in the countryside, where novice buyers want advice and demonstrations. By cultivating a physical network, Oppo and Vivo are building a platform difficult to replicate in the short run. Close all those tabs. Open this email. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.",

      "title": "Apple Pay stoush turns sour with ruling against Australian banks | Australia news",
      "text": "Customers of three of Australia’s four big banks will not have access to Apple’s electronic payment system, after the competition watchdog refused their application to bargain collectively.\nCommonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank applied in July to negotiate as a collective over the use of Apple Pay, which allows touch-and-go payments on iPhones.\nThe banks had argued that Apple Pay prevented them from developing their own integrated digital wallets for iPhones, which they said would increase competition and consumer choice in Australia.\nApple Pay to launch in China despite stiff competition in mobile payment Read more\nRestrictions on passing fees associated with Apple Pay onto customers were also a sticking point.\nBut the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has rejected the application , meaning each bank will have to reach an individual agreement with Apple before its customers can use Apple Pay.\nThe ACCC said it accepted that allowing the banks to negotiate collectively and potentially boycott Apple Pay would place them in a better bargaining position with Apple, but that the benefits for customers were “currently uncertain and may be limited”.\nRod Sims, the ACCC chairman, said digital wallets and mobile payments were in their infancy and subject to rapid change.\n“It is therefore uncertain how competition may develop with the availability of mobile payments and possible future innovations.\n“Apple Wallet and other non-bank digital wallets could represent a disruptive technology that may increase competition between the banks by making it easier for consumers to switch between card providers and limiting any ‘lock in’ effect bank digital wallets may cause.”\nIn an emailed statement provided by Apple to the ABC , it said the ACCC’s decision was “great for Australians”.\nThe ACCC’s ruling is a draft decision with a final outcome expected in March 2017.\nThe banks seemed to take heart from Sims’ description of the ruling as “finely balanced”, vowing to continue to work with the ACCC in a statement published on the Bendigo and Adelaide Bank’s website.\nLance Blockley, the spokesperson for the applicants, said a ruling against them would mean “effectively … no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone”.\n“The application has never been about preventing Apple Pay from coming to Australia or reducing competition between wallets. It has always been about providing consumer choice and innovation.”\nANZ, American Express and Cuscal, which represents 13 issuers, have reached agreements with Apple over Apple Pay in Australia.",

      "text": "Apple, Inc.'s Gross Profit Margin Is Faring Better Than You May Think \nBy Daniel Sparks Print \nFor Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) important holiday quarter, management is guiding for the company's gross profit margin to drop between 160 and 210 basis points. When viewed alongside the year-over-year declines in the three quarters before it, this underwhelming guidance for the important profitability metric could be a cause for concern for some investors. \nContinue Reading Below \nImage source: The Motley Fool. \nBut a closer look at what's going on with Apple's gross profit margin suggests the tech giant is probably doing better than it looks when it comes to profitability. What's affecting Apple's gross profit margin? More From Fool.com He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nFor its first fiscal quarter of 2017, which coincides with the fourth calendar quarter of 2016, Apple management expects gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%, down from 40.1%. Even if Apple achieves the midpoint of its guidance range for gross profit margin, this would undoubtedly mark a notable decline. But investors shouldn't fret; there's good reason for the year-over-year pullback. \nWhen asked about Apple's lower-than-expected guidance for its first-quarter gross profit margin, Apple CFO Luca Maestri broke down the factors that are driving the difference in the year-ago gross profit margin and Apple's guidance: \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT 40 basis points in the year-ago gross profit margin were driven by a $548 million award for a patent infringement. 60 to 70 basis points of the difference between the two periods is simply due to currency headwinds. Finally, Maestri said he expected higher cost structures of new products to negatively impact the year-over-year comparison. \nIn other words, after excluding impacts of Apple's patent infringement award in the year-ago quarter and currency headwinds, management only anticipates its first-quarter gross profit margin to decline between about 55 and 115 basis points year over year. Further, much of this expected year-over-year decline in gross profit margin is expected to be a factor of higher cost structures; so, Apple's profitability doesn't seem to be suffering from any negative secular trends -- unless, of course, this higher cost structure for the quarter is the beginning of a sustained period of rising costs. \nBut it's unlikely higher costs are here to stay. Apple has dealt with temporary higher cost structures in the past, when it launched the iPad Mini and at times when it refreshed lots of its product lines around the same time. Zoom out \nLooking beyond a tough, and arguably unfair, year-over-year comparison, there's probably an even better reason for Apple investors not to be concerned: A zoomed-out view of Apple's quarterly gross profit margin over a period of several years shows that a gross margin of around 38% to 38.5% isn't really so abnormal for the company. Between the fourth quarter of 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple's gross margin has bounced around between about 37% and 40.1%. \nData retrieved from Apple SEC filings for quarters shown. Quarter with an asterisk is themidpoint of management's guidance. Chart source: author. \nSo Apple's expected gross profit margin during the first fiscal quarter of 2017 certainly isn't anything to be excited about. But it's also not worth worrying about. \nWhen should investors start worrying about Apple's gross profit margin? If the key metric ever begins to consistently trend downward for more than a few years, this could be more indicative of more secular negative factors, such as declining pricing power, permanently higher cost structures, or unfavorable products mix shifts, that could be here to stay. \nOf course, it doesn't hurt for investors to look into quarter-to-quarter volatility of Apple's gross profit margin, given how important it is to an investing thesis in Apple stock. As a cash cow, anything that hinders the company's ability to rake in high levels of profits is worth a closer look. \nIn this particular case, the driving force behind Apple's lower gross profit margin doesn't look like it's a problem. Indeed, I'd argue that Apple's gross profit margin today continues to support the company's impressive ability at sustaining pricing power and scale in evolving markets. \n10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "| Cool Stuff Found \nCheck out Canopy from Neat Studio, a case specifically for Apple’s Magic Keyboard. In addition to being a case, it can also serve as a stand that holds your iPad Pro (or other device) up while you’re typing. It has a synthetic canvas cover and a microfiber interior. The strap that holds it shut is leather, and it holds your Magic Keyboard using micro-suction pads. I haven’t tested it out, but if I was going to haul a Magic Keyboard around, putting it in a case makes a lot of sense. Canopy is available for pre-order for $40. The company said it’s trying to deliver before Christmas, but can’t guarantee it.",

      "text": "PR Brands strive for inclusivity with holiday marketing Apple, Delta, Amazon and Zales have all earned positive feedback for their efforts to bridge divisions among consumers and across the nation as a whole. By Beki Winchel | Posted: November 29, 2016 Tweet The 2016 presidential election has proven to be divisive, but many brand managers are attempting to bridge the chasm in their marketing and PR efforts. \nDelta endeared consumers—and pacified critics—when it banned a passenger for shouting belligerent political statements on a flight. \nThe New York Times reported : Delta Air Lines has barred a disruptive passenger who shouted pro- Donald Trump and anti- Hillary Clinton remarks at fellow passengers on a flight from Atlanta to Allentown, Pa., last week, the airline’s chief executive said on Monday. The chief executive, Edward H. Bastian, said in a memo published on Delta’s website that other travelers on the flight Nov. 22 would receive refunds for their tickets. \nThe decision came as many travelers lashed back after Delta’s crew allowed the passenger to remain on the flight. \nBastain praised Delta’s employees for their actions and admitted to the airline’s mistake, writing that Delta’s values include “treat[ing] one another with dignity and respect”: Part of being a reliable travel partner and a servant leader is acknowledging our mistakes so we can learn from them and respond more effectively in the future. Delta has apologized to the customers onboard that flight. We are also refunding those customers the cost of their tickets. I also want to make sure all of you know we have your backs. The heightened tension in our society means that now more than ever we must require civility on our planes and in our facilities. We must stay true to Delta’s core values and treat one another with dignity and respect. We also must remain committed more than ever to the safety of our customers and our crew members. We will not tolerate anything less. \n[ JUST ANNOUNCED: The 2017 Social Media Conference for PR, Marketing and Corporate Communicators at Disney World ] \nApple, Amazon and Zales call people to come together \nOther brand managers have made statements of inclusivity through seasonal ad spots. Here’s Apple’s holiday commercial: \nThe commercial is a message of togetherness, Techcrunch’s Romain Dillet wrote : If the message isn’t clear enough, Apple also wrote “Open your heart to everyone” at the end of the spot. While the holidays are a good opportunity to spend time with your families and friends, the company is saying that you should look beyond that. The divisions that led to the presidential election are probably one of the driving factors behind this ad too. We all share the same fears, the same smartphones and the same hesitation. So let’s be nice to one another. \n“We never pegged Frankenstein as someone who celebrates Christmas, but thanks to Apple's heartwarming Christmas commercial we wouldn't have it any other way,” Good Housekeeping’s Ryan Adelson wrote . \nApple wasn’t the only marketing team urging viewers to come together. \nForbes reported : Apple’s ad comes on the heels of a similar commercial released last week by Amazon . In that ad, an imam and priest come together over tea, share a hug, and show a genuine care for each other. It’s widely been viewed as a response to the anti-Muslim speech that characterized part of the 2016 Presidential campaign. After the ad’s release, Amazon AMZN -1.79% CEO Jeff Bezos said last week that he was “proud” of his team for creating a powerful ad. \nAmazon’s message is decidedly more overt than Apple’s: \nZales Jewelers’ marketers also embraced inclusivity with a nod to same-sex marriages in its recent holiday ad: \nThough Frankenstein’s monster, priests and imams proved to tug on consumers’ heartstrings, Zales’ use of a lesbian couple brought its social media and marketing teams controversy. \nAdweek reported : On its website, One Million Moms released a statement accusing Zales of attempting to \"normalize sin.\" It calls for people to boycott the brand, stop into Zales stores and share concerns with store managers, and urge Zales to pull the commercial and \"remain neutral\" in the culture wars. \"An even greater concern is that the commercial is airing when children are likely watching television,\" the group says. \"To make matters worse, this ad has aired during family viewing time such as football games and prime-time shows.\" As a result, Zales social media channels have been flooded. And no post—not even an innocuous one advertising Bulova watches—is safe from outrage. LGBTQ supporters are being vocal as well, pledging to back Zales with their wallets this holiday season. Ragan readers, how is your organization sending messages of togetherness this holiday season?",
