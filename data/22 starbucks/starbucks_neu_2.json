      "text": "Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has fallen well behind in the single-serve coffee market in the United States. The chain has about half the sales of market leader Keurig Green Mountain -- though most of its sales come from K-Cups licensed by its rival. \nKeurig, which is now part of privately owned JAB Holdings, dominates the U.S. market for pod-based coffee machines controlling \"virtually all\" of it, according to The Washington Post . That's not an insignificant market as another Post article notes that single-serve coffee -- mostly Keurig K-Cups -- accounts for about a third of all coffee sold in the U.S.\nIt's a huge market that Starbucks has a chunk of only because it licenses the right to make K-Cups from Keurig. Ultimately, due to expiring patents, it could drop the license. However, for now the company's best chance to increase its single-serve market share -- without cutting a check to its rival -- would be to expand sales of its Verismo single-serve coffee maker.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "Franklin Park will soon have a new Chipotle and T-Mobile store, which will be near a new Starbucks location that previously had been announced.\nGlazier Construction broke ground on a new development project on the southwest corner of Crown and Mannheim roads on Oct. 31. Once construction is completed, the site is expected to feature a three-unit, 6,000-square-foot commercial building.\nThe new building will sit just north of the new drive-thru Starbucks coming to 2800 Mannheim Road next year.\n\"A groundbreaking was held last week to celebrate the start of the construction of Glazier's retail development,\" Trustee Karen Special said at the board's Nov. 7 board meeting. She said Glazier recently purchased the 42,000-square-foot property from the village in order to build their retail center.\nConstruction will continue through the winter, weather permitting, and the new retail space is expected to open by next summer, Special said.\n\"[Glazier development company also] has a second village-owned site between Chase Bank and the future Starbucks site under contract for another commercial development,\" Franklin Park Village Planner Zoe Heidorn said. Additional information regarding Glazier's second development site in Franklin Park was not yet available.\nAnd in addition to the new Chipotle and T-Mobile, Special also announced that the village recently hosted a groundbreaking of two new \"industrial speculative developments\" at 10501 Seymour Ave. One of the two buildings will have 367,000 square feet of industrial space, and the other will have 106,000 square feet. As of Monday, the two proposed industrial buildings had yet to find tenants to occupy them.\nAlex V. Hernandez is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.\n ",

      "text": "How Starbucks Can Hedge Its China Strategy newsfeedback@fool.com (Asit Sharma) 27 min ago Image source : Starbucks China Instagram page. \nIn Starbucks Corporation 's (NASDAQ: SBUX) most recent quarterly earnings call on Nov. 3, CEO Howard Schultz could not have been more emphatic in describing the one business opportunity Starbucks executives obsess over more than any other: \nNot only has Starbucks cracked the code in China, consistently delivering record operating and financial performance, but our newest class of Starbucks stores in China is delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in our history in the market. And we have created partner pride and a deep emotional connection among our customers and our partners in the Starbucks brand in China that rivals any market in the world. By building the foundation of our business in China carefully, methodically, and respectfully, we are creating a growth and profit engine that will continue to accelerate for decades to come. \nI would call this just a bit hyperbolic, and yet Schultz went on to reiterate the coffee retailer's recently announced goal of more than doubling its 2,400 units in China to 5,000 stores by 2021. Starbucks opened its first store in China in 1999, so essentially, it's expecting to achieve in five years a store count that took 18 years to reach. The company will indeed be able to move this swiftly, as it plans to license about two-thirds of the future locations to local partners. \nWhile Starbucks' management team may brim with confidence, the gradual shifting of revenue concentration from the U.S. to China isn't without risks. The brand does seem to enjoy a special relationship with Chinese consumers, and yet other foreign consumer staples have seen recent market share deterioration as the Chinese begin to manifest a preference for home-grown goods. \nFurthermore, a potentially cooling Chinese economy may have implications for consumption habits in the coming years. And finally, increased Western competition is on the horizon. U.K. hospitality giant Whitbread announced plans earlier this year to double its own \"Costa Coffee\" brand store count in China to 700 stores by 2020. \nHow can Starbucks buy some protection from revenue risk as it ramps up in the world's second-largest economy? One answer lies in domestic expansion, but not in the most obvious of U.S. markets. A new way of looking at the map \nDuring the Nov. 3 earnings call, two seemingly unrelated questions from analysts illustrated the current state of U.S. growth. In the first, an analyst asked about the plethora of artisan coffee shops springing up in New York, and implicitly, about tougher competition within metropolitan areas. The analyst wondered if Starbucks' Reserve Stores, which offer what the company calls an \"elevated\" coffee experience, are providing a beachhead of sorts against this encroachment. \nSchultz's response was tinged with incredulity. He wondered if the analyst had seen the company's Seattle Roastery, or observed its Reserve stores (she had). A central learning from the Roastery, Schultz explained, is that customers are drawn to the location's espresso bar. The espresso bar is a central point \"where all the coffee is made in multiple brewing methods. That has created excitement, interest, education, romance, theater, but it also has created the opportunity for us to provide our customers with a different coffee experience and, candidly, at a higher ticket.\" The espresso bar at Atlanta's new Peachtree Reserve store. Image source : Starbucks Corporation. \nThe CEO went on to explain that the 3,000-square-foot configuration of the typical Reserve store borrows elements from the Roastery, most prominently the long espresso bar. Reserve stores then are meant to pull much more traffic and a higher ticket from customers versus traditional locations. We should infer that the company really isn't worried about a more crowded market for high-end coffee. \nThe second question, posed near the end of the call, regarded U.S. comparable-store sales, or comps, which in the previous quarter broke a 25-quarter streak of consecutive increases above 5%. The recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter now marks two consecutive quarters of 4% growth. The analyst wanted to know if this relative underperformance was due to macroeconomic headwinds, or perhaps some internal execution issues. \nIn answering, Schultz stressed that Starbucks is playing a very long game, and insisted that comps weren't the sole determinant of the company's growth. Thus, in some quarters comps would outperform, and sometimes they'd miss expectations. The response was slightly ironic, as the company rarely hesitated to emphasize its U.S. comps streak at the top of earnings releases before the miss earlier in 2016. \nAt any rate, both questions point obliquely to the same concern: How stable are growth prospects in the U.S., Starbucks' biggest market? As Starbucks locations in major cities increasingly bump up against independent competition -- and each other -- shareholders shouldn't assume that comps are destined to trend up indefinitely. \nTo support long-term domestic sales expansion, and also provide a bulwark against future downturns in China revenue, the coffee giant can look to sign leases in communities with pent-up demand for the Starbucks experience. Increasingly, the company is seeing opportunities in cities where economic growth has been stagnant or depressed, and in which a Starbucks location can help anchor renewed development. \nLost beneath the headlines on global expansion is a spate of new openings in such diverse localities as Englewood, Illinois; the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens in New York; and even Ferguson, Missouri, where riots occurred in 2014 after the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer. \nThe company has publicized its desire to open at least 15 stores in \"diverse, low- to medium-income communities\" by 2018. And management as of late seems to marvel at the potential of a foray into non-traditional markets. More versatile store types, including small, \"espresso shot\" formats and drive-throughs, provide less capital-intensive ways for the organization to foster new geographic revenue streams. \nIf Starbucks can find appreciable revenue in ever-tinier MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Areas), it may avert future oversaturation in larger American cities. This type of growth appeals to the organization's socially conscious management team, and it may also play a vital role in hedging China risk in the coming years. \n10 stocks we like better than Starbucks \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Image source : Starbucks China Instagram page.\nIn Starbucks Corporation 's (NASDAQ: SBUX) most recent quarterly earnings call on Nov. 3, CEO Howard Schultz could not have been more emphatic in describing the one business opportunity Starbucks executives obsess over more than any other:\nNot only has Starbucks cracked the code in China, consistently delivering record operating and financial performance, but our newest class of Starbucks stores in China is delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in our history in the market. And we have created partner pride and a deep emotional connection among our customers and our partners in the Starbucks brand in China that rivals any market in the world. By building the foundation of our business in China carefully, methodically, and respectfully, we are creating a growth and profit engine that will continue to accelerate for decades to come.\nI would call this just a bit hyperbolic, and yet Schultz went on to reiterate the coffee retailer's recently announced goal of more than doubling its 2,400 units in China to 5,000 stores by 2021.Starbucks opened its first store in China in 1999, so essentially, it's expecting to achieve in five years a store count that took 18 years to reach. The company will indeed be able to move this swiftly, as it plans to license about two-thirds of the future locations to local partners.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

Heres His New Pick While Starbucks' management team may brim with confidence, the gradual shifting of revenue concentration from the U.S. to China isn't without risks. The brand does seem to enjoy a special relationship with Chinese consumers, and yet other foreign consumer staples have seen recent market share deterioration as the Chinese begin to manifest a preference for home-grown goods.\nFurthermore, a potentially cooling Chinese economy may have implications for consumption habits in the coming years. And finally, increased Western competition is on the horizon. U.K. hospitality giantWhitbread announced plans earlier this year to double its own \"Costa Coffee\" brand store count in China to 700 stores by 2020.\n ",

The green cup , illustrated by Japanese artist Shogo Ota, celebrated humanity with a threaded design of more than a hundred people from all walks of life, drawn in one continuous stroke. Though simple , Ota’s vision is one that is increasingly hard to achieve in a divided world.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nA video of an encounter at a Starbucks near the University of Miami Wednesday afternoon showing a man screaming “Trump” (referring to President-elect Donald Trump) at an employee after he said it took too long for his order was gaining traction on Twitter. \nJorge de Cárdenas posted the video at about 5 p.m. with the message: “#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white “discrimination.” #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white &quot;discrimination&quot; pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy &mdash; jorge de cárdenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \nThe nearly two-minute video starts with a man, dressed in a button-down shirt with a vest and jeans and carrying what appeared to be files, asking for his money back. \n“You’re trash,” he said to the female cashier. “Cause I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost, now give me my money back. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.” \nHe then asked for the employee’s name, so he could report her to Starbucks. \nAnother man, who was also a customer, came to the employee’s defense and screamed back at the man. \n“You want to talk like that, take it outside,” he said. \nThose men then went at hit for nearly a minute. \nDe Cárdenas told the Miami New Times that he thought the two men “almost came to blows.” \nThe fight comes as the nation copes with reports of increased hate crimes after Trump was elected.

      "text": "In News by Drew Salisbury   @raisedinthecity \nDonald Trump’s victory last week has emboldened white Americans across the country who feel as though their inherent entitlement and superiority has been ignored over the last eight years. Exhibit A: This douchebag in a vest screaming at a black Starbucks employee because he feels he wasn’t respected or served fast enough or some puffed up bullshit. #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white “discrimination” pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge de cárdenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \nJorge de Cárdenas, who captured the moment on video, said the man claimed he was the victim of “anti-white discrimination” because he and his female companion had to wait too long for their order. “He started disparaging the staff,” Cárdenas told the Miami New Times . “One patron called him an asshole, so he said, ‘Fuck you, bitch.’ That’s when I started filming.” \nIn the video, the man demands his money back, invoking the president-elect, and his words make it crystal clear his rage tantrum had everything to do with the race of the employees and a belief that he was not being shown proper deference as a white man. \n“I voted for Trump!” the man yelled. “Trump! You lost, now give me my money back!” \n“What is your name?” he continued. “What is your name? I want your card. You are garbage. You are complete trash.” \nAfter being confronted by another customer who tells him to calm down and not talk to the employee like that, the man amps up his tedious machismo, inviting the other customer to “step outside” like he thinks this is “Roadhouse” or something. He finally says “Let’s go” to his blonde companion and the two exit the store. \nYou know, for all the think pieces about what propelled Trump’s victory, whether economic anxiety among the working class, or a flawed Democratic candidate in Hillary Clinton, my money’s still on white people — used to getting nearly anything they want whenever they want it — feeling “discriminated” against when they start getting treated like everybody else. And they’re ready to feel special again .",

      "text": "Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz may have spoken for many corporate CEOs when he said in a memo to employees that he was \"stunned\" about the election outcome.\nBut as the news of Trump's win gave way to planning for his transition, the reality appears to be taking hold, and corporations are navigating how to respond in the aftermath of a historic election that proved explosively divisive. On the campaign trail, Trump bashed several U.S. companies. Rhetoric about women and minorities from Trump's campaign, his supporters or his past create a minefield for corporations that have touted their diversity and inclusion policies. Some CEOs or corporate officials who have spoken out have seen calls for boycotts of their brands on social media.\n\"They're clearly not as vocal, and in many cases are laying low and waiting to see what really is generated through the Republican-controlled Congress,\" says Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown University 's McDonough School of Business.\nYet that Republican-controlled Congress is also expected to usher in pro-business changes such as tax reform, infrastructure plans and regulatory changes that have some in the business community excited, said John Engler, a former governor of Michigan and president of the Business Roundtable, which represents CEOs of the largest public corporations.\n\"The reaction from the election has simply been 'Let's get ready to take advantage of this opportunity that's presented itself,' \" Engler said in an interview. CEOs, he says, \"are interested in growth. They awakened a week ago and said, 'Wow, what was not possible is possible.' \"\nIn its aftermath, the chief response from CEOs speaking out about the election included congratulations, calls for unity and commitments to diversity. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon wrote to his employees that \"we have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside.\" Apple's Tim Cook Quote: d Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and reminded employees that \"our company is open to all ... regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\"\nYet some CEOs are also starting to publicly offer more policy-oriented remarks or even advice for Trump as the focus shifts from the results of the campaign to how he will govern. On Tuesday, General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, who had written an initial blog post to employees last week, suggested in a CNBC interview that Trump might actually find himself benefiting from trade deals.\n\"I think what the president will learn,\" Immelt said, \"is that as he travels the world, trade deals give him power…. If the president of the United States travels around the world and has nothing to offer from a standpoint of economic connection, you lose half of your negotiating power. This guy is a negotiator, he's a dealmaker. So I think let's just wait and see what he does.\"\nMeanwhile, Mark Fields, the CEO of Ford, spoke for the first time since the election outcome about the 35% tariff that Trump has discussed imposing on cars made in Mexico. Fields delivered the keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday and said, \"A tariff like that would be imposed on the entire auto sector, and that could have a huge impact on the U.S. economy,\" according to the Detroit Free-Press. During the campaign, Trump frequently called out Ford for moving its small car production from the United States to Mexico.\nStill, in a charged atmosphere with a divided electorate and an explosive social media environment, some brands are already learning how volatile the response can be to business leaders' remarks. At the DealBook conference hosted by New York Times columnist Andrew Russ Sorkin last week, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said she fielded questions from her employees who were \"all crying\" after the election. She said: \"The question that they're asking, especially those who are not white: 'Are we safe?' Women are asking: 'Are we safe?' LGBT people are asking: 'Are we safe?' I never thought I'd have had to answer those questions.\"\nNotably, she also spoke of unifying the country and acknowledging the democratic process. Yet Trump supporters on social media platforms seized on parts of her remarks, calling for a boycott of PepsiCo's products. (A PepsiCo spokesman said in an emailed statement that \"Mrs. Nooyi misspoke. She was referring to the reaction of a group of employees she spoke to who were apprehensive about the outcome of the election. She never intended to imply that all employees feel the same way. We are incredibly proud of the diverse views and backgrounds across our workforce, and we are united in our desire for a brighter future.\")\nJena McGregor writes a column analyzing leadership in the news for the Washington Post’s On Leadership section.\nPrivacy Policy",

      "text": "0 November 18, 2016 Donald Trump On Twitter: Starbucks #TrumpCup Trends As Fox News ‘OBJECTified: Donald Trump’ Special Airs Friday, November 18 [Video] Paula Mooney \nDonald Trump’s Twitter account is getting plenty of attention, not only because of a Starbucks #TrumpCup hashtag that’s trending, but also because of a one-hour Fox News special called OBJECTified: Donald Trump, which airs on Friday, November 18. As seen in the below video snippet from OBJECTified: Donald Trump, Harvey Levin of TMZ fame spoke of the impetus for the show’s concept and the very reasoning behind the OBJECTified name. \nLevin revealed he was interested in doing an OBJECTified show or a series of OBJECTified shows on a famous person — but not by sitting on a sofa and talking to folks like Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton, but by walking around their homes and looking at objects as a jumping-off point for personal conversations. Clinton said no to OBJECTified , Trump said yes to OBJECTified: Donald Trump . <noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/98NLGVK4LNM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></noscript> \nThere were a bunch of things that left Levin stunned when he interviewed President-elect Trump. The Mr. Trump revealed in OBJECTified: Donald Trump is completely different from the image that Mr. Trump has projected on the campaign trail, states Harvey. \nIn OBJECTified: Donald Trump, viewers will see the new leader of the free world speak of Mr. Trump’s fears — and portray a vulnerable side to the upcoming Commander-in-Chief. \nLevin was shocked to learn that business school wasn’t Mr. Trump’s first choice. Instead, the soon-to-be President Trump wanted to make movies and planned to attend the University of Southern California’s famous film school. However, the guy who was helping Mr. Trump get into USC needed to move to New York — and the man was so impressed with the way Mr. Trump negotiated his real estate deal, Mr. Trump ended up in real estate when the man advised President-elect Trump that movie-making was a hit-or-miss business, whereas real estate ventures seemed more secure.

As such, at least one Fox News host believed OBJECTified: Donald Trump would win big ratings for the network on Friday night — seeing as though the OBJECTified: Donald Trump special was filmed in September — prior to Mr. Trump winning the presidency, but will air soon after Mr. Trump won the presidency. Levin said he wasn’t sure how big of a ratings bonanza the OBJECTified: Donald Trump special would be for Fox News . Tonight at 10 PM ET, 7 PM PT, on @FoxNews , a one hour special on me and my life by @HarveyLevinTMZ . Enjoy! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nAs seen in the above tweet, Mr. Trump sent out a tweet about the OBJECTified: Donald Trump special airing about his life to his Twitter followers. \nThat tweet quickly gained nearly 10,000 Twitter likes and more than 3,300 retweets in about 45 minutes for the 45th President of the U.S. Trump Tower [Image by Bebeto Matthews/AP Images] \nIn the OBJECTified: Donald Trump special Mr. Trump will speak about his father — as seen in the above video — and how he sent his son to military boarding school in order to shape him up and give him discipline. \nMeanwhile, “Operation #TrumpCup” is also trending on Twitter, as seen in the below popular tweet. \n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump \n2) If they refuse take video \nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 \nThe tweet urged folks to go to Starbucks and tell the baristas therein that his or her name is Trump — and if they refuse (what exactly they might be denied is not clear), to film video of the incident. \nWith a photo of a Starbucks red Christmas cup with Trump written on it, the tweet has gone viral. \nApparently, the melee started because of the below video of a Starbucks customer allegedly getting refused when he asked for the name Trump to be written on his cup. <noscript><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i4rofKlCHfE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></noscript> \nMasks of President-elect Trump in Japan, at hot-selling item, can be seen above. \n[Featured Image by Eugene Hoshiko/AP Images]",

      "text": "Welcome to Donald Trump's America?\nEarlier this week, we shared the video of a displeased Starbucks patron who ranted and raved about how his bad service was a product of anti-white discrimination .\nAnd now we have the unfortunate job of reporting on an even more disturbing story...\n\nA middle school teacher in Baltimore was fired from her job this week after cellphone footage was taken of her absolutely berating her students in class.\nThe teacher is white, a majority of her students were black and she got very, very mad at them for reasons that most definitely do NOT justify what she said.\n“Leave! Get out of my class,” we hear her screaming in the video below, as she shoves a boy out of the room at Harlem Park Elementary/Middle School.\n“You’re idiots!” she adds, prior to warning the kids that “if you don’t get an education you will wind up being a punk ass n---er who is gonna get shot.”\nYup, she really did say that.\nShe also called her students “stupid” during her one-minute rant, but that was almost harmless compared to everything else.\nThe teacher's name has been withheld, but we can confirm that she's been fired.\nWatch her rant below and try not to lose faith in all of humanity as you do:\n",

      "text": "Comments \nStarbucks cups are once again at the heart of an enormously petty and contrived grievance campaign by conservatives. Apparently upset that Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump supporters have taken to “protesting” by writing TRUMP on all of their Starbucks cups. \nWhile the stereotype of Trump supporters being uneducated and…on the less intellectually coherent side of things isn’t a particularly productive one, it must be said that it’s hard to see how purchasing products to scrawl a name on it is an effective protest. \nThe protest began after a Trump fan in Florida (of course) threw a tantrum after his order took longer than he thought it should have and thought he was being punished for being a Trump fan, because nothing is apparently more sensitive than a white conservative’s sense of oppression. \nIn desperate need of a safe space, Trump fans launched “Operation Trump Cup” (#TrumpCup) and are posting pictures of themselves with the cups with Trump written on them. What they are trying to accomplish is still unclear. \nWhat they have achieved is ruthless mocking on social media. Trump Fans DESTROY Company By Giving It Money https://t.co/q3VSp4RRfa \n— Simon Maloy (@SimonMaloy) November 18, 2016 Shhhh, stop making fun of the people participating in #TrumpCup . Maybe they’ll start doing the same thing with Planned Parenthood.",

      "text": "yesterday Tell Starbucks to Suck It & Make Your Own Flavored Cold Brews \nStarbucks last big hit was definitely their Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew , which became a permanent menu item—not just a summer fling—on May 31, 2016. It's the perfect blend of 20-hour cold brew and vanilla sweet cream; The result not only tastes great, but the cream makes is visually mesmerizing as it floats down through the brew. \nThey even have a newer holiday version that's called Spiced Sweet Cream Cold Brew , which is basically the exact same thing as the Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, only with added \"mulling spice syrup,\" as they call it. \nOnly problem is, these flavored cold brews costs a pretty penny, and they're really just a tease to bigger and better cold brew flavors. There's a whole world of tasty possibilities out there, whether they're simple additions after you make your cold brew or more intense flavors you use infuse into the cold-brew process. We've rounded up our favorites below, but feel free to experiment (and reveal your newfound secrets to us!). \nDon't Miss: Hot vs. Cold Brew Coffee: Which One Is Better for You? 1. Vanilla Sweet Cream (Addition) \nLet's get this one out of the way real quick. If you really can't get enough of Starbucks' signature Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew but don't want to pay the hefty price, then just make it yourself. We've got a great set of instructions to help you replicate it at a fraction of the cost. If you want to make it winter holidays-style, see #3 below for more additions. Image by Jessica Bose/ Food Hacks Daily 2. Liquor... Any Type Works (Addition or Infusion) \nCoffee and booze is a match made in heaven, so obviously any combination of cold brew and liquor would be near the top of our list. It may not be the best way to start your morning, but it's pretty much irresistible for any other time of day. \nYou could simply add some Frangelico liqueur to your cold brew like Averie Sunshine does , and top it off with some chocolate syrup, dark chocolate shavings, and whipped cream for a sweet, boozy treat. Image by Averie Sunshine/ Averie Cooks \nDon't Miss: \n5 Reasons Why You Should Never Throw Out Used Coffee Grounds \nOr you can make a cold-brewed version of Irish coffee, where you just swap out the traditional hot coffee with your cold brew. Take it a step further by cold-brewing your coffee in Irish whiskey for one helluva serious kick. Just add the sugar and cream afterward as usual. \nOn that note, you can also make some homemade Kahlua using the cold-brew process . Instead of water, sub in either vodka or Scotch whisky, then cold brew for about 14 hours. Add the vanilla and sugar (or other sweetener ) afterward. \nReally, any alcohol (or alcohol combo) could be good for your cold brew. And don't be afraid to use cheap booze, either. With the coffee and other add-ins, you'd never be able to taste the difference between the okay and high-end stuff. 3. Spices.. Get Creative! (Infusion) \nAlcohol isn't the only way to make your cold brew more exciting. Something as simple as cinnamon can really kick things up a notch. Emma from A Beautiful Mess adds it to most of of her cold brews , and recommends trying out ginger, nutmeg, and cloves as well, or any combination thereof. Experiment with various spices, or base it around the seasons, until you've come up with some flavor profiles that excite your tongue with every sip. \nDon't Miss: Revolutionize Your Coffee Game with These Cold Brew Hacks 4. Scandinavian Flavors (Infusion) \nFood52 user ErinH takes her cold brew Scandinavian-style, including almond extract, fennel seeds, and white sugar in the cold-brewing process. Then she tops off the finished product with milk or cream. The result is nothing short of incredible, or, as ErinH describes, so good you'll \"die of happiness.\" With some experimenting from the above section, you may have been able to reach this wonderful drink yourself, but why work hard when we can just tell you? Image by ErinH/ Food52 \nDon't Miss: How to Make Homemade Flavored Extracts for Baking & Cooking 5. Fruit... Whatever You Like with Coffee (Infusion) \nIf you've never considered adding fruit to your cold brew, you're missing out on a whole world of sensationally sweet flavor. Danguole at 10th Kitchen infused her cold brew with the sweet acidity of citrus just by adding the zest of two oranges along with five crushed cardamom pods for a little extra spice. Let the drink sit for as long as 24 hours; stir, filter, and then pour to enjoy. Image by Danguole Lekaviciute/ 10th Kitchen \nDon't think you'll like the orange flavor? Try pomegranate then. Just steep the pomegranate seeds when making your cold brew, then filter them out and enjoy a slightly tart-sweet pomegranate taste. \nDon't Miss: DIY Grenadine Syrup Will Change How You Make Cocktails \nIf you're a fan of Arnold Palmers, the iconic drink that combines iced tea with lemonade , then you've got to try the \"Laura Palmer,\" a flavored cold brew popularized by Supercrown Coffee Roasters in Brooklyn, NY. It's named after the troublesome \"Twin Peaks\" character, if you didn't figure that out already, and Food52's Samantha Weiss Hill shares detailed instructions on how to recreate it . Image by supercrowncoffee/ Instagram 6. Vanilla Honey (Addition) \nIf vanilla is the driving point behind your Starbucks cold brew obsession, try a different take by substituting the vanilla sweet cream with vanilla honey instead, as Chelsea of Port and Fin does with her vanilla-honey cold brew . Just make your cold brew, add the vanilla-honey mixture and whatever milk you'd like, and let Starbucks fade from your memory. Image by Chelsea/ Port and Finn 7. Pumpkin & Dates (Addition) \nStill jonesing from Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte ? Well, you can make the next best thing thanks to Vanessa Porter of Velvet Bird. She created a cold brew that adds syrup made of pumpkin purée, dates, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla . It's the perfect cold brew to drink when you're missing those autumn-time breezes.

(@America_1st_) November 18, 2016 \nThis video was posted a day before the election, but is just now going viral. \nIt shows a man requesting to have the name “Trump” written on his cup at Starbucks. \nFor those who don’t know, when you order at Starbucks you give them and the barista shouts it out when your drink is ready. People have fun with this sometimes, and give funny names for the barista to shout. Starbucks has encouraged people to do this as a marketing gimmick. \nGetting them to call-out “Trump” was pre-election trolling effort promoted on Twitter. \n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump \n2) If they refuse take video \nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 \nThough the man filming the video claims to have called the corporate office and confirmed that he is allowed to give any name he wants, the manager was not having it. Along with refusing the gentleman service, he called the police. \nThis is obviously difficult to grasp. There was a black female and a fat white male also working who appeared to approve of the managers decision to bring law enforcement into this coffee cup situation. The fat one is seen making the call. \nDid he actually call 911, I wonder? \nThat is probably what happened. \nTry for a moment to imagine being so far separated from reality that you believe a person is breaking the law by talking about Donald Trump. Personally, I cannot comprehend this fully after watching the video, and will have to spend some hours pondering what it must be like to live inside of such a mind as this.",

      "text": "For Bon Appetit , by Alex Beggs.\nCourtesy of Starbucks There’s nothing like that moment when the barista at Starbucks calls out something close to your name (Alice?! Alice?!), and you take your skinny vanilla latte over to the milk station and think to yourself: something’s missing. There’s cinnamon, 14 types of not-sugar, that other spice that’s never labeled, and all those lids . But you know what would really make this vanilla latte SHINE and GLOW and WARM YOU UP? Jameson. That’s what.\nBecause it’s Halloween and this is just the occasion when we need a little something in our cardboard cup as we haul mini-Frankensteins all over town in freezing winds. Other great occasions? The movies. Long train rides. Waiting in lines for things. Parent-teacher conferences. Up to you!!\nSo we asked Matt Ragan , beverage director of Dallas’s Victor Tangos , to help us doctor up our favorite Starbucks orders with hard alcohol — if you’re under 21, stop reading! But now you’re probably reading it just to spite me. Well, everyone drink responsibly.\nCourtesy of Starbucks Drink: Pumpkin Spice Latte Pair with: 1 oz Bourbon, dash of Angostura bitters, ¼ oz Allspice Dram I’m pretty sure not spiking every PSL with Bourbon or aged rum is somehow against the Patriot Act.\nCourtesy of Starbucks Drink: Chile mocha Pair with: ¾ oz Patron Café, ¾ oz Ancho Reyes Hotter than Ina Garten's texts to Jeffrey. A little spicy, loads of baking spices and covered in chocolate.\nCourtesy of Starbucks Drink: Cool Lime Refresher Pair with: 1 oz Hendrick’s Gin, ¾ oz Aperol + Hard Ginger Ale This screams for the cucumber notes of Hendrick’s Gin, a little Aperol for the citrus/grapefruit notes, and top it all off with some hard ginger ale. These flavors are so good together, only dolphin haters wouldn’t like it.\nCourtesy of Starbucks Drink: Oprah Chai Tea Latte Pair with: ¾ oz rum (Mount Gay Black Barrel Rum), ¾ oz Averna This delicious little spiked diddy tastes like getting a free car just for showing up, wrapped in a warm hug, nestled next to a healthy serving of inspiring Quote: s, and topped with a heaping mound of feminist empowerment.\nDrink: Skinny Vanilla Latte Pair with: Shot of Jameson, shot of Bailey’s Can I state the obvious? If I can, then pair this with a double-shot of air and two back-to-back SoulCycle sessions. But if it’s a cheat day, go big with a shot of Jameson and Bailey’s.\nDrink: Caramel Macchiato Pair with: 1 ½ oz Apple Brandy It’s a scientific fact that caramel and apple gives you caramel-covered apples. This is like a carnival in your mouth, without the creepy clowns.\nCourtesy of Starbucks Drink: Smoked Butterscotch Steamer [Editor's note: This is a real drink] Pair with: Shot of scotch (Glenfiddich 15 year Sherry Cask), dash of Sherry (Pedro Ximenez Sherry) Spike this tragically-named bevy with a shot of Glenfiddich and sherry. Then hop on your broomstick and get back to Hogwarts.\nCourtesy of Starbucks Drink: Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato Pair with: Shot of pineapple-flavored rum (Plantation Stiggins Fancy Aged Pineapple Rum) OMG. FML. Like these two are like SO good together. This combo is sure to appease the inner hash-tagging Valley Girl in all of us. #totesamazeballs\nDrink: Double Espresso Pair with: ¾ oz coffee liqueur, ½ Crème de Cacao, dash of bitters (Bittermen’s Tiki Bitters) + 1 sugar cube Nothing more classic than coffee, chocolate, and baking spice.\nOr, if your Starbucks has Starbucks Evenings, you could just order the Espresso Cloud™ IPA —a coffee + beer creation.\nMore from Bon Appetit :\n32 Fall-Spiced Recipes You'll Be Making All Season\nWhen Life Hands You Lemons, Make These Lemon Desserts\nNo-Cook Pasta Sauces You Should Have Up Your Sleeve at All Times\n35 Make-Ahead Breakfasts so You Can Sleep in and Eat Well All Week\nOur 50 Favorite Weeknight Dinners\n24 Recipes Everyone Should Know How to Cook\nAlso on HuffPost Starbucks Holiday Drinks In Order Of Hype Starbucks Holiday Drinks In Order Of Hype 1 of 8 Toffee Nut Latte The rich, buttery flavour of sweet toffee is combined with the warmth of toasted nuts and blended with our smooth espresso and velvety steamed milk; topped with whipped cream and Toffee Nut Sprinkles.\nHaven't heard of this holiday drink?

      "text": "GOP voters force baristas to shout out Donald’s name Trump supporters are posting pictures of Starbucks coffee with the hashtag #TrumpCup to protest discrimination against Republicans Trump supporters have been telling baristas their name is ‘Trump’ The baristas then must write it on the cup and shout it out loud when ready Some have noted that the protest is only giving Starbucks more money However, those behind the protest say the point is to cause a statement (Daily Mail) – Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump who feel there has been a backlash against Republicans since his election are taking their protest to the percolators. \nRepublicans are ordering their coffee and stating their name is ‘Trump’ so baristas will have to shout the last name of the president-elect when their drink is ready. \nSPECIAL: Calls for Trump’s assassination. Horrific threats to do violent harm to Melania. Obama and the liberal lunatics are not going to go quietly. They are not accepting the election results and will do ANYTHING to get their way. Will you help us stop what is coming next with a donation? \nThe protest is allegedly against people ‘discriminating against Republicans’ and was started by Trump supporter and actor Scott Baio, according to Yahoo News. \nA hashtag #TrumpCup began to circulate on Twitter and a video of a barista calling the police after a man asked for Trump’s name to be written on his cup went viral, causing the phenomenon to increase. \nAnother video of a man shouting ‘Trump’ at a barista when he felt his drink order was taking too long added fuel to the fire. \nNow, dozens of people are taking pictures of their Starbucks drink with the name ‘Trump’ written on it in protest of the alleged discrimination. \nBut many have pointed out the protest is actually just padding the wallets of Starbucks and their CEO Howard Schultz, who openly backed Hillary Clinton. \nSome have said the act is less of a protest and more of a statement – but either way, it’s a controversy that hasn’t seemed to hurt the coffee giant financially. \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3953728/Trump-supporters-order-TrumpCups-Starbucks-protest-against-Republican-discrimination.html Bash Obama on Facebook?

      "text": "Police searched Sunday for a man who stabbed another man in the arm outside of a Starbucks coffee shop in Vancouver’s Uptown Village.\nTwo transient men were fighting around 7:30 a.m. at 2420 Main St. when one of them lunged at the other with what looked like a screwdriver, stabbing him with it, Vancouver Police Department Officer Brian Schaffer said. The man who was stabbed, 31-year-old Gregory M. Tornholm, was treated for his injuries at a local hospital, Schaffer said.\nThe man who injured Tornholm fled the scene and had not been found by police as of Sunday afternoon. Police were working to identify the suspect, Schaffer said.\nAfter Tornholm was discharged from the hospital, he was booked into the Clark County Jail on a warrant, Schaffer said.\n",

      "text": "Starbucks ( SBUX ) may have just given its legion of caffeine addicts a nice, early holiday gift -- another price increase.\nIt's not too hard to figure out why Starbucks may have lifted prices again. For starters, sales growth has slowed in the U.S., so a price increase would go a long way to pumping up sales.\nAccording to receipts for a venti redeye coffee with one shot of expresso from several New York City Starbucks locations starting on Nov. 17, we paid $5.17, a 6.8% increase from the week prior. As late as Nov. 14, the same drink cost $4.84. \"Prices on all the coffee, frappucinos, everything went up after Election Day,\" said a barista TheStreet spoke with about the higher price for our morning java.\nA spokeswoman for Starbucks didn't respond to an email asking if the company raised prices in New York City or elsewhere.\nStarbucks already hiked drink prices at many of its U.S. stores by as much as 30 cents in July, citing higher coffee costs and rising operating expenses. Customers were forced to pay 10 cents to 20 cents more for certain sizes of brewed coffee, and 10 cents to 30 cents more on espresso beverages and tea lattes. Prior to what looks to be a post Election Day price increase, Starbucks has typically raised prices on select beverages between 5 cents and 20 cents a year.\nStarbucks U.S. same-store sales in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 2 rose 4%, matching a disappointing 4% growth rate in the third quarter.",

      "text": "By Jose Mari Franz Teves Nov 21, 2016 10:50 AM EST An alleged Starbucks employee have shared leaks on the upcoming release date of Pokemon generation 2 on Reddit, wherein he said that the upcoming game will be eyeing a December 7 release. Advertisement Earlier this November, we have already learned that 100 new Pokémon from Generation 2 has been added to Pokémon Go. Though we weren't able to catch them, their names did appear in the code, which could only mean that an upcoming update is already right around the corner. Although Niantic has yet to give any official announcements on the addition of new Pokémon to the game, an internal memo from Starbucks might have just given away the official release date. Advertisement Just last Thursday, an alleged Starbucks employee took to the Pokémon Go subreddit to share what he claims is an internal memo from corporate which reveals a brand new marketing campaign that equates with the release of Pokeman Version 2. The leaked image that contains the information regarding the launch has already been spread entirely online. Issues with the shared letter As numerous Redditors have already pointed out, there are quite a few major issues that go along with this letter. Not only is there any proof that it actually came from Starbucks. But there is a very critical typo in the form of \" Pokeman, \" which appears three times. Along with the image, the source has included a message that insists that the photo is legitimately coming from Starbucks and that he's not making anything up. Advertisement The message and photo removed The message and the leaked image have since been deleted but some Redditors and other analysts say that they have been able to verify the validity of the email. However, they weren't able to confirm the line about Pokémon Go was there originally. Expect something big on December 7 Fans are not going to get hyped just yet, especially considering how shady the source of the leak is, but don't be surprised if some new Pokémon start popping up in Pokémon GO around the 7 th of December. If that is truly the release date, Niantic will most likely make an official announcement beforehand. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. ",

Starbucks has some tips for doing the holidays right (and not going totally overboard), because seriously fall and winter is the best time for treats and delicious beverages. So if you want to enjoy your fave seasonal beverages while skipping some calories , we’ve GOT YOU.\nBetween these tips, amazing holiday beverages Starbucks announced this month , and the red cups returning , they’re spoiling us! (And we love it.)\nThe sugary toppings for most of these beverages can save you some serious caloric intake, so baristas recommend either cutting back or skipping them completely:\n1. Ask for less pumps of syrup in your drink — less sugar and less calories! \n2. Ask your barista for only a little whip to top of your drink, or even skip the whip. \n3. Find out if your espresso or Frappucino-blended drink can be made “light” or “skinny,” which means it’s made with nonfat milk and doesn’t have whipped cream on top. \nNew and all spiced up for the holidays!

More Bay Area News Westfield mall in SF evacuated briefly after small fire \nWitnesses reported a woman struggling with a man, identified as Stewart, over her laptop, officials said. The suspected robber allegedly ripped the laptop away from the victim and headed for the exit, police said. \nAs Stewart attempted to run out of the establishment, a patron blocked the door, police said. Stewart pulled a gun and the patron moved away from the door, police said. \nThe Starbucks patron alerted police that Stewart jumped into a waiting vehicle, driven by a man later identified as Haliburton, and went east on Ashby Avenue, said Sgt.

      "text": "November 22, 2016 Customer Experience Love Is in the Air for Starbucks Customers Share Instagram Downloads \nIt’s a symbolic gesture of love and commitment known the world over. When someone gets down on one knee in front of another, there’s little doubt what will come next. \nFor two hopeful romantics, their local Starbucks stores were the perfect backdrops for marriage proposals and Starbucks partners (employees) played a role in the customers' declarations of love. ‘I saw the most beautiful girl I had ever seen at Starbucks’ \nIt was August 24, 2011. Jordan Yanco was on a coffee run to get his coworker a skinny latte when he encountered his future wife. \n“I saw the most beautiful girl I had ever seen at Starbucks,” said Yanco, a New York City-based dialect coach for actors and English as a second language (ESL) speakers. “I knew that if I didn’t say something, she would disappear and I would never see her again.” \nYanco broke the ice by complimenting Nadia Udeshi on her colorful pedicure and kept the conversation going as they waited for their beverages. \n“We discovered that we had similar interests,” he said. “Before leaving Starbucks that day, we had scheduled our first date.” \nYanco and Udeshi grew close over the next several years. They frequented Starbucks locations across the city, including the location where they first met near the Grand Central Terminal. When Yanco decided it was time to ask for Udeshi’s hand in marriage, he knew that Starbucks had to be involved. \n“I returned to the Starbucks where we first met and asked one of the baristas to help with the proposal to make this an unforgettable moment for Nadia,” Yanco said. \n“I have seen a lot of customers meet for the first time in my store, but I’ve never seen a proposal,” said Willie Almonte, Starbucks shift supervisor. “I was really excited and proud to have a chance to help Jordan.” \nYanco met with Almonte on four separate occasions to devise a plan. On September 1, they put it into action. \n“I took Nadia out for a long dinner not too far from the store,” said Yanco. “To my complete surprise, she suggested that we go shopping after dinner and wanted to go to Starbucks first because she was thirsty. It was amazing how my plan just fell into place.” \nAfter arriving at Starbucks and ordering her drink, Udeshi received a special beverage that Almonte created, which simply included a note attached to a tea bag string in a cup. The note had the words “open me” on the outside and “look down” on the inside. As Udeshi followed these directions, Yanco got down on one knee and recalled saying, “It all started with your feet [referring back to his opening line about her pedicure when they first met] and here I am now. I want to be your husband and spend the rest of my life with you.” \nThe two will get married in May 2018. They have already started thinking of ways to incorporate Starbucks into their nuptials, such as serving Starbucks coffee with the wedding cake. \n“Starbucks affects us every time we see one of the company’s stores,” said Yanco. “We can’t walk by a Starbucks without thinking about that other wonderful layer. It’s not only the place where we met, but it’s now the place where we started living the rest of our lives together.” ‘Proposing at Starbucks was a no brainer’ \nAfter meeting online and having phone conversations for three straight weeks, Dwight Thomas, Jr. and TaShauna Wardsworth agreed to meet for the first time at a Starbucks in Texas. \nThomas, an industrial networks architect, made the one-hour drive from Sugar Land to Tomball every weekend to see Wardsworth after that first date. It didn’t take long for Thomas to decide that he wanted to marry her and Starbucks was the perfect location to pop the question. \n“Proposing at Starbucks was a no-brainer,” he said. “I wanted it to be special and different. Starbucks is the place where we met and now visit every Sunday on our way to church.” \nThomas spoke with Sam Compton, manager of the Starbucks he visits with Wardsworth, and asked for help with the proposal. \n“I was honored to have a part in such a great love story. Starbucks really is a place that brings people together,” said Compton. “I worked with Dwight for a week to plan this memorable moment and all of the baristas in the store came together to make the night truly magical.” \nThomas has family night with Wardsworth and her mother every other week, so he used this occasion as a cover for his big plan. On October 28, the trio headed to the movies, but not without stopping at Starbucks first. \n“Shaun fussed with me because I was driving a different route to the movie,” said Thomas. “She fought me every step of the way until we got to Starbucks and she saw what was going on. Then she was blown away.” \nThomas invited an acoustic guitarist and saxophone player to serenade his soon-to-be-bride with one of their favorite songs. He then got on one knee and asked Wardsworth to be his wife. After she said yes, each barista in the store presented her with a long-stem pink rose. \n“I didn’t know how it would actually look, I only had a vision,” said Thomas. “Proposing at Starbucks with special music and family surpassed anything I could have imagined.” \nThe wedding will take place in April 2017. Thomas is still reliving the moment he proposed to Wardsworth and has advice for those who are thinking about their own engagement. \n“Dare to be different. It doesn’t have to be a traditional proposal,” he said. “I chose to take some of our favorite things and put them together and I came up with something awesome.” \nFor more information on this news release, contact Related News",

      "text": "Starbucks fans, you won’t be pleased about this devastating news Stephanie Hallett More The last thing you want to hear during the most expensive time of year is that your favorite coffee drink is going up in price, but that’s the sad news we have to deliver today from Starbucks . The company quietly raised prices on many of its cold beverages and baked goods on November 10th by between $0.10 and $0.30, jacking up the average customer’s bill by about 0.5%. The company last raised prices in July , increasing the cost of select sizes of brewed coffee by $0.10 to $0.20, and the price of espresso and tea latte drinks by between $0.10 and $0.30. This is the fourth time in three years that Starbucks has raised its prices, likely because of lower-than-expected sales growth . A rep for Starbucks explained the rationale for raising prices to Consumerist, saying, “We continually evaluate pricing on a product-by-product and market-by-market basis in our stores in order to balance our business needs while continuing to provide value to our loyal customers and to attract new customers.” While price hikes suck for consumers, the upside is that Starbucks employees recently got a raise of at least 5% nationwide; with more than 150,000 employees working in 7,670 stores, that raise will surely help a lot of individuals and families — especially during the holiday season. So let’s try to look on that bright side, shall we?",

      "title": "This Is How Starbucks Baristas Really Feel About Customers Coming in on Thanksgiving Day",
      "text": "If you've ever run into Starbucks on Thanksgiving before the long car ride to your family dinner, you might have said something like, \"Stinks you have to work today,\" to the barista. How do those comments — and working on Thanksgiving — actually make baristas feel?\nTo find out, Reddit user JustinitsuJ created a thread asking, \"As a customer, how much of an a-hole am I for coming in on Thanksgiving?\" He said that he typically likes to avoid Starbucks on Thanksgiving because he doesn't agree with baristas having to work that day.\n But last year, even though he felt bad, he couldn't resist going to the coffee chain. He asked baristas,\"What are your thoughts on someone who visits on Thanksgiving?\" Their answers will surprise you:\n1. \"I'm getting paid time-and-a-half, so I'm good. We're open whether you show up or not. Come in and share a smile and a cup of joe. \" — MaidenLocks\n2. \" For me (and my family) any holiday is basically the same as any other day, even the family-oriented ones. The only thing that would make me hate someone for wanting a latte on a holiday is if they were an asshole . And then it would be because they're an asshole.\" — Shryxer\n3. \"Dude, you're never a dick for coming in. Please, please come to Starbucks. The only time I complain about customers is when there's a mismanagement of expectations during parts of the day. Even then, your store will probably be dead so hop on in.\" — Tetsuo9000\n4. \" I love getting to spend the first half of the day with my work family (we always bring in food and goodies to share with everyone) and then have plenty of time for the second half of the day to spend with my family for dinner. Also, the customers that come in are always (most of the time) really lovely. It feels good to be able to wish a happy Thanksgiving to complete strangers and vice versa .\" — Fortheloveofitt\n5. \" If we're open, you're not a dick! It's the customers that come in during peak and complain they are in a hurry and have to get back to their families. Like ... do you realize the barista you're complaining to is working on Thanksgiving and would love to have the day off to be with their family too?\" — Shryxer\n6. \"I don't really hold it against anyone but I do appreciate the people who make a point of staying home as well as the customers who recognize that I may not want to be there and throw in an extra thank you. \" — Vulcantrash\n7. \"I would suggest that you as a customer continue to be nice and polite and tip a little something if you're coming in on Thanksgiving.\" — Thelieofsleep\nThe takeaway: Don't feel guilty about going into Starbucks on Thanksgiving because they're open, after all. If you do go in, don't pity the barista — just be even nicer than usual. ~Give thanks~.\nFor more food news and magical recipes, follow Cosmo Bites on Facebook !\nFollow Danielle on Instagram and Twitter .\n ",

Anything at Starbucks with a Chirstian bent makes them uneasy, even if they identify themselves as Christians. However, if Starbucks offered a special “Mohammed blend” for Ramadan, the libtards would gulp it up. 5 posted on 11/25/2016 4:38:53 AM PST by Atticus To: markomalley Comment from the remarks at the article: \"Starbucks does not have a red nativity themed cup this year.

      "text": "All the new Starbucks holiday menu items are making us hungry Gina Florio More It’s that jolly time of the year when you eat turkey, see family, and dream of the Starbucks holiday menu . We couldn’t help but get excited when we saw the red snowflake-drenched holiday cup from the Starbucks camp , but now we need some grub to go along with it. Well, worry on more. That red cup is about to have some company. There are some yummy new sandwiches coming up at your nearest Starbucks , like the All the Trimmings Breakfast Sandwich that includes maple-glazed ham, apple sausage, apple-sage stuffing, and a maple glaze, all shoved between a gloriously buttery bun. Don’t get too excited, though, because this one is only available in Florida, Seattle, and parts of California. The other brand new sammie is the Carved Ham, Egg, and Swiss Breakfast Sandwich, which comes on a croissant, and you should have no trouble finding that around the country. If you’re looking for something more familiar, you can also get your paws on a traditional Holiday Turkey and Stuffing Panini. Now for the sweets. Expect to munch on some snowman cookies, holiday ugly sweater cookies, and the kitschy cake pops, of course. If you haven’t tried the cranberry bliss bar yet, put that on the top of your priority list, because it goes smashingly well with any of the Starbucks holiday-themed lattes . Better hurry up, because you don’t want to wait for ages in line only to find out your favorite Starbucks holiday snacks have already been gobbled up.",

      "text": "When is Pokemon Go Generation 2 being released? Leaked Starbucks email suggests early December! Nov. 27, 2016 | 10:10 pm | Author : Asa Hawks | Categories : Video Games \nUpon its release less than five months ago, the augmented reality geolocation video game Pokémon Go became a worldwide phenomenon as the mobile app quickly shattered numerous records, including becoming the fastest app to ever to reach $500 million in revenue — beating out Candy Crush Saga by more than 135 days! \nHoping to keep as many of its millions of users playing as possible, the app’s creators at Niantic Labs have continued to update the app and create special events, including a week-long Halloween themed event which rewarded double candy (of course) and saw a HUGE increase in the number of spooky Pokémon popping up. (Niantic reportedly made $200 million from their Spookémon event.) \nCurrently, Pokémon Go users are enjoying a Thanksgiving event that is rewarding players with double experience points and double stardust while also introducing one of the last Pokemon from Generation 1 to not make an appearance yet — the much bally-hooed Ditto! (Ditto is a shape-shifting Pokémon and he disguises himself as other Pokémon until he is caught, at which point he reveals himself.) \nWith the addition of Ditto to the game, that only leaves the “Legendaries” (Zapdos, Articuno, Moltres, Mew and Mewtwo) to round out the complete list of 153 Pokémon originally available in Generation 1. That, of course, has many fans wondering when Pokémon Go will introduce Generation 2, which features 100 new Pokemon, including additional evolutions and pre-evolutions for some Pokémon already available in Generation 1. \nThat question may have been answered earlier this month thanks to an alleged corporate email shred by a Starbucks employee on reddit which suggests Pokémon Go will be introducing Generation 2 on December 7! \nHere is a photo of the “leaked” Starbucks Pokémon Go Generation 2 email — click to enlarge: \nTh redditor who posted the image shared this comment: \nI work at Starbucks and this is one of the most recent updates we received from corporate. Now, it’s hard to say whether or not this specifically refers to Generation 2 (although what else could it mean?), whether or not Starbucks and Niantic are partnered up, or if this will even be pushed out on the date specified (things don’t always go to plan). However, it all makes sense to me, but this would be a huge update. Based on the description of the event, it would require Niantic to put a Pokestop at every Starbucks. Lastly, I realize this may seem strange, especially with the “Pokeman”, but it’s a real email and I can send proof to the mods if required. Regardless, this isn’t anything concrete and pretty vague, and no other information was given to us. As a huge fan of Pokemon and Pokemon Go, I couldn’t NOT share the news with everyone. Fingers crossed that it’s gonna happen! \nSome commenters pointed at the “Pokeman” misspelling as a reason to discredit the validity of the email, but I completely agree with many folks who point out that it is a common mistake and, if anything, makes the email even more believable. (I know I was still spelling it “Pokeman” after I had been playing the game for a week lol.) \nThe Silph Road is reddit’s premiere group of Pokémon Go researchers and they shared an update soon after the email was posted suggesting that there was no evidence to think it was fake. “The email appears, on our inspection, to be a legitimate Starbucks communication,” Silph Executive DRONPES wrote, “though the last line (about ‘Pokeman version 2’) may still have been altered or added after the fact.” \nDRONPES added: \nNotably, there are rumors that leaks like this have soured deals still in progress for Niantic in the past, so we aren’t sure what the fallout of a leak like this will be. Surely, Starbucks would have purchased a promotional package and would have wanted to get some mileage out of the announcement, intending to make it newsworthy and build hype for the marketing drive. \nEither way, it could potentially be more evidence that Niantic is moving forward quickly towards Gen 2. December may just be a crazy few weeks! \nAnother redditor did a little research in an attempt to read some of the other words behind the main text in the email. “I´ve played with the rest of the letter and could read some of the other text behind but it was only boring stuff about deliverys and refrigerator stuff,” revealed NatalsLegacy. (Sounds like legitimate, boring company communication to me.) \nThe original poster of the email has since deleted his/her account, but was a member of reddit for four years prior to the posting. (It would make sense that he/she would do that because this is a pretty big deal and could actually lead to getting fired.) \nAs far as the other promotions listed in the email, the $5 Groupon deal was already in effect at the time. The $3 Facebook deal on holiday drinks was a day away and did apparently happen . I couldn’t find anything yet on the Verizon $50 eGift card promotion that will reportedly begin on December 2. \nIt’s interesting to note that the email states that “Lures will be dropped at all SBUX stores.” Obviously, not all Starbucks stores are currently Pokestops, so its unclear if Niantic will make that change (if the email is legit). You may recall a similar partnership between Niantic and McDonald’s for the launch of Pokémon Go in Japan. \nThe email also mentions a Pokémon Frappuccino! I can’t imagine all the possibilities if they open the door to Pokémon-themed Starbucks drinks! Actually, I can imagine some of the possibilities \nAvailable soon at Omastarbucks:",

      "text": "By: Starbucks via Business Wire News Releases   07:00 AM EST King County Emergency Shelter Campaign for Homeless Families Gets More Than $3 Million Boost from Starbucks, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft, Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Key Bank Foundation With family homelessness at a crisis point, Seattle-area business leaders, including Starbucks, are joining together to raise more than $3 million to ensure “No Child Sleeps Outside.” \nThe Starbucks Foundation and Schultz Family Foundation announced today their support of the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign by Mary’s Place. Together with other businesses, they are joining an unprecedented effort to mobilize the community, and contributing over $3 million to provide safe emergency shelter for the estimated 500 unsheltered families in King County, including hundreds of children. The campaign also has the support of companies like Microsoft Corp., Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, Seattle Mariners, as well as the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Seattle Association, which together represent thousands of Seattle businesses. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161129005572/en/ \nWith family homelessness at a crisis point, King County’s business leaders are joining an unprecedented employer-led effort to raise more than $3 million to ensure “No Child Sleeps Outside” (Photo: Business Wire) \nFollowing a 20 percent jump in the homeless count last year, families with young children are waiting months for emergency shelter, leaving many sleeping on the streets, in cars and parks across the community. This move by The Starbucks Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft, and others supports an immediate expansion of Mary’s Place, and responds to the critical, short-term need to bring unsheltered families inside. Separately, the organizations also expressed support for the mayor’s Pathways Home strategy, which addresses some of the systemic problems contributing to the homeless crisis. It includes a shift towards rapid rehousing (providing assistance and services to help those experiencing homelessness to quickly find housing), funding for expanded shelter hours at several shelters, and the creation of lockers for the homeless. Recognizing that city and county reforms to provide affordable housing will take months or years, supporters of the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign believe it is critical to provide immediate emergency shelter for hundreds of children. \n“The 500 families with small children who are sleeping outside in King County cannot wait for the promised reforms and housing that will take a year or more,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer of Starbucks and co-founder of the Schultz Family Foundation. “We need to treat this daily tragedy with the same urgency that would follow any natural disaster. This is a short-term but urgent humanitarian need, and we are proud to join other Seattle employers in the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign.” \nMary’s Place, which runs the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, is a 17-year-old emergency shelter organization with six locations throughout the county that operates primarily with private funding. Mary’s Place provides emergency shelter to nearly 40 percent of families experiencing homelessness across King County – serving 115-120 families per night, and 400 families throughout the year. However, 20 families a day are still turned away because there is not enough capacity at these shelters. \n“King County is facing an unprecedented homelessness crisis and more than 500 families are sleeping outside each night in places unfit for habitation,” said Marty Hartman, executive director of Mary’s Place. “It breaks our hearts to have to turn them away each day. We are so incredibly grateful for the support of our business partners like Starbucks, Microsoft, the Schultz Family Foundation, and so many others who are making it possible for us to expand our services and bring more families inside to warmth, safety, and stability.” \n“No child should have to sleep outside at night. We must come together as a community to address this vital need as a local imperative,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft president. “We are pledging $1 million, including $250,000 to Mary’s Place, to address homelessness across King County. We will support partners throughout the area to pursue both short- and long-term systemic solutions, including permanent housing.” \nStarbucks Foundation to Match Customer Donations in more than 200 King County Stores in December \nIn addition to a $1 million financial contribution to the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, The Starbucks Foundation will match every dollar donated by customers in participating King County Starbucks® stores between December 1 st and 31 st , up to an additional $1 million dollars to help shelter local families. The Starbucks Foundation will also allocate an additional $250,000 to other local nonprofits, including the United Way, YWCA, and Youth Care, that connect homeless families and youth to job placement programs and other critical services. \nHoward and Sheri Schultz, co-founders of the Schultz Family Foundation, are also personally contributing $1 million to Mary’s Place through the Schultz Family Foundation to expand both shelter capacity and the organization’s ability to move families into permanent housing. In addition, the Schultz Family Foundation will continue to support other Seattle homelessness organizations to reduce the number of unsheltered youth and young adults. \nAbout Mary’s Place \nMary’s Place empowers homeless women, children, and families to reclaim their lives by providing shelter, nourishment, resources, healing, and hope in a safe community. Mary’s Place operates six crisis response family shelters providing refuge and community for 400 family members experiencing homelessness. The organization focuses on an innovative strategy of combining prevention, emergency shelter, and resources for transition into housing to bring families out of homelessness. At their Family Center, Mary’s Place provides shelter, services, and resources in the same building. This allows families, together with their assigned Housing & Wellness Advocates, to focus on individualized plans for overcoming barriers and finding employment and stable housing. It does all this cost effectively in loaned buildings that are empty and awaiting development for just dollars per night. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world.

      "text": "Thumbnail November 29, 2016 07:00   \nSEATTLE- The Starbucks Foundation and Schultz Family Foundation announced today their support of the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign by Mary’s Place. Together with other businesses, they are joining an unprecedented effort to mobilize the community, and contributing over $3 million to provide safe emergency shelter for the estimated 500 unsheltered families in King County, including hundreds of children. The campaign also has the support of companies like Microsoft Corp., Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, Seattle Mariners, as well as the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Seattle Association, which together represent thousands of Seattle businesses. \nFollowing a 20 percent jump in the homeless count last year, families with young children are waiting months for emergency shelter, leaving many sleeping on the streets, in cars and parks across the community. This move by The Starbucks Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft, and others supports an immediate expansion of Mary’s Place, and responds to the critical, short-term need to bring unsheltered families inside. Separately, the organizations also expressed support for the mayor’s Pathways Home strategy, which addresses some of the systemic problems contributing to the homeless crisis. It includes a shift towards rapid rehousing (providing assistance and services to help those experiencing homelessness to quickly find housing), funding for expanded shelter hours at several shelters, and the creation of lockers for the homeless. Recognizing that city and county reforms to provide affordable housing will take months or years, supporters of the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign believe it is critical to provide immediate emergency shelter for hundreds of children. \n“The 500 families with small children who are sleeping outside in King County cannot wait for the promised reforms and housing that will take a year or more,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer of Starbucks and co-founder of the Schultz Family Foundation. “We need to treat this daily tragedy with the same urgency that would follow any natural disaster. This is a short-term but urgent humanitarian need, and we are proud to join other Seattle employers in the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign.” \nMary’s Place, which runs the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, is a 17-year-old emergency shelter organization with six locations throughout the county that operates primarily with private funding. Mary’s Place provides emergency shelter to nearly 40 percent of families experiencing homelessness across King County – serving 115-120 families per night, and 400 families throughout the year. However, 20 families a day are still turned away because there is not enough capacity at these shelters. \n“King County is facing an unprecedented homelessness crisis and more than 500 families are sleeping outside each night in places unfit for habitation,” said Marty Hartman, executive director of Mary’s Place. “It breaks our hearts to have to turn them away each day. We are so incredibly grateful for the support of our business partners like Starbucks, Microsoft, the Schultz Family Foundation, and so many others who are making it possible for us to expand our services and bring more families inside to warmth, safety, and stability.” \n“No child should have to sleep outside at night. We must come together as a community to address this vital need as a local imperative,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft president. “We are pledging $1 million, including $250,000 to Mary’s Place, to address homelessness across King County. We will support partners throughout the area to pursue both short- and long-term systemic solutions, including permanent housing.” \nStarbucks Foundation to Match Customer Donations in more than 200 King County Stores in December \nIn addition to a $1 million financial contribution to the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, The Starbucks Foundation will match every dollar donated by customers in participating King County Starbucks® stores between December 1 st and 31 st , up to an additional $1 million dollars to help shelter local families. The Starbucks Foundation will also allocate an additional $250,000 to other local nonprofits, including the United Way, YWCA, and Youth Care, that connect homeless families and youth to job placement programs and other critical services. \nHoward and Sheri Schultz, co-founders of the Schultz Family Foundation, are also personally contributing $1 million to Mary’s Place through the Schultz Family Foundation to expand both shelter capacity and the organization’s ability to move families into permanent housing. In addition, the Schultz Family Foundation will continue to support other Seattle homelessness organizations to reduce the number of unsheltered youth and young adults. \nAbout Mary’s Place \nMary’s Place empowers homeless women, children, and families to reclaim their lives by providing shelter, nourishment, resources, healing, and hope in a safe community. Mary’s Place operates six crisis response family shelters providing refuge and community for 400 family members experiencing homelessness. The organization focuses on an innovative strategy of combining prevention, emergency shelter, and resources for transition into housing to bring families out of homelessness. At their Family Center, Mary’s Place provides shelter, services, and resources in the same building. This allows families, together with their assigned Housing & Wellness Advocates, to focus on individualized plans for overcoming barriers and finding employment and stable housing. It does all this cost effectively in loaned buildings that are empty and awaiting development for just dollars per night. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world.

      "text": "Starbucks planned in new Digital Classroom Building   \nBy Steve Nakata, Administrative Services \nPULLMAN, Wash. – Washington State University will have its first full-service, licensed Starbucks store when the new Digital Classroom Building opens in the fall. \nThe goal is to have a soft opening as students return during the Week of Welcome and have the store fully operational by the first day of class on Aug. 22. \nThe store will offer a full menu of Starbucks food and drink products, as well as gift cards. \nWSU Dining Services Director Gary Coyle expects it to be a destination coffee shop: “We anticipate that it will draw people in from all over campus and the Pullman community.” \nThe 800-square-foot store will be on the first floor of one of the busiest buildings on campus. \n“The classrooms will seat about 1,000 people and there are informal learning spaces for an additional 500 people,” said Louise Sweeney, project manager lead for WSU Facilities Services. “The Starbucks will definitely see a lot of foot traffic.” \nCoyle said he anticipates store setup and training of three permanent employees in July. Baristas must complete 40 hours of training and receive Starbucks certification before they serve customers. \n“We’ve been in discussion with Starbucks for several years about opening a licensed store on campus and I think it’s going to be very successful,” he said. \n\nGary Coyle, WSU Dining Services, 509-335-7039, Louise Sweeney, WSU Facility Services, 509-335-4437, Steve Nakata, WSU Administrative Services communication, 509-335-1774,",

      "text": "Pinterest \nWith the suspect of an attempted bombing of three Albuquerque Starbucks coffee shops now in custody, along with the bombings of two international locations, it is becoming clearer that the massive company may be a direct target for ISIS. \nOn Monday, the FBI announced they have taken custody of a person in connection with the “suspicious” devices found at three closed Starbucks coffee shops in the Albuquerque area. No charges have been filed yet, but the person was apprehended Saturday and turned over to the FBI, indicating possible terrorist involvement, MRCtv is reporting . \nThe three devices actually exploded but only one caused minimal damage, nobody was injured. \nIn March, a bombing outside a Starbucks at the Brussels airport left 34 dead. The attack was claimed by ISIS. From The Chicago Tribune : \n“In its claim of responsibility, the Islamic State group said its members detonated suicide vests both at the airport and in the subway, where many passengers fled to safety down dark tunnels filled with hazy smoke from the explosion. A small child wailed, and commuters used cell phones to light their way out. IS warned of further attacks, issuing a communique promising “dark days” for countries taking part in the anti-IS coalition, warning \n“The government said at least 11 people were killed at the airport and 20 on the subway, where the bomb hit an enclosed train car. Later, a security official said the overall death toll had risen to 34, without providing a breakdown of where.” \nTwo months earlier, ISIS claimed responsibility for an explosion and a gunfight at a Starbucks coffee shop in Jakarta, Indonesia. From QZ : \n“Indonesia’s capital Jakarta was hit by a series of bombings today (Jan. 14) that killed two civilians, including one Canadian. Officials blamed the attack on Islamic State militants, some of whom have allegedly been captured. \n“A number of explosions rocked the city’s Sarinah neighborhood starting at around 10:45am local time, followed by a gun battle between attackers and police outside a Starbucks cafe that was one of the targets.” \nTargeting Starbucks cafes is not a new phenomenon. A bomb threat was made late last year at a shop on the grounds of Camp Lejune in North Carolina. As far back as 2009, a Starbucks in New York City was bombed as well . \nA sign of American success, progress and prosperity – or capitalist excess to others – Starbucks has a global presence. There are more than 24,000 coffee shops in 70 countries around the globe. \nSo if you visit your local Starbucks, be aware and alert.",

      "text": "Why Starbucks Remains in Investors' Good Favor PART: Why Starbucks Remains in Investors' Good Favor PART 1 OF 5 How Much Upside Is Left in Starbucks’s Stock Price? By Ralph Nathan | Nov 29, 2016 4:23 pm EST Stock performance \nStarbucks’s ( SBUX ) share price has been soaring since it announced its fiscal 4Q16 results on November 3, 2016. As of November 28, the company was trading at $57.4, a rise of 11.2% from its price on November 3. \nAnalysts expected the company to post EPS (earnings per share) of $0.55 on revenue of $5.68 billion in fiscal 4Q16. The company beat the consensus estimate with EPS of $0.56 on revenue of $5.71 billion. SBUX’s better-than-expected earnings and revenue increased investors’ confidence in the stock, leading to a rise in its price. For a detailed look at Starbucks’s fiscal 4Q16 performance, read Starbucks Posts Strong 4Q16 Earnings: What Does the Future Hold? \nThe victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election also contributed to a rise in Starbucks’s share price. Investors expect Trump to loosen regulations, which could be beneficial for restaurant chains. If Trump repeals or changes the Affordable Care Act , restaurants will be relieved of employees’ health insurance expenses. Investors also don’t expect Trump to raise the federal minimum wage. Year-to-date performance \nDespite the recent rise in Starbucks’s stock price, the company’s share price has returned -1.2% year-to-date (or YTD). Since the beginning of 2016, SBUX’s peers Dunkin’ Brands ( DNKN ), Domino’s Pizza ( DPZ ), and McDonald’s ( MCD ) have returned 31.3%, 55.7%, and 3.6%, respectively. \nThe comparative broader index, the iShares US Consumer Services ETF ( IYC ), has returned -6.9%. IWP has invested ~11.5% of its investments in restaurants and travel companies. Series overview \nIn this series, we’ll look at Starbucks’s revenue and EPS estimates for the next four quarters. We’ll also look at Starbucks’s valuation multiple, recent recommendations, and target price for the next 12 months. \nLet’s start by looking at analysts’ revenue estimates for Starbucks over the next four quarters.

      "text": "Here's How To Get A Free Starbucks Drink Every Day 1 hour ago A Starbucks employee recently revealed a hack that one customer uses to get a free drink from the coffee chain every day of the year, but he also said that he hates that customer. Barista Brad Halsey submitted a story to Kitchenette's Stories of Horrible Restaurant Customers and in it, he revealed that one Starbucks patron comes into his store every day and orders the same infuriating drink which the guy then gets for free. Apparently, the customer bought 365 Starbucks cards and registered each online with a different birthday so he gets a free birthday drink every day of the year. The man then says his app is malfunctioning and that it gives him a b-day drink every day. While Brad doesn't seem to mind the menu hack, what bothers him is that the customer doesn't just do things subtly - instead he asks the barista for a Venti cup and a marker, goes on to write an elaborate order on it then claims he isn't picky and explains why the drink should be rung up for a $3 instead of what it's worth, $6.50. He might be an annoying customer, but he seems to have found a pretty ingenious way to get free coffee, at least until Starbucks changes their system.

Starbucks cup design mislabels famous Oregon waterfall Posted: The Oregon Double Wall Traveler mug highlights various Oregon landmarks and cities (Photo: KPTV) The 'Klamath Falls' pictured on the cup is actually Multnomah Falls (Photo: KPTV) PORTLAND, OR (KPTV) - \nWhoever designed a new Oregon-themed travel mug at Starbucks made a mistake that will be pretty obvious to most Oregonians. \nThe cup highlights various landmarks, cities and the things they're known for, including the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Pendleton's famous rodeo and wool blankets, and food trucks in Portland. \nThe problem is, the 'Klamath Falls' shown toward the bottom of the cup is clearly a drawing of iconic Multnomah Falls, a popular tourist spot in the Columbia River Gorge, 300 miles to the north. \nNot only that, there are no falls in Oregon that bear the 'Klamath' name. \nAccording to the Mail Tribune in Medford, the southern Oregon city of Klamath Falls was originally built near a \"waterfall\" on the Link River that was really just a series of rapids. \nThose rapids have been gone for decades. \nAn eagle-eyed customer spotted the mistake and posted a photo on Twitter, questioning who reviewed the design. #FAIL @Starbucks who reviewed the final design? Klamath Falls DOESN'T have a waterfall. The pic looks like you meant #multnomahfalls #oops pic.twitter.com/DTGZHeUg20 \nIf you're interested, you can buy the Oregon Double Wall Traveler in Oregon Starbucks stores or online for $22.95. \nCopyright 2016 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.

      "text": "November 30, 2016 — Leave a Comment \nHold on to your butts – Universal Orlando is getting an exclusive Starbucks mug starting December 1, and you’ll have to fight me to be first in line to buy one. The mug will be part of the Starbucks ‘You Are Here’ series that you can find all over the United States. \nWalt Disney World and Disneyland joined the ‘You Are Here’ family back in 2015, but judging by the design on Universal’s, it looks like this one was worth the wait. Unlike the Disney mugs, Universal will be showcasing their entire resort on one mug. So, if you were hoping for separate drinkware for Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, you’ll be disappointed. However, who knows what the future could hold once Volcano Bay opens up. The masses need their coffee. \nStarbucks is located at Universal CityWalk, Port of Entry in Islands of Adventure, and New York in Universal Studios Florida.",

      "text": "Share this article \n\nPeppermint mocha lattes are being served at Starbucks, you’ve been waiting all year for Free form’s (ABC Family) 25 days of Christmas and you have just accepted a Facebook invite to an ugly Christmas sweater party. Yup, the holiday season is in full swing. After eating all of the Thanksgiving leftovers your mom sent you home with, you’ve already moved on to perfecting your craft of baking gingerbread cookies. However, sometimes people can get lost during the holiday season. Over the years, the holiday season has become very materialistic. Expectations are high and gift giving creates a whole new kind of anxiety. Some people wish that they can “get through” the holiday season. Sometimes this thought goes through my head as well, which is normal. The holidays can be quite chaotic, but this doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy the season. I mean, it only comes around once a year, so why not take the time and really reflect on what makes this time of the year so special? Here are some reminders why the holiday season is actually the best time of the year. \n1. Family \nWhen comes down to what the holidays are really all about, it’s usually family. You shouldn’t be embarrassed or annoyed by your family because it’s all out of love. The holidays are when some of my fondest and funniest memories of my family were made. Take the time this holiday season and create some memories of your own to look back on. \n2. Decorations \nThere’s nothing like hanging those twinkling lights on the roof of a house or putting the final touches on the Christmas tree. Decorating is a free and fun activity to do with friends or family. It’s nice to look back and reflect on classic traditional decorations while incorporating a modern twist with new decorations as well. \n3. Food \nGingerbread cookies, holiday glazed ham and much more mouth-watering treats are for sure to tickle your taste buds this holiday season. Baking and cooking are truly a lost art form that can be rekindled during the month of December. Everything has cinnamon spices in it and bread in the name, so what more could you want than that combination? \nThe list could go on and on about why the holiday season is so special, but we haven’t got all day here. The important thing to remember is to be in the moment and take the time this holiday season to cherish all the great memories this season is going to give you. \n\nPhoto Credit: Street Food Cinema, Giphy.com",

      "text": "Guess what’s back. Back again (Picture: Starbucks) The winter season is definitely upon us, the time of year when we’re guilty of indulging our most basic desires. \nIt wouldn’t really be winter unless we didn’t whip on a pair of Uggs, coat everything in cinnamon and spend every single outdoor moment trying to get the perfect #SoWinter picture for Instagram.\nHere are the most basic things we’ll all be getting up to this winter.\nLike, literally.\nNot until summer anyway (Picture: Jaquie Boyd / Getty) 1. Moan As much as you spend the last few weeks of summer eagerly looking forward to winter, as soon as it arrives you spend every single moment of it moaning non-stop.\nYou moan about the cold, your dry skin, the dark… and every single moan-themed sentence starts with ‘I can’t even’.\n2. Sickness monitoring If there’s one basic thing we do even better than moan about the weather it is to monitor the health levels of anyone at work who comes within a 20cm radius of us.\nIf you catch anyone with the slightest sniffle you loudly tell them to keep away from you because you don’t want to catch their lurgy while you ostentatiously apply anti-bacterial hand gel.\nHow grown up of you.\n3. Instagram everything The leaves, the frost, the snow, an icicle, your new ear muffs.\nBasically anything remotely related to winter will be instagrammed, filtered 3 times and have at least 12 winter-related hashtags underneath.\n\n4. Trendy hot drinks You ease into this with the pumpkin spiced latte (aka the PSL), and then slowly make your way through the entire Starbucks, Costa and Pret Christmas hot drink menu.\nOf course you Snapchat every single hot drink-related adventure.\n5. Match everything If you’re not matching your hat with your scarf and your gloves, then why bother even leaving the house that day?\n6. UGGs everywhere When it comes to UGGs you are obsessed, and there is simply no such thing as having just one pair.\nYou have at least three pairs in different lengths and different colours.\nSo basic, but you’re so comfy.\nThe basic winter dream (Picture: Ugg) 7. Excessive selfies As soon as you spot anything with a holly leaf on it you proceed to stage a mini selfie photo shoot.\n#SoWinter, and bonus points if your outfit motif matches the holly leaves.\nMore 14 pictures of winter-loving animals that'll make you feel festive \nEven after she left for uni, this girl's dog still waits for her to come home every day \nKendall Jenner wore five different looks for the Victoria's Secret runway show \n8. Candles Candles are an absolute must, and they can only either be cinammon scented or a Christmas-themed Yankee Candle.\nThese must be placed in every single room of your home for optimal basic behaviour.\n9. Cinnamon overload Unless it’s swimming in cinammon you won’t even entertain consuming it during the months of October – January.\nYou even sprinkle it into your almond milk.\n10. Bublé overload Most people listen to Bublé once a week, but not the basic folks out there.\nYou will listen to him every single moment of the day while making jokes that you are his muse.\n\n11. Festive wear How can everyone know just how happy you are that it is now winter, unless you’re not wearing something festive-themed every single day?\nYou indulge your basic happiness by wearing a Christmas jumper at all times.\n12. Check print overload You’re basically a giant walking chessboard, in a variety of different colours, drinking a PSL.\n13. Christmas countdown 25 days to go! You’ve got your UGGs on, you’ve matched them with a mini-lumberjack check shirt, you’ve got your latte in hand. The only thing left to do is start the Christmas countdown! This will most likely take place via Facebook posts that only your mum will like.\nMORE: 13 reasons why Winter Wonderland is the absolute worst \nMORE: The 20 worst people in the world at Christmas… are you one of them? \n ",

Located along what will eventually be the east pedestrian mall, the shop will include a drive-thru and a large plaza with outdoor seating next to the building. \nThe master plan for that area also includes future restaurant and retail development, as well as a hotel on the south side of the new 19th Street along Oliver. \n\"We're excited to have a Starbucks on campus,\" Patterson says. \"It's going to be great for faculty, staff and students already here and will be a draw for the greater Wichita community.\" NOTE -- If the media release text is not visible, please refresh the page in your browser.",

      "title": "If Howard Schultz Is Leaving Starbucks, Has This Coffee Giant Peaked?",
      "text": "Source: courtesy of Starbucks Corp. Believe it or not, Howard Schultz has tried to leave Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) before. This time looks like it will be for real. Starbucks announced on Thursday that Howard Schultz is departing the day-to-day operations as CEO of the company.\nWall Street and investors hate to see iconic CEOs resign. Still, some people will not consider this announcement a surprise. When Starbucks conducted its most recent management reshuffling it sure looked like a semi-formal CEO succession plan was being put in place .\nThe big question to ask is far different to ask versus a decade ago when Schultz was not running the company — Has Starbucks best days of growth peaked?\nSchultz is not going to be departing the company entirely. Schultz is set to become executive chairman, and the Starbucks press release shows that he will focus on retail innovation and will accelerate the growth of Starbucks ultra-premium retail formats. He will also lead the company’s social impact initiatives.\nSome good news is that this change will not take place immediately at the effective date will be April 3, 2017. Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer, will expand his responsibilities as president and chief executive officer. Johnson has also been a member of Starbucks’ board of directors for 7 years.\nStarbucks shares were up 0.9% going into Thursday’s closing bell. They were down roughly 4% at $56.45 in the after-hours session about 15 minutes after the close. Also in that 15 minutes some 1.4 million shares traded hands.\nStarbucks has a 52-week trading range of $50.84 to $62.54. Investors will want to pay attention to one trend here. The consensus analyst price target has already been on the decline with Thomson Reuters showing a consensus analyst price target of $64.12 ahead of the Schultz departure. That consensus price target was $64.60 a month ago, $65.88 just 60 days ago and $66.21 just 90 days ago. That target was closer to $68 in July and slightly over $68 at the start of 2016.\nOne issue to consider is whether or not Starbucks will be able to still double its footprint in China. Some investors are going to be surprised to have a Schultz-less Starbucks. Others will think this was telegraphed in earlier management reshuffling.\nIt still seems more than fair to wonder if this marks the beginning of the end for Starbucks’ endless growth. After all, in many ways Howard Schultz is to food and coffee what Steve Jobs was to Apple and tech. Starbucks had annual sales of $21.3 billion in 2016. That is versus $10.7 billion in 2010, $6.4 billion in 2005 and $2.2 billion in the year 2000.\nAgain, it just seems fair to wonder about the days of endless growth. At a minimum this represents the leadership change of a legend. Again, it has happened before — but this time looks real.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   Howard Schultz offered up a quote regarding his departure as CEO:\nStarbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI — both in the U.S. and around the world.\nAs I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson — our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years — has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.\n",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks says CEO Howard Schultz , who transformed the chain into a global coffee brand, is stepping down from that role at the coffee chain that he joined more than 30 years ago.\nThe Seattle-based company announced Thursday that Kevin Johnson , who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will become chief executive as of April 3.\nSchultz, currently chairman and CEO, will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. Schultz, 63, is credited with turning around the coffee chain's fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the company's popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings.\nThe company's sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they've slowed more recently.\nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton , and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and has spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nFindTheCompany | Graphiq FindTheCompany | Graphiq",

      "title": "Starbucks: CEO Howard Schultz Steps Down",
      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Is Stepping Down \nStarbucks ‘ chief executive Howard Schultz will step down from his role in 2017, ending a successful tenure atop the coffee giant in which he steered it to become a strong performing global powerhouse. \nThe coffee chain on Thursday announced that effective April 3, Schultz would retain his role as executive chairman but would no longer serve as CEO so he could pivot his focus on “innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries around the world.” Schultz has been advocating a push into more premium coffees as a way for Starbucks sbux to compete and establish its brand with a stronger footing for the future. He’s sought to explore new concepts like the Starbucks Roastery in Seattle, a massive retail location that has a cafe and tasting room and helped kick off the company’s bigger bet on a more premium retail and coffee experience. Kevin Johnson, who served as president and chief operating officer and is a seven-year member of the Starbucks board, will succeed Schultz. \n“As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson–our current president, COO, a seven-year board member, and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years–has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer,” Schultz said in a statement. “This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \n\nThe leadership changes caught investors off guard, coming a week before Starbucks is set to host the company’s investor day event. Shares were down a little over 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday. \nBu Schultz leaves Starbucks on firm ground after his second successful run as CEO. He previously ran the company from 1987 to 2000, but returned in 2008 after Starbucks fired former CEO Jim Donald. Under Donald, the brand found itself out of favor with consumers and shuttered stores as it faced slow growth in the U.S. during the financial crisis. \nSince then, Schultz has had immense success turning around the company. Annual net revenue climbed from $10.4 billion in 2008 to $21.3 billion in the most recent fiscal year. The company has over 25,000 stores today, an almost even mix of company-operated and licensed locations. Back in 2008, it had close to 1,700 locations. \nWith that pace of expansion and sales growth, Starbucks has been a success story at a time when many big restaurant concepts have faced persistent sales and traffic challenges. This summer, for example, shares dipped after Starbucks posted U.S. comparable-store sales growth that was under 5% for the first time after 25 straight quarters of increases above that pace. That exemplifies the high bar that Wall Street investors had set for Starbucks that most other chains of similar size haven’t been expected to achieve. \nNew CEO Johnson has been integral to that success as well. He’s led the company’s global operating businesses across all regions and has helped steer marketing and investments in tech. \n“Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team,” Johnson said in a statement. ” Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future.” ",

      "text": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation - News9.com - Oklahoma City, OK - News, Weather, Video and Sports | Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation Posted:   9:09 PM EST 2016-12-02 02:09:00   fast-  9:08 PM EST 2016-12-02 02:08:50 GMT After nearly 24 hours of drenching rain helped quench a series of devastating wildfires in eastern Tennessee, local officials turned to cleanup and recovery efforts even as they battled their own personal crises. More >> Crews discovered the remains of more people as they searched the rubble of wildfires that torched hundreds of homes and businesses near the Great Smoky Mountains, bringing the death toll to 11, officials said Thursday. More >>   8:59  08   By CANDICE CHOI and MICHAEL SISAKAssociated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings - a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

      "text": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Steps Down Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Steps Down December 2, 2016 , 1:45 AM Stephen Brashear / Getty Images Howard Schultz is stepping down as Starbucks CEO effective next year, the New York Times and NPR report. Kevin Johnson, the company's President, COO, and a longtime Schultz ally, will take over the CEO position effective April 3. Schultz will return to his position as the company's executive chairman.“This is a big day for me,” Schultz told the Times . “I love the company as much as I love my family.”Schultz first joined the coffee chain 30 years ago, and is attempting to hand over the reigns for the second time. He stepped down as CEO first in 2000 to serve as executive chairman, a position he held until 2008, when he replaced executive James Donald as sales were stagnant. Under Schultz's stewardship, the chain has grown to around 25,000 stores in 75 countries. Since taking the reigns again in 2008, he increased the company's valuation from $15 billion to $84 billion.The move fuels speculation that Schultz may seek to enter politics. He's nurtured close relationships with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Not only that, but Starbucks has often championed progressive causes under his watch. Those have included writing \"Come Together\" on cups during the 2011 government shutdown and providing tuition to employees seeking a college education. Shares of Starbucks fell 3.6 percent to $56.44 after-hours trading following Schultz's announcement. Advertisement",

      "text": "CEO of Starbucks Howard Schultz plans on creating a new brand of stores called Starbucks Reserve-Only The new stores will offer premium small lot reserve coffee in more of a cafe environment than the current Starbucks stores The new Reserve-only stores will be about twice as large as current Starbucks stores The new cafes will be in hundreds of locations and they'll start popping up next year\nMedia: Wibbitz What we know as Starbucks may be in for a serious change.\nAs longtime Starbucks chairman and CEO Howard Schultz hands over the reigns of the coffee giant to president and COO Kevin Johnson, Schultz said he plans to focus more of his energy on the Reserve Roasteries and other “ultra-premium” products.\nNo, he’s not leaving the company, and as he’ll become executive chairman of the board (he was already chairman), it’s likely his influence will remain as strong as ever.\nSchultz already announced back in July that he would be focusing on the upscale Reserve products, stores and roastery and tasting rooms. There’s little doubt that his vision of the future of Starbucks is very much aligned with the more upscale products.\n“What we have created with the Roastery is the most dynamic, immersive retail experience the industry has ever seen,” he said in a letter to employees in July. “With its stunning success, we will now accelerate and globalize the Roastery experience, building more roasteries in iconic cities, and threading the Roastery experience into hundreds of new coffee-forward Reserve stores around the world, which also will integrate the spectacular culinary experience of our new Italian food partner, Princi.”\nStarbucks launched the Reserve line of small-batch roasted premium coffee in 2010, and in 2014 opened the first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room on Capitol Hill. The company has since announced plans for Reserve roasteries in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo.\nThe stores are a combination of a small-batch roastery, a coffee tasting room, a retail space and an educational experience, all aimed at promoting the ultra-premium Reserve coffees and associated products.\nIt’s true, many already associate Starbucks with high priced coffee (and prices have gone up twice this year), but the Reserve line took that to the next level.\nSchultz now plans to focus on development of the Reserve roasteries and expansion of the Reserve “retail experience,” the company said in a news release.\nIf the strategy proves successful, Starbucks customers can expect to see a lot more of that fancy “R” and, probably, more expensive products on the front line.\nDaniel DeMay covers Seattle culture, business and transportation for seattlepi.com.

      "text": "As Schultz Steps Down, Next Starbucks CEO Brings Tech Savvy Leslie Patton Dec 02, 2016 5:04 am ET (Bloomberg) -- After turning Starbucks Corp. into the world’s largest coffee chain, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz will hand the reins to a lieutenant who could solidify its role as a technology company. Kevin Johnson, a 33-year veteran of the tech industry who became Starbucks’ chief operating officer last year, will take the helm from Schultz on April 3. The move is a nod to the company’s growing reputation for innovation: It introduced the world’s first successful mobile-payment service, beating out the likes of Apple Inc. and Google Inc., and gets an increasingly large portion of its revenue from that source. Schultz will keep the role of executive chairman at Starbucks, focusing on the rollout of its upscale Reserve brand. “I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz, 63, said on a conference call after the change was announced Thursday. “But Kevin and the team are in charge.” Johnson, who joined the board in 2009, was tapped for the operating chief job after Troy Alstead went on sabbatical. Johnson, 56, previously worked at Microsoft Corp. and Juniper Networks Inc. In 2008, he was named to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, where he served under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Schultz’s Shadow The CEO change jarred investors, who briefly sent the shares down as much as 12 percent, though Johnson was seen as a possible successor since he took the No. 2 job last year. For many shareholders and customers, Schultz has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. And he’s used the company to pursue social causes -- occasionally clumsily -- such as racial strife and sustainability. Schultz will focus on expanding Starbucks’ Reserve Roasteries, a chain of massive coffee houses that provide tastings and other experiences, as well as new Reserve retail stores. The executive has been working to position the Reserve name as Starbucks’ new higher-end brand. Schultz also will continue the company’s “social impact” efforts. As CEO, he’s already pushed to open stores in low-income areas and supported gay marriage. It hasn’t always gone smoothly. Schultz’s idea for employees to discuss race relations with customers was criticized as ham-fisted. Investors weren’t anticipating Schultz’s departure as CEO so soon, though having both executives focus on different parts of the company could have benefits, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus. “The timing of this is a surprise,” she said. “I do think the ‘divide and conquer’ strategy is probably good for the company long-term.” Mobile Transactions Starbucks’ digital and technology prowess has put it ahead of its peers, allowing it to serve more customers faster. Same-store sales rose 5 percent in the Americas region in the most recent quarter. Mobile payments accounted for about 25 percent of U.S. transactions in that period. Starbucks built on its tech leadership with an order-ahead feature, which lets customers select and pay for drinks in advance. They then can pick up the beverages at a shop without waiting in line. Since Johnson became operating chief, Starbucks has rolled out mobile ordering across the U.S. and even tested delivery. The Seattle-based company also is boosting spending on digital ventures, including taking its app and rewards platform to countries such as China. Though shares of Starbucks tumbled immediately after the announcement, they recovered some of that ground during extended trading. As of 5:54 p.m. in New York, the stock was down 3.3 percent to $56.58. Second Retirement This isn’t Schultz’s first retirement as CEO. After serving in the job from 1987 to 2000 -- punctuated by an initial public offering in 1992 -- he stepped down in 2000. But Schultz returned in 2008 after Starbucks faltered. The company had opened too many locations too quickly and got hit by the financial crisis. Profit plunged. Schultz put Starbucks back on firmer footing. “The difference between then and now couldn’t be greater,” he said on Thursday. “In 2007-2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies and Starbucks was not immune.” The company now has the “strongest leadership team in history,” he said. It’s been speculated that Schultz might make a run for U.S. president, though he’s repeatedly said he has no intention of doing so. While speaking at a conference in New York last month, Schultz said he wouldn’t serve as part of President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet. He also denied rumors of running for president last year in a New York Times opinion piece. It’s probably too early to tell if Schultz has designs on the White House, Bartashus said. “Certainly if he is interested in a political career, he has the next 2 1/2 years to sow those seeds,” she said. “A lot will depend on the first half of the Trump administration.” --With assistance from Olga Kharif To contact the reporters on this story: Leslie Patton in Chicago at lpatton5@bloomberg.net, Nick Turner in New York at nturner7@bloomberg.net.

Starbucks built on its tech leadership with an order-ahead feature, which lets customers select and pay for drinks in advance. They then can pick up the beverages at a shop without waiting in line. Since Johnson became operating chief, Starbucks has rolled out mobile ordering across the U.S. and even tested delivery. The Seattle-based company also is boosting spending on digital ventures, including taking its app and rewards platform to countries such as China. Though shares of Starbucks tumbled immediately after the announcement, they recovered some of that ground. The stock was down 2.4 percent in Germany to the equivalent of $57.13 in trading before U.S. markets opened on Friday. Second Retirement This isn’t Schultz’s first retirement as CEO. After serving in the job from 1987 to 2000 -- punctuated by an initial public offering in 1992 -- he stepped down in 2000. But Schultz returned in 2008 after Starbucks faltered. The company had opened too many locations too quickly and got hit by the financial crisis. Profit plunged. Schultz put Starbucks back on firmer footing. “The difference between then and now couldn’t be greater,” he said on Thursday. “In 2007-2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies and Starbucks was not immune.” The company now has the “strongest leadership team in history,” he said. It’s been speculated that Schultz might make a run for U.S. president, though he’s repeatedly said he has no intention of doing so. While speaking at a conference in New York last month, Schultz said he wouldn’t serve as part of President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet. He also denied rumors of running for president last year in a New York Times opinion piece. It’s probably too early to tell if Schultz has designs on the White House, Bartashus said. “Certainly if he is interested in a political career, he has the next 2 1/2 years to sow those seeds,” she said. “A lot will depend on the first half of the Trump administration.” (Updates with premarket trading in 15th paragraph.) --With assistance from Olga Kharif To contact the reporters on this story: Leslie Patton in Chicago at lpatton5@bloomberg.net, Nick Turner in New York at nturner7@bloomberg.net.

Schultz is considered to be a visionary who built the coffee shops into one of the best known brands in the world. Schultz wants to oversee the company's efforts to open roasteries where customers can see the entire coffee process, take classes and taste unique coffees. The final employment report of the year is due today. This is also the last major piece of economic data before the Federal reserve meets next year. Surveys of economists predict jobs added will be 175,000 to 200,000. President-elect Donald Trump has picked retired Marine General James Mattis as Defense Secretary. Mattis retired as chief of U.S. Central Command in 2013, has often said that Washington lacks a strategy in the Middle East.",
