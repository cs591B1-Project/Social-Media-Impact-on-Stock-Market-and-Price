      "text": "0 0 \nRecently, Microsoft started bombarding users with unwanted ads that have managed to strike a chord with the Windows user community. Not only was Microsoft already pushing ads for Windows 10, but now they have extended the inconvenience to ads for their browser, Microsoft Edge. Users have reported these ads popping up in the Start menu. Also, Microsoft started pushing ads into Windows apps as well. \nMany want to know exactly how they can get rid of the unwanted ads and just as they asked, solutions came. One very simple solution that has worked for many users is just unpinning Microsoft Edge from your taskbar. If the program is still on your taskbar, right click it and select the Unpin from taskbar option. According to a lot of users, this should get rid of the pesky ads for you. But there were also users that didn’t find success with this solution, so it isn’t failproof. \nIn case the first one failed, here is another solution that might prove to be more successful. What you need to do is open your Start menu and navigate to your Settings. Once the settings menu is open, go to the System section and continue by selecting Notifications & Actions. \nFrom there, look for the Get tips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows section, which should be positioned on the right side among other options. Once you turn the toggle for that setting to Off, your ad problems should be a thing of the past. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nXbox Preview was just one of the many programs of this type that Microsoft hosts, with other such programs constantly popping up for Windows 10 and Windows 10 applications. To be in better alignment with its Windows 10 counterparts, the Xbox Preview program has been appropriately renamed to the Xbox Insider program. \nUntil now, the only way to get into the Xbox Preview/Xbox Insider program was through an invitation. That is no longer required, as Microsoft has announced one of the biggest changes it’s ever made to the program: free entrance into the Xbox Insider program. Now, anyone that desires to sign up for Xbox Insider is free to do so. \nThe Xbox Preview version had a feature called the Xbox Preview Dashboard, which was a sort of place where people could interact. With this update, the Dashboard is being revamped and transformed into the Xbox Insider Hub . The places where users interact and share feedback for other Microsoft programs such as Windows 10 or Office 365 Insider are also called Hubs, therefore it was only suitable for the Dashboard to be renamed. The name isn’t the only thing changing, as the old Dashboard will also be modernized from an aesthetic point of view, making it so that it is in better sync with the rest of Microsoft’s visual ideas. \nThe update is being rolled out systematically, starting with the people that have contributed the most over time, meaning that if you are new to the program, you’ll have to wait a few days as Xbox Preview seniors will have priority. \nMicrosoft seems to be having a lot of success with its Insider programs. Theirs is no reason why the Xbox Insider wouldn’t receive the same accolades as its Windows comrades. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nEveryone that likes to follow Microsoft’s latest endeavors or is just simply tech savvy enough to read up on what’s going on in the tech world knows that Microsoft likes to use codenames for its different projects and initiatives. \nNo exception from this is the Redstone codename, which has been around for some time. For Windows 10 , Microsoft has decided to implement a new update system based on them putting out constant, more minor updates and only a couple major updates at a given time. This means that it will take Microsoft less time to react to bugs and issues fed back from the community. Additionally, Microsoft now uses codenames to differentiate the various areas of an update or various smaller updates that are part of a bigger rollout. \nThat’s where Redstone steps in. Microsoft’s recent Anniversary Update was part of what is referred to as Redstone 1, with Redstone 2 and Redstone 3 being different. Redstone 2 covers the major update for Windows 10 that will be released early next year, while Redstone 3 has come to be known as the Creators Update. \nHowever, there seems to be another update on the horizon and it looks like Microsoft will keep using the Redstone codename, bringing us to Redstone 4. As far as it’s been uncovered, it looks like what is referred to as Redstone 4 is actually an update that Microsoft is preparing for 2018. \nRumors also put the Surface Phone somewhere in the same release time frame, meaning that Microsoft could be working on setting up a joint release or maybe a bigger event, where the release of the Surface Phone device will be enhanced by the simultaneous release of the 2018 update. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Here’s what specs the Lumia 750 could have received",
      "text": "0 0 \nIt’s been over a year since Microsoft decided to hack and slash the Lumia series from the smartphone roster, meaning that some devices that were still in production might have received the axe as collateral damage. There were discussions of a Lumia 750 device back then, but nothing came of that rumor. Now, however, a patent leaked featuring the Lumia 750 handset as it was intended but never finalized. It looks like the device was intended as a mid-range phone. Let’s take a look and see what kind of specifications the canceled device had. \nThe Lumia 750 would have sported a 5 inch display with HD capabilities that would have been nice for viewing pictures taken with the 8 MP camera which would have also been featured on the handset. The lens apparently had the Zeiss mark on it. Other camera functions included autofocus, an LED flash function and 1080 recording at 30 fps. The maximum resolution for the lens was 3264 x 2448. \nTaking a look inside the device, we see a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processing unit, which was a quad core processor clocked at 1.2 GHz. There were supposedly Cortex A53 cores featured in it. The graphics were handled by the Adreno 306 GPU, which complemented the processing unit’s power. \nIn terms of memory, the phone sported 8 GB of storage capacity, which could be extended using a microSD card. The RAM capacity was 1 GB, which wasn’t the greatest, even back then. The battery used for the device was a 2650 mAH unit. \nThe phone also had the standard capabilities such as GPS, LED, Wifi support and your regular smartphone sensors. \nBy the look of these specs, it seems that Microsoft decided to trash a pretty decent device. There’s no knowledge on the price that the device would have, but depending on how expensive it would have gotten, the specs would have been more or less worth it. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Follow About | \nAndy Patrizio is a freelance technology writer based in Orange County, California. He's written for a variety of publications, ranging from Tom's Guide to Wired to Dr. Dobbs Journal. Microsoft launches 'Feature Pack' for SharePoint 2016 Instead of a pack of bug fixes, this adds a bunch of new features and functions Related Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Network World | Nov 9, 2016 8:10 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nThe traditional update to a major product release is a service pack, which is mostly bug fixes and maybe a few new features. But Microsoft is doing something a little different with the release of \"Feature Pack 1\" for SharePoint 2016. + Also on Network World: Nov 2016 Patch Tuesday: Microsoft released 14 security updates, 6 rated critical + \nMicrosoft released SharePoint Server 2016 in May, along with mobile apps for iOS and Android shortly thereafter. Mobile access was one of the major emphasis points in SharePoint 2016, along with hybrid cloud support and Office 365 support. \nIn a blog post, Microsoft announced Feature Pack 1 as a part of the November 2016 Public Update, which includes a number of new features. Administrative actions logging \nThis feature is for troubleshooting issues related to administrative changes, particularly in a multiple administrator set-up, by logging actions undertaken via the Central Administration website or the Management Shell. MinRole enhancements \nMinRole is the new topology in SharePoint Server 2016 that simplifies your deployment experience by taking the guesswork out of making sure services are running on the right servers. MinRole has two new server roles that are optimized for small and medium-sized server farms: the ability to run on just two servers or a high availability (HA) MinRole farm with just four servers, and ensuring that services are operating on the correct servers within a farm, based upon a set of predefined server roles. OneDrive for Business modern experience \nThe UI to OneDrive for Business gets an overhaul to more resemble the layout and functionality already found in its Office 365 counterpart. This particular feature will require an active software assurance contract at the time of updating to Feature Pack 1, or else it will be disabled. Custom tiles \nThe App Launcher is used to launch SharePoint and Office 365 workloads, and now it will allow users to add their own custom tiles that point to other SharePoint sites, external sites, legacy apps and more. OneDrive API \nNow you can build a file management and workflow app through the OneDrive API, which provides a set of HTTP services to connect your application to files and folders in OneDrive Personal, OneDrive for Business and document libraries in SharePoint Online. \nMicrosoft also offers a preview of two new hybrid capabilities. Hybrid Auditing enables audit logs from on-premises installations of SharePoint 2016 to be collected and uploaded to Office 365 for centralized auditing and reporting functions. \nThe second feature, called Hybrid Taxonomy, allows customers to bring their taxonomy store to Office 365, enabling a single source for creating and managing Terms, Term Sets and Groups through a single Managed Metadata Service.

      "text": "Markets Today Microsoft, Oracle Could Take a Beating in Trump's Tech World Geographically diversified tech behemoths could be negatively affected by Trump presidency while U.S.-centric companies are likely to benefit. Jaewon Kang Nov9,201611:11AMEST \nAs investors navigate through Donald Trump's shocking victory against Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election, there may already be potential winners and losers within the technology universe. Behemoths with international revenue streams are likely to be hurt by the Trump presidency while cybersecurity stocks can anticipate a boost, according to industry analysts. \nShort-term, movements in currency will affect companies with international revenue streams, Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson said by phone, adding that this has been a point of contention since the Brexit vote for companies with exposure to the pound. Salesforce.com ( CRM ) , for instance, translates its European revenue to the pound. \nNelson explained that long-term, potential changes to international trade agreement may hurt hardware manufacturers that source components from overseas such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) . \n\"While it may take time for the election results to change the overall demand environment, given valuations of many growth software names, we think the software market could trade with a multiple to the market,\" wrote RBC Capital Markets analysts Matthew Hedberg and Ross MacMillan in a note Tuesday night. \nTrump's victory may lead to a short-term pause in IT spending against the backdrop of weak equity markets, Hedberg and MacMillan further noted. \nTrump's exclusionist philosophy could bode well for U.S.-centric software companies such as Intuit ( INTU ) , Ultimate Software Group ( ULTI ) and Paylocity Holding ( PCTY ) , according to the analysts. On the flip side, it could hurt geographically diverse behemoths like Microsoft, Oracle ( ORCL ) , SAP ( SAP ) and VMware ( VMW ) . \nTurboTax owner Intuit sees about 95% of its revenue come from the U.S. while Ultimate Software and Paylocity both count 100% of their respective revenue from the U.S., according to data from FactSet. \nBy comparison, only about 47% of Microsoft's revenue stems from the U.S., with Mainland China contributing to around 10%. Japan makes up about 4% of the pie, Germany forms about 3.2%, United Kingdom is approximately 2.7% and France constitutes around 2.3%. \nOracle's pie of revenue looks quite similar. After the U.S. that makes up 47% of the software giant's revenue, the U.K. comes a close second with 6.3% of revenue and Mainland China making up approximately 6.2%. Japan contributes to around 4% of total revenue. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "  \nOver the last few months, Microsoft has been sharing a series of testimonials from professionals using its portfolio of Surface products to be more productive in their daily lives. From SMBs managers to attorneys to creatives , the company has been showcasing a lot of use cases proving that its hybrid devices, especially the Surface Pro range really deserves its “Pro” moniker. \nToday, Microsoft Surface Product Marketing Manager Sohana Punithakumar published another blog post to reveal how the Surface Pro 4 allows writer and crafter Kathy Capeluto to balance life, work and crafting. “I met Skimm’bassador Kathy Capeluto recently through our partnership with popular e-mail news brief theSkimm ,” explained Punithakumar, before adding that “she’s been a diehard Surface Pro 4 fan since she got it last year as a birthday present from her family.” Kathy Capeluto, writer, crafter and Surface Pro 4 fan. \nA former MacBook Pro user, Capeluto recalled her excitement when she discovered her birthday gift a year ago. “When I first started using Surface Pen, I shrieked with joy and immediately went to hug my mom to thank her for the gift she unknowingly gave me: my time back!” \nIndeed, the hybrid tablet allowed her to transform her crafting passion into a successful side business. A firm believer in the fact that “work craft balance” is better than “work life balance,” she used that same motto to create her own professional website that features some of her creations. \nAs she explains, being able to draw and edit her creations on the Surface Pro 4 allows her to save time, explore more creative options and manufacture better products \n“I draw on my Surface and then upload my work into the Cricut Design Space plug in, where I can clean up the images with ease thanks to the Surface Pen. Then my Cricut (imagine a printer that has a blade instead of an ink cartridge, and can cut cardstock, vinyl, and other materials) brings the digital shape to life.” Capeluto designs these photo booth props on her Surface and then cut them on her Cricut. \n“Surface Pro 4 is everything I never knew I needed and can’t live without now,” explained Capeluto. To learn more about her crafting activity, we invite you to check her creations on her seasonal Etsy shop . In this story stream:",

      "text": "  \nRohan Kumar, the General Manager at Database Systems Group, has taken to the Microsoft Azure blog to showcase the ways which In-Memory technology brings remarkable performance to Microsoft’s Azure SQL Database. \nOverall, Rohan highlights that in-memory technology allows you to achieve phenomenal performance with Azure SQL Database, reduced query execution time, and increased performance and reduced cost. He describes a few of these performance enhancements as follows: In-Memory OLTP increases throughput and reduces latency for transaction processing. Scenarios such as trading and gaming really see the performance benefits. Another common scenario is data ingestion from events or IoT devices. You can also use it to speed up caching, data load, and temp table and table variable scenarios. Clustered Columnstore Indexes reduce storage footprint (up to 10X) and improve performance for reporting and analytics queries. Use it with fact tables in your data marts to fit more data in your database and improve performance. Use it with historical data in your operational database to archive and be able to query up to 10 times more data.. \nThe post also addresses how several groups have been using In-Memory Technology and Microsoft’s Azure SQL Database. First up is Quorum, which was able to grow their business by onboarding new customers and supporting organizations at much larger scale, without spending more on more database throughput. Second is Quest, which was able to speed up the processing of requests and events. Third is M-Files which was able to allow its customers to gain insights and find information much faster. For more details, be sure to check out the full post on the Microsft Azure Blog . And, while you’re at it, check out the SQL In-Memory documentation .

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft is continuing their philanthropy, this time in collaboration with the Humble Bundle website. Both Mojang and Microsoft Studios are taking part in the Humble Blockjam Bundle, a live stream event with other developer studios to create games within a severe time limit of three days and raise money for charity. \nWatch live video from Mojang on www.twitch.tv \nHumble Bundle is known for their low prices and contributions to a variety of charities. Purchasing from their store gives 10% of the price to a charity of their choice. Similarly, their low priced video game bundles let users choose how much they’d like to attribute to the developer, site, and charity depending on how the customer thinks the money should be spent. \nFor this Humble Blockjam Bundle, the five teams are creating games for the Block by Block charity. This initiative fittingly uses their funds to build public spaces with designs created by residents in Minecraft. All 100% of the proceeds from these donations will be going to Block by Block to continue their work. \nOne game the five games features behind a charismatic gentleman on the train attempting to convince other passengers that they are stuck between the space/time continuum. Without spoilers, the developer mentioned on the stream that the story can turn good or bad depending on the individual. \n— Måns Olson (@MansOlson) November 9, 2016 \nThe Humble Blockjam Bundle started just yesterday and has another day and a half to go but it’s already gathered $19,000 dollars for Block by Block. While the games aren’t expected to be the highest quality, donators will be getting the five games at the end of the event on Friday at 3:00 a.m. PST. Not only will you get to watch them develop games and talk to developers, but tours of the Mojang office will be had with Youtube personalities like Stampy, StacyPlays, and Squaishey. \nYou can watch the streams of each developer team and donate to charity for some free games by visiting the Humble Bundle site . Don’t wait, it won’t last too much longer! In this story stream:",

      "text": "Gaming Xbox stick would've supported Xbox-to-TV game streaming Microsoft's scrapped Xbox streaming stick would've transformed HDTVs into a UWP conduit, allowing for wireless Xbox-to-TV game streaming and more \nRemember that Xbox streaming stick and set-top box that Microsoft was supposed to reveal at E3 2016 but didn't? New details have emerged about the duo, and they're actually pretty impressive. \nAccording to Windows Central , the streaming stick was codenamed \"Project Hobart,\" and was actually nixed at the last minute before E3. Internal sources at Microsoft say that Hobart basically would've been like Microsoft's very own $99 Chromecast-like dongle that offers basic video streaming (Netflix, Hulu, etc) with it's own secret weapon: Windows 10 UWP integration. \nArmed with UWP functionality, Hobart would've tapped into the Windows 10 ecosystem and allowed gamers to wirelessly stream Xbox One gameplay over to Hobart, effectively transforming an HDTV into a remote-play station. Hobart apparently had lower computational power to support UWP apps and could even play lightweight games. \nHere's what Windows insider Brad Sams originally leaked before E3 2016: \"Microsoft is going to announce at least two streaming devices at E3. There's going to be a very small device--the size of a Chromecast--and something that's a little bit larger. \n\"It'll be lunchbox-sized, but it won't be an Xbox One crammed into a teeny-tiny box, but I believe it's going to be a streaming device with more advanced functionality. [It'll likely be] a media device that plays lightweight Windows Store games, possibly like Apple TV.\" \nKeep in mind this is the streaming stick, not the lunch box-sized set-top box. Microsoft was supposed to reveal two Xbox streaming devices; Hobart, the stick-dongle, and another as-yet-unnamed device that'd basically act like a NVIDIA Shield or Sony's ill-fated PlayStation TV . \nI'd wager that the set-top box would have beefier specs and support wider functionality, possibly with external HDD support and even expandable memory to transform it into a mini-console of sorts. \nBut why did Microsoft kill the devices off? Surely a Windows 10 dongle would've been an amazing solution that would push the ecosystem even further by effectively transforming any HDTV into a UWP-ready conduit, complete with game-streaming, apps and built-in games. \nWindows Central guesses that Project Hobart ran off of Windows 10 IoT, and Microsoft has apparently had some pretty big problems getting its smaller wearable and IoT tech working on the OS itself. This led to Microsoft completely cancelling its new Band wearables . \nI fully expect Microsoft to optimize Hobart and release it sometime soon, likely in the coming year. A Windows 10-powered dongle and set-top box combo would be a huge boon for the platform, and it'd push the OS into a brand new frontier for complete household dominance.",

      "text": "As far as we know Microsoft has shelved their wearable ambitions, but the rumour is that prior to its cancellation Microsoft was working on a Microsoft Band 3, and as part of the effort attempted (and failed) to port Windows 10 IoT to the new device.\nSome further indication that Microsoft was still very recently working on their wearables project is a new patent application for a “WEARABLE PERSONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM” applied for as recently as the 11th July 2016 by the Xbox Design Labs. The patent is a continuation of a Oct. 29, 2012 patent of the same name, and in the latest application Microsoft fleshes out the details somewhat more, in particular concentrating on how the sensor/processing module would be removable and how it would be retained in the housing.\nParticulars noted include that the module would be inserted from the bottom of the frame and snap into a tongue and groove joint on the frame section.\nMicrosoft notes the sensor module would either have a concavity or gasket on the underside which would shield the optical sensor from outside light, allowing the sensor to read your pulse without interference.\nThe sensor module would then be removable by downward pressure until it “unsnaps” and could then be placed on a stand where it would attach magnetically, and would then be charged and synced as needed.\nMicrosoft holds a design patent for the exact shape of the device depicted above , suggesting they were actually going to release the device more or less as depicted.\nWhether this is still the case seems doubtful, given the shuttering of the Microsoft Band team, but hopefully at some point Microsoft will once again feel pressure to be part of the fitness wearable world.\nThe patent can be seen here .\n",

His father, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney. His late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International. Bill Gates - Early Life He had an early interest in software and began programming computers at the age of thirteen. In 1973, Bill Gates became a student at Harvard University, where he meet Steve Ballmer (now Microsoft's chief executive officer). While still a Harvard undergraduate, Bill Gates wrote a version of the programming language BASIC for the MITS Altair microcomputer .\nDid you know that as young teenagers Bill Gates and Paul Allen ran a small company called Traf-O-Data and sold a computer to the city of Seattle that could count city traffic? Bill Gates & Microsoft In 1975, before graduation Gates left Harvard to form Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. \ncontinue reading below our video How to Negotiate Your Bills Lower The pair planned to develop software for the newly emerging personal computer market.\nBill Gate's company Microsoft became famous for their computer operating systems and killer business deals. For example, Bill Gates talked IBM into letting Microsoft retain the licensing rights to MS-DOS an operating system, that IBM needed for their new personal computer . Gates proceeded to make a fortune from the licensing of MS-DOS . \nOn November 10, 1983, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, Microsoft Corporation formally announced Microsoft Windows , a next-generation operating system. \nOn January 1, 1994, Bill Gates married Melinda French Gates. They have three children. Bill Gates Philanthropist Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, have endowed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with more than $28.8 billion (as of January 2005) to support philanthropic initiatives in the areas of global health and learning.",

      "text": "Share By Mary Bellis \nIn July of 1980, IBM representatives met for the first time with Microsoft's Bill Gates to talk about writing an operating system for IBM's new hush-hush \"personal\" computer. \nIBM had been observing the growing personal computer market for some time. They had already made one dismal attempt to crack the market with their IBM 5100 . At one point, IBM considered buying the fledgling game company Atari to commandeer Atari's early line of personal computers. However, IBM decided to stick with making their own personal computer line and developed a brand new operating system to go with. IBM PC aka Acorn The secret plans were referred to as \"Project Chess\". The code name for the new computer was \"Acorn\". Twelve engineers, led by William C. Lowe, assembled in Boca Raton, Florida, to design and build the \"Acorn\". On August 12, 1981, IBM released their new computer , re-named the IBM PC. The \"PC\" stood for \"personal computer\" making IBM responsible for popularizing the term \"PC\". IBM PC Open Architecture The first IBM PC ran on a 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 microprocessor. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Ways to Improve Your Credit Score The PC came equipped with 16 kilobytes of memory, expandable to 256k. The PC came with one or two 160k floppy disk drives and an optional color monitor. The price tag started at $1,565, which would be nearly $4,000 today.\nWhat really made the IBM PC different from previous IBM computers was that it was the first one built from off the shelf parts (called open architecture) and marketed by outside distributors (Sears & Roebucks and Computerland). The Intel chip was chosen because IBM had already obtained the rights to manufacture the Intel chips. IBM had used the Intel 8086 for use in its Displaywriter Intelligent Typewriter in exchange for giving Intel the rights to IBM's bubble memory technology. IBM PC Man of the Year Less than four months after IBM introduced the PC, Time Magazine named the computer \"man of the year\"",

      "text": "\nIn today’s Ask the Admin , I look at Azure DNS, a new service from Microsoft that recently reached general availability.\nIt’s probably worth stating right from the get-go, that Microsoft’s Azure DNS service doesn’t allow you to purchase domain names from Microsoft. You’ll still need to pay a domain registrar a yearly fee for that privilege. But what Azure DNS does give you is the ability to use Microsoft’s infrastructure for resolving name queries for your domain’s zones.\n \n \nWhat Is a DNS Zone? If you own a domain name, such as acme.com, a DNS zone holds records for the domain. For example, www.acme.com and sharepoint.acme.com are both DNS zones of the acme.com domain. In this case, both of these zones could be used with applications hosted in the Azure cloud, so it might make sense to manage the DNS for these zones in Azure as well, where you can put DNS under an existing contract and manage the billing in one place. If you want to link a DNS zone created in Azure to the global DNS hierarchy, you’ll need to own the top-level domain (TLD) name.\nWhy Use Azure DNS? Unless your organization has multiple physical data centers, it’s not likely that you host your own external DNS. But if you do, and you are running unsupported versions of Windows Server or don’t have multiple physical locations, migrating to Azure DNS can bring much better reliability because of Microsoft’s global network of nameservers and Anycast routing, which automatically routes queries to the closest physical nameserver for improved performance.\nMicrosoft promises better responsiveness for apps hosted in Azure, when used in conjunction with Azure DNS. Additionally, if you update DNS records in Azure, these changes are quickly replicated across all Microsoft’s global nameservers, so you shouldn’t have to wait long for your changes to take effect.\nPricing Microsoft charges for each hosted DNS zone and the number of queries, meaning you only pay for what you use. Another advantage of billing based on the number of queries is that if required, Microsoft lets you set a short time-to-live (TTL) on DNS records, less than 60 seconds. Microsoft charges $0.50/per DNS zone a month and $0.40 for every million queries.\nFor more information about hosting DNS zones in Azure, see Microsoft Azure DNS on Microsoft’s website, and keep an eye out for a future Ask the Admin , where I’ll show you how to create a DNS zone in Azure, and how to point your DNS registrar’s nameserver records to point to Azure DNS.\nThe post Microsoft Azure: A First Look at Azure DNS appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior   @gcaweir · 4 seconds ago \nSeven weeks after fresh complaints emerged about a new battery issue affecting its Surface Pro 3 tablet , Microsoft finally released new firmware this week which it says has fixed the problem. \nIt was the second major issue for the Surface Pro 3's batteries this year. The first affected some devices that shipped with batteries manufactured by Simplo, while the more recent problem was confined to those with LGC batteries. In each case, only a limited number of the tablets was affected. \nUsers affected by the LGC battery issue described extremely rapid battery drain, with a 100% charge dropping to zero in as little as 90 minutes. Some devices were more seriously affected, with users reporting that their batteries weren't holding their charging at all , and that they were unable to use the tablet unless it was plugged into the mains. \nTheir frustrations grew as many claimed that Microsoft had been less than helpful, initially refusing to acknowledge that there was any issue affecting battery performance on its tablets for weeks. The problem was particularly troubling for those whose Surface Pro 3s were no longer under warranty, as Microsoft's support team offered them no option but to pay up to $450 USD or £400 GBP for an out-of-warranty replacement. \nAs InfoWorld noted in September, Microsoft had done exactly the same thing during the earlier Simplo battery issues, charging users hundreds of dollars for out-of-warranty replacements. It wasn't until after the problem began attracting headlines on tech sites , prompting Microsoft to finally acknowledge the issue - four months after users first began reporting it - that the company eventually refunded those charges. \nNow, with the release of its latest firmware update to resolve the newer LGC battery issue, Microsoft has said that it's already issued refunds to all eligible customers. \n\"We've gathered additional details about which customers were affected and are committed to making sure that the people who experienced this issue are taken care of,\" the company said. \"We have reached out to those customers and all refunds were processed in October 2016.\" \nIt further clarified that all customers \"who've been affected by this issue and who paid for an out-of-warranty exchange of their Surface Pro 3 were refunded the cost of their out-of-warranty exchange.\" \nHowever, if your device was affected by the LGC battery issue, and you paid for an out-of-warranty replacement, but you haven't received an email from Microsoft informing you that your refund is being processed, the company says that you should contact Surface support .

      "text": "Unlimited Digital Access: $1 for 8 weeks. \nBrad Smith, Microsoft’s president and the leader of the company’s legal and lobbying organization, has campaigned for an increase in the number of skilled workers the company can bring in to the country. \nMicrosoft, like many technology firms, has come to rely on guest workers who live in the U.S. under the H-1B visa program. During his campaign, Trump said he opposed the program, though his statements on the matter have also been contradictory . He, at times, indicated support for the visas, suggesting raising wages for visa holders and smoothing their path to receiving permanent residency. \nThe trade policy of a Trump administration could also concern Microsoft. \nAs a candidate, he opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the giant trade framework under consideration in Congress that Microsoft and much of American big business supported. He has struck a generally protectionist tone, and pledged to renegotiate existing trade deals. \nAt an event in September in Vancouver, B.C., Microsoft co-founder and board member Bill Gates said Microsoft was structured on the assumption that people, products and ideas could compete in an open global marketplace. \nThough he didn’t mention Trump by name, Gates said the rebuke to a more interconnected world dealt by the Brexit vote and “some other things” was worrying. \n“Microsoft and my foundation are really predicated on a huge amount of cooperation between all the different countries in the world,” Gates said. \nA Trump administration could be good for Microsoft’s pocket book, however. \nHis tax plan would lower the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent today. Trump has also proposed taxing foreign profits repatriated to the U.S. at a 10 percent rate. \nMicrosoft, which has structured its global operations to avoid U.S. taxes, at the end of June had more than $124 billion in income, untaxed in the U.S., held overseas. The company’s tax bill at the current rate were it to repatriate that sum would be $39 billion, the company says. \nMicrosoft didn’t immediately comment when asked about the implications of the incoming Trump administration for the company.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today announced that Azure SQL Database built-in In-Memory technologies are now generally available for the Premium database tier including Premium pools. The latest In-memory technology will help customers in optimizing the performance of transactional (OLTP), analytics (OLAP), as well as mixed workloads (HTAP). Microsoft highlighted that it will allow them to achieve great performance with Azure SQL Database – 75,000 transactions per second for order processing (11X perf gain) and reduced query execution time from 15 seconds to 0.26 (57X perf).\nPerformance and Cost Saving details:\nOrder processing benchmark (scale factor 100, with 400 clients) on P15 (the highest tier at the time of writing): 75,000 transactions per second (TPS) with In-Memory OLTP, compared with 6,800 TPS with traditional tables and stored procedures, which translates to 11X performance gain with In-Memory OLTP. Also lower performance tiers show impressive results. For a P2 with the same workload (scale factor 5, with 200 clients): 8,900 TPS with In-Memory OLTP, compared with 1,000. 30-40% performance gain just by replacing traditional table-valued parameters (TVPs) with memory-optimized TVPs: High Speed IoT Data Ingestion Using In-Memory OLTP in Azure Performance results for Columnstore indexes,\n\nUsing a P15 database (the highest performance tier at the time of writing), the query runs in 0.26 seconds with Columnstore, while it runs in 15 seconds when using traditional indexes with page compression. This translates to a performance gain of 58X ! Even with lower pricing tiers you see significant performance benefits: using a P1 database, the query runs in 4.8 seconds with Columnstore, while it runs in 27 seconds using traditional indexes with page compression. A performance gain of 5.6X without increasing the pricing tier! Read more about it here .\n",

      "text": "Faster than originally planned, the first batch of feature updates for SharePoint Server 2016 includes improved administrative logging and app launcher customizations. Making sure its customers don't fall too far behind the technology curve, Microsoft announced earlier this year that it would use a string of upcoming Feature Packs to help SharePoint Server 2016 keep pace with its rapidly evolving, cloud-based counterpart, SharePoint Online. The first Feature Pack was originally set for an early 2017 release, but in September the company said it was ahead of schedule and planned to release it sometime this month. As promised, this week Microsoft announced the release of Feature Pack 1 as part of the November 2016 Public Update for SharePoint Server 2016. Among the new features is administrative actions logging, which offers IT departments more visibility into the configuration changes made by SharePoint administrators. \"SharePoint administrators spend time troubleshooting administrative changes to their on-premises environment that can result in failure conditions or other undesired effects,\" blogged Bill Baer, senior product manager for the SharePoint team. \"To aid in troubleshooting, especially in the increasingly common multiple administrator set-ups, we have added logging around key SharePoint administrative actions performed either through the SharePoint Server 2016 Central Administration website or through the SharePoint Server 2016 Management Shell.\" Feature Pack 1 also contains a OneDrive API integration for seamless file operations and management between SharePoint and Microsoft's cloud file storage platform. Plus, users will notice that the software inherits the newer, more modern interface found in OneDrive for Business that allows for drag-and-drop file management and one-click sharing and uploading.Other features include two new MinRole server roles for small and midsize SharePoint server farms and customizable tiles in the App Launcher. New hybrid auditing and taxonomy capabilities are available in beta.Over at SharePoint Online, Microsoft announced it had enabled new capabilities that allow users to quickly create SharePoint team sites that are linked to Office 365 Groups in mere seconds. From the SharePoint homepage in Office 365, users can click on the Create Site button to kick off the process. \"A two-step creation wizard will fly out from the right,\" after which users select whether a group is public or private, the team site's classification (general purpose, internal use only, etc.) and its owners and members, explained the Microsoft SharePoint team in   A host of new admin controls help organizations keep a tight rein on the new feature. \"Admins can manage whether Create site appears at all, and when it does, admins can adjust who sees the Create Site button and what their provisioning experience should be (classic, modern or custom),\" stated the company. Editable team site homepages allow users to add, remove and reorganize a site's web parts on the fly, and new in-place navigation editing capabilities can be used to add web links to the left-hand navigation column and adjust their placement. A wizard-driven list and document library creation experience (New > List) reduces the time it would otherwise take to dig through menu items.",

      "text": "Unlimited Digital Access: $1 for 8 weeks. \nBrad Smith, Microsoft’s president and the leader of the company’s legal and lobbying organization, has campaigned for an increase in the number of skilled workers the company can bring in to the country. \nMicrosoft, like many technology firms, has come to rely on guest workers who live in the U.S. under the H-1B visa program. During his campaign, Trump said he opposed the program, though his statements on the matter have also been contradictory . He, at times, indicated support for the visas, suggesting raising wages for visa holders and smoothing their path to receiving permanent residency. \nThe trade policy of a Trump administration could also concern Microsoft. \nAs a candidate, he opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the giant trade framework under consideration in Congress that Microsoft and much of American big business supported. He has struck a generally protectionist tone, and pledged to renegotiate existing trade deals. \nAt an event in September in Vancouver, B.C., Microsoft co-founder and board member Bill Gates said Microsoft was structured on the assumption that people, products and ideas could compete in an open global marketplace. \nThough he didn’t mention Trump by name, Gates said the rebuke to a more interconnected world dealt by the Brexit vote and “some other things” was worrying. \n“Microsoft and my foundation are really predicated on a huge amount of cooperation between all the different countries in the world,” Gates said. \nA Trump administration could be good for Microsoft’s pocket book, however. \nHis tax plan would lower the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent, from 35 percent today. Trump has also proposed taxing foreign profits repatriated to the U.S. at a 10 percent rate. \nMicrosoft, which has structured its global operations to avoid U.S. taxes, at the end of June had more than $124 billion in income, untaxed in the U.S., held overseas. The company’s tax bill at the current rate were it to repatriate that sum would be $39 billion, the company says. \nMicrosoft didn’t immediately comment when asked about the implications of the incoming Trump administration for the company.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s Surface Pro 3 has been plagued with battery issues for the past year with devices from two battery suppliers – Simpl0 and LGC falling prey once after another. Microsoft is putting a stop to this with an update released to Surface Pro 3 owners this week. With the Surface Pro 3 System Firmware update – 11/07/2016 (07th of November), Microsoft confirms that this addresses the issue for the LGC devices which began reporting this fault in September.\nSurface Pro Embedded Controller Firmware v38.11.50.0 corrects an error that may occur on a limited number of Surface Pro 3 devices where the full charge capacity of the battery is misreported to the operating system and device firmware. This update corrects the firmware component that functions as a “fuel gauge” so that the battery capacity is accurately reported.\nAccording to Microsoft, the battery issue with the Surface pro 3s wasn’t due to the hardware, but due to the firmware. Rather than report the accurate battery life, the Surface would misreport the battery capacity to the system, preventing it from fully charging and therefore leading to perceived short battery life. Microsoft likens this to a faulty fuel gauge, whereby the fuel gauge shows it is full when it is in fact half full or less than that. The new update released this week fixes that logic issue, though it won’t be immediate. Over a series of charge and discharge sequences, the Surface should eventually return back to normal.\nThe update should be available now, and can be downloaded via the going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Check for updates.\nHave you received the software updates? Let us know in the comments below.",

      "text": "Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Creators Update Preview Build 14965 GO The new build is now available for insiders in the fast ring Nov 9, 2016 18:51 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has just released a new Windows 10 preview build for Windows insiders enrolled in the fast ring, giving them the chance to try out a few more features that are supposed to be part of the final version due in early 2017. Windows 10 build 14965, which is a preview of the Creators Update, comes with a virtual touchpad that makes it possible for users to move content on a second display from a tablet without the need for a mouse. All you have to do is connect to another monitor, PC, or TV, and in Action Center tap the Project quick action to use it. There’s a new “Show touchpad button” option that enables this feature. The Sticky Notes app has also been updated to version 1.2.9.0 and it comes with plenty of new features, including support for Insights to many more languages and regions, including Germany, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese. The app has also received plenty of bug fixes, and Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider program, says that all improvements are based on user feedback, with other new features currently in the pipeline also thanks to suggestions submitted by insiders. Windows Ink improvements Windows Ink also received a number of improvements, including new settings that include a link to the handwriting tool. The address bar in Registry Editor has been revamped with support for CTRL + L to get focus, as well as with shorthand notation for HKEY names (instead of typing out the full HKEY name). And last but not least, the Hyper-V VM experience has been improved with bugfixes, including for “an issue where depending on the zoom level selected, the VM window might not be created large enough to avoid scrollbars.” Just like it’s the case with the majority of preview builds, there are also known issues and other improvements, and you can check them out in full in the box below. This build is only available in the fast ring for the time being, but depending on feedback, Microsoft could ship it to other users as well. Windows 10 Build 14965",

      "text": "November 9, 2016 0 Microsoft just pushed Windows 10 Mobile Build 14965 after many rumors and teasers. Anyways, you can read the changes and fixes that the build brings by clicking here. The Build also brings its own share of known issues that you should know before trying to install Build 14965. Windows 10 Mobile Build 14965 Known Issues: If you used the previous ‘date change’ workaround to update to Build 14951 or Build 14955: Please don’t use it any longer! The Microsoft account (MSA) ticket on your device needs to expire and then you’ll be offered today’s build. If you changed your date by 30 years… you’ll want to do a device reset. You will be unable to install additional languages, keyboards, and speech packs on your phone for the next few weeks. If you have existing languages, keyboards, and speech packs installed – they will carry over when you update to new builds. You just can’t install any new ones. If you do a hard reset of your phone on these builds – you will also be unable to install additional languages, keyboards, and speech packs. You can use Windows Device Recovery Tool to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, install any languages, keyboards, and speech packs you need and then update to the latest build in the Fast ring as a workaround.

The build again doesn’t bring anything new in terms of features or major changes. Check the full official changelog below. Windows 10 Mobile Build 14965 Changelog: We fixed an issue where, when using Cortana in French (France or Canada), the “Prendre une <photo/video/selfie>” (take a picture, video, or selfie) command was redirecting to a Bing search rather than opening the Camera app as expected. We fixed an issue resulting in Cortana crashing if you typed “Create an appointment” then tapped on the resulting suggestion to “Create an appointment”. We improved the performance for English (India) text prediction. We fixed an issue in Data Usage Settings, where after selecting the data plan to be unlimited, it would still prompt to set a limit. We’ve also made it easier in the Data Usage Settings for those with dual SIM phones to differentiate between the cellular data use on each SIM, and fixed a few other polish issues, including that the sort by dropdown on the Usage Details page was unexpectedly wide. We fixed an issue where Narrator wasn’t giving feedback when adjusting sliders, for example in Settings, or in the Volume flyout. We fixed a migration issue resulting in Microsoft Edge to fail to launch for some Insiders after updating to a new build. Related ",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio News: Dell Smart Desk A Worthy Competition To Surface Studio? Joe Bacaron Nov 09, 2016 01:17 PM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Dell website \nThe new Dell Smart Desk is reportedly going to be unveiled during the CES 2017, and the buzz is that the new desktop would be worthy adversary to the Microsoft hybrid, Surface Studio. \nA new BTS clip was released introducing the new Dell Smart Desk, and it showed the same functionalities of the Surface Studio. It even has the same hockey puck-like device such as the Surface Dial that Microsoft is selling for an extra $100. \nThere's no word on what Dell's removable device is called. \nThe voice in the clip says, \"Our thoughts naturally transfer to paper. But there's a gap between what comes naturally and how we create digitally. Dell has changed that.\" \nThere's a bit of difference in the direction that Dell Smart Desk and the Surface Studio is going: the former opting to release two monitors that can be interfaced with various tools, while the Microsoft desktop features a hinged display and keyboard.   \nA spokesperson for Dell told PCMag , \"Dell energized the audience with a sneak peek of its smart desk concept in action, teasing its innovative functionality and the exciting potential it will bring to creators everywhere.\" \nIt's interesting that Dell Smart Desk will be revived now, just a week after the Surface Studio was introduced, when the technology was already two years old. \nThe price for the Dell Smart Desk will be a significant factor to be a worthy competition, however. The Surface Studio is already prohibitive at $2,999. Will Dell go the same route as Microsoft when it comes to cost?",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio Specs, Price News: Holiday Release Date Revealed Joe Bacaron Nov 09, 2016 01:16 PM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter website \nThe Microsoft Surface Studio release date has been announced to be on Dec. 15 this year, and that's good news to consumers or at least, to those who can afford it anyway. \nThe Microsoft Surface Studio is expected to carry a price tag of $2,999 upon the release date. The bundle will come with the Surface Pen. But people also need to buy the accessory, the Surface Dial, for another $100. \nAs to the specs , the 28-inch screen has a PixelSense display with 192 dpi resolution, 10 point multi-touch, and 3:2 aspect ratio and 6th Generation Intel Core i5 or i7. \nIt also comes with either an i5 Intel 8GB: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M 2GB GDDR5 memory, i7 Intel 16GB: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M 2GB GDDR5 memory or i7 Intel Core processor, up to 4 GB of NVIDIA GeForce GPU. You can choose from the 8GB, 16GB or 32GB RAM with Rapid Hybrid Drive options of 1TB or 2TB.   \n\"Surface Studio is a device created around you and your thoughtfully designed workspace,\" the Microsoft website said. \"The minimal and modern design sits perfectly on your well thought out desk, with clean lines and a small footprint.\" \nOne of the innovations for the new hybrid device is the Surface Dial, which triggers a color palette that can be very beneficial for graphic artists since they can pick and choose from the slew of options on the screen. It also provides direct access to a menu of shortcut tools, which again makes it easy for the user. \nPre-orders are now available ahead of the Microsoft Surface Studio release date on Dec. 15.",

      "title": "Microsoft to Build Out, Probably Upgrade, Boydton Data Center",
      "text": "In the fifth expansion to its data centers there in six years, Microsoft will invest another $251.6 million to expand its data center facility in Boydton, Virginia, located in Mecklenburg County on the state’s south border between Richmond and Raleigh, North Carolina. This according to announcement from Gov. Terry McAuliffe, just hours after the former Democratic National Committee chair absorbed the news of his party’s stunning losses in the national election.\n“Microsoft has now invested nearly $2 billion in its Mecklenburg facility and created over 250 jobs since 2010,” stated Gov. McAuliffe, in a statement released Wednesday afternoon.\nMicrosoft’s move comes just weeks after unveiling “Generation 5” of its modular data center design, at its cloud farm in Quincy, Washington, about a hundred miles east of corporate headquarters. This design blueprint replaces the compact IT-Pre-Assembled Container (IT-PAC) design pattern, on which the Boydton data center was originally built.\nAlthough Microsoft has yet to confirm this news publicly (governors often get to reveal the news first), it would appear that Microsoft has a plan under way to replace IT-PAC with Gen-5, with Boydton being next on the company’s agenda.\nIT-PAC was an ambitious project which first began in Boydton in 2010 , comprised of lightweight steel sheds containing pre-constructed compute and power units. At first, they looked like camper trailers, or changing rooms for movie stars on location. Three years later, the system looked somewhat more modernized , like efficient, lopsided building blocks back-to-back in several rows.\nOpen air contributed to the cooling apparatus of IT-PAC, appearing to rely on the environment itself to help out with maintenance and upkeep. That air was pumped in through a damp film, cooling it along the way, and reducing water consumption to a small fraction of traditional data centers.\nThe company began rolling out IT-PAC in Quincy after having drawn complaints from state officials, both for its tremendous power draw and its reliance upon diesel generators for supplemental power. According to a 2012 New York Times report , prior to IT-PAC’s rollout, Microsoft had been granted enough permits by the Washington State Ecology Dept. to produce one-third the wattage of a nuclear power plant.\nBut “Generation 5” moves servers out of the shed and back onto the slab. It does borrow many of the cooling lessons learned from IT-PAC, but reportedly using a design that doesn’t require the use of potable water.\nIT-PAC did have the benefit of being upgradeable and expandable in modular ways. It was that program that permitted Microsoft to re-invest in Virginia repeatedly, beginning with the initial $499 million expansion, followed by $150 million in 2011, $348 million in 2013, $346.7 million in 2014, and $402.4 million in 2015, according to the Governor’s office.\nAt press time, Microsoft had not responded to Data Center Knowledge’s request for information, though we will update you when it does.",

      "text": "Technology Apple, Microsoft, Cisco Eye Trump Overseas Cash Tax Plan Apple is the overseas cash king, but President-elect Trump has proposed a measure that would ease the tax hit on U.S. companies bringing cash back to the country. (Apple) Reprints \nApple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress. \nTrump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Cisco and Oracle ( ORCL ). \nTrump's cash repatriation proposal \"could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,\" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. \"The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.\" \nMoody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015. \n\"We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,\" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. \" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments. \n\"More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.\" \nTrump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates. \n\"Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,\" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report. \nWalter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate \"is not likely to block\" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House. \nPritchard says Adobe Systems ( ADBE ), Autodesk ( ADSK ), Citrix Systems ( CTXS ), Red Hat ( RHT ) and VMware ( VMW ) are among companies that could bring back cash. \n\"We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,\" Pritchard said in a research report. Drug Companies Also Have Lots Of Cash Overseas \nThe biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen ( AMGN ), Medtronic ( MDT ) and Gilead Sciences ( GILD ), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Coca-Cola ( KO ). \n\"While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,\" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report. \nAmong big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today . Meanwhile, Apple was down a fraction to 110.88 and Alphabet slipped 0.8% 805.59. Microsoft shares dipped 0.5% to 60.17. \nRELATED:",

Microsoft \nHere's a little something to get excited about if you're a Windows 10 watcher on the lookout for new features. \nMicrosoft on Wednesday released its latest Windows 10 Creators test version , which includes a virtual touchpad that lets you control external monitors from tablets without having to attach a mouse. \n\"Use it just like you would a physical touchpad to control content on the connected screen,\" software engineer Dona Sarkar said in a blog announcing the new build. \nTo enable the feature, you press and hold on the taskbar and select \"show touchpad button.\" \nOtherwise, there are very few new features in the test build, according to Mary Jo Foley, who watches Microsoft for CNET sister site ZDNet. She noted some Sticky Note updates, including support for \"Insights\" in more languages. \"Microsoft also improved Windows Ink Workspace in this build with various tweaks,\" she said.",

      "text": "Yet again – Microsoft updates the Surface Pro 3 to fix battery drain issues Yet again – Microsoft updates the Surface Pro 3 to fix battery drain issues Posted: Tags : Windows - Windows + Microsoft - Microsoft + Tablets - Tablets + A while ago, Microsoft Surface Pro 3 users whose tablets ran on Simplo and LG Chem batteries complained the cells drained within a couple of hours before becoming completely incapable of charging, rendering the tablet unusable unless it's plugged in. Now, Microsoft has developed a fix and made it available for Surface Pro 3 users. The company explains that the update \"corrects the firmware component that functions as a fuel gauge so that the battery capacity is accurately reported.\" Indeed, the problem was in misreporting the charge capacity of the battery to the operating system and the device's firmware. According to Microsoft, the fix will make the Surface Pro 3 self-correct the reported full charge capacity over several charge and discharge cycles and let the device operate on battery power. The update can be installed by going to Start > Settings > Update & security > Windows update , and performing a Check for Updates . The firmware which fixes the issue is dated 11/7/2016. For the installation, the Surface Pro 3 has to be plugged into AC power, and all USB devices and external monitors must be disconnected. The AC power should not be disconnected while the firmware update is being applied. Microsoft also reassured users that the batteries of affected tablets haven't been damaged in any way. It also recommends installing the update on all Surface Pro 3 tablets, regardless of whether they exhibit battery problems or not.This is about the third time Microsoft has issued an update to fix draining batteries on Surface Pro 3 tablets. The bug was present on launch units and a second fix was issued in August this year. ALSO READ",

      "text": "Why does Microsoft Word come with so many fonts that nobody ever uses? — Syd It’s not that nobody ever uses them, it’s that 99 percent of the available fonts in your word-processing program of choice are only used by college students drafting résumés for their first internships. For example, the SDSU class of 2018 uses up an entire society’s worth of Papyrus every year. If anybody out there is wondering how this falls beneath the purview of hipster knowledge (and I admit, probably nobody is wondering that, but just in case you are), I refer you to...I don’t know, how about any sign for any business opened since about 2008? Hipsters love typography. I should qualify that a bit. We don’t love typography in the sense that we would like to work at a printer, preparing plates and watching those big spools of paper spin around. We love typography in the sense that we enjoy seeing our small-batch whiskey bottles wrapped in labels that wouldn’t have looked out of place in 1932. You might say we love typography to the tune of $24/ounce, if you’re the cynical bastard type; but I prefer to think of it as a love founded on tradition but without the needlessly difficult or dangerous parts.",

      "text": "Microsoft pulls plug on Windows 7 and 8.1 By Staff Writer | Nov 09, 2016 01:48 PM EST facebook tweet   (Photo : Richard Levine / Getty Images) The newly opened Microsoft flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York, on Tuesday, November 10, 2015. Microsoft announced that Windows 10 is now on 200 million devices around the world since its launch in July 2015. \nTech giant Microsoft recently announced in its website that it will stop providing new licenses for Windows 7 Professional and Windows 8.1 to Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEM s). After ending retail sales of the Operating Systems to consumers in 2014, this \" End of Sales \" officially ends the run for Windows 7 and 8 . Advertisement \nTechnically, this means that companies like Dell , which manufacture computers, would not be getting new licenses for Windows 7 and 8 anymore, though it could still use the ones they currently have in stock. All future devices would come with Windows 10 pre-installed, and the \"downgrade rights\", which gave consumers an opportunity to revert to an older OS, would not be available anymore, as Forbes reports. \nVenture Beat points out that this is the company's way of slowly phasing out their old Operating Systems, much like what happened to Windows 98 , XP and Vista in the past. This also shifts the spotlight to Windows 10 , the company's current OS, which has not been well-received by users at the moment. Advertisement \nMainstream support for Windows 7 ended in 2015, while the extended support will be available until 2020. Mainstream Support covers warranty claims and bug fixes, as Extended Support only handles security updates. For Windows 8 , mainstream support will be available for users until 2018, and extended support up to 2023. Windows 10 will still have until 2020 for the mainstream support to end, and 2025 for the extended support. \nManufacturers are still selling devices with Windows 7 and 8 pre-installed in the market, allowing them to deplete their stock of the Operating Systems. \nWindows 7 , one of most-loved Operating Systems, was released in October 2009, being a replacement to the Windows Vista . Windows 8 was made available to the public on October 2012. Its update, Windows 8.1 came out the following year. Windows 10 , released in July 2015, is boasted by Microsoft to be different from its predecessors. Labeled as a \"service\", Microsoft claims that Windows 10 can be upgraded with new features, such as the recent Anniversary Update back in August 2016.",

      "text": "Tweet \nMany people use Google Chrome, and rightfully so. The cross-platform web browser works brilliantly, and is super-fast. Plus, the search-giant's browser is very secure too, right? Not so fast... \nToday, Sophos drops a bombshell by revealing that scammers are actively targeting Chrome users by leveraging a bug. These bad guys pose as Microsoft tech support and display an in-browser message that says the user's computer is infected with \"Virus Trojan.worm! 055BCCAC9FEC\". To make matters worse, Google has apparently known about the exploit for more than two years and simply failed to patch it. \n\"Tech support scammers have started exploiting a two-year-old bug in Google Chrome to trick victims into believing their PC is infected with malware. The bug was discovered in Chrome 35 in July 2014 in the history.pushState() HTML5 function, a way of adding web pages into the session history without actually loading the page in question. The developer who reported the issue published code showing how to add so many items into Chrome’s history list that the browser would effectively freeze\", says Sophos. \nThe company further says, \"beating the attack isn't hard. Users can either close Chrome using the Task Manager or, in cases where the browser is using up so much processor power that Task Manager doesn’t appear, by rebooting the computer. The chances of encountering this particular scam are small -- it's only been spotted on a single website -- but its existence underlines how small bugs that don’t seem terribly important may nevertheless be abused by cyercriminals down the line\". \nSophos shares the full fake message below. Remember, the computer is not really infected, scammers are trying to trick the user. \nMicrosoft Identification-Malware infected website visited. Malicious data transferred to system from unauthorized access. System Registry files may be changed and can be used for unethical activities. \nSystem has been infected by Virus Trojan.worm! 055BCCAC9FEC -- Personal information (Bank Details, Credit Cards and Account Password) may be stolen. \nWhile all Chrome users are at risk, the scammers are currently pretending to be Microsoft tech support, making Windows users the real at-risk people. In other words, this scam would not likely be effective on users of macOS or Linux-based operating systems. Still, scammers could alter the scheme to target other operating systems too. \nEven though the risk is rather low, Google still owes it to all its Chrome users to have a safe and secure browser with a focus on security. Ignoring a bug for two years is simply unacceptable. Hopefully the company patches the 2014 bug soon. \nDoes this lower your confidence in the overall safety of Google Chrome? Tell me in the comments.",

More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Computerworld | Nov 9, 2016 9:19 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft announced last Friday that it is bringing Access , the personal database program from its Office productivity suite, to Office 365 Business and Business Premium plans. It has been available for other 365 subscriptions, including ProPlus, E3 and E5 subscriptions, and the consumer plans. \nAccess will be included in the next client update to Business/Business Premium subscribers, which will roll out between the beginning of December and the end of January. Customers on the deferred channel will have to wait until June 2017. \nThe big question is where will it fit in. Access has become an afterthought in the Office suite as Microsoft has shifted all of its efforts to SQL Server. There is even an Express Edition designed to run on a low-resource system. But Microsoft has given some indication of its strategy in the blog post announcing the news of availability. Access is a great database management solution for small businesses because it makes collecting and storing data accessible on the desktop—without requiring support from an IT administrator. Access enables users to develop business applications, collect and analyze data from multiple sources, and track any kind of data, from a customer contact list to robust asset management. \nThere will also be new enterprise data connectors for users on the ProPlus, E3 and E5 plans. These include OData Feed, Dynamics CRM, Salesforce and Amazon Redshift. They will be made available in early 2017, and Microsoft promises more on the way. \nOffice 365 Business and Business Premium are the SMB versions of Office 365, costing just $8.00 or $12.50 per user per month, respectively. The subscription includes all of the traditional Office apps -- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook and Publisher -- and now Access. \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

Not so fast... Today, Sophos drops a bombshell by revealing that scammers are actively targeting Chrome users by leveraging a bug. These bad guys pose as Microsoft tech support and display an in-browser message that says the user's computer is infected with \"Virus Trojan.worm! 055BCCAC9FEC\". To make matters worse, Google has apparently known about the exploit for more than two years and simply failed to patch it. \"Tech support scammers have started exploiting a two-year-old bug… [Continue Reading]",

      "text": "  \nThe Surface Pro 4 has been out for a while, and its predecessor, the Surface Pro 3, has been more or less left in the sidelines. This is much to the distress of people who are still using the SP3, considering the device has been suffering from some battery life issues recently. Thankfully, Microsoft has released the first firmware release for the SP3 since August – one that hopes to fix those battery issues and put the Surface back in working order. \nv38.11.50.0 corrects an error that may occur on a limited number of Surface Pro 3 devices where the full charge capacity of the battery is misreported to the operating system and device firmware. This update corrects the firmware component that functions as a “fuel gauge” so that the battery capacity is accurately reported. See Surface Pro 3 Battery FAQ for more information. \nThe update came out a few days ago – November 7th, to be exact. The issue was only really a problem for a select few devices, but it was still an inconvenience that needed to be dealt with. \nIt’s probably going to be a while before the Surface Pro 3 gets any more in the way of firmware updates, considering Microsoft has moved on to other hardware quite a while ago. If more serious issues do come up, however, take this firmware as reassurance that Microsoft is dedicated to keeping the SP3 experience functional.  ",

The sudden sweep of red states was an unexpected game changer in the election and almost everybody missed the mark, even Bing. \nBing Predicts is known for calculating the outcomes of popular global events such as sports championships, entertainment awards, and legislative elections. In this particular case, Bing saw fit to grant Clinton the win with a comfortable margin. We even saw Bing Predicts give as high as 90% probability in the lady’s favor. But as the night went on, it dwindled to leave Trump with the majority of electoral votes and the presidency on the horizon. Election 2016 Predictions By State \nWinBeta reached out to Microsoft for an answer to exactly how Bing was so far off the outcome. A spokesperson replied: \n“Bing Predicts uses several sources including search, web, social data, third-parties and more to inform predictions. True to the nature of all predictions, we can never guarantee 100% accuracy.” \nBing wasn’t the only prediction to guess wrongly. In fact, most major news and analysist predictions were shocked to see just how wrong they were when the results came in from yesterday’s polls. \nWhat does this mean for Bing Predicts? Probably nothing. Simply put, the system can only calculate with data that it is given like we explained here . After all, computers are only as intelligent as mankind creates them to be.  ",

      "text": "Emio’s PS4 ‘Elite’ Controller Will Be Available Tomorrow  21 PST \nLast year Microsoft took the wraps off the Xbox Elite controller and while it was pretty damn expensive as far as controllers are concerned, it was also pretty well-received as last we checked, back in June earlier this year Microsoft actually managed to make a million units , which they obviously would not do if there was no demand for it. \nSo where’s Sony’s answer to the Xbox Elite controller? Unfortunately as far as official controllers are concerned, Sony does not have an answer to that. Instead it seems that we’d have to turn to third-parties for that as Emio has recently unveiled its own Elite PS4 controller that is scheduled for a release tomorrow, the 10th of November. \nInterestingly enough the design of Emio’s controller greatly resembles that of the Xbox Elite. It will feature customizable D-Pads, joysticks, rear paddles, interchangeable thumb thicks and rear control paddles, d-pad, and more. Basically it’s the PS4 version of the Xbox Elite controller, although we guess we would have preferred an official Sony version, but this version doesn’t look too shabby. \nIn terms of pricing it is more affordable than the Xbox Elite as it is priced at $90 versus the $150 of the Xbox Elite when it was first released. If you’d like to get your hands on it, then head on over to Amazon to place your pre-order. \nFiled in Gadgets > Gaming . Read more about PS4 and Sony . Related Articles",

      "text": "Xbox One S Helps Microsoft Outsell PS4 in Australia   Tyler Treese \nWhile detractors will claim that the Xbox One S is just a stopgap until Scorpio is released in 2017, even they can’t deny that it’s been a very successful one. The slimmer and 4K Blu-Ray compatible system has helped Microsoft outsell Sony recently in many regions. That trend continues down under, as the NPD Group has released sales data for Australia, where the Xbox One has been the best-selling console from August to October. \nWhile exact sales numbers are not available, we do know that the Xbox One was the best selling console from August 1 to October 30. The Xbox One S certainly helped sales, but a strong software line-up also convinced Australian gamers to buy an Xbox One. Forza Horizon 3 (which coincidentally is set in Australia) is now the best-selling Xbox One game of this year. \nHere’s what Microsoft Australia’s Xbox Business Lead Jeremy Hinton had to say about the sales: \n“We’d like to thank our fans for their continued support and passion for Xbox in Australia. It’s great to see such enthusiasm for the new Xbox One S & Forza Horizon 3 , as well as the range of exclusive bundles including Gears of War 4 , Battlefield 1 , FIFA 17 , and Minecraft – all of which are available now. With the upcoming launches of Dead Rising 4 this December, and Halo Wars 2 in February 2017, there has never been a better time to be an Xbox gamer” \nConsole sales are about to get even more interesting as Sony is releasing the PS4 Pro this week. Sony’s 4K-capable gaming system definitely will cater to the same market, although it can’t play 4K Blu-Rays, so movie buffs will still have a reason to pick up Microsoft’s “all-in-one home entertainment system.” \nLet us know in the comments if you think the PS4 Pro will reinvigorate the hardware sales for Sony, and if the Xbox One Australia sales are worth worrying about.",

      "text": "Microsoft says it will push for diversity and security from the Trump administration Posted Facebook’s   \nAlthough Donald Trump’s presidential campaign never netted much support from tech companies, at least one company is now congratulating him on his election victory. \n“Every president-elect deserves our congratulations, best wishes and support for the country as a whole. The peaceful transition of power has been an enduring and vital part of our democracy for over two centuries, and it remains so today,” Microsoft chief legal officer Brad Smith wrote in a blog post . \nSmith said that Trump’s victory was driven by economic disparity, noting that job growth has not grown evenly for those who have college degrees and those who do not. Trump’s supporters felt “left out and left behind,” he added, noting that Microsoft will work to create new jobs to address the gap. \nHowever, Smith’s post also offers a quiet repudiation of Trump’s anti-immigration and anti-encryption stances. \n“As we think societally about these new opportunities to address those who have been left behind, it’s critically important that we appreciate the continuing national strengths that serve the country so well,” Smith wrote, noting that diversity has a place in strengthening the economy and encouraging job growth. “We’re committed to promoting not just diversity among all the men and women who work here, but the type of inclusive culture that will enable people to do their best work and pursue rewarding careers.” \nHis comments on diversity were echoed at eBay, where CEO Devin Wenig issued a memo to employees reminding them of founder Pierre Omidyar’s immigrant background. “As I travel to our offices around the world, I have the privilege to interact with people of countless nationalities and backgrounds. This diversity is one of the most valuable assets we have as we drive our business forward,” Wenig wrote . \nSmith also subtly went to bat for consumer privacy and access to encryption (Trump has called for tech companies, most notably Apple, to provide backdoor access to the government). \n“People will not use technology they do not trust. We’re committed to developing technology that is secure and trusted, both for Americans and for people around the world,” he wrote, referencing Microsoft’s recent legal victories against the Justice Department on these issues. “As we’ve won the cases we’ve brought, we’ve been reminded of one of this country’s greatest strengths, its strong Constitution, independent judiciary, and the overarching rule of law.” 0",

      "text": "In trade-dependent Washington, where the sale of Microsoft software, Boeing jets and Starbucks coffee to other countries helps fuel the regional economy, a Trump presidency could have large impacts.\nGiven President-elect Donald Trump’s statements against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and other trade pacts, “it’s pretty clear that we are not going to see any new trade agreements in the near future,” said Debra Glassman, senior lecturer at the University of Washington Foster School of Business.\nShe predicts there will be no ratification of the TPP, no conclusion to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations, and possibly a return “to an era of greater protectionism.”\n“Countries will look out for their own interests. This will result in a patchwork of trade barriers — and that’s difficult for businesses. For every market they sell into, there will be different rules,” she said.\n  Though Glassman is not predicting any specific effects on Washington state, “the thing about trade is that any change in trade has winners and losers. You might protect a certain set of manufacturing jobs but you’d lose jobs in transportation and logistics.”\n“There’s going to be a reallocation of jobs across industries if we move back to a more protectionist international system,” she said.\nChris Mefford, president and CEO of economic development consulting firm Community Attributes, said, Trump’s criticism of the Ex-Im Bank threatens “a huge asset that the Boeing Company relies on.”\n”I don’t think he gets the role of trade in our global economy,” Mefford said. “He’s alienated key global trade partners including Mexico and Canada.\nMefford also said he believes Trump’s comments on diversity, immigration and women could make it more difficult to attract work talent from around the world. \n“These are real, real issues. These are not just moral high ground issues,” he said. \nJanet I. Tu: 206-464-2272 or jtu@seattletimes.com . On Twitter @janettu .

      "title": "Microsoft Nixes Its Project Hobart Streaming Stick",
      "text": "Project Hobart, the company's $99 streaming device, met an unceremonious end as its hardware plans shifted. During the E3 2016 conference in June, Microsoft unveiled is trimmer, 4K video-enabled Xbox One S and teased the late-2017 release of its Project Scorpio games console with full 4K gameplay. Noticeably missing was the rumored Xbox TV streaming stick. A Windows Central report suggests that the early leak of rival Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro, also capable of producing 4K visuals, sent ripples across the Xbox group, causing them to rethink their hardware plans. Microsoft's streaming stick, codenamed \"Project Hobart,\" was to be a $99 dongle that could be used to stream Xbox One or Project Scorpio content over WiFi. The device would have enough computing power to run (UWP) Universal Windows Platform apps and games with modest requirements. According to the report, Microsoft was about to order the manufacture of 300,000 units and launch the device after E3. However, Sony appears to have thrown a wrench into those plans.Microsoft wasn't originally planning to announce Project Scorpio at the conference, but the Sony PlayStation 4 announcement at the major video game industry expo unsettled the company's hardware strategy, stated the report. In the end, a promotional Project Scorpio was shown and Hobart was nowhere to be seen.Last month, Microsoft pulled its Band 2 fitness wearable , amid rumblings that the company was calling quits on the product line. \"We have sold through our existing Band 2 inventory and have no plans to release another Band device this year,\" a spokesperson told eWEEK's Todd R. Weiss. \"We remain committed to supporting our Microsoft Band 2 customers through Microsoft Stores and our customer support channels and will continue to invest in the Microsoft Health platform, which is open to all hardware and apps partners across Windows, iOS, and Android devices.\" Struggling to get the device to run Windows 10—Band 2 and its predecessor use custom firmware—Microsoft reportedly disbanded the team that was making the attempt. The company also pulled the Band SDK (software development kit). Despite these setbacks, Microsoft recently unveiled plenty of new hardware last month. One of the highlights of the company's Windows 10 event on Oct. 26 in New York City was the new Surface Studio all-in-one PC. Aimed at \"creators\" and treading into Apple territory , the device features an expansive 28-inch touch- and stylus-enabled display that can be positioned into an angle similar to that of a drafting table. Another attention grabber was Microsoft's new Surface Dial. When placed on the Surface Studio, the puck-like peripheral can be tapped and spun, actions that sprout on screen contextual menus, radial color pickers and other tools in drawing and image editing programs. Microsoft also refreshed its Surface Book, the company's answer to the MacBook Pro (also refreshed late last month ), Apple's premium laptop. While it boasts the same design as its predecessor, the new Surface Book with Performance Base features newer, more powerful sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processors, up to 1 TB of storage, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M GPU and up to 16 GB of memory.",

      "text": "November 08, 2016 Patch Tuesday: Adobe, Microsoft patches actively exploited zero-day Deploying fixes for browsers, graphics components and Office will be a top priority for most administrators. \nMicrosoft and Adobe released security updates this Patch Tuesday which patched several critical vulnerabilities including zero-days that were actively being exploited in the wild. \nMicrosoft issued 14 bulletins , including six vulnerabilities that were rated as “Critical” and eight that were rated as “Important.” The patch included a zero day that was actively being exploited in the wild. The zero-day is located in Window's Kernel-mode drivers which was used in conjunction with a recently patched Adobe flaw to launch a low volume spearphishing campaign which sought to take control of an infected systems, Microsoft reported . \nThree of the bulletins contained public disclosures and the vulnerabilities that affect Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps, Microsoft SQL Server, Internet Explorer, and even Adobe Flash Player. \nMicrosoft users are encouraged to download the latest versions of their software and ensure all of their applications are up to date. \nThe Adobe Security update patched nine critical vulnerabilities in its Flash Player which affect the Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Chrome OS platforms, and one vulnerability in the and a low level vulnerability in the Adobe Connect which affects the Windows platform. \nThe updates resolve type confusion vulnerabilities and resolve use-after-free vulnerabilities that could each lead to code execution. Users are encouraged to upgrade to Flash Player 23.0.0.207 for Windows and Mac and to Flash Player 11.2.202.644 for Linux, Adobe reported . \nThe Microsoft vulnerability which was exploited in the wild was spotted by Google which typically gives vendors 60 days to patch any vulnerability that is discovered privately however, because the flaw was actively being exploited the timeline was reduced to seven days. \n\"While Adobe issued a patch almost immediately, Microsoft was not able to before Google disclosed the vulnerability publicly,” Trustwave Researcher Karl Sigler said in a Nov. 8 blog post. “The fact that these vulnerabilities were being actively exploited in the wild changed Google's typical disclosure policy.” \nDeploying fixes for browsers, graphics components and Office will be a top priority for most administrators, Tripwire Security Researcher Craig Young told SC Media. \n“All of these components are affected by one or more code execution vulnerabilities Microsoft has classified as highly exploitable,” Young said. “These are of the highest priority due to the fact that the vulnerabilities can potentially be triggered through normal web browsing activities giving an external attacker a way into networks.” Topics:",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft quietly fixes second Surface Pro 3 battery problem Microsoft has issued a firmware fix meant to fix a second Surface Pro 3 battery issue affecting some users. | Topic: Windows 10 \nMicrosoft issued a firmware fix to a second battery issue affecting some Surface Pro 3 devices on November 7. \nOfficials didn't make much of the update meant to address battery problems experienced by some with Surface Pro 3 devices with LGC batteries. (I wouldn't have seen it without noticing a Neowin post on the fix. ) But on November 8, \"Greg\" a Microsoft Surface Team Forum moderator, let users know that Microsoft had identified a fix for the issue and made it available via Windows Update . \nMicrosoft officials acknowledged a second battery issue affecting some Surface Pro 3 users in late September . This acknowledgement came after a firmware fix for a different Surface Pro 3 battery issue experienced by some with devices using Simplo batteries. Microsoft issued a firmware fix meant to address those with Simplo devices suffereing from extreme battery-drainage issues in August. \nAfter the August fix was provided, a number of users with LGC batteries in their Surface Pro 3 devices began reporting they were noticing battery degradation. Microsoft officials said at that time that the August firmware fix was not the culprit. \nThe November \"System Firmware Update -- 11/7/2016\" is meant to fix the problems experienced by those with LGC batteries.Microsoft also published a \"Suface Pro 3 Battery FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for the Surface Pro Embedded Controller Firmware Update\" that is meant to provide questions and answers about the Surface Pro 3 battery issues users are reporting. \nMicrosoft officials described the problem as affecting \"a limited number of Surface Pro 3 owners\" who have found that \"their battery can no longer hold a charge, and it looks like the battery capacity has diminished.\" The firmware update \"corrects the logic in the firmware component that functions as the 'fuel gauge' for the Surface Pro 3 batter, so that the actual battery capacity on devices with this particular part is accurately reported,\" the FAQ states.\" \nOnce this fix is applied to Surface Pro 3, the reported full charge capacity will self-correct over the next several charge and discharge cycles,\" the FAQ adds. Surface Pro 3 users who've installed earlier fixes meant to address battery-discharge issues are recommended to install this November update, as it replaces the one released in late August, the FAQ says. Even those Surface Pro 3 users who have not experienced battery issues should apply the update, Microsoft recommends. \nMicrosoft officials said this is a problem unique to Surface Pro 3 devices and that other Surface device owners should not experience the problem. Users who paid for an out-of-warranty exchange for the Surface Pro 3 battery issues will get a refund , the FAQ states. Microsoft officials said they have reached out to those customers and \"all refunds were processed in October 2016.\" Read this",

      "text": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tried to find something nice to say about the election Playing it safe share Yesterday, the US voted to elect Donald Trump as its next president, and no shortage of tech industry figures have taken time today to publicly melt down in interviews with the press and on Twitter. Venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar wants California to secede and Slack CEO Stuart Butterfield said he was “heartbroken.” Meanwhile, Facebook is on the defensive, refusing to acknowledge that its algorithmic News Feed may have had an adverse effect on the public’s ability to digest unbiased information during the election cycle . Over in Redmond, Microsoft is just being Microsoft. In a statement posted to LinkedIn this afternoon , CEO Satya Nadella provided perhaps the safest series of thoughts one could possibly have about the outcome of last night’s race and the prospective path of the country. It began with the revelation that, “Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US.” Indeed we did, Satya. An election was had. There was a winner, and a loser. Votes were cast, and some counted earlier than others. The statement goes on: The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. One can only hope “interest” was “truly shared among Microsoft employees.” It is quite telling of Microsoft’s corporate mentality that Nadella is walking such a fine line here, seemingly terrified of upsetting one side of the aisle. The company has never been quite as outspoken as, say, Apple under CEO Tim Cook, who has publicly advocated for environmental conservation and gay rights . So it’s not a huge surprise Microsoft doesn’t want to play that game on the day after a polarizing, unprecedented election. “We witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US.” Yet it’s not exactly reassuring either. To hit home the innocuous banality of his position, Nadella links to a post by Microsoft’s chief legal officer, Brad Smith. The post, titled “Moving forward together: Our thoughts on the US election,” gives little actual thoughts on the US election. Instead, it’s a somewhat lengthy plea in defense of a cozy relationship with the White House in an uncertain time for the tech industry , given Trump’s anti-immigration policies and trade agreement stances. It’s clear Microsoft, like its competitors and contemporaries, is worried about a souring relationship with Washington and its bottom line. By putting out such platitudes, Nadella may be congratulating president-elect, but he’s also crossing his fingers that Trump doesn’t follow through on some of his tech-adverse campaign promises .

New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: [Motherboard] Microsoft’s HoloLens Could Go to War Select All Posts By This User Quote: LimpidArmor calls its helmet the Circular Review System (CRS). It's a helmet outfitted with a Microsoft HoloLens and hooked to cameras on the tank’s body. The cameras come with the system so the crew can put them wherever they need. It’s a great idea because driving a tank sucks. The metal beasts are stuffy, crowded, and loud. It's hard to maintain battlefield awareness. Worse, tanks crews rely on slits in the armor or rudimentary black and white cameras to watch the road and hit their targets. CRS would change that. The system comes with a HoloLens equipped helmet, a box of cameras, and some proprietary software. The crew places the thermal and optic cameras on the body of the tank as they see fit and the software feeds the images to the HoloLens. Even better, LimpidArmor’s software allows the viewer to mark targets, highlight enemies, and track targets. They also claim the software allows users to pull in outside video feeds from drones and other sources.",

      "title": "Surface Pro 5 Release Date And Rumors: Microsoft’s Hybrid To Eclipse iPad Pro 2",
      "text": "\nWith the Surface Studio, the revamped Surface Book and the rumored Surface Pro 5, 2017 might very well become Microsoft’s year. Though the tech giant has not confirmed the development or the existence of the Surface Pro 5, speculations and alleged leaks about the device are abounding. As far as the nature of the device’s rumors is concerned, the upcoming hybrid seems poised to dominate the hybrid portable enterprise device market next year.\nThe Surface Pro has had a pretty colorful history, starting with the Surface RT four years ago. When Microsoft unveiled the hybrid device to an iPad-saturated market four years ago, many were quick to dismiss Microsoft’s efforts as unremarkable. Despite the rocky start, however, Microsoft muscled on, eventually culminating in the release of the Surface Pro 4 last year, a device that has largely been acclaimed, both critically and commercially.\nRumors about the Surface Pro 5, the rumored follow-up to the successful Surface Pro 4. Speculations about the device’s specs are very encouraging, with rumors pointing to a hybrid device that is equipped with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors ranging from the entry-level Core m3 to the high-end Core i7 chip. All signs so far, including Microsoft’s decision to seemingly release the Surface Pro 5 early 2017 instead of late 2016, appears to target the release of Intel’s latest processor. With Kaby Lake chips, the Surface Pro 5 would stand far beyond that of its competition, the Apple iPad Pro 2, which is also rumored to be released sometime early 2017.\n[Image by By Intel Free Press| Wikimedia Commons |Cropped and Resized| CC BY-SA 2.0 ] Microsoft has never really shied away from equipped the Surface line of hybrid devices with the best processors that the industry currently offers. With Kaby Lake processors, 4k video processing would be native to the Surface Pro 5. Such power would place the device far beyond the iPad Pro 2’s powerful, albeit ARM-based processor. While the iPad Pro 2 would undoubtedly receive a huge boost in power from its predecessor, the power discrepancy between Apple’s homegrown mobile chip and Intel’s premium line of desktop-grade processors is very significant.\nCouple this with the rumored storage and memory options for the Surface Pro 5 and Apple’s iPad Pro 2 would definitely appear to be in trouble. Speculations point to the Surface Pro 5 to be equipped with as much as 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM, while Apple’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro currently at 256GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. Even if Apple’s steps up its specs to about 512GB of storage and 6GB of RAM, it would still be a long way away from the Surface Pro 5. After all, Apple’s strategy over the years has been to release incremental upgrades for each device’s iteration. Thus, even a 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 512GB of storage and 6GB of RAM is already stretching it.\nOne thing that would definitely give the Surface Pro 5 a definitive edge over the iPad Pro 2 is the operating system used in the two devices. The Surface line has always been equipped with the full desktop-grade version of Microsoft’s operating system. Thus, the Surface Pro 5 would undoubtedly run the latest, most advanced iteration of Windows 10. On the other hand, the iPad Pro 2 would most likely still run iOS , a mobile operating system. This severely cripples the device, since even basic tasks such as working on multiple MS Word documents would prove tricky on the iPad Pro 2.\n[Image by ç˛žé¸ ĺĽ˝ćąčĽż ç†Šč€é—†| Flickr |Cropped and Resized| CC BY-SA 2.0 ] Apple has recently asserted that it would not be merging iOS and its desktop-grade operating system, macOS. Thus, with the iPad Pro 2 being a tablet-class device, it would be crippled by the limitations of iOS. If Apple takes a step out of the box and releases the iPad Pro 2 with macOS Sierra, it would be a completely different story. However, the chances of that happening are fairly low.\nWhen Microsoft first released the Surface line of devices, it decided to take a step away from convention and gamble on something that was, up to that day, largely uncharted territory. Apple, on the other hand, has been playing it safe for years now. With the inevitable bout between the Surface Pro 5 and the iPad Pro 2 on 2017, Apple would need to really dig deep in order to best, or at least match, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 5. If any, fans of powerful portable devices might not need to wait very long, as rumors indicate that the release date for both the Surface Pro 5 and the iPad Pro 2 would be set for early 2017.\n[Featured Image by Scott Akerman| Flickr |Cropped and Resized| CC BY-SA 2.0 ]\nSurface Pro 5 Release Date And Rumors: Microsoft’s Hybrid To Eclipse iPad Pro 2 is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

Attackers can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to view a specially crafted web page. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently logged-in user. Failed attacks will cause denial of service conditions.   Recommendations Run all software as a nonprivileged user with minimal access rights. To reduce the impact of latent vulnerabilities, always run nonadministrative software as an unprivileged user with minimal access rights. Deploy network intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for malicious activity. Deploy NIDS to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This includes but is not limited to requests that include NOP sleds and unexplained incoming and outgoing traffic. This may indicate exploit attempts or activity that results from successful exploits Do not follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Web users should be cautious about following links to sites that are provided by unfamiliar or suspicious sources. Filtering HTML from emails may help remove a possible vector for transmitting malicious links to users. Implement multiple redundant layers of security. Memory-protection schemes (such as nonexecutable stack and heap configurations and randomly mapped memory segments) will complicate exploits of memory-corruption vulnerabilities.  ",

      "text": "0 A Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop rests on a tabletop at an event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 26, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nWithin a few days from each other, Microsoft and Apple released the next generation in their successful line of notebooks -- the Surface Book 2 and the 2016 MacBook Pro respectively. Both devices offer unique features, such as a detachable screen and an option Touch Bar, but also hold their own when stripped down to their essentials. \nREAD: Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 release date, news & update: Redmond tech giant looking to consolidate Windows 10 platform \nThe Microsoft Surface Book 2 \nTechnically called the Surface Book i7, the Surface Book 2 is powered by the sixth generation Intel Core i7 processor. And as Microsoft has partnered this with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M GPU, it is one of the most powerful non-gaming laptops that also offers stellar graphics. To handle this, however, the device experienced a redesign from the inside and weighs a relatively heavier 3.63 pounds. \nThe Surface Book 2 sports a 13.5 inch screen, which boast a display of 3000 x 2000 pixel resolution. The device has two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, as well as a full-sized SD card reader. Microsoft claimed a 16-hour battery life, but C|Net clocked it in at just over 11.5 hours. The Surface Book i7 is already available for pre-order and is priced at US$2,399 (AU$3,130). \nWatch the Surface Book i7 introduction \nREAD: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date, news & update: Specs, features & price discussed; Early 2017 release expected \nThe 2016 MacBook Pro \nBefore the 2016 MacBook Pro was officially announced, the public was itching for a Mac upgrade, and Apple delivered in terms of power. The new generation is powered by Intel’s sixth generation Core i5 processors, which Apple confirmed are configurable to the Core i7 processors. The device also sports an Intel Iris Graphics 540 chip for the standard 13 inch variant and an Intel Iris Graphics 550 chip for the 13 inch model with TouchBar. \nThe 2016 MacBook Pro display boasts a 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution with a LED-backlit display and IPS technology. The device also sports two Thunderbolt 3 ports and weighs in at just over 3 pounds. Its battery life is also better than its predecessor with 10 hours of continuous web use. The lowest-end version of the device is available for pre-order for US$1499 (AU$1,960), while the highest-end variant is priced at US$2,399 (AU$3,130). \nWatch the 2016 MacBook Pro introduction",

      "title": "Microsoft files a patent enabling Surface Pen wireless charging via accessories",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThis appears to be a week of published patents as news of a single Microsoft invention has surfaced among a sea of recently published inventions by Apple. Microsoft’s latest patent, “ Inductive Peripheral Retention Device ,” was filed in September and details accessories for the company’s Surface Pen that not only keeps the tool strapped to a Windows 10 device, but recharges it in the process. \nThe first batch of images provided in the patent illustrates a rounded accessory with a USB connector. As shown below, the design is rather simple, showing the Surface Pen seated within the accessory’s rounded portion and docked alongside a Windows 10 device. However, the patent also shows the pen/accessory combo plugged into the USB port of a desktop monitor so the Surface Pen is easily accessible without cluttering the desktop space. \nMicrosoft’s patent is based on inductive (wireless) charging. The loop portion of the accessory consists of an inductive element that is bent to form a flexible loop. This element includes perforations and traces, the latter of which carry an electrical current. It is housed within fabric so the Surface Pen has a comfortable fit, and connects to the USB jack’s circuit board inside what Microsoft describes as the “peripheral securing portion.” \n“The plug is securable to and removable from the device using one or more hands of a user,” the abstract states. “The apparatus also includes a peripheral securing portion connected to the plug and configured to removably engage a peripheral device via an inductive element formed as a flexible loop and configured to form a communicative coupling between the peripheral device and the device, which may be used to support charging of the apparatus.” \nThe patent also goes on to illustrate a detachable keyboard with a flexible hinge for Surface devices. As illustrated above, this peripheral includes a mid-spine section between the keyboard area and the computing device connection portion that consists of three inductive coils. Thus, the user could simply place the Surface Pen down into this narrow region for a wireless recharge. The Surface Pen could also receive a charge if placed in a pen clip that is secured to the flexible hinge. \n“This may be utilized to charge the stylus, transfer data (e.g., to authenticate the peripheral device), and so on,” the patent states. “Further, flux flow lines may also support a rotationally invariant shape such that the flexible hinge may move yet still support the communicative coupling.” \nMore: Microsoft patent hints at AR/VR combination headset \nThe authors behind Microsoft’s filed patent include Timothy Allen Jakoboski, Shiu Sang Ng, and William H. Standing. Microsoft Technology Licensing is listed as the assignee. \nGiven that this patent is merely in the filing stage, its current state does not mean Microsoft is not working hard to bring this invention into the hands of customers. However, right now, the new patent serves as a glimpse of the avenues Microsoft is taking to provide a great computing experience to customers with the least number of physical cords.

      "text": "0 \nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) are frequently cited as \"mature\" tech stocks that you buy for income and stability instead of growth. Both stocks have outperformed the S&P 500's 4% gain -- Microsoft is up 9% for the year, and IBM has climbed about 13%. But is either stock still worth buying today with the market near all-time highs? The Surface Pro Studio. Image source: Microsoft. The similarities between Microsoft and IBM \nAt first glance, Microsoft and IBM are very different companies. Microsoft generates most its revenue from licensing and subscription fees for Windows and Office. It generates additional revenue from sales of its Azure cloud platform Dynamics CRM, Surface hardware, Xbox consoles, and search-based ads. IBM's core business is split between business services, technology services, hardware systems, and enterprise software. \nBut Microsoft and IBM both face two similar challenges -- slower enterprise spending, and the technological shift toward mobile and cloud-based solutions. Sluggish enterprise spending causes companies to stick with older versions of Windows and Office, and to spend less on IBM's IT services, hardware, and software. Both companies are also struggling to remain relevant in a mobile world . That's why Microsoft's revenue fell 2% last year, while IBM's top line declined 12%. \nNeither Microsoft nor IBM has a meaningful presence in mobile hardware, but both companies are pivoting their businesses toward higher-growth cloud solutions to offset declines in other older businesses. Microsoft's core strategy in that market revolves around growing its commercial cloud business (Office 365, Dynamics, Azure), which achieved an annual run rate of $13 billion last quarter. \nIBM's plan is similar -- to grow its \"strategic imperatives\" businesses (cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and social) at a faster rate than its older businesses. IBM's cloud \"as a service\" business, which can be compared to Microsoft's commercial cloud business, hit an annual run rate of $7.5 billion last quarter. IBM Watson Element for Educators. Image source: IBM. How fast are Microsoft and IBM growing? \nMicrosoft has posted positive single-digit annual sales growth for three consecutive quarters. IBM, however, has posted annual sales declines for 18 consecutive quarters. Looking ahead, analysts expect Microsoft's revenue to rise 2% this year, but IBM's to decline 2%. That's partly because Microsoft's business (mostly software) was easier to pivot toward higher-growth cloud businesses than IBM's complex mix of business software, hardware, and IT services. \nIBM slimmed down its hardware business over the past few years with the sale of its PC business, low-end servers, and its chipmaking unit. But the hardware business remains a dead weight on Big Blue's top line, causing its Systems revenue (8% of sales) to fall 21% annually last quarter. Its core business and technology services are also losing ground to nimbler rivals . \nBoth companies rely heavily on inorganic growth to strengthen their ecosystems. Microsoft's acquired LinkedIn to gather more employer and employee data for its analytics business, and to widen Dynamics' moat against Salesforce 's market-leading CRM platform. IBM has been acquiring smaller cloud, mobile, and security businesses to strengthen its strategic imperatives. Both companies have adequate cash to continue that strategy -- Microsoft generated nearly $27 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, while IBM generated over $14 billion. Dividends and buybacks \nMicrosoft currently pays a forward yield of 2.6%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 69%. IBM pays a higher forward yield of 3.7%, yet has a lower payout ratio of 44%. From an income investor's perspective, IBM might seem like a better pick. \nMicrosoft spends more cash on buybacks than IBM. Over the past 12 months, it spent nearly $15 billion on buybacks, but Big Blue spent just over $3 billion. However, IBM intentionally started reducing those buybacks last year to conserve its free cash flow for investments and acquisitions in its higher-growth businesses. Profitability and valuations 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes \nMicrosoft's earnings, lifted by buybacks and its shift toward higher-margin cloud businesses, are expected to rise 6% this year. IBM's earnings are expected to fall 10% due to its ongoing sales declines, increased investments, and reduced buybacks. \nMicrosoft currently trades at 29 times earnings, which matches the industry average of 29 for business software and services companies. IBM trades at 13 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 21 for IT services companies. Those metrics indicate that investors could be a bit too excited about Microsoft, while ignoring IBM's cheap valuation. The winner: IBM \nMicrosoft initially looks like a better buy than IBM -- it clearly has better sales and earnings growth, and its turnaround efforts are producing more visible results. But IBM's higher dividend, lower payout ratio, and lower P/E ratio indicate that it's the better pick at current prices. Microsoft has lots of growth potential -- especially with new products like HoloLens, VR headsets , and Xbox Scorpio on the way -- but I'd like to see a higher yield and a lower P/E before I start a position. \nA secret billion-dollar stock opportunity \nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here . \nLeo Sun owns shares of Salesforce.com .

      "title": "NooBaa Announces Microsoft Partnership: Azure Marketplace Availability and Accelerator Participation",
      "text": "Flexible data storage fabric spans on-premises and multi-cloud capacity including Microsoft Azure\nTel Aviv, Israel (PRWEB) November 08, 2016\nNooBaa today announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft, which includes NooBaa’s native integration with Azure Blob Storage, availability of the NooBaa software-based storage solution in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, and Microsoft’s selection of NooBaa as a member in the Microsoft Accelerator program.\nNooBaa’s software solution provides a new architecture for a flexible compute and storage fabric that seamlessly spans enterprise datacenters and public cloud providers. In addition to supporting heterogeneous on-premises storage resources, NooBaa now allows customers to pool public cloud capacity from Microsoft’s Azure Blob Storage in addition to other cloud providers. NooBaa’s support for multiple public clouds reduces vendor lock-in and facilitates simple application and data migration between resource pools.\nThe NooBaa storage solution is now also available directly through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. NooBaa represents the first multi-cloud-capable storage solution in the Marketplace and provides access to Azure Blob Storage capacity via the popular S3 API, which has emerged as a de-facto standard for Dev-Ops and cloud computing. The NooBaa Azure Marketplace Edition can be deployed for free and automatically integrates with Azure compute and capacity resources.\nIn addition to NooBaa’s availability in the Azure Marketplace, NooBaa has also been selected by Microsoft to join the exclusive Microsoft Accelerator program . The Accelerator program provides NooBaa working space, and valuable access to mentoring, funding, facilities, and direct access to Microsoft customers. According to Navot Volk, Managing Director of Microsoft Accelerator, “We only accept 3.5% of the applicants into the accelerator so we’re extremely selective about the companies we work with. NooBaa is unique because their technology is impressive, they deliver a unique value proposition for Microsoft’s IT customers, and they align perfectly with Microsoft’s strategic vision for hybrid computing.”\nAccording to James Staten, Microsoft’s Chief Strategist for Cloud & Enterprise, “This blended model lets you stop worrying about where your apps are, and focus more on how to leverage the right resources for the right valuehybrid is not a temporary state but the new normal.” NooBaa supports hybrid computing by creating and automating a continuous capacity fabric across on-premises and public cloud resources, with flexible capabilities for data placement and migration. With NooBaa, customers can more easily move workloads between cloud providers without application changes.\n“It’s becoming clear that Microsoft is going to be a dominant market force for enterprise hybrid cloud computing over the next few years. Being admitted to the Accelerator was a huge win because it allows us to focus on important things like Azure integration and customer feedback,” according to Yuval Dimnik, NooBaa’s CEO, “we’re getting access to some amazing people and resources that are accelerating our progress. Plus I have to say the food is amazing!”\nAbout NooBaa\nNooBaa is the new way for enterprises to create and consume cloud services. It allows large enterprises to improve flexibility while reducing vendor lock-in and costs. Co-founded in 2013 by leading storage and security experts Yuval Dimnik and Guy Margalit, NooBaa has offices in Herzliya, Israel and Silicon Valley, California. Privately-held, NooBaa has received venture capital funding from JVP , OurCrowd and prominent industry leaders.

      "text": "Microsoft adds virtual trackpad for Windows 10 November 10, 2016 - 10:55   Microsoft unveiled its Creators Update for Windows 10 last month, alongside a number of new features that are expected to arrive in March. While Microsoft didn't detail every single new feature, choosing to hide some in a video, it appears the company still has some surprises planned. In a new test version of Windows 10 (build 14965), released on Wednesday, November 9 to Windows Insiders, Microsoft has added a virtual trackpad for its operating system, The Verge said. \nMicrosoft describes the feature as a way to control external monitors with a tablet and no mouse. It's designed to sit in the taskbar, if selected, and provide a virtual trackpad on the screen that can be used to control the mouse and right-click or left-click options. You can now enable a touchpad icon in the notification area, and you can tweak the trackpad gestures in the main Windows 10 settings panel. \nAlongside the virtual trackpad, Microsoft is also tweaking its Sticky Notes app for Windows 10. More languages and regions are now supported, adding the ability to recognize emails, URLs, phone numbers, addresses, and stocks in a number of new countries. Microsoft is also improving its Windows Ink features, with quick access to pen settings, options to shrink and expand the protractor with a mouse, and improved performance of the Sketchpad app when lots of digital ink is used. Windows 10 testers will be able to experiment with all the new changes, as they roll out worldwide to testers in the fast ring. Related links:",

      "text": "Microsoft’s super-expensive DVD Player app available in the Windows Store for Windows 10 users has just received an update on machines running preview builds of the operating system and enrolled in the Fast ring, before the company eventually pushes it to all users at a later time. Windows DVD Player version 10.16102.10081.0 continues to be available for $15 from the Windows Store, which is quite unexpected given the fact that it’s a Microsoft app and because it does pretty much the same thing as all the other freeware solutions on the market. What’s new in this version? Microsoft says that this new version comes with a feature that automatically reads the DVD when a new disc is inserted into the drive and the app is already running, as users previously had to refresh it manually every single time when they put a disc in the unit. Furthermore, the company has refined the playback bar by moving less-used actions in the three-dot menu, while the ov...",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nMicrosoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, and president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, both released statements today in response to Donald Trump’s win in the United States’ election last night . Nadella’s statement, which was posted via his LinkedIn account , is more of a short introduction to Smith’s rather lengthy blog post on the official Microsoft website. \n“Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees,” Nadella wrote. “We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.” \nSmith also drew attention to Microsoft’s aim to improve diversity and inclusivity, in particular mentioning a study from Georgetown University which discussed the growth in jobs in the United States over the past few years. “It shows that a quarter-century of U.S. economic growth under Democrats and Republicans alike has added 35 million net new jobs. But the number of jobs held by Americans with only a high school diploma or less has fallen by 7.3 million,” Smith says. “In a time of rapid change, we need to innovate to promote inclusive economic growth that helps everyone move forward. This requires a shared responsibility among those in government, across the private sector, and by individuals themselves.” Satya Nadella and Bill Gates \nAnother concern of Microsoft’s was infrastructure. “It was encouraging to see both presidential nominees endorse new infrastructure investments, and we believe that new data analytics and cloud technologies can contribute to these improvements. We especially appreciate the role that broadband and computing infrastructure can play in creating broader economic opportunities, perhaps especially in areas of higher rural unemployment,” Smith enthuses before returning to the importance of multiculturalism and diversity not only in the work force but in the country as a whole. \n“We invest over $12 billion a year in research and development, as much as any other company on the planet, and over 85 percent of this work is done in the United States. Over a third of our engineers have come from other countries – 157 countries, in fact,” Smith reveals. “We have employees from every race, ethnic background and religion. If there’s a language spoken on the planet, there’s a good chance that it’s spoken by an employee at Microsoft. And we’re committed to promoting not just diversity among all the men and women who work here, but the type of inclusive culture that will enable people to do their best work and pursue rewarding careers. We know that this is the only way we’ll fully succeed as a company. And we believe it’s the only way we’ll fully succeed as a country.” \nSmith finished his statement by referencing the role technology had played during the election and the importance of security and respect for public and private safety . “We’re committed to developing technology that is secure and trusted, both for Americans and for people around the world. We literally have thousands of employees who make this their focus and priority. And we know that we’ll benefit from stronger government policies as well. That’s why we’ve not only advocated for clearer and more modern U.S. laws, but have filed lawsuits four times in the past three years against the current administration, standing up for what we believe are the vital rights of people both here and abroad. As we’ve won the cases we’ve brought, we’ve been reminded of one of this country’s greatest strengths, its strong Constitution, independent judiciary, and the overarching rule of law.” \nWere you impressed with Satya Nadella and Brad Smith’s statements?

Lucky that I didn't restart the PC otherwise i'd have been completely locked out of the system. Instead I got a secondary PC in another room that I quickly had a look through on google for the synopsis and advice in what to do. AVG and Malwarebytes managed to fix the problem although after scanning and rebooting I was still gripping the chair and praying to a deity above that it had worked. Lucky i'm now back up and running on the main PC but it'll teach me not to be complacent when it comes to fake media stories on FB that are being re-circulated and shared.  ",

      "text": "Amazon, Microsoft Capitalize On Cloud-Computing Bonanza Cloud-computing growth is accelerating, says Nomura. (©Nataraj - Fotolia/stock.adobe.com) Reprints \nSpending on cloud-computing services continues to accelerate, with Amazon ( AMZN ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) key drivers of growth, says investment bank Nomura. \nNomura estimates capital spending on cloud services hit $45 billion in 2015, up 24% from the $36 billion in 2014. It said much of the growth has gone to Amazon's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure and Office365 cloud services. \n\"The revenue trends here are robust as ever, which lends confidence to our view that capital expenditures will continue to expand,\" Nomura said in a research report. Amazon and Microsoft \"account for a material percentage of the growth of traditional IT hardware spending,\" Nomura said. IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft has been riding high since it reported better-than-expected September-quarter results , boosted by its cloud offerings. Amazon is the leader in web services, with sales last year topping $10 billion, putting it in prime position to benefit from the accelerated use of cloud services. \nNomura said it surveyed 50 global chief information officers in early October to gauge their spending priorities. Cloud computing is a driver for 70% of CIOs, while software-defined data centers drive 34%. These figures are up from 52% and 14%, respectively, in the October 2015 survey. \nAmong the big beneficiaries of the cloud spending is Arista Networks ( ANET ), Nomura said. It expects Arista to maintain its rapid growth as it gains share in the hot data-center switching market. \nAnother beneficiary is fiber-optic company Ciena ( CIEN ). Ciena's optical technology \"targets the data-center interconnect market directly and, thus, ought to boost Ciena's mix of data-center revenue,\" Nomura said. \nOther beneficiaries are Infinera ( INFN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ) and Juniper Networks ( JNPR ). \nThe survey said CIOs now expect 65% of 2018 workloads to be in the cloud, up from 57% in its March survey. This compares with 48% of workloads in the cloud in 2016.",

Satya Nadella himself wanted Microsoft to be friends with everyone, and that’s exactly his position after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States.

This update corrects the logic in the firmware component that functions as the “fuel gauge” for the Surface Pro 3 battery, so that the actual battery capacity on devices with this particular part is accurately reported. This allows the Surface to once again leverage the maximum charge capacity of the battery. \nOnce this fix is applied to a Surface Pro 3, the reported full charge capacity will self-correct over the next several charge and discharge cycles. Surface Pro 3 devices that previously experienced the problem can now operate on battery power, and the issue won’t occur on devices that haven’t experienced the issue. \nYou can find more details about the battery fix software update for the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 at the link below, the update is now available to download.",

      "text": "Microsoft Updates $15 Windows 10 DVD Player App (No, It Didn’t Make It Free) GO Update released today to insiders enrolled in the Fast ring Nov 10, 2016 07:04 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft’s super-expensive DVD Player app available in the Windows Store for Windows 10 users has just received an update on machines running preview builds of the operating system and enrolled in the Fast ring, before the company eventually pushes it to all users at a later time. Windows DVD Player version 10.16102.10081.0 continues to be available for $15 from the Windows Store, which is quite unexpected given the fact that it’s a Microsoft app and because it does pretty much the same thing as all the other freeware solutions on the market. What’s new in this version? Microsoft says that this new version comes with a feature that automatically reads the DVD when a new disc is inserted into the drive and the app is already running, as users previously had to refresh it manually every single time when they put a disc in the unit. Furthermore, the company has refined the playback bar by moving less-used actions in the three-dot menu, while the overall design is inspired from the Movies & TV app. When there’s no DVD in the drive, the playback bar is automatically disabled. There are also some basic keyboard shortcuts, such as pause and play with the spacebar, double-clicking for full screen and escape to go back to window mode. As you can see, these are just basic improvements that many people expected to be there from the very beginning, but Microsoft seems only now to understand that it’s really awkward to sell an application for $15 without actually offering a good feature package. The Windows Media Player was available for free for users who upgraded from a Media Center edition of Windows, but everyone else had to pay $15 to get it from the Store. And unfortunately, many did, even though the same features, and a lot more than that, are already part of freeware solutions that are available for download right now. 10.16102.10081.0",

      "text": "Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Mobile Build 14393.448 GO New public update available for Windows 10 Mobile devices Nov 10, 2016 05:47 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has just released a new Windows 10 Mobile update for public users that pushes OS version to 14393.448 and brings bug fixes and performance improvements. What’s important to note is that this is just a cumulative update, so it doesn’t bring any new features, but only fixes and improvements that are supposed to refine the experience we get with the operating system. Microsoft hasn’t provided too many details about this new cumulative update, but it says that it’s the mobile sibling of KB3200790 , an update that was released for PCs and which increases the operating system version to 14393.447. “This update is published for Windows 10 Mobile. It includes the same improvements and fixes from the update listed as November 8, 2016—KB3200790 (OS Build 14393.447) that was published for Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016,” Microsoft said in a statement. No mobile-specific changes Oddly enough, the official changelog for Windows 10 build 14393.447 (cumulative update KB3200790) does not include any mobile-specific changes, so it’s hard to tell what exactly is new on devices running Windows 10 Mobile and installing this particular build. You can see the full changelog of cumulative update KB3200790 in the box at the end of the article. But even so, users are recommended to download and install it on their devices as soon as possible, mostly because it includes fixes and improvements that can indeed refine how the operating system works on supported devices. We’ve already installed this new update on the HP Elite X3 and the Lumia 950 XL, but we didn’t notice anything new, so it’s all just under-the-hood work that’s supposed to improve Windows 10 Mobile performance. If you want to download this new update on your Windows 10 Mobile device as well, just go to Settings > Update and security > Update. A phone reboot will be required when the process is completed, and the whole process takes approximately 5 minutes. KB3200790 Changelog",
