      "text": "asus rog g vi laptop appears on amazon More If you’re eager to dump $3,100 into a gaming laptop sporting the latest hardware, look no further than the Asus Republic of Gamers G701VI laptop. The company first revealed this mobile powerhouse earlier this month, packed with a GeForce GTX 1080 graphics chip and overclocked DDR4 system memory. Now the unit is finally up for grabs on Amazon , and currently the listing shows that only eight six units are in stock.\nHere are the specs in a pretty table:\nModel number: G701VI-XB72K Screen size: 17.3 inches Screen resolution: 1,920 x 1,080, 120Hz refresh rate G-Sync support: Yes Processor: Quad-core Intel Core i7-6820K (unlocked) System memory: 32GB DDR4 at 2,400MHz Graphics chip: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Graphics memory: 8GB GDDR5 Storage: 512GB NVMe PCIe SSD Size: 12.2 x 16.9 x 1.3 inches Weight: 7.9 pounds Wireless connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2)\nBluetooth 4.1 Ports: 3x USB 3.0 Type-A\n1x USB 3.1 Type-C\n1x Thunderbolt 3\n1x Ethernet\n1x HDMI 2.0\n1x Mini DisplayPort Battery: 6-cell Li-ion, 93 watt-hours Price: $3,100 The processor used in this PC gaming beast stems from Intel’s sixth-generation “Skylake” family and sells for $378 on its own. Released in the third quarter of 2015, this chip consists of four cores with a base clock speed of 2.70GHz and a maximum turbo speed of 3.60GHz. It relies on 8MB of on-board cache, and includes an integrated HD Graphics 530 component with a base clock of 350MHz and a maximum clock speed of 1,050Mhz.\nAs for the discreet GTX 1080 graphics chip, that on its own costs a meaty $600, thus between the processor and graphics chip, customers start out with a combined cost of $978. The system memory isn’t quite that expensive (which can be manually upgraded to 64GB), but customers will likely see a good deal of the remaining cost in the storage and the display, the latter of which surprisingly only supports a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 despite the hefty graphics processor powering the panel.\nMore: Asus crams two GTX 1080 graphics chips into new GX800 laptop for PC gamers\nHowever, what’s great to see is the growing adoption of Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1 Type-C connectivity. Those ports can be used to connect the company’s latest external graphics card station should G701VI laptop owners need even more graphical power for their PC games outside the supplied GTX 1080 graphics chip.\n“An anti-ghosting keyboard with 30-key rollover technology ensures multi-keystroke in-game commands are correctly logged even when gamers hit several keys simultaneously. In addition, a built-in ESS DAC and amplifier provide richer, more detailed in-game audio, strong bass and less distortion,” the company said earlier this month .\nIn the time it took to write this report, Amazon sold two units, leaving the current stock residing at a mere six units. That said, if Amazon Prime customers order right now, they can get this beefy PC gaming laptop in just two days!\nAsus crams two GTX 1080 graphics chips into new GX800 laptop for PC gamers Asus’ powerful new gaming laptop has the muscle for virtual reality Falcon Northwest TLX, DRX laptops now sport GeForce GTX 10 Series graphics chips",

      "text": "Amazon''s Holiday Deliveries Face Turbulence From Pilot Strike November 22, 2016, 09:05:  Amazon's Holiday Deliveries Face Turbulence From Pilot Strike \nAmazon.com Inc.'s newly established in-house transportation network is facing a rocky start to its all-important holiday season. \nPilots contracted to deliver Amazon packages began picketing Tuesday because of a longstanding labor dispute, a sign of further potential disruptions through the end of the year at one of Amazon's two airline partners. \nThe pilots are employed by Air Transport Services Group Inc., which alongside Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., was hired by Amazon to fly its packages in 40 dedicated jets by the end of 2018. About 16 will be in operation by the end of the year, according to the companies. \nIn a complaint filed in federal court Tuesday, ABX Air Inc., a subsidiary of ATSG, said Christmas shopping and deliveries have already been disrupted and could worsen if the industrial action continues.It also filed a request for a temporary restraining order. Atlas declined to comment on whether it was affected by the ATSG industrial action on Tuesday. \nAmazon said it works with a variety of carriers and is \"confident in our ability to serve customers.\" \nThis holiday season is the first major test of whether Amazon can lessen its reliance on traditional delivery partners like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. In addition to the plane leasing, Amazon is putting more drivers on the road in vans branded with its logo to take on huge amounts of additional packages. It also wants to be a competitor to UPS and FedEx, according to people familiar with the matter. \nAmazon has asked certain last-mile delivery partners to increase holiday capacity by as much as double in recent weeks—a difficult ask due to an already tight labor market and shortage of rental vehicles, according to people familiar with those requests. It is tied to Amazon's move to consolidate deliveries to the same address into one vehicle, known as \"Project Zero\", instead of routing them through several different carriers. \n\"It's unrealistic to ask you to double your capacity at a week's notice,\" said an executive at one of those companies. \nAmazon said that there hasn't been a recent shift in its holiday forecasts or capacity needs. \nAmazon determined that it needed to take its destiny into its own hands after holiday delivery problems in 2013, when bad weather followed by a flurry of last-minute online orders at retailers caused millions of packages to arrive after Christmas. \nSince then, it has increased its reliance on the U.S. Postal Service, regional delivery companies and smaller, last- mile delivery companies, as well as its own citizen courier fleet of Flex drivers, as it built out its network of warehouses. Amazon started a trial in September last year with ATSG, initially leasing five Boeing Co. 767 freighter jets to link its distribution centers through the airline's Wilmington, Ohio, hub. \nHowever, Amazon also walked into longstanding labor disputes over pay and working conditions at some cargo airlines, though both ATSG and Atlas said they have had no problem recruiting extra pilots. \nABX's legal filing said that the Tuesday action caused the cancellation of 26 flights and stranded more than 1.25 million pounds of cargo for its other major customer, Deutsche Post AG'sDHL. \nIf more flights are canceled due to the action, it \"will result in millions of dollars of freight and packages not timely being delivered to retailers and homes,\" the complaint said. \nAside from ATSG's base in Ohio, the jets are operating up to eight daily flights for Amazon from airports that include the online-retail giant's Seattle base, Stockton and Ontario in California, Rockford, Ill., Lehigh Valley Airport in Allentown, Pa., and Tampa, Fla.., according to people familiar with the network. \nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com  162105ET  ",

      "text": "amazon live sports instant video ultra hd More Amazon is taking yet another step toward satisfying cord cutters’ every television need. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the online retailer — which has already gone to great lengths to prove that it’s much more than just your digital shopping destination — is “exploring an ambitious offensive aimed at infiltrating the last bastion of traditional pay-television: live sports.” This builds upon an earlier report from the Journal, noting that Amazon will also be giving streaming services like Netflix a run for their money by preparing for a global launch .\nThe Journal reports that over the last few months, Jeff Bezos’ company has held negotiations for live game rights with industry giants like the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and the National Football League, as well as other such groups as Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, and World Surf League.\n“My sense is they are interested in anything that might be out there,” said Chad Swofford, vice president of digital for the ACC, a college sports conference, told the WSJ. But for the time being, Amazon is staying tight-lipped on any plans for expansion its Prime Video service may have.\nMore : Amazon customers will be able to buy Fiat Chrysler cars with an online discount\nIf Amazon is indeed scouting new entry points into sports broadcasting, which could be a highly lucrative business, it would seem to make sense. After all, live sports is one of the last differentiable elements offered by traditional cable and satellite television platforms. Some other major tech players have already begun streaming such events — Facebook and Twitter are both in the game, and Amazon may be playing a bit of catch-up at this point.\nBut don’t get too excited about the possibility of live sports being added to Amazon. It won’t come free — even if you already have a Prime subscription . As the Journal reports, “With at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership, though the details are unclear.”\nAs for its plans for worldwide domination, sources claim that Amazon is interested in bringing its video service to around 200 countries and territories. Today, Amazon Prime Video can only be accessed by those in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Japan, though India is forthcoming. That said, however, it would appear that Amazon has its sights set on a much larger piece of the pie — the whole pie, in fact. with a planned launch in India.\n “Amazon has gone global ,” Jeremy Clarkson, the star of the forthcoming Amazon show “ The Grand Tour ,” tweeted recently. “It is going to be available in 200 territories. That’s pretty much everywhere .”\nUpdated on 11-22-2016 to reflect news of Amazon’s global expansion.\nInstagram goes live, adds disappearing photos and videos in Direct feature ‘The Simpsons’ renewed to become the longest-running scripted TV show 'Stranger Things' director/producer Shawn Levy enters 'Uncharted' territory",

      "text": "360pi releases unique insight into Amazon’s total product count growth, holiday category trends and more\nOTTAWA, Ontario --(BUSINESS WIRE) NRF expects 137.4M Americans to shop online or hit stores this Black Friday weekend. With assortment playing a major role in retailers’ strategies this holiday, 360pi , the leader in product and price intelligence, today released a special edition holiday infographic , taking a look at which products were in Amazon’s aisle this holiday. This infographic, Amazon’s Endless Holiday Aisle , follows the observed shifts in Amazon’s category, product, brand, and seller coverage between May and November 2016, providing unprecedented insight into Amazon’s assortment, marketplace and holiday strategies. Some highlights include:\nThird-party sellers let Amazon “have their cake and eat it too”\nWhile 360pi’s recent analysis shows marketplace sellers account for 96.2% of all products offered on Amazon.com, these same sellers only represent half of all merchandise sold on Amazon. This lets Amazon dominate the retail landscape at a fraction of the risk and cost of other sellers.\nKey holiday categories signal Amazon’s growth strategy\nObserved changes between May 2016 and November 2016\nElectronics & Computers, one of the most highly competitive holiday categories, saw a 75% increase in the total number of products available by all sellers, including Amazon proper. Despite the vast number of marketplace sellers seen capitalizing on retailer out-of-stocks this holiday, Amazon saw no change in seller count in Toys & Games over the observed time period. 360pi observed 22% growth in the number of brands offered for sale on Amazon.com in the Home & Kitchen category. Earlier this year, 360pi also found that 60% of top marketplaces offered products in this category. Amazon continued its aggressive play into Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry, as evidenced by the recent influx in product listings. The retailer showed a 55% increase in listings over the past six months, which follows an earlier 87% increase between May 2015 and May 2016. Marketplaces are driving the bulk of Amazon’s category ramp-up this holiday\nIn preparation for the holidays, Amazon proper expanded their product offering by 30% from May to November 2016 – the equivalent of 3.6M new products. Amazon’s marketplace sellers cumulatively increased their count by 17.5% (6M+ products) over the same time period.\nAmazon’s Endless Holiday Aisle is part of 360pi’s fourth annual award-winning Holiday Insights Series , delivering subscribers exclusive weekly holiday product and pricing trends across several major retailers, including Amazon, Walmart and Target. Sign up for the Holiday Insights Series to download the infographic and to receive 360pi’s special Black Friday and Cyber Monday analyses, a must-have for every retailer and brand manufacturer this holiday.\nAbout 360pi\n360pi derives profitable insights from product and pricing big data to help leading omnichannel retailers, etailers, and brand manufacturers compete and win with shoppers. 360pi’s customer base accounts for over $US200 billion in annual product sales and includes Ace Hardware, Build.com, and Overstock.com, along with several Fortune 500 consumer products companies. With the majority of in-store purchases being influenced online, 360pi helps retailers and brands successfully navigate the multi-channel landscape with real-time insight into who is selling what, where, when, why and for how much.

      "text": "Aerospace & Defence | Wed Nov 23, 2016 | 4:23am IST Pilots strike at cargo airline serving Amazon, DHL as holidays near By Nick Carey | CHICAGO \nCHICAGO Pilots at ABX Air, an express cargo airline that serves online retailer Amazon.com Inc and DHL Express, went on strike on Tuesday, a critical time for retailers with the holiday shopping season about to kick into high gear. \nSome 250 pilots, who are represented by the Teamsters union, went on strike in the early morning, affecting around 75 flights, mostly for Amazon and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG. \nPilots went on strike because ABX, owned by Air Transport Services Group Inc, has violated its contract by asking them to work emergency hours over the last two years because of a staffing shortage, then failed to grant them compensatory time off or allow pilots to take earned vacations, the union said. \n\"Our pilots are striking so that we can have the status quo of our contract restored, and we would like that to be in the next minute so we can return to serving our customers,\" said Tim Jewell, a pilot and secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 1224, which represents ABX pilots. \"But if the company chooses not to do that our members are prepared to continue striking.\" \nAir Transport Services Group said in a statement that ABX was taking multiple steps to tackle an \"illegal work stoppage\" including seeking a court order to get pilots back to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement. \nThe strike comes just ahead of Cyber Monday, which is the biggest day of the year for internet shopping and is expected to break records this year. \nAmazon has contracts with the major U.S. package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, giving it alternatives to ABX. \nIn May, Amazon also entered into a long-term agreement with Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc under which the company would provide cargo services to the online retailer using 20 Boeing Co 767-300 freighters. \n\"We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,\" Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said. \nDHL, however, said the strike had affected deliveries of goods into the United States. \n\"Due to a work stoppage affecting our airline partners, inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are continuing to monitor the situation.\" \nMatt Barton, an aviation industry economist with FlightPath Economics, said he expects the strike will be short, so will only cause a \"relatively minor shortage\" for Amazon. \nBut he said the long-term problem is a nationwide shortage of pilots, as older pilots retire and too few step up to replace them, which portends more strikes in the coming years. \n\"Call it a canary in the coal mine or a shot across the bow, but this is happening now,\" Barton said. \"We are going to see pilot wages rise and problems like this for the next 10 to 15 years.\" \n(Additional reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler and Lisa Shumaker) Next In Aerospace & Defence ",

      "text": "11/22/16 AT 9:18 PM Close \nAmazon is looking into expanding its ticketing business into Europe, Asia and maybe the United State, Recode reported . \nThe company already launched Amazon Tickets in the UK last year. The site sells tickets for comedy, music and theatre shows like Stomp , Wicked and Kinky Boots . \nHowever, a job posting suggests the company is taking Amazon Tickets to other places. The career listing also shows the company might merge up Amazon Tickets with Amazon Prime to make Prime Tickets. The combo could be easier for customers who already have an account with Amazon Prime. \nThe job listing says the company is looking to hire new employees “to develop our international expansion strategy for Europe and Asia,” according to Recode. Related Stories Amazon Prime's $99 Fee Could Go Up Sooner Than You Think \n“[O]ur vision goes beyond just selling tickets as we aim to disrupt the entire live entertainment experience, including what happens before, during and after the show,” a job post says, Recode reported. “The ticketing business is ripe for innovation and improvement, as much of the industry has not fundamentally changed since the 1970s.” \nAmazon Tickets is also looking for employees to work at its headquarters in Seattle, hinting plans for a U.S. launch. \n“We are continuously building and inventing systems that make it easier to add more and more shows to our catalog and effortless for our customers to find and buy tickets to the shows that they want to attend,” the company says in the job post . “From a technology point of view, selling tickets online create many challenges of scale and complexity that result from being the intersection between software and the physical world.” \nIf Amazon starts its ticket business in the U.S. it will be in fierce competition with Ticketmaster and resellers like StubHub and SeatGeek .

      "text": "Amazon May Not Be The Cheapest Option This Holiday Season (AMZN, GOOG) By Rakesh Sharma | November 22, 2016 — 11:54 AM EST \nThis holiday season, Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) may not be the only game in town to buy holiday gifts. \nA story by the Wall Street Journal’s personal technology columnist quotes price intelligence firm 360pi as saying that Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google’s ( GOOG ) shopping service had cheaper prices for “60% of Amazon’s 750 top-selling products.” A couple of factors are threatening Amazon’s dominance in cheap prices. First, the company has begun adding sales tax to its products in 23 states. This has the effect of inflating product prices. (See also: Amazon Changes Gift Wrap This Holiday Season ). \nSecond, the rise of deep-pocketed competitors, such as Google and Wal-Mart Corp. ( WMT ), has introduced options for consumers. Google especially has ramped up its investment in e-commerce. The Mountain View company acquired Undecidable Labs, a purchase research tool that enables customers to specify product attributes as choices for e-commerce, earlier this month. (See also: Google Express Takes On Amazon Prime Now ). \nThe report quotes Joleen Wroten from 360pi who said that Amazon’s strategy was to move fast to match the lowest price, rather than always be the lowest. Another report, this time from Consumer Reports magazine , suggested that Amazon’s offers are not always as they seem because they do not provide specifics, such as brand and model numbers for the products. The company is especially prolific in utilizing this strategy while advertising television sets. The site does list a number of offers that it considers better deals for electronics products on Amazon. \nAs a cursory experiment, we compared prices for Sennheiser HD 598 Over-Ear headphones across three sites: Amazon, Google Shopping, and Walmart. Each of these sites displayed an aggregate price for the product with Google Shopping being the cheapest at $133.58. However, that price belonged to a marketplace with listed sellers and buyers. Drilling down to details revealed that prices for the headphone's black versions were comparable between Google Shopping and Amazon. The Wall Street Journal article lists other objects, such as ugly sweaters, which are cheaper on Google Shopping as compared to Amazon.

      "text": "Carnival Partners with Amazon (CCL, AMZN) By Dan Moskowitz | November 21, 2016 — 11:58 PM EST \nCarnival Corporation ( CCL ) and Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) have partnered on a pre-Black Friday promotion. The first 1,500 people to click on a Carnival ad posted on Amazon and book a cruise between Nov. 21 and 23 will receive an Amazon Echo Dot. The cruise must be booked for between March 2017 and April 2019 and must be paid in full at the time of booking. \nIf you’re not familiar with the Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon specifically describes it as “a hands-free, voice-controlled device that uses Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, provide information, read the news, and set alarms.” \nThe current cost for the Amazon Echo Dot is $49.99. Therefore, this promotion isn’t likely to attract many new travelers. On the other hand, it could influence travelers who had plans to book a cruise to book sooner, which locks up that revenue for Carnival before those travelers change their minds. For Amazon, this promotion has the potential to drive more consumers into its ecosystem. (See also, Carnival Cruise Creates Mini-Tsunami ) \nChristine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line, released the following statement: “Amazon has a huge audience with the potential to introduce thousands of new consumers to the world of cruising, so being one of the first cruise lines to work with them for a Black Friday promotion opens a world of possibilities. Both Carnival and Amazon offer an exceptional range of options and experiences in music, food, family and entertainment, which makes this an exciting collaboration.” \nJeremi Gorman, Head of North American advertising sales for Amazon Media Group, said, “Amazon is focused on delighting customers with the best offers and experiences – including from brands that don’t sell their products directly on our site. We are thrilled to be working with a leading cruise line such as Carnival on this unique program, and to help our customers discover the joy of cruising!” \nThis is a small promotion that won’t move the revenue needle for either company in the immediate future, but it’s also low risk for both sides and the real value is gained exposure to new sets of consumers for both Carnival and Amazon. \nCCL has slipped 0.21% over the past 12 months, but it currently offers a dividend yield of 2.75%. \nAMZN has appreciated 11.75% over the past 12 months. It does not pay a dividend. Subscribe to News To Use for the latest insights and analysis Thanks for signing up to Investopedia Insights - News to Use.",

      "title": "Pilot strike at Wilmington company could delay Amazon, DHL delive",
      "text": "Pilots for a Wilmington-based cargo airline that fly for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just days before the crucial Black Friday shopping holiday begins.\nAir Transport Services Group officials said they sought a court order in Cincinnati’s U.S. District Court ordering the 250 pilots who picketed Tuesday to go back to work, calling it an “illegal work stoppage.”\nATSG president and CEO Joe Hete told the Dayton Daily News he hoped the strike would not last long.\n“Hopefully, sane minds will prevail, and we’ll get this resolved shortly,” Hete said.\nRELATED: AMAZON GROWTH HELPS AREA AIR PARK GROW BUSINESSES\nThe striking pilots who fly for ABX Air, a subsidiary of ATSG, are members of Airline Professionals Association of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 1224.\nThe strike cancelled about 80 flights at Wilmington Air Park and the DHL hub in Cincinnati, according to the union. The cargo carrier operates 45 flights a day for DHL and 35 for Amazon.\nA person familiar with the situation at the Wilmington Air Park told the Dayton Daily News that Amazon planned to ground its flights Wednesday at the Wilmington Air Park. Hete declined to comment on the status of any flights.\nAn Amazon spokeswoman, Kelly Cheeseman, did not immediately respond to a question about flight plans, but said, “We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers.”\nAmazon’s relationship with ATSG is still young.\nIn March, ATSG announced that Amazon was positioned to become not only the company’s most important customer but a part-owner.\nAmazon was leasing six ATSG Boeing 767s to assist in the delivery side of its business, ATSG said in March. The agreement lets Amazon lease up to 20 of the planes.\nJohn Haber, founder of Atlanta-based supply chain consultant Spend Management Experts, said the number of flights affected by the strike are a “big deal,” especially during the Christmas shopping season. DHL operates on a much smaller basis in the U.S. market, compared to Amazon, while Amazon’s Wilmington flights are part of the online retailer’s new air cargo network, he said.\n“It’s Black Friday week,” Haber said. “In the overall scope of things, is it a massive amount of volume? It’s not massive, but it’s not good.”\n“The Teamsters are pretty crafty,” he added. “They have more leverage this week than pretty much any time other than maybe the week or two before Christmas.”\nIn the long run, the strike may hurt ATSG more than Amazon simply because ATSG is smaller, Haber said.\n“Amazon has a lot more leverage if this thing draws out,” he said.\nFinding another air cargo carrier quickly may be difficult even for the huge online retailer, Haber said.\nBottom line, the longer the strike goes on, the more likely it is there could be a “domino effect,” he said.\nSaid Haber, “I’m sure they (Amazon) were planning on those 30 airplanes being in use today and tomorrow.”\nRandy Riesbeck, a striking pilot, said ABX is violating its contract with the union, forcing him to fly more than 40 days he should have had off. Other pilots face similar situations, having flown a total of more than 8,000 extra days in excessive “emergency assignments,” he and other striking pilots said.\n“It’s very tiring, very fatiguing on the body,” Riesbeck told WHIO-TV.\nUnion negotiators have proposed what he called a “workable solution.” He said the union regrets that shipments may be late, but he added: “ABX has left us with no choice.”\nDavid Wagenseller of Wilmington was shopping for new TVs Tuesday at the Best Buy store near the Dayton Mall.\n“We are frequent shoppers of Amazon,” Wagenseller said. “I actually just heard this news this morning so it’s concerning because Amazon has been huge for our local community in the Clinton County, Wilmington area.”\n“I certainly hope that does not happen,” he added.\nEarlier this month, a federal court judge rejected a request by ABX Air for a temporary restraining order against its pilots and their union, the Teamsters noted in a release from Berlin Rosen, the union’s public relations firm.\nJudge Timothy S. Black of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Ohio, wrote that he denied the restraining order because the “court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims.”\nPilots picketed Tuesday outside ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington and outside DHL’s North American hub at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport.\nATSG’s subsidiaries include ABX Air, Inc.; Airborne Global Solutions, Inc.; Air Transport International, Inc.; Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc. and other companies.\nLast month, the Teamsters asked the National Mediation Board to investigate ATSG.\nATSG owns ABX Air and Air Transport International Inc. The union contends the ATSG operates the two carriers as a single transportation system while “maintaining a facade of two separate carriers,” the union said in a statement.\n“Historically, airline holding companies have owned and operated multiple airline subsidiaries and kept them separate from one another for various reasons, some of which were designed to artificially suppress labor costs and conditions. The historical model no longer works due to vastly changed economic conditions affecting the airline industry, including the increasingly dire shortage of pilots across the world, which are now straining airlines’ ability to efficiently, effectively and safely serve their customers,” the Teamsters said in an Oct. 27 statement.\nStaff Writer Rachel Murray and WHIO-TV reporter Gabrielle Enright contributed to this story.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Exclusive: Amazon To Play Up New Database, Artificial Intelligence at Cloud Confab \nNext week at its annual AWS re:Invent tech conference , Amazon Web Services is expected to unveil a new easier-to-manage version of the popular PostgreSQL database for its cloud customers. \nIn so doing, the Amazon amzn cloud unit is repeating its own history by taking a database that already runs on its infrastructure , then basically cloning it and offering it as a fully managed service. AWS did the same thing with MySQL, another popular open source database, when it released Aurora . AWS claims that product is the fastest-growing service in its history. \nThe basics of the announcement were confirmed by several sources familiar with the plan but who are not authorized to speak about it. AWS declined to comment for this story. \nPostgreSQL database is seen by many as a better option than MySQL for larger customers looking for less pricey alternatives to offerings from Oracle orcl and Microsoft msft . So this move makes sense given Amazon’s focus on winning Fortune 500 accounts. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nAWS execs are also expected to use their stage time in Las Vegas to talk about how they will make the machine learning technology that powers Alexa , Amazon.com’s amzn popular personal assistant, available to more developers. \nTo be clear, AWS partisans already use tools like AWS Lambda to build Alexa applications that can do banking , schedule an Uber uber ride, or order a pizza. \nBut Amazon needs to offer more powerful machine learning capabilities to its cloud customers. As a recap, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that trains computers to recognize patterns from tons of data. It enables breakthroughs in image or facial recognition; by poring through myriad images, a computer can “recognize” a person or a cat, and even detect emotions based on facial expressions. The technology also underlies the ability of computers to translate human speech from one language to another. For more on AWS, watch: \n“AWS lags both Microsoft msft and Google goog in providing machine learning tools to do a lot of heavy lifting,” said one source familiar with the plans who requested anonymity. Other sources confirmed Amazon plans to announce new Alexa-like machine learning tools for AWS developers. \nThere could also be news about a new, more flexible option for of Amazon’s basic cloud computing service, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), that lets customers add or delete memory or processor cores as needed to fit their needs. This service would mimic the Google Custom Machine Types announced early this year. \nRight now, customers pretty much have to buy the EC2 configurations and options that Amazon lists: There are very many to choose from but each option is static. A re-configurable choice would provide more flexibility for customers whose needs change by the day (or the minute.) \nAmazon has been trickling out updates to its cloud services leading into re:Invent. Over the past few weeks, the cloud computing leader cut prices on some core computing instances ; said its QuickSight analytics product, announced l ast year is now available; and updated AWS Marketplace to handle subscriptions of third-party software. It also cut storage prices. \nIn addition, last week AWS also introduced what it called the AWS Serverless Application Model , aka Project Flourish, to help developers build “event-driven applications.” This type of software performs actions based on a specific trigger, such as a user pressing a button, or sensor data hitting a predetermined threshold. One real-world example: when your home thermostat dips below 50 degrees, your furnace kicks on without human intervention. \nThat’s quite a flood of feature-and-function news but, if history is prologue, the really big announcements will come onstage next week as AWS chief executive Andy Jassy, chief technology officer Werner Vogels or product strategy general manager Matt Wood take the stage in Las Vegas.

      "text": "The Amazon Treasure Truck rolled into Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood on Tuesday night with a turkey deal just in time for Thanksgiving. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) The Treasure Truck was the “turkey truck” on this Tuesday before the Thanksgiving holiday in the Seattle area.\nAmazon’s lit up, roaming, deals on wheels destination was out and about delivering fresh, 14- to 16-pound free-range turkeys from Woodinville, Wash.-based meat company Porter & York . The $43 deal also included a Cuisinart thermometer, roasting pan and roasting bag.\nGeekWire caught up with the truck in the parking lot of a Spirit gas station in Ballard at the corner of Northwest Market Street and 24th Avenue Northwest. A steady stream of customers approached the truck and waited in a short line in the rain to get their boxed turkeys between 7 and 8 p.m.\nCustomers picked up their turkeys beneath a tarp on a rainy night in Seattle. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) After starting in Bellevue on Tuesday, the truck made stops at Seattle’s Occidental Park, Westlake Center and Queen Anne before ending the night in Ballard.\nDeal of the day. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser) “It’s been a very popular offer,” an Amazon marketing assistant told GeekWire as he staffed the truck with a co-worker. “Ballard is a good location for us. People like seeing us out here.”\nThe truck was also offering upsell items to keep with the holiday cooking theme. Those items included a meat smoker, bear claws meat shredders, a baster and a fancier thermometer.\nThe truck usually goes out once or twice a week and alerts customers via an app notification or a text message with what deal is on the truck that day and where it will be parked.\nAmazon’s Ballard presence is only going to increase as its secretive drive-up grocery store — just blocks from where the Treasure Truck was parked on Tuesday — appears to be getting closer to an opening day .\nAmazon couldn’t tell us how many turkeys it had sold off the Treasure Truck.

      "text": "Amazon is taking new steps to help sellers battle counterfeiters in its online marketplace, according to a news report.\nThe e-commerce giant is testing a new set of digital tools called Brand Central to help merchants prevent other sellers from copying and selling their products, tech news site CNET reported on Tuesday.\nIn recent months, Amazon’s AMZN marketplace, which sells everything from toilet paper to Mickey Mouse t-shirts to exercise equipment, has come under fire for counterfeit items. CNBC reported earlier this year that counterfeit items sold by third-party sellers—many of whom are China-based—are an increasing problem.\nAccording to the report, Amazon has been “courting” more Chinese manufacturers, raising the risk of more counterfeit merchandise in its marketplace. Because of this, some sellers are losing trust in the marketplace and are even complaining of a loss in sales.\nApple recently said that many of Apple-branded chargers for smartphones and laptops sold on Amazon are fake, for instance. Amazon is an authorized reseller of Apple products.\nFor more on Amazon, watch this:\nIn response, Amazon started in August to impose steeper fees and require additional paperwork from suspicious sellers. The fees, which ranged from $1,000 to $1,500, were assessed to sellers who sold counterfeit items. A few weeks ago, Amazon also filed its first lawsuits against sellers who allegedly sold counterfeit goods on the site. The company, which says it invests tens of millions of dollars annually to combat sales of bogus items, employs a team of software engineers, research scientists, program managers, and investigators to root out counterfeits.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nAccording to CNET, the new anti-counterfeit tool will help sellers protect their trademarked goods and ensure that the source of the items they sell is legitimate.\nAmazon is likely trying to ensure that sellers don’t flee its marketplace during the holiday season, its busiest time of year. It must reassure sellers that they are not at risk of losing sales to competitors selling fakes at lower prices. According to a CNBC report, Forearm Forklift, a seller of exercise equipment, saw annual revenue plunge 30% since 2008 because of competition from fakes on Amazon. Amazon is also trying to send a message to shoppers that everything they buy is authentic.\nAmazon isn’t the only e-commerce giant to deal with counterfeit problems. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has also struggled with fake items. Specifically, Alibaba’s flagship e-commerce marketplace Taobao, has been known for selling counterfeit goods.\nAmazon did not respond for a request for comment.",

      "title": "Amazon Holiday Shipments Could Be Delayed Following a Pilot Strike",
      "text": "Amazon’s holiday season has become far more complicated.\nApproximately 250 pilots who fly cargo carriers for ABX Air went on strike Tuesday morning and have declined to fly any of their scheduled routes until they can come to an agreement with their employer. ABX, which is owned by the Air Transport Services Group (ATSG), has several cargo customers, but its two biggest are Amazon and DHL. And now the pilots and the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224 union supporting them are saying Amazon’s shipments could be impacted, leading to delivery delays for the e-retail giant’s customers.\nAccording to the pilots, the cargo carrier is flying 14 aircraft and 35 flights per day for Amazon AMZN , carrying the company’s goods from one spot to another to facilitate shipments to customers. In a statement, the pilots say “Amazon customers will also see delays and disruptions.” DHL relies on Air Transport Services Group for 45 flights per day.\nThe row between the pilots and ABX is due in part to what the pilots say is a company that is “significantly understaffed.” They claim ABX Air and ATSG are violating their employment contract by forcing them to work “emergency assignments” when they’re not scheduled to fly, and not allowing them to take extra time off for their additional work.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\n“I take my job as a pilot seriously, and I’m committed to serving ABX Air and our customers, but I’m also a father of a little girl and help care for my aging mother,” Randy Riesbeck, an ABX pilot, said in a statement. “On numerous occasions I have had to miss my daughter’s school events and previously scheduled medical appointments for my mother, all because ABX Air emergency assigned me to work on a day I had scheduled off. How am I supposed to explain to my daughter why I wasn’t there to see her grow up? How do I explain to my mother that I can’t take her to the doctor?”\nThe pilots add that their work schedule is “causing stress and strain” and say their employers might be violating a U.S. law governing work and compensation.\n“To date in 2016, pilots have been scheduled to cover over 8000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off,” a statement reads. “As the airline moves into peak holiday flying season, ABX Air and ATSG are refusing to honor contractual provisions regarding compensatory time and vacation time in order to cover the pilot deficit. This change violates the terms of the company’s agreement with the pilots, which is a violation of the status quo under the Railway Labor Act.”\nABX Air said in a statement on Tuesday that it believes the strike is “illegal” and says it will use the court system to put an end to the stoppage.\nFor more about Amazon , watch:\n“We will seek a court order later today to restore the status quo operating environment, even as we continue discussions with union representatives about specific issues of concern,” ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement. “We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements.”\nThe chief executive added that its customers might face “temporary interruptions” to their service, but didn’t say how far-reaching the delays might be.\nAn Amazon spokesperson didn’t say how the work stoppage might affect the company’s shipments and customer service.\n“We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,” the spokesperson said in a statement. It’s unclear how much of Amazon’s logistics network relies upon the 35 affected flights.\nIn a statement to Fortune , an ABX Air spokesperson did not elaborate beyond Starkovich’s public comments.\nThe strike comes just a day after workers at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, announced a strike ahead of the busy holiday travel season .",

      "text": "Bitcoin wallet provider iPayYou, Inc . has launched a new service that allows users to purchase goods on Amazon.com Inc. using bitcoin.\n\nCalled Amazon Direct, the service allows users to seamlessly transfer any amount of bitcoin from their iPayYou bitcoin wallet to Amazon. To use, an iPayYou customer determines the dollar amount they want to transfer then a destination account at Amazon.com, then simply click a button to make a transfer.\nOnce the transfer is complete the amount credited to the Amazon account can be used to make any sort of purchase.\nAmazon Direct differs from existing bitcoin to Amazon.com services such as Purse.io who acquire unwanted Amazon gift cards and certificates and then sells them to users for Bitcoin. Instead, iPayYou acquires digital gift card balances from ACI, a company that transfers the fiat balances from its own Amazon account to the user’s personal account.\niPayYou, a company which we last wrote about in July when they launched a bitcoin to Twitter payments services, is headed by Chief Executive Officer Gene Kavner, who previously held the position of world-wide leader of the Amazon Associates program, giving him a wealth of experience when it comes to deal with the e-commerce giant.\n“Amazon Direct is the best way to spend bitcoin: after determining what you want on Amazon, you can ‘automagically’ transfer bitcoin from iPayYou to Amazon. Amazon Direct is revolutionizing the way consumers are able to spend their bitcoin by granting them access to buy more than 100 million products at the world’s largest store,”Kavner said in a statement.\n“During my time as an executive at Amazon, we closely studied the friction points and obstacles faced by shoppers, including and especially with payments. Bitcoin is a solution to so many of those problems,” added Kavner. “That’s why today – in time for the holiday season –we’re launching the most direct way to spend bitcoin anywhere, starting with the world’s largest retailer.”\nFees Naturally, there are fees involved with using Amazon Direct, but they are not onerous at all. iPayYou charges a flat fee of 1 percent per transaction with a minimum purchase of $1, plus the network fee which is currently around $0.13.\nWe were positive on iPayYou when we last wrote about them, and with their new Amazon Direct offering that positivity remains. While Purse.io does on occasion offer discounts which are not being offered here, iPayYou one-ups them when it comes to speed and simplicity of use, and combined with the company’s other offerings makes for a highly appealing bundle of bitcoin-related tools.\nImage credit: iPayYou/screenshot  ",

      "text": "  17:00 PM EST Amazon Badger Shaving Brush Brand Latherwhip Launches No Mo’ Movember Giveaway \nLatherwhip Founder 'AJ Hardy' continues to raise awareness of the brand's \"No Mo' Movember\" movement and hopes to raise further awareness of Men's health issues. Latherwhip is giving away coupons to get its top-rated $60 badger hair shaving brush for $3.60 through Amazon to celebrate. \nBeaverton, OR, United States - November 22, 2016 /PressCable/ — \nOne of Amazon.com’s most trusted male grooming brands ‘Latherwhip’ has today announced a giveaway of it’s top rated badger hair shaving brush (which usually retails at $59.99) for $3.60 through Amazon. The shave brush giveaway is to mark Latherwhip’s “No Mo’ Movember” campaign. \nCoupons Can Be Claimed Through This Website for this week only. \nLatherwhip founder AJ Hardy has previously stated how he has wanted to use the small, but much-loved brand to raise greater awareness for a something important. Hardy believes Movember is a critically important movement, yet before now felt the brand wasn’t best able to join in with the spirit of ‘No Shave November’ or ‘Movember’ since the primary purpose of current Latherwhip products is essentially to ‘remove’ hair. \nThe “No Mo’ Movember” campaign is therefore set up to ‘follow up’ the official Movember campaign as gentlemen quite often prefer to return to their cleaner shaven or ‘stache-less’ style. \nThis of course presents the perfect opportunity to shave in the classic style, with a brush, some good soap, in a mug, with a good razor. Hardy mentioned that even if a gentleman only treats himself to a classic shave once every couple of weeks or so – it’s still an important time to indulge in a classic masculine pursuit. \nThe Movember movement itself is, of course, in place to raise awareness of men’s health issues, including prostate cancer, testicular cancer and male suicide. The aim is to increase early cancer detection, diagnosis and effective treatments – in order the reduce the number of preventable deaths. \nThe shaving brush itself is a well loved and top rated item by customers and sells exclusively through Amazon.com at an MSRP of $59.99 currently at 50% off for the holidays. \nThe “No Mo’ Movember” Coupon allows folks to pick up their own brush (or as a gift) for $3.60. \nFor more information, please visit http://latherwhip.com \nContact Info:",

The light/medium is always around $7.50 ish online, $8.50 in stores. \n\n(IMO - this is a really good product and I normally hate most of them with color added -- this one is subtle, not orangey, good with all skin types etc. 2 ounces is a smaller amount but a little bit goes a long way.

In most cases, it is.\nBROWSE 2016 BLACK FRIDAY NEWSPAPER ADS: Walmart | Target | Toys'R'Us | Best Buy | Lowe's | Kohl's | Academy Sports + Outdoors | Dick's Sporting Goods | Sears | Macy's | Top 25 Deals\nEven on the low end, most major retailers beat Amazon's best prices about 50 percent of the time. Most were much higher.\nOverall, only about 17.3 percent of items will actually be more expensive in stores on Black Friday than they were ahead of Black Friday on Amazon. The overwhelming majority of items - 78 percent - had a significant discount over Amazon prices.\nWalletHub also found that not all Black Friday deals were equal. For example, shoppers get the biggest bang for their Black Friday buck on video games, where they save 31 percent by waiting until Black Friday to shop. On the other end, shoppers buying jewelry only saved 0.4 percent waiting for Black Friday.\nAnother interesting WalletHub find: 11 percent of Black Friday deals were the same as last year . Sears was the retailer most likely to recycle deals (28 percent of items), which might make sense when you're dealing in durable goods, such as tools and appliances. Amazon is recycling about 10.8 percent of deals from a year ago, while Dell Home is recycling the lowest percentage: only about 2.7 percent.\nCheck out the retailers that give Amazon prices a run for their money in the gallery above.",

      "text": "November 22, 2016 Filed Under: Amazon , Gifts , Roundups by Lil' Luna 0 This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclosure policy here . In the past, I’ve always thought that buying gifts for kids was pretty easy. I’m trying to figure out why I don’t feel that way so much now. Maybe it’s because my kids all have different interests and it’s hard to remember who likes what. Maybe it’s because there are just SOOO many different toys to buy and it’s hard to narrow it down to one. Maybe it’s because I’m a lot more picky in the toys that they get because I don’t like ones with too many small pieces or glitter. 😉 In case you are like me, it’s nice to have a list of the Best Gifts for Kids 5 and under that can all be found on Amazon. They range in price but none are too expensive and all would make great birthday and Christmas gifts. I had my 2 youngest go through some toy magazines and these are some of their favorites. I also picked these based off of Amazon reviews and how popular they were. I’m thinking any of them will be a hit, and I hope this list helps you save some time this holiday season. I also love hearing any suggestions you have so we can add it to the list next year, so be sure to leave a comment below if you other great gift ideas for young kids. 😉 Best Gifts for Kids 5 and under:",

      "title": "ABX Air pilots strike affecting air cargo for Amazon and DHL as holidays near",
      "text": "Pilots at ABX Air, an express cargo airline that serves online retail giant Amazon and DHL Express, went on strike on Tuesday, a critical time for retailers with the holiday shopping season about to kick into high gear. Some 250 pilots, who are represented by the Teamsters union, went on strike in the early morning, affecting around 75 flights, mostly for Amazon and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG.\nPilots went on strike because ABX, owned by Air Transport Services Group Inc, has violated its contract by asking them to work emergency hours over the last two years because of a staffing shortage, but then failed to grant them compensatory time off or allow pilots to take earned vacations, the union said.\n“Our pilots are striking so that we can have the status quo of our contract restored, and we would like that to be in the next minute so we can return to serving our customers,” said Tim Jewell, a pilot and secretary treasurer of Teamster Local 1224, which represents ABX pilots. “But if the company chooses not to do that our members are prepared to continue striking.”\nAir Transport Services Group said in a statement that ABX was taking multiple steps to tackle what it called an “illegal work stoppage” including seeking a court order to get the pilots back to work.\n“We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labour agreements,” ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement. ABX is notifying customers so they can make alternative arrangements.\nThe strike comes just ahead of Cyber Monday, which is the biggest day of the year for internet shopping and is expected to break records this year. Amazon said it has contracts with the major U.S. package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, giving it sufficient alternatives to ABX. “We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,” Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.\nDHL, however, said the strike had affected deliveries of goods into the United States. “Due to a work stoppage affecting our airline partners, inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today,” the company said in a statement. “We are continuing to monitor the situation.”\nReuters \nThe post ABX Air pilots strike affecting air cargo for Amazon and DHL as holidays near appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "title": "Amazon's Holiday Deliveries Face Turbulence From Pilot Strike",
      "text": "Amazon.com Inc.'s newly established in-house transportation network is facing a rocky start to its all-important holiday season.\nPilots contracted to deliver Amazon packages began picketing Tuesday because of a longstanding labor dispute, a sign of further potential disruptions through the end of the year at one of Amazon's two airline partners.\nThe pilots are employed by Air Transport Services Group Inc., which alongside Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., was hired by Amazon to fly its packages in 40 dedicated jets by the end of 2018. About 16 will be in operation by the end of the year, according to the companies.\nBut the contracts with Amazon, which is beginning to build its own transportation network through these kinds of partnerships, have added more flights and staffing needs at ATSG and Atlas. The increased demand is upsetting pilots as they try to agree on new labor contracts with management.\nIn a complaint filed in federal court Tuesday, ABX Air Inc., a subsidiary of ATSG, said Christmas shopping and deliveries have already been disrupted and could worsen if the industrial action continues.It also filed a request for a temporary restraining order. Atlas declined to comment on whether it was affected by the ATSG industrial action on Tuesday.\nAmazon said it works with a variety of carriers and is \"confident in our ability to serve customers.\"\nThis holiday season is the first major test of whether Amazon can lessen its reliance on traditional delivery partners like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. In addition to the plane leasing, Amazon is putting more drivers on the road in vans branded with its logo to take on huge amounts of additional packages. It also wants to be a competitor to UPS and FedEx, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAmazon has asked certain last-mile delivery partners to increase holiday capacity by as much as double in recent weeks—a difficult ask due to an already tight labor market and shortage of rental vehicles, according to people familiar with those requests. It is tied to Amazon's move to consolidate deliveries to the same address into one vehicle, known as \"Project Zero\", instead of routing them through several different carriers.\n\"It's unrealistic to ask you to double your capacity at a week's notice,\" said an executive at one of those companies.\nAmazon said that there hasn't been a recent shift in its holiday forecasts or capacity needs.\nAmazon determined that it needed to take its destiny into its own hands after holiday delivery problems in 2013, when bad weather followed by a flurry of last-minute online orders at retailers caused millions of packages to arrive after Christmas.\nSince then, it has increased its reliance on the U.S. Postal Service, regional delivery companies and smaller, last-mile delivery companies, as well as its own citizen courier fleet of Flex drivers, as it built out its network of warehouses. Amazon started a trial in September last year with ATSG, initially leasing five Boeing Co. 767 freighter jets to link its distribution centers through the airline's Wilmington, Ohio, hub.\nHowever, Amazon also walked into longstanding labor disputes over pay and working conditions at some cargo airlines, though both ATSG and Atlas said they have had no problem recruiting extra pilots.\nABX's legal filing said that the Tuesday action caused the cancellation of 26 flights and stranded more than 1.25 million pounds of cargo for its other major customer, Deutsche Post AG's DHL.\nIf more flights are canceled due to the action, it \"will result in millions of dollars of freight and packages not timely being delivered to retailers and homes,\" the complaint said.\nAside from ATSG's base in Ohio, the jets are operating up to eight daily flights for Amazon from airports that include the online-retail giant's Seattle base, Stockton and Ontario in California, Rockford, Ill., Lehigh Valley Airport in Allentown, Pa., and Tampa, Fla.., according to people familiar with the network.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 21:05 ET (02:05 ",

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

      "text": "Pilots at ABX Air, an express cargo airline that serves online retail giant Amazon and DHL Express, went on strike on Tuesday, a critical time for retailers with the holiday shopping season about to kick into high gear. Some 250 pilots, who are represented by the Teamsters union, went on strike in the early morning, affecting around 75 flights, mostly for Amazon and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG.\nPilots went on strike because ABX, owned by Air Transport Services Group Inc, has violated its contract by asking them to work emergency hours over the last two years because of a staffing shortage, but then failed to grant them compensatory time off or allow pilots to take earned vacations, the union said.\n“Our pilots are striking so that we can have the status quo of our contract restored, and we would like that to be in the next minute so we can return to serving our customers,” said Tim Jewell, a pilot and secretary treasurer of Teamster Local 1224, which represents ABX pilots. “But if the company chooses not to do that our members are prepared to continue striking.”\nAir Transport Services Group said in a statement that ABX was taking multiple steps to tackle what it called an “illegal work stoppage” including seeking a court order to get the pilots back to work.\n“We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labour agreements,” ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement. ABX is notifying customers so they can make alternative arrangements.\nThe strike comes just ahead of Cyber Monday, which is the biggest day of the year for internet shopping and is expected to break records this year. Amazon said it has contracts with the major U.S. package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, giving it sufficient alternatives to ABX. “We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,” Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.\nDHL, however, said the strike had affected deliveries of goods into the United States. “Due to a work stoppage affecting our airline partners, inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today,” the company said in a statement. “We are continuing to monitor the situation.”\nReuters \nThe post ABX Air pilots strike affecting air cargo for Amazon and DHL as holidays approach appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nDonald Trump meets with The New York Times after Twitter spat\nGood afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Thanks for checking out this week's edition of Swerve. Before we break for Thanksgiving, here's your latest helping of news and musings on AT&T Inc. (T), Time Warner Inc. (TWX) and on what's happening in the media industry as a whole. Plus, the latest news from President-elect Donald Trump. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media (https://marketwatch.typeform.com/to/YStdOx).\nBroken promises: President-elect Donald Trump made a lot of promises during his more than 18-month run to win the White House. He's walked back several of those, including the scale of his planned border wall, the repeal and replacement of Obamacare and the plan to prosecute rival Hillary Clinton. Trump also promised he would straight up block AT&T's proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner. His campaign said he \"would never approve such a deal.\" But as Recode reporter April Glaser writes (http://www.recode.net/2016/11/21/13700452/trump-att-time-warner-merger-antitrust-regulation-fcc), the advisers Trump tapped to oversee the FCC and Justice Department transitions \"have a history of being very pro-industry and anti-regulation, particularly when it comes to mergers.\"\nJeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, who are helping with the FCC transition, argued in favor of AT&T's proposed, but ultimately failed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011. And Eisenach said consolidation was the best thing that could happen in the cable business when Comcast was considering a Time Warner takeover in 2013.\nAngry bird: Donald Trump made sure the world knew his feelings about the \"highly overrated\" Broadway hit \"Hamilton\" and its cast 's message to his Vice President Mike Pence (https://twitter.com/HamiltonMusical/status/799828567941120000) last weekend. Trump took to Twitter again on Tuesday to vent about the New York Times. And not for the first time.\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/801021596228091905)\nTrump met with -- and gave an earful to -- executives and anchors from the country's five biggest TV networks on Monday, according to CNN Money (http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/21/media/donald-trump-meeting-tv-networks/index.html). Trump reportedly vented about media coverage, but also committed to improving media access. On Tuesday he was set to meet with the New York Times, but canceled after incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus urged him to (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/business/media/donald-trump-new-york-times.html), according to Times reporter Sydney Ember. Priebus was allegedly concerned Trump would face questions he wasn't prepared to answer. The meeting was eventually rescheduled. Times staffers posted updates throughout the duration of the meeting, which you can read here (http://www.nytimes.com/live/trump-at-the-new-york-times-the-tweets/).\nThe dark side: Donald Trump's new chief strategist Steve Bannon sat down with Michael Wolff of the Hollywood Reporter to talk (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steve-bannon-trump-tower-interview-trumps-strategist-plots-new-political-movement-948747?utm_source=twitter&mc_cid=6eb79f2d7b&mc_eid=e05bfb64d5) about plotting \"an entirely new political movement.\" Bannon, who is the former news chief of controversial alt-right news site Breitbart, has been slammed since his appointment for being a white nationalist. He told Wolff:\n\"Darkness is good. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power. It only helps us when they [liberals and the media] get it wrong. When they're blind to who we are and what we're doing.\"\nAmazon's Hail Mary: Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) really wants to get into streaming sports. And any sport will do. Wall Street Journal reporter Shalini Ramachandran, (http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-explores-possible-premium-sports-package-with-prime-membership-1479757001) citing sources, writes that Amazon has been in talks with the NBA, MLB, NFL and even lacrosse and surfing leagues for the rights to carry live games. Live sports are the last frontier in streaming TV, as one of the few things forcing fans to keep their cable TV subscription. The NFL and Twitter signed a deal to live stream Thursday Night Football games.\nTeam up: The two biggest fantasy sports sites, DraftKings Inc. and FanDuel Inc., have agreed to set aside their differences and merge, as they both struggle with regulatory and legal challenges to their core business, writes Wall Street Journal reporter Alexandra Berzon (http://www.wsj.com/articles/draftkings-and-fanduel-agree-to-merge-1479479405).\nFOMO:Claire Atkinson at the New York Post reports (http://nypost.com/2016/11/20/abc-is-exploring-a-24-hours-new-channel/) that Walt Disney Co. (DIS) network ABC is exploring the possibility of a 24-hour news digital news channel.\nForce to be reckoned with: Disney's \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" set for its North American release on Dec. 16, is tracking for a massive $150 million box office debut, according to The Hollywood Reporter (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-tracking-huge-130m-us-debut-949896).\nThanks for reading Swerve.

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike   12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

      "text": "By Laura Stevens and Doug Cameron\nAmazon's new transportation network off to bumpy start\nAmazon.com Inc.'s newly established in-house transportation network is facing a rocky start to its all-important holiday season.\nPilots contracted to deliver Amazon packages began picketing Tuesday because of a longstanding labor dispute, a sign of further potential disruptions through the end of the year at one of Amazon's two airline partners.\nThe pilots are employed by Air Transport Services Group Inc. (ATSG) , which alongside Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. (AAWW) , was hired by Amazon (AMZN) to fly its packages in 40 dedicated jets by the end of 2018. About 16 will be in operation by the end of the year, according to the companies.\nBut the contracts with Amazon, which is beginning to build its own transportation network through these kinds of partnerships, have added more flights and staffing needs at ATSG and Atlas. The increased demand is upsetting pilots as they try to agree on new labor contracts with management. In a complaint filed in federal court Tuesday, ABX Air Inc., a subsidiary of ATSG, said Christmas shopping and deliveries have already been disrupted and could worsen if the industrial action continues.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-holiday-deliveries-face-turbulence-from-pilot-strike-1479865150).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump calls for day-one executive actions, outlines first 100 days (http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-calls-for-list-of-day-one-executive-actions-outlines-first-100-days-1479775808?mod=mktw).\nMost students don't know when news is fake, Stanford study finds (http://www.wsj.com/articles/most-students-dont-know-when-news-is-fake-stanford-study-finds-1479752576?mod=mktw).\n-Laura Stevens ; 2055ET\n ",

      "title": "Amazon's Holiday Deliveries Face Turbulence From Pilot Strike",
      "text": "By Laura Stevens and Doug Cameron\nAmazon.com Inc.'s newly established in-house transportation network is facing a rocky start to its all-important holiday season.\nPilots contracted to deliver Amazon packages began picketing Tuesday because of a longstanding labor dispute, a sign of further potential disruptions through the end of the year at one of Amazon's two airline partners.\nThe pilots are employed by Air Transport Services Group Inc., which alongside Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., was hired by Amazon to fly its packages in 40 dedicated jets by the end of 2018. About 16 will be in operation by the end of the year, according to the companies.\nBut the contracts with Amazon, which is beginning to build its own transportation network through these kinds of partnerships, have added more flights and staffing needs at ATSG and Atlas. The increased demand is upsetting pilots as they try to agree on new labor contracts with management.\nIn a complaint filed in federal court Tuesday, ABX Air Inc., a subsidiary of ATSG, said Christmas shopping and deliveries have already been disrupted and could worsen if the industrial action continues.It also filed a request for a temporary restraining order. Atlas declined to comment on whether it was affected by the ATSG industrial action on Tuesday.\nAmazon said it works with a variety of carriers and is \"confident in our ability to serve customers.\"\nThis holiday season is the first major test of whether Amazon can lessen its reliance on traditional delivery partners like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. In addition to the plane leasing, Amazon is putting more drivers on the road in vans branded with its logo to take on huge amounts of additional packages. It also wants to be a competitor to UPS and FedEx, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAmazon has asked certain last-mile delivery partners to increase holiday capacity by as much as double in recent weeks -- a difficult ask due to an already tight labor market and shortage of rental vehicles, according to people familiar with those requests. It is tied to Amazon's move to consolidate deliveries to the same address into one vehicle, known as \"Project Zero\", instead of routing them through several different carriers.\n\"It's unrealistic to ask you to double your capacity at a week's notice, \" said an executive at one of those companies.\nAmazon said that there hasn't been a recent shift in its holiday forecasts or capacity needs.\nAmazon determined that it needed to take its destiny into its own hands after holiday delivery problems in 2013, when bad weather followed by a flurry of last-minute online orders at retailers caused millions of packages to arrive after Christmas.\nSince then, it has increased its reliance on the U.S. Postal Service, regional delivery companies and smaller, last-mile delivery companies, as well as its own citizen courier fleet of Flex drivers, as it built out its network of warehouses. Amazon started a trial in September last year with ATSG, initially leasing five Boeing Co. 767 freighter jets to link its distribution centers through the airline's Wilmington, Ohio, hub.\nHowever, Amazon also walked into longstanding labor disputes over pay and working conditions at some cargo airlines, though both ATSG and Atlas said they have had no problem recruiting extra pilots.\nABX's legal filing said that the Tuesday action caused the cancellation of 26 flights and stranded more than 1.25 million pounds of cargo for its other major customer, Deutsche Post AG's DHL.\nIf more flights are canceled due to the action, it \"will result in millions of dollars of freight and packages not timely being delivered to retailers and homes,\" the complaint said.\nAside from ATSG's base in Ohio, the jets are operating up to eight daily flights for Amazon from airports that include the online-retail giant's Seattle base, Stockton and Ontario in California, Rockford, Ill., Lehigh Valley Airport in Allentown, Pa., and Tampa, Fla.., according to people familiar with the network.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 22, 2016 20:54 ET (01:54 ",

      "title": "Amazon's Holiday Deliveries Face Turbulence From Pilot Strike",
      "text": "By Laura Stevens and Doug Cameron\nAmazon.com Inc.'s newly established in-house transportation network is facing a rocky start to its all-important holiday season.\nPilots contracted to deliver Amazon packages began picketing Tuesday because of a longstanding labor dispute, a sign of further potential disruptions through the end of the year at one of Amazon's two airline partners.\nThe pilots are employed by Air Transport Services Group Inc., which alongside Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., was hired by Amazon to fly its packages in 40 dedicated jets by the end of 2018. About 16 will be in operation by the end of the year, according to the companies.\nBut the contracts with Amazon, which is beginning to build its own transportation network through these kinds of partnerships, have added more flights and staffing needs at ATSG and Atlas. The increased demand is upsetting pilots as they try to agree on new labor contracts with management.\nIn a complaint filed in federal court Tuesday, ABX Air Inc., a subsidiary of ATSG, said Christmas shopping and deliveries have already been disrupted and could worsen if the industrial action continues.It also filed a request for a temporary restraining order. Atlas declined to comment on whether it was affected by the ATSG industrial action on Tuesday.\nAmazon said it works with a variety of carriers and is \"confident in our ability to serve customers.\"\nThis holiday season is the first major test of whether Amazon can lessen its reliance on traditional delivery partners like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. In addition to the plane leasing, Amazon is putting more drivers on the road in vans branded with its logo to take on huge amounts of additional packages. It also wants to be a competitor to UPS and FedEx, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAmazon has asked certain last-mile delivery partners to increase holiday capacity by as much as double in recent weeks -- a difficult ask due to an already tight labor market and shortage of rental vehicles, according to people familiar with those requests. It is tied to Amazon's move to consolidate deliveries to the same address into one vehicle, known as \"Project Zero\", instead of routing them through several different carriers.\n\"It's unrealistic to ask you to double your capacity at a week's notice, \" said an executive at one of those companies.\nAmazon said that there hasn't been a recent shift in its holiday forecasts or capacity needs.\nAmazon determined that it needed to take its destiny into its own hands after holiday delivery problems in 2013, when bad weather followed by a flurry of last-minute online orders at retailers caused millions of packages to arrive after Christmas.\nSince then, it has increased its reliance on the U.S. Postal Service, regional delivery companies and smaller, last-mile delivery companies, as well as its own citizen courier fleet of Flex drivers, as it built out its network of warehouses. Amazon started a trial in September last year with ATSG, initially leasing five Boeing Co. 767 freighter jets to link its distribution centers through the airline's Wilmington, Ohio, hub.\nHowever, Amazon also walked into longstanding labor disputes over pay and working conditions at some cargo airlines, though both ATSG and Atlas said they have had no problem recruiting extra pilots.\nABX's legal filing said that the Tuesday action caused the cancellation of 26 flights and stranded more than 1.25 million pounds of cargo for its other major customer, Deutsche Post AG's DHL.\nIf more flights are canceled due to the action, it \"will result in millions of dollars of freight and packages not timely being delivered to retailers and homes,\" the complaint said.\nAside from ATSG's base in Ohio, the jets are operating up to eight daily flights for Amazon from airports that include the online-retail giant's Seattle base, Stockton and Ontario in California, Rockford, Ill., Lehigh Valley Airport in Allentown, Pa., and Tampa, Fla.., according to people familiar with the network.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 20:54 ET (01:54 ",

      "text": "Snowflake Reduces Data Warehouse Storage Pricing by 23 Percent As promised, Snowflake matches Amazon's latest cloud storage price reduction, lowering Snowflake's price by a total of 80 percent over the past month\nSAN MATEO, CA--(Marketwired - Nov 22, 2016) - Snowflake Computing , the data warehouse built for the cloud, today announces an additional 23 percent price reduction for its compressed cloud storage. This represents Snowflake's second price reduction in a month. With today's reduction, Snowflake customers have experienced an 80 percent total price reduction in the past 33 days.\nThe smallest organizations to the largest enterprises continue to benefit from Snowflake's customer-centric strategy of enabling them to affordably store all of their data in one location. Snowflake already delivers the only data warehouse built for the cloud with unmatched performance, concurrency and simplicity. With these further price reductions, Snowflake remains the most affordable data warehouse.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), Snowflake's cloud storage provider, on Monday announced new pricing for its S3 Standard Storage. Snowflake, as previously promised, has lowered its own storage pricing to match Amazon's. This continues Snowflake's strategy as the first data warehouse solution provider, cloud or on-premises, to provide customers the true cost benefits of cloud object storage.\nFrom December 1, 2016, Snowflake's new US storage pricing will:\nReduce compressed capacity storage pricing to $23/TB/month -- a 23 percent savings. Reduce compressed on-demand storage pricing to $40/TB/month -- a 20 percent savings. Effectively reduce uncompressed storage pricing to $5/TB/month or less (assuming 5x compression). In October, Snowflake announced significant price reductions for its US storage, matching Amazon's prices. With Monday's additional pricing announcement, Snowflake customers have received significant total price reductions over the past month:\n80 percent savings for compressed capacity storage 73 percent savings for compressed on-demand storage Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia said in October that Snowflake would pass onto customers the savings of any future storage price reductions from Amazon. Today, Snowflake has made good on that promise and will do so for all future price changes. \"From day one, Snowflake's architecture was designed to deliver the best technology and the best pricing,\" Muglia said. \"Snowflake enables customers to dial their storage and compute up and down with the click of a button so they only pay for what they use. Snowflake is the most affordable data warehouse in the world, allowing customers to store all their data in one location, while reaping the benefits of the most powerful and easy-to-use data warehouse solution on the market.\"\nIn addition to Snowflake's US pricing, Snowflake announces new pricing for its recent EU (Frankfurt) data storage deployment:\nReduce compressed capacity storage pricing to $24.50/TB/month -- a 24 percent savings. Reduce compressed on-demand storage pricing to $45/TB/month -- an 18 percent savings. Effectively reduce uncompressed storage pricing to $5/TB/month or less (assuming 5x compression).

      "title": "Amazon $25 off $75 on Household Essentials",
      "text": "Amazon is offering a $25 off $75 promotion when you buy $75 in total items from on their Holiday Essentials list. Here are all of the eligible items sorted by category. \nGrocery (Drinks, Snacks, Protein bars, Chicken Stock, etc.) Health and Wellness (Cold and Pain Medicines, etc.) Household (Toilet Paper, Trash Bags, Batteries, etc.) Personal Care (Face Wash, Cleansing Towels, Razors, etc. Sample deals. I’m running a couple of quick, simplified scenarios to work out if the deal is generally worth it. I picked these two products at random out of the items I’d at least heard of before and had a rough idea of what they should cost.\nLarabar Gluten Free Snack Bar, 1.7 oz Bars, 16 Coun t is on the list and costs $16.38. If I buy 5 boxes to reach $75, my total is $81.90 – $25 off = $56.90 net. At 80 bars, this works out to $0.71 per bar, which is a pretty good price. Here’s a screenshot of the $25 off:\n\n24-pack of Energizer MAX AA batteries is on the list and costs $9.79. If I buy 9 packs to reach $75, the total becomes $88.11 – $25 off = $63.11 net. That ends up at $0.29 per battery, which is a good price as far as Energizer MAX batteries go. I could certainly buy a cheaper generic brand for a little less (AmazonBasics at $0.24 per battery ). I have found that Energizer MAX batteries really do leak less than both Duracell and Costco Kirkland brands.\nBasically, if you would actually buy these items otherwise, it appears you can actually save some money on this promotion. The prices don’t appear to be hiked up just to be taken back down. You have to pick from the items listed on the page, in their listed quantity. They should already be set as such, but they must also be sold and shipped by Amazon. You should see the $25 off on your checkout page before committing to purchase.\n\n\n\nAmazon $25 off $75 on Household Essentials from My Money Blog . \n© MyMoneyBlog.com , 2016. \n",

      "text": "Top of the Order:\nFirst and 10? There’s no mistaking the fact that how people watch television is undergoing a revolution. We used to dream of a world when we could get 500 TV channels, and then when we got there, many of us discovered that we didn’t have the interest in, or time to watch, oh, say about 485 of those channels for more than 10 minutes at a time.\nNetflix, skinny TV-channel bundles and over-the-top subscription services such as those from HBO and Showtime have all done their part to change the television-viewing landscape. But let’s face it, while smaller TV packages like those offered from Sling may be attractive, they do come with a price. Sometimes that comes in the form of limitations on what channels you can get. And one of the last Holy Grails that the big-name cable and satellite TV providers still wield over their subscribers is live sports broadcasts.\nFor Amazon and its popular Prime video-streaming service, live sports may be the next big thing it has in mind in its rivalry with Netflix. The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon is exploring the creation of a package of “channels,” if you will, that would offer live sports from leagues such as the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball. The potential of such an offering remains in its early stages, but the reasons for wanting to give its Prime subscribers access to live sports programming are easy to see.\nThe main reason would be to attract new subscribers to Amazon’s Prime service. Subscribers currently pay $99 a year for Prime, which, in addition to free two-day delivery on most items they purchase via Amazon, also lets them watch programs, including Amazon originals, on the Prime video-streaming service. The Journal also said that Amazon is looking at offering its own skinny bundle TV channel package, which could include one or more of the live-sports offerings from the major sports leagues.\nMiddle Innings:\nHow Much for That? On Monday, it was reported that Oracle acquired Dyn, a provider of web domain services. The deal was viewed as curious, in part, because Dyn was hit by a cyberattack that shut down several well-known websites for the better part of a day in October. Dyn specializes in services that direct traffic across the internet. As with many of Oracle’s recent purchases, the acquisition of Dyn is meant to boost Oracle’s presence in cloud-based computing.\nFinancial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but Fortune reported Tuesday that Oracle paid between $600 million and $700 million for Dyn, according to “a source close to the deal.” Whatever the final price was, it ended up being a pretty good payout for Dyn, as the company is said to have brought in just under $100 million in financing from venture capital and other investors.\nMore Galaxy Booms? Samsung, still trying to recover from its big recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones that was brought about by the occasional phone exploding in some customers’ pants pockets, is now trying to assuage some fears that another of its phone models might be susceptible to blowing up without any warning.",

      "text": "Pilot strike could delay Amazon, DHL shipping Jefferson Graham , WKYC 10:59 PM. EST November 22, 2016 (Photo: Elizabeth Weise) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nOn the eve of Black Friday, the official start of the holiday shopping season, pilots for a regional Ohio cargo airline that delivers packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike. This could cause delivery delays. \nABX Air, a unit of Air Transport Services Group, said it would try to end the strike by seeking a court order and get the roughly 250 pilots back on the job. \nABX Air operates 45 daily flights for DHL and 35 for Amazon. All were canceled Tuesday. \nBecause pilots won't cross picket lines, planes can not leave the Amazon hub in Wilmington, Ohio, (southeast of Dayton,) or the DHL hub in Cincinnati, according to the Wall Street Journal. \nAmazon, which dominates e-commerce sales, has a big presence in Ohio, where it's building three data centers and two warehouses, according to the Columbus Dispatch. The newspaper says Amazon will invest $1 billion in the state. \nAmazon told Bloomberg it works with many carriers, and was confident it would be able to get packages to customers. \nBetween the two clients, DHL and Amazon accounted for 65% of Air Transport Service's revenue in the third quarter, according to the AP.

      "text": "Denver neighborhoods get roasted in 'Judgmental Maps,' an Amazon best seller in an unusual category 11:41 PM, Nov 22, 2016 Previous Next What started out as a joke between friends about Denver is now a best selling book on Amazon. KMGH Previous Next DENVER -- What started out as a joke between friends about Denver is now a best-selling book on Amazon. \"Judgmental Maps\" is a best seller in the Historical Atlases & Maps section of Amazon. \"The Historical Atlases & Maps category is ripe for innovation,\" said author and comedian Trent Gillaspie. \"What category should it be under?\" asked Denver7 reporter Marshall Zelinger. \"Not Historical Atlases & Maps. Honestly, this should be under Humor, but I think the publisher knows better than putting this up against Amy Schumer and Aziz Ansari, for his like millionth month.\" Gillaspie was back in Denver, where he lived for 20 years, for a Tuesday night book signing at the Tattered Cover on Colfax Avenue. His book takes 77 cities and renames neighborhoods with plenty of judgment. As his book sleeve notes: \"A no-holds-barred look at city life that is at once a love letter and hate mail from the very people who live there.\" \"There are 77 different maps in this book, and those came from 77 different authors,\" said Gillaspie, who helped craft Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Austin (where he now lives), San Antonio, Houston and Bourbon Trail (Kentucky) \"The overall idea of this was to build a blog that was a place where people could anonymously submit these types of maps without the risk of getting fired,\" said Gillaspie. \"I would say this is a little bit anti-PC. We released this on Election Day and then it somehow lined up really well with the rest of things, with a judgmental outlook.\" \"Do you want people to be offended?\" asked Zelinger. \"Yeah, I would like it if everybody who read this book was like, 'Yeah, that's sort of offensive.' I would enjoy that if they said that. If somebody says, 'I'm not offended by this.' Then we probably messed up,\" said Gillaspie. \"It's a truth atlas. It should be funny. You should laugh at it. You're not a horrible person for laughing at it.\" Many of the labels are not journalistically safe to share. \"What's the least offensive label that you have?\" asked Zelinger. \"I think there's a lot in here that is less offensive than it could be. You could talk about 'everyone forgets about this area,' this is off of the Grand Rapids, Michigan map. Everybody forgets about Grand Rapids, let's be honest,\" said Gillaspie. \"'The people who live in those rich neighborhoods are like, 'Yeah, thank you, of course, why wouldn't you label me rich?' Those aren't offensive; those are more like congratulatory.\" He listed off some of the original Denver labels: Hipsters People with cars parked on their lawns Loose Chihuahuas running around the street Bullet holes in windows \"I think probably the most accurate one is 'Cougartown,'\" said Gillaspie of the Cherry Creek area. A comedian friend of his wrote a short blurb for the Baker neighborhood just west of South Broadway. \"Baker, South Broadway: If you're looking to see a group of popped collars waiting in line for brunch while a homeless guy peeing gets ignored by two bearded dudes making vegan ice cream, this is the spot,\" said Gillaspie. One area that got off easy is Casa Bonita, a well-known attraction just west of Denver, which was labeled \"Casa Bonita.\" \"Casa Bonita didn't get a judgment; it should just be 'diarrhea and tortillas,\" said Gillaspie. We asked what emoji he hopes his book causes people to share. \"Take the Facebook options; like, love, whoa and haha, and that's it, oh and the angry face, of course. It's all of them. And then 'poop' (emoji),\" said Gillaspie. \"A lot of people are telling me, 'Hey, it's in my bathroom,' which is great. Didn't make the coffee table, but made the junior varsity in your house.\" He said this book is similar to the 1976 The New Yorker cover of Saul Steinberg's \"A View of the World from 9th Avenue.\" \"Where it's 9th Avenue, 10th Avenue, states, Japan,\" said Gillaspie. \"There's a little bit of edge to it. There's a little bit of snark to it. I think some people are a little bit nervous when they open it up to see what they're going to find. Hey, if you don't like this, life is too short, laugh at it.\" Not all the effort is simply to be snarky. He wants to take some of the proceeds and give back to some of the cities. \"How can we take some of the earnings from this book and put it back into the communities that we're destroying through judgment,\" said Gillaspie. \"I'm a big fan of Habitat for Humanity. I think the Habitat for Humanity does really good work.\" \n----",

      "text": "Amazon appeared to remove several politically motivated negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's memoir Settle for More after a flood of one-star ratings drew media attention. As of early Wednesday, 17% of the reviewers on Amazon gave the book one star. At one point, as many as 76% of the reviews were one-star, Slate reported .\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that many of the reviews were linked to a pro-Trump Reddit forum called \"The_Donald.\"\nSome commenters picked up on the removal of the negative reviews. \"Tim from MD.,\" for example, wrote a post titled \"Over 120 1 star reviews have been deleted. Are we living in a free country anymore?\"\n\"Trump is president, but she wrote the book certain Clinton would win,\" Tim from MD. wrote. \"Now the book and her shows advertisers are getting boycotted. So apparently her attorneys have called to get negative reviews deleted. And they succeeded. I'm shocked.\"\nUSA TODAY\nExclusive: Fox anchor Megyn Kelly describes scary, bullying 'Year of Trump'\nUSA TODAY\nMegyn Kelly takes issue with 'NYT' book review\nBrianna wrote, \"I have written many thoughtful reviews as to why this book is horrible! They have all been removed even though I am a reputable Amazon customer/reviewer which is why originally Megyn had the true rating of one and a half stars and now four and a half FIXED STARS!\"\nAmazon did not remove all the reviews that seem to focus more on the recent presidential campaign than the contents of the book. One reviewer who gave the book a single star wrote nothing more than \"Anti-Trump.\" Another wrote that she is still upset \"over trump calling her out,\" and one reviewer said, \"As unpopular and uninteresting as her show. MAGA,\" using the acronym for \"Make America Great Again.\"\nKelly's publisher, Harper Collins told the L.A. Times that the onslaught of negative reviews had \"the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book and our author Megyn Kelly,” adding that “We have brought it to the attention of Amazon.”\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Megyn Kelly on the air, on the red carpet Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "Latherwhip Founder ‘AJ Hardy’ continues to raise awareness of the brand’s “No Mo’ Movember” movement and hopes to raise further awareness of Men’s health issues. Latherwhip is giving away coupons to get its top-rated $60 badger hair shaving brush for $3.60 through Amazon to celebrate.\nBeaverton, OR, United States – November 22, 2016 /PressCable/ —\nOne of Amazon.com’s most trusted male grooming brands ‘Latherwhip’ has today announced a giveaway of it’s top rated badger hair shaving brush (which usually retails at $59.99) for $3.60 through Amazon. The shave brush giveaway is to mark Latherwhip’s “No Mo’ Movember” campaign.\nCoupons Can Be Claimed Through This Website for this week only.\nLatherwhip founder AJ Hardy has previously stated how he has wanted to use the small, but much-loved brand to raise greater awareness for a something important. Hardy believes Movember is a critically important movement, yet before now felt the brand wasn’t best able to join in with the spirit of ‘No Shave November’ or ‘Movember’ since the primary purpose of current Latherwhip products is essentially to ‘remove’ hair.\nThe “No Mo’ Movember” campaign is therefore set up to ‘follow up’ the official Movember campaign as gentlemen quite often prefer to return to their cleaner shaven or ‘stache-less’ style.\nThis of course presents the perfect opportunity to shave in the classic style, with a brush, some good soap, in a mug, with a good razor. Hardy mentioned that even if a gentleman only treats himself to a classic shave once every couple of weeks or so – it’s still an important time to indulge in a classic masculine pursuit.\nThe Movember movement itself is, of course, in place to raise awareness of men’s health issues, including prostate cancer, testicular cancer and male suicide. The aim is to increase early cancer detection, diagnosis and effective treatments – in order the reduce the number of preventable deaths.\nThe shaving brush itself is a well loved and top rated item by customers and sells exclusively through Amazon.com at an MSRP of $59.99 currently at 50% off for the holidays.\nThe “No Mo’ Movember” Coupon allows folks to pick up their own brush (or as a gift) for $3.60.\nOnce Again For This Week Only The $3.60 “No Mo’ Movember” Coupons Can Be Claimed Here\n http://latherwhip.com\nContact Info:\nName: AJ Hardy\nOrganization: Latherwhip\nAddress: Suite # 9450 SW Gemini Drive, Beaverton, OR, 97008-7105, USA\nPhone: (013) 018-258031\nRelease ID: 148383\n ",

      "text": "Amazon video going global with rival to Top Gear \nWednesday, November 23, 2016 Tweet \nSAN FRANCISCO, United States (AFP) — Amazon is set to challenge Netflix worldwide with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service, featuring its remake of the BBC’s global hit Top Gear. \nAmazon Prime Video is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Prime would likely expand to some 200 countries and territories in a direct challenge to Netflix , which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service. \nAmazon’s take on Top Gear , called The Grand Tour , made its Prime debut Thursday in the existing markets, including Britain and the United States — to rapturous reviews from the UK press. \nAmazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos tweeted that the global roll-out of The Grand Tour would come in December. \nIts colourful main host, Jeremy Clarkson, was dropped from the madcap BBC show after he punched a producer in March. \nThe BBC came back with a rebooted version featuring new presenters including British broadcaster Chris Evans, but he quit after only one series following downbeat reviews of the programme, which has 350 million viewers per week in 170 countries. \nAmazon seized on the opportunity of hiring Clarkson and his two co-presenters to use the motoring show as a flagship product for its global ambitions. \n“It’s going to be available in 200 territories. That’s pretty much everywhere,” Clarkson tweeted. “Amazon has gone global.” \nHow the show will be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service. \n“We don’t have anything else to announce” beyond Bezos’s announcement, an Amazon spokeswoman told \nAFP . \nEYES ON NETFLIX \nNetflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over its own growth. \nThe company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter — most of them from outside the United States — and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers. \nOf that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company is gaining momentum as a global TV feed. \nFor the current quarter Netflix forecast a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US. \nThe service credited a robust line-up of original programming, including Stranger Things and Narcos , with helping to draw customers. \nThe earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street. \nThe on-demand television service credited with giving rise to “binge viewing” has won devotees with its own hit shows, including House of Cards and Orange is the New Black . \nOFFERING ORIGINALS \nNetflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some US$7.5 billion — more than competitors CBS , HBO , or Turner , according to IHS Markit. \nNetflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some US$6 billion. \nOriginal Amazon productions Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle won prestigious Emmy Awards in the US. \nPrime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store, which has moved dramatically beyond its early days as a bookseller. \nAmazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38 per cent from a year earlier.

      "text": "Amazon seems to have come a long way from being an intricate machine propelling CEO Jeff Bezos ‘ever-expanding’ ambitions, to making some key changes in the way the company functions. (Picture: Reuters) On August 15, last year, The New York Times had in an article called ‘Inside Amazon : Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace’ accused the company of pushing its employees too far to achieve unrelenting ambitions. The article portrayed Amazon as putting up standards which were ‘unreasonably’ high and using employees to use tools to ‘sabotage’ each other resembling ‘Hunger games’. The ‘purposeful Darwinism was so bad that even employees suffering from miscarriages and cancer were given undue feedback without been given time to recover. Amazon seems to have come a long way from being an intricate machine propelling CEO Jeff Bezos ‘ever-expanding’ ambitions, to making some key changes in the way the company functions. According to reports, Amazon has said that it is overhauling the review process that is done by the company annually. It says that the review is more simplistic as it works on the strengths rather than the weakness of its employees, and eventually building on the program.\nAmazon reportedly has been using an employee rating system which ranks them as low or high-level performers, which is a very draconian management technique, earlier used in the tech world. But while most of the companies in the Silicon Valley have done away with it, Amazon could not let go of the system. While critics might call the recent announcement as a PR activity and the same process might continue, but the way Jeff Bezos works, the plan just might have been well-thought by him before making the announcement.\nBut putting aside what the mechanism’s fortune turn out to be, this move does give out some business lessons for us all. The most important lessons being how Bezos showed amazing emotional intelligence by understanding the article and criticism and acting upon it. Some may consider it a change, too late, but Bezos made some quick responses when the story came out as well, even though he felt the article in NYT was unduly biased. He reportedly told his employees that he does not identify the picture of Amazon that was portrayed and hoped his employees did not as well. He also asked his employees to read the NYT story. Such an overwhelming need for further goals can lead a company to scale back its ambitions or softening its stance.\nBut we as outsiders cannot in any way know what it is like working for a company like Amazon unless the 3 lakh people who work for the company let the world know. However, this announcement and the first reaction by Jeff Bezos show the abilities that the founder has, that is, to learn from feedback and act on them rather than relying on emotions, no matter the viability of the implications. It is an attitude to imbibe.\nTo understand this more, one has to think from the perspective of a founder- especially the founder of the world’s biggest online retailer. Bezos has invested so much of his life in his company, and when you give it your all, it is not easy to understand the criticism, leave alone accepting it and acting upon it. The reason being, when you are so big, there has to be some truth in all feedback, and all you can to is either run when the dirt hits the fan or accept and learn from it. Emotional intelligence is one of the most important qualities to have in general and as a leader, as it opens up new avenues to benefit from. At the same time, this means that your criticism should also be sincere and substantial instead of just being hurtful, as nobody benefits in the larger scheme of things.\nBut if you do get hurtful feedback, rather than trying to correct the person you did it, you must use it as a chance to improve, at least that is what Jeff teaches us.",

As part of its ongoing Black Friday deals, Amazon has cut the price from £239 to £167.99, a 30% discount. (That's around half the original launch price for the watch, for what it's worth.)\nSee at Amazon UK \nYou'll have a hard time tracking down a better smartwatch at that price point. Here's Russell Holly on why the Huawei Watch is the best :\nHuawei's Watch is a unique successful attempt at making Android Wear watches look more like and actual watch and less like a gadget. It's packing a fully circular always-on display, microphone and speaker for handling calls, and a heart-rate sensor for connecting with your favorite fitness apps. The battery will last the average user multiple days, but promises to last through a whole day no matter who you are.\n",

      "text": "The Grand Tour is Amazon's most-watched show Autoblog 18 hrs ago Joel Stocksdale © Amazon Amazon's multi-million dollar investment in The Grand Tour seems to have paid off. The company reported that Clarkson, Hammond, and May's show had the best debut of any Amazon Original series, pulling in more viewers on day one than the previous top show, The Man in the High Castle . This only includes viewers from the US, UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan, the countries where the show is currently available. Two hundred more countries will get the The Grand Tour in December.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo The show also brought in loads of new Amazon subscribers. While the company didn't release a specific number, it did say that more people signed up for Amazon Prime on the day of the debut than all but one other day of the year. The only day that exceeded that of The Grand Tour 's debut was Prime Day, when Amazon offers loads of Prime exclusive discounts on products.\nAmazon also touted the positive critical reception of the show. Among the highlights were a 97-percent score on review aggregator, Rotten Tomatoes , and status as the highest rated show or movie on IMDb . We also found the show quite enjoyable, and you can check out our thoughts on the first episode here .\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "WILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) – Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear.\nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots.\nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union.\nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract.\nThe airline’s president, John Starkovich, said the strike is illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration.\nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike.\nA DHL spokeswoman said “deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today” because of the strike, and DHL is watching the situation. Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\nBetween them, DHL and Amazon accounted for 65 percent of Air Transport Service’s revenue in the third quarter.\nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company’s labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing.\nThe company’s shares fell 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $16.44 on Tuesday while the broader markets closed higher. Air Transport shares have gained 86 percent in the past 12 months.",
