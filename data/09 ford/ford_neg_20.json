      "text": "Cars 2017 Ford EcoSport all-wheel-drive version likely to be launched in India All US-spec EcoSport models will be manufactured in India and hence AWD may also be offered in the country. November 21, 2016 15:43 IST 2017 Ford EcoSport Ford \nAmerican carmaker Ford showcased new EcoSport compact SUV at the Los Angeles Auto Show on 14 November. Apart from the restyled face and devoid of rear mounted spare wheel for the US, the highlight is the top of the line SES series that will feature Intelligent 4WD, sport-tuned suspension and steering, copper accents for the interior and sports seats. Emerging reports indicate this model may debut in India as well. \nAs of now, Ford confirmed AWD equipped EcoSport only for US market. The US-spec EcoSport models will be manufactured in India at the Chennai plant. Hence, chances are high that SES series will also get launched in India, reports Rushlane. 2017 Ford EcoSport facelift unveiled \nIndia launch of the new EcoSport is expected in mid-2017. In the latest avatar, EcoSport gets one-piece hexagonal grille in place of the split grille in line with companies bigger SUVs — the Kuga and the Edge. The headlamps, fog lamps and the bumper have been reworked at the front while sides get newly designed alloy wheels. Even though rear door mounted spare wheel has been dropped for US market, Asia-bound versions are expected to continue without change. \nOn the inside, 2017 EcoSport gets a new dashboard and steering wheel. It boasts of more advanced SYNC3 infotainment technology. A new 8-inch screen working in tandem with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto commands, and B&O Play audio settings have been added. \nFor India, the current powertrains are expected to continue. EcoSport in India is sold with a 1.5-litre TDCi diesel engine, which is tuned to dish out 99bhp of power. The petrol mills are a 1.5-litre Ti-VCT and the 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine. If AWD option is offered, it will be most likely to be coupled with 1.5-litre Ti-VCT petrol unit. Also read ",

It seems odd that Ford would use such strange images for such a solid, sensible midsize car, but it was the 1960s. The brochure for the Fairlane used a similar look. Photo by Ford Motor Company",

      "text": "You are here: Home » Manufacturing » Ford » Ford steps up effort to hire people with autism November 21, 2016 @ 7:17 am Comments \nHave an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nDETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. plans next year to hire an additional 12 to 24 adults with autism, expanding a program with the Autism Alliance of Michigan that has more than 30 other local companies signed on. \nThe programs are growing quickly. For the companies, people with autism represent untapped talent, and the jobs mean an opportunity to earn a living for those on the spectrum who have typically been left behind. \nIn June, the automaker launched its pilot program by hiring four adults with autism who have college degrees to work in its product development department at its world headquarters. Those four were on temporary status, but have since been become regular employees at the automaker. Ford originally committed to hiring five employees, but two part-time positions were combined to create one full-time position to accommodate an exemplary candidate. \n\"When we started, we wanted to make sure we could do this and do it sustainably,\" said Kirstin Queen, manager of diversity and inclusion at Ford. \"The program was found to be very successful, and the supervisors have said these individuals brought a new energy that spread to other employees.\" \nThe challenge of employing an adult with autism, while all are different, usually lies in the realm of social interactions. Employees with autism can lack social skills and social imagination and are often brutally honest, which can come across as rudeness. \nThe program was developed with the Autism Alliance of Michigan, a nonprofit founded by Dave Meador, vice chairman and chief administrative officer at DTE Energy Co. Autism Alliance trained Ford staffers how to interact with their new colleagues with autism, including creating direct, concise job functions as well as understanding the employees' social limitations. \nFord's vehicle evaluation and verification test lab participated in the pilot program, and Ford will expand the new hires into information technology and digital innovation departments, Queen said. \nThe 60- to 90-day ramp-up process has begun, and the jobs are expected to be filled in January. \nThe new positions will require a bachelor's degree, as did the previous positions. \nFord receives a federal work opportunity tax credit of $2,400 per adult with autism it hires. That credit, however, does not completely offset the costs of the program, said Colleen Allen, president and CEO of the Autism Alliance. \nSince Ford began its program in June, dozens of other companies have sought similar programs through the Autism Alliance. The organization is working with 38 companies, either on creating programs or are already commencing pilot programs. \nAllen declined to name the other companies as they navigate through their initial pilot programs, but they include 10 banking and finance firms, seven manufacturing companies, three IT companies and others in different industries. \n\"The expressed interest has shot through the roof this year,\" Allen said. \"We're definitely ahead of the curve nationally.\" \nAllen said the only limitation is the organizations' ability to keep up with demand. Roughly 200 adults with autism are looking to get placed. \n\"We're not in a hurry; we're not going to just dump someone in an open position,\" Allen said. \"This is a thoughtful process, and we want to make sure we get it right\" to benefit the employee and encourage the company to participate further. \nAutism represents a hefty economic question as more and more of those diagnosed reach working age. It's imperative that employers adapt or miss out on a productive population with specialized skills, Allen said. \nAutism's costs are growing -- estimated at $268 billion annually in the U.S. on treatment and loss of productivity in 2015, rising to $461 billion, or 1 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, by 2025, according to a 2015 study by researchers at the University of California-Davis and the University of Denver. Diabetes and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder are the only diseases that cost more than autism, and neither generally prevents people who have them from working. \nIn the U.S., it's estimated that more than 3.5 million people and one in 68 children (one in 42 for boys) being born have autism spectrum disorder — a complex brain condition associated with poor communication skills — according to a 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. In Michigan, the state estimates there are 50,000 or more adults with autism, and growing. \nIt's called a spectrum because the symptoms can range from not understanding nonverbal communication, to lack of empathy, to obsessive-compulsive behavior, to never speaking. Less-severe cases are often called Asperger's syndrome, but many experts no longer use that term. \nMore than half of people diagnosed with autism have average to above-average intelligence, according to a 2014 study. \nCompanies are becoming more aware of the benefits of hiring adults with autism, thanks to early adopters like Walgreen Co. \nIn 2007, Walgreens opened a distribution center in Anderson, S.C., and piloted a program to employ workers with disabilities -- 33 percent of the nearly 300 workers at that time -- many of whom had autism. To accommodate workers with autism, managers are instructed to avoid metaphors and use direct instruction and outfit a break room with beanbag chairs and puzzles to calm workers with autism who may feel sensory overload from the loud, often frantic pace of a distribution center, Workforce magazine reported in 2012. \nThe Anderson center now employs more than 40 percent with disabilities, and Walgreen opened a similar facility in Connecticut in 2009. \nAllen said Southeast Michigan will be successful when autism hiring expands beyond seeking highly skilled adults with autism and looks to match those in every category with jobs they can do. \n\"There's a perception now that those on the spectrum are these really smart, highly functional people,\" Allen said. \"Not everyone has three degrees.\" You can reach Dustin Walsh at Tags:",

      "text": "Last week, president-elect Donald Trump took credit via Twitter for preventing a Ford plant from moving to Mexico . \nIt was unclear whether Trump understood that the plant, in Louisville, KY, makes only a small number of Lincoln MKC SUVs and that the bulk of its output is the Ford Escape (the vehicles share a platform). \nIn any case, Ford then said that it had considered moving MKC production to Mexico so that the Louisville plant could build more Escapes, a hot-selling compact crossover SUV that was originally designed in Europe. \nThe carmaker acknowledged the plan had changed and that MKC production would remain in Louisville. \nBut here's the thing: the move wasn't being contemplated until 2019 , when the current Ford contract with the United Auto Workers union expires. \nAnd even if Ford had gone forward with the MKC plan, there would have been no loss of jobs at the factory. \nThe UAW nonetheless was concerned. This is from Bloomberg's Keith Naughton : \nFord didn’t inform the union of its long-term plans for the MKC before [Trump's] tweets went out Thursday night, [a UAW source said]. That’s what UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles, who oversees Ford contract negotiations, and other union leaders were planning to discuss with the company today, he said. Settles and Ford manufacturing chief Bruce Hettle sent a letter to Louisville plant workers Friday promising to meet with them “in the coming days” to discuss the change in plans on the MKC. \nBut here the thing, even if Ford and the UAW weren't in communication about this potential change, it's possible that there still would be no UAW job losses in Louisville because the same workers could simply build the Escape instead of the MKC. Connecting the blurry dots \nFord Chairman Bill Ford had been trying to get Trump to lay off his criticism of the company's decision to move some small-car production to Mexico — again, with no UAW job losses in the US, as that production capacity would be needed to build new trucks and SUVS. (Ford wasn't succeeding, according to reports.) \nA plausible explanation is that Ford and Trump worked out a way for Trump to \"save\" jobs in Kentucky, by keeping modest MKC production (2,000 vehicles per month, versus 30,000 Escapes), abandoning a plan that wasn't even going to go into effect until late in Trump's first term. \nTrump then created a tempest in a teapot by inaccurately tweeting that the entire Louisville plant was a Lincoln factory and that it wasn't being relocated. I'm not declaring that this is what actually happened, just connecting the blurry dots. \nThere was no way Ford was going to move a plant that's been in operation since 1955, that has been running flat-out to satisfy Escape and MKC demand, and that Ford invested $600 million in to retool back in 2010-2011. \nThat, unfortunately, was the message that got out, due largely to Trump's lack of knowledge about how the auto industry operates. \nBear in mind that the change to Lincoln production wasn't even going to occur for three years. Effectively, Ford jettisoned something it was thinking about doing. But by 2019, the auto market could be different. It's running at record sales levels now in the US, and it's a safe bet that even in a downturn, compact SUV sales will hold up. But who knows? \nThis is the problem with taking credit for a future decision that's contingent on factors that have nothing to do with the present auto market.",

      "text": "Cars Coming Soon->Revealing Edition The 2011 Explorer will be revealed soon! \nWhen Ford revealed the all-new-for-the-U.S. 2011 Ford Fiesta , it was a full year before the car was available for order, accompanied by a major social media marketing campaign designed to build hype and get everyone familiar with it. \nIf you’re interested in how Ford will manage the reveal of the completely redesigned 2011 Explorer , you need to look no further than Facebook. Ford has chosen to make the reveal there instead of at one of the major auto shows, though it hasn’t said when. \nFord has managed to keep the new design pretty well under wraps, though we know four- and six-cylinder EcoBoost powertrains will be under-the-hood options. \nWe also know the new Explorer will use a unibody chassis based on the new Taurus platform. That will definitely limit its off-road abilities, but should result in a much more refined, car-like demeanor. \nIf you want to be among the first to see the new Explorer, just head to its Facebook page . \nIn other revealing news, Hyundai will debut its new Veloster coupe at the 2010 Paris Auto Show in October. \nWhile it’s not clear if the Veloster name will stick, it is clear that Hyundai won’t want to cannibalize its own sales by offering two similar models. It’ll differentiate itself from the Genesis Coupe with front-wheel-drive and by being smaller and lighter. But that seems to point at the demise of the Tiburon . Only time will tell! \nUnder the hood, the new coupe will feature a 1.6-liter engine generating 140+ horsepower. A turbocharged direct injection option will also be available, which should pack a more exciting 200 horses. \nSales will begin in Europe in early 2011, with the U.S. release happening a few months later. \nShould the Veloster replace the Tiburon? Will the new Explorer be a sales hit? \n-tgriffith",

      "title": "Westworld Episode 8 Recap",
      "text": "SHARE Westworld Episode 8 Recap \nAfter last week’s shocking reveal on HBO ‘s Westworld , Ford brings Bernard back online to discuss what happened. Bernard is in tears because he killed her and he really loved her. Ford finds his anguish remarkable and assures Bernard he only killed Theresa because he told him to. “They would have destroyed the art I created,” Ford reasons, pointing out that management would have also destroyed him. Pointedly, he mentions that Arnold felt the way Bernard does, and “He couldn’t stop me, either.” Ford has Bernard cover their tracks, destroy any evidence that the pair were involved in Theresa’s murder, and when he is done, Ford will free Bernard from his memories of what he had done, and his love for Theresa. “You will be at peace.” \nMaeve is in the saloon like normal, but is having a hard time accepting the blonde that is the new Clementine. She flashes back to her life with her daughter, then is in the lab with Felix and Sylvester. She can’t tell what is real anymore, and declares that she is getting out of Westworld. Sylvester dares her to leave, and Maeve knows about the exploding failsafe buried deep in her central code. She wants them to reprogram her and give her administrative privileges in order to get her own “army” to break out of the compound. “It’s time to write my own f***ing story.” \nDolores feels like she is close to being home. But first she sees a half dozen or so men on the beach, dead. Impaled by arrows belonging to the Ghost Nation. One of the men is still alive, barely, and begs for water. William hesitates to help, but Dolores insists. The soldier admits that Logan sent the soldiers to kill William and Dolores, but Dolores won’t let him die. She goes to get him more water and is confronted with the sight of herself face down in the water. It is just a vision, and after a moment everything returns to normal. By the time she returns to William, the soldier is dead. \nFord reveals to Charlotte and Stubbs that Theresa was found in the same place they found the Woodcutter. It appears that she simply slipped and fell to her death. There were no guests or hosts nearby, but they did find pieces of the satellite device nearby. Ford’s theory is that she had programmed the hosts to transmit the data, and when that failed, she went up to do it herself. Charlotte shows genuine remorse for Theresa’s death, which Ford tries to temper by explaining that yesterday’s demonstration was a hoax perpetrated by Theresa and the QA team. Ford plans to significantly restrict QA’s access to the code until they can get a more trustworthy team in place. Bernard will be reinstalled as the head of behavior. \nSylvester is concerned with how tightly wounded the higher-ups are. There was an accident in the park, and they need to wrap up this Maeve situation. After examining her code on a tablet, Maeve found what she needed and needs her techs to take her to the behavioral unit during the shift change. It is quite complicated, what she needs done, but then she can be someone else’s problem. Sylvester takes Felix outside and convinces him to wipe Maeve completely, brick her, and claim she came in that way. They roll her down the hall on a stretcher – nothing out of the ordinary here. Felix starts the process and warns her that, in order to do what Maeve requested, he has to shut her down. \nTeddy and the Man in Black are still riding together. They come across a number of dead people and find a blonde woman, who the Man in Black recognizes, still alive. He thought they retired her. Wyatt’s men did this. Teddy cuts her free and a huge man jumps out, in full samurai-style armor, complete with a mask with huge horns. He attacks and the men fight. The Man in Black finally takes him down with a rope to the neck. Teddy remembers this is similar to the way in which he attacked Dolores, and hits him. \nLee is trying to direct a cannibal host to be more realistic and frightening. Charlotte comes in, devastated by Theresa’s death. In hopes of making her feel better, Lee points out that Theresa was smuggling out data, but Charlotte defends her, saying that everything she did was at the command of her corporate overlords. Ford is almost done with his narrative, one that Lee isn’t needed for. She wants to give him a new job. They go into cold storage, where Charlotte chooses a deactivated host to upload 35 years of data into. Lee’s job is to give him some semblance of a backstory then get him on the train and out of the park. This happens to be the same host who was once Dolores’ father. \nFelix feels bad about Maeve, but then Maeve sits up on the stretcher. He didn’t brick her at all. Sylvester is terrified, especially when she explains they’ve been tinkering with her core code. She grabs a scalpel and slices open Sylvester’s throat, which upsets Felix – she said she wouldn’t hurt anyone. “You know how duplicitous I am,” Maeve defends. She gives him a cauterizer and tells Felix to fix Sylvester – he might need him. “Now it is time to recruit my army.” \nMaeve wakes and goes to the saloon, as she always does. While she waits for Hector’s gang, she tests some of her new skills by getting the bartender to pour her a free drink. A little girl outside reminds Maeve of her own little girl, and of the Man in Black coming in to kill them. Maeve tells the new Clementine to go distract some new guests and sends the bartender in the back as Hector’s squad rolls in – right on time. They start their mayhem, and Maeve strolls outside, telling the sheriff to be on his way. He leaves the thieves alone. The deputies practice their quick-draw on each other. Hector and his men steal the safe and Maeve smiles. It all went off without a hitch. \nBernard is worried that Charlotte will be an impediment to Ford’s new narrative, but Ford is more concerned with what Bernard feels: a machine that knows its own true nature. Bernard understands how he is coded, but doesn’t understand his feelings. Are they real? He doesn’t understand the difference between himself and Ford, between the different kinds of pain they each feel. Ford says this is the same question that drove Arnold mad. He maintains that there is nothing that makes us alive. Consciousness doesn’t exist. We all live in loops, seldom questioning our choices. Before he is wiped, Bernard has one more question: has Ford ever made him hurt anyone like this before? “Of course not,” Ford assures him, even as Bernard’s mind flickers to the briefest of memories: him killing Elsie. \nAfter more walking, Dolores comes to the vista she painted. She is home. In her mind she sees a bustling little town, and she is back in her chaste dress. This is one of the earliest iterations of Westworld, with a tech coaching stiff, barely life-like hosts to dance. Suddenly there are shots and screams. Dolores sees herself with a gun, then putting the gun to her own temple. William grabs the gun from her and Dolores, back in the here and now, is panicked. She thinks she is going crazy. She can’t tell what is real and what is a memory from a life long ago. “This is what Arnold wants, he wants me to remember.” He used to meet her there. William wants to get her out of here, get her back to Sweetwater. It’s like she is breaking down the further outside of town she gets. Some soldiers approach, and William is hopeful it is a Union scouting party that can take them back to town. No such luck. It is Logan and some Confederados. “You two are f***ed!” he cries gleefully. \nStubbs is glad to see Bernard has been reinstated – he thought the decision to remove him was short sighted. He offers his sympathies for Theresa, which Bernard brushes off. Stubbs tries to gently bring up that he knew about Bernard and Theresa’s relationship, but Bernard has no idea what he is talking about: “I barely knew her.” Stubbs tries to brush off the weirdness and asks about Elsie. Bernard is sure she is just enjoying her time off. Stubbs knows something is wrong. \nTeddy has the Man in Black tied up. He has no idea who he is and starts punching the Man in Black to get answers out of him. Teddy remembers he took Dolores and hurt her. The Man in Black laughs and calls Teddy an idiot, a glorified pimp. Teddy threatens to kill him but the Man in Black isn’t worried. In fact, he is ready to share his story with him. “I am a god, a titan of industry,” he says. “Philanthropist, family man.” He insists he is a good guy. Last year, in a tragic accident, his wife took the wrong pills and died. Thirty years of marriage vanished. He tried to console his daughter at the funeral, but his daughter believed her mother killed herself because of him, that she lived in terror because of the anger and hatred she saw in him. He insists they never saw him like he is in Westworld, and returned to prove her wrong. He came back here and made his own story. He wanted to see if he had it in him to do something horrible, to be something horrible. The Man in Black picked a homesteader, Maeve, and stabbed her before killing her daughter right in front of her. He did it just to see what he thought. But Maeve refused to die, and slit his throat. The Man in Black felt nothing. He saw Maeve rush her daughter outside, the two collapsing onto the ground, and in that moment she was alive, truly alive. It was then that the maze revealed itself to the Man in Black, telling him there was a deeper game, “Arnold’s game.” A game that cuts deep. \nAs the Man in Black is telling his story, Maeve is a hundred miles away, in Sweetwater, reliving the tale, slitting the new Clementine’s throat instead of the Man in Black’s. The townspeople are all around Maeve, staring in disbelief as the woman falls apart. She whispers to Hector to start shooting, and it scares the townsfolk away. In the lab, techs are nervous because Maeve isn’t responding to commands. A team is authorized to extract her. \nIt is Ford and Bernard who study Maeve back in the lab after the Man in Black tried to kill her. Her cognition is fragmented, and Ford takes the memories from her so she need not suffer. She begs Ford to be allowed to keep the pain; that is all she has left of her little girl. Ford puts her in sleep mode, but it doesn’t take and Maeve stabs herself in the throat. \nThe maze is all that matters to the Man in Black, and besting Wyatt is all that stands in the way. The blonde wants to kill the Man in Black; he is much worse than Wyatt’s men. Teddy puts his gun to the Man in Black’s head, but he can’t pull the trigger. The girl will help, and stabs Teddy in the chest with an arrow. “You’ve been gone a long while,” she says. “It’s time you came back into the fold.” From out of the woods comes a shadowy army of men in similar armor to the horned one they encountered earlier. \nYou can watch a preview for “The Well-Tempered Clavier,” the first season’s penultimate episode, by clicking here .",

      "title": "Trump's half-truth about Ford, GM's CEO talks policy and more",
      "text": "Monday,  02 PM \nIt's been a hectic couple of weeks in the world of automotive news. \nBetween a new president bringing a potential paradigm shift to manufacturing policy and an auto show, business has been a boomin' here at Daily Drive-Thru world headquarters. \nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. ‘LIKE’ US HERE. \nIn today's edition we've got more of the same: car companies trying to figure out where they stand in a Trump nation, new cars and new car technology. \nWith the Thanksgiving holiday coming this week, expect all this lovely news fodder to fall off a cliff, so enjoy it while you can. Ford keeps MKC in Kentucky, Trump takes credit Ford will continue making the Lincoln MKC in Louisville, Kentucky. (Lincoln) \nFord Motor Company said last week that it would abandon its plan to shift production of its Lincoln MKC crossover from its Louisville Assembly Plant to Mexico. Normally this kind of announcement would come and go without much fanfare, but then Donald Trump got involved. \nPresident-elect Trump took to his social media platform of choice, Twitter, to take credit for preventing a “Lincoln plant” from moving from Kentucky to Mexico. This is inaccurate on multiple fronts: neither the plant nor the jobs it fosters were headed south of the border. Ford’s plan was to move production of the less-popular MKC in order to ratchet up sales of its hot-selling Escape SUV. Our Jim Resnick explains why abandoning this plan could be problematic . \nFor better or worse, Trump is correct that he is most likely to credit/blame for this strategy shift, as Ford was a frequent recipient of his campaign vitriol for its plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nSource: Reuters GM CEO talks long-term strategy in Q&A Mary Barra, chief executive officer of General Motors, said her company is ready to work with the Trump Administration. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \nElsewhere in Metro Detroit, General Motors is ready to work with the president-elect, at least that’s what Chief Executive Mary Barra said during a Q&A session with Automotive News. Barra didn’t have much to say about Trump other than the standard response that GM has a long history of working with governments around the world. \nWhen asked about how her company might embrace a world free of the Obama-era fuel consumption regulations, Barra said GM would continue working to address environmental issues, but it would also enjoy being relieved of the monetary burden that comes with ever-tightening gas mileage standards. \nRead the full Q&A here . NuTonomy takes streets of Boston Self-driving cab company nuTonomy will expand its research operation to Boston by the end of the year. (Kyodo News via Getty Images) \nCreated by MIT grads and based in Boston, the autonomous ride-sharing service nuTonomy will soon take to the streets of its home city. You might remember nuTonomy for just barely beating Uber to the punch when it launched a self-driving car service in Singapore earlier this year. After scoring that win and raking in $16 million in new cash , the company is bringing its vehicles stateside. \nNuTonomy plans on testing its vehicles in the Raymond L. Flynn Marine Park in Boston’s Seaport area before the end of the year. The company doesn’t have plans to make its service available to the Boston public just yet, but it’s likely only a matter of time before that bridge is crossed. BMW drops autonomous research partnership BMW dropped its autonomous partnership with Chinese search engine giant Baidu last week. (SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) \nIn other self-driving car news, BMW and Baidu (think Google in China) dropped their autonomous vehicle research partnership last week. The divorce was spurred by irreconcilable differences about how to proceed with their shared research. \nBMW and Baidu were testing autonomous prototype software in both the U.S. and China. BMW said it plans on keeping its research and development team in China focused on autonomy and Baidu has already started testing its software in Ford vehicles. \nSource: Reuters Subaru rolls the dice on second large SUV Subaru is looking to the future of car design with its VIZIV-7 SUV concept that debuted at LA Auto Show. (Subaru ) \nSubaru is gearing up for another run at the family SUV segment, which will answer two important questions: is Subaru more than a niche brand? And, what did it learn from the Tribeca? \nLast week the Japanese automaker rolled out the VIZIV-7 concept, a seven-seat SUV that serves as a rough draft for a U.S.-made production model it plans on rolling out in 2018. On the surface, this is a brilliant move for Subaru. Big SUVs are the new minivans for many family-minded buyers and their sales growth shows no sign of slowing down. However, this is not Subaru’s first rodeo in this arena: from 2005 to 2014 it sold the Tribeca, a nameplate you might not have heard of because it averaged a measly 9,000 sales per year before Subaru mercifully killed it. \nWhile Subaru’s bread and butter, sporty wagons such as the Outback and Forester, are selling like hotcakes, sedans such as the Legacy and Impreza have been less popular. When this SUV does arrive, it should tell us a lot about the brand. \nSource: Bloomberg \nCheck the Daily Drive-Thru every weekday morning to get the latest on the most important news and trends in the automotive world. \nYou can find Friday’s installment of the Drive-Thru here and view the rest of our archives here . \nGot a news tip or a comment?

      "title": "Testing 4-2-8…How Much Horsepower Does the Ford 428 Cobra Jet Really Make?",
      "text": "Email \nFord really got it right with the 1968 428 Cobra Jet (CJ). Technically a midyear offering, the 1968 1/2 CJ combined 427 Low Riser heads, a cast iron copy of the aluminum 390 Police Interceptor intake manifold, the 390 GT’s hot hydraulic cam, a healthy 735-cfm Holley four barrel, and streamlined exhaust manifolds to fight off the 396s, 440s and 400s from the competition. Best of all, unlike the fire breathing 427 FE (which was mostly installed in fullsize 1963-1967 models), the 428 CJ was commonly available in all the popular midsize Ford-Mercury muscle models. More than 18,000 were installed in 1968-1970 Mustangs alone. \nBut there was one thing about the 428 CJ that left everyone puzzled. The factory power rating seemed to be a typo. Without a wink or a nod, Ford claimed the new CJ made 335 hp at 5,600 rpm and 445 lb-ft of torque at 3,400 rpm. While the torque claim was in line with expectations, many wondered why the big 428 CJ was only 10 ponies ahead of the 325hp 390 GT four-barrel mill. Beyond that, the so-called Thunderbird 428 offered in fullsize Fords and T-birds made 345 hp, 10 more than the CJ despite its milder cam, low-rise iron intake, 446-cfm Ford 4300 series four-barrel carburetor, and clunky log-style exhaust manifolds. \nThe facts became clear once 428 CJ Mustangs and Fairlanes started running high 13s at the strip with zero preparation. The 335hp rating was nothing more than a ploy to distract the NHRA from the CJ’s true ability, in hopes of getting more advantageous classifications in Stock and Super Stock competition. Because the NHRA used advertised factory horsepower and shipping weight claims to group vehicles into competition classes and categories, it paid to fib a little bit; 428 CJ-powered Mustangs and Fairlanes quickly became feared street and strip machines. \nAs with most deceptions, the ruse was quickly unmasked as the NHRA factored the 428 CJ into higher classes so it couldn’t bully weaker machinery. Oddly, however, Ford never revised the sandbagged horsepower claims. Right to the end in 1970, the 335hp rating stuck. So the question remains, how much horsepower does a stock 428 CJ really deliver? \nTo find out, we visited Donnie Wood and his team at R.A.D. Auto Machine where a Q-code (non Shaker) 1969 Mach 1 428 CJ was being rebuilt to stock specifications. We could tease you and save the punchline for the end of the story, but we will save you the disjointed experience of leafing ahead by reporting that it delivered 365.1 hp at 4,800 rpm and 452.4 lb-ft at 3,700 rpm on the R.A.D. Land & Sea dynamometer. Given the CJ’s reputation for being underrated by Ford, the 30.1 extra ponies weren’t a big surprise. Let’s dig in and see what makes the 428 Cobra Jet tick. 1 R.A.D. bored the cylinders 0.030 over on a Rottler F79A three-axis CNC milling station to clear up minor wear. The main bearing saddles and caps were align honed. 2 The fingers point out oil galley cap plugs, which must not be overlooked during block cleaning and assembly. Another plug is present near the distributor mounting boss. 3 While Ford offered forged-steel cranks in the 427 family, the cost-conscious 428 uses a cast-iron unit with a 3.98-inch stroke. R.A.D. removed 0.020 inch from the main and rod journals to restore fresh surfaces. Main bearings are Sealed Power (PN 4261 M20), as are the rod bearings (PN 8-3230CP-20). 4 Designed long before the advent of one-use, torque-to-yield fasteners, the 428’s main cap bolts are tightened to 100 lb-ft in two steps. The standard two-bolt main caps are totally adequate for all but the most extreme naturally aspirated applications. 5 The 428 shares its 6.488-inch-long forged-steel connecting rods with the 390 except for one important difference: 11/16 fasteners versus 3/8. The larger-diameter bolts/nuts (in the center of the photo) weigh 16 grams more per rod and can cause high-rpm vibration if carelessly mismatched. R.A.D. replaced the Ford hex nuts with 12-point ARP units tightened to 52 lb-ft. 6 The stock-spec 428 cast pistons were replaced by Sealed Power forgings (PN L2303NF-030) with floating pins. At 840.5 grams, each piston is 19.4 grams lighter than the stock castings removed from the engine. Compression remains at 10.5:1. Rings are Hastings moly-faced units (PN 2M-595-030), gapped at 0.019 inch. The 427 was the only FE engine factory equipped with forged pistons. 7 With its abbreviated intake port architecture, each FE head weighs a mere 39 pounds (bare). The 428 CJ’s C80E heads have as-cast (nonmachined) 73cc combustion chambers and 2.09/1.65 valve head diameters. The seats were in good condition so R.A.D. recut them instead of resorting to insert replacement surgery. 8 Stock-diameter 2.09/1.65-inch valve sizes remain, but R.A.D. upgraded to 427-style swirl-polished stainless units from Engine Pro (PN 01-2300-8). The pen points out the abrupt stem-to-head transition of the stock valve. The streamlined valves add modest gains to flow. 9 The stock valve-guide bosses accept most double valve springs without diameter reduction machining. R.A.D. revived the guides with bronze wall inserts. The exhaust seals are rubber umbrella-type (in fingers), while the intake seals are smaller PC style units with spring-loaded lips. They better prevent suction from drawing oil into the intake ports. 10 To match the stock-spec camshaft, stock replacement single-valve springs (with flat-dampers) deliver 85 pounds on the seat and 300 pounds at 0.500-inch lift. Outside diameter is 1.812 inches, and stock stamped steel retainers and locks are employed. 11 Aiming to replicate a stock 428 CJ driving experience in the restored Mach 1 host vehicle, hotter camshaft profiles were shunned in favor of this Howard Cams CJ clone (PN 257611-10). Specs are 0.481/0.490-inch lift, 256/256 degrees duration (advertised), 200/200 degrees of lift (at 0.050 lift). Like all (non 1966 Police Interceptor) 428 cams, it uses hydraulic lifters. 12 Thicker Fel-Pro head gaskets (PN 8554PT) have a crushed thickness of 0.042 inch. They trim the 10.5:1 compression ratio by approximately a quarter point for added safety with modern 93-octane unleaded pump gas. 13 The pen points to the integral air injection passage found in all CJ heads. Part of Ford’s Thermactor emissions control system, the threaded holes accept air injection piping to increase post-combustion exhaust gas temperature to burn off residual hydrocarbons before they exit the tailpipes. 14 With its nonadjustable rocker arms, simple 9.59-inch long, 5/16-inch-diameter pushrods with ball-ends actuate the valves. FE builders must remember to install the pushrods after the intake manifold goes on because several of them pass through the manifold. Naturally this tip excludes the 427 SOHC, which eschews pushrods and lifters. 15 The pen points to the rocker arm shaft’s oil squirt holes. They must be targeted inboard toward the engine centerline during assembly of the rocker arms. Failure will result in oil-starved rocker arms and scuffed valve guides. 16 With the pressed steel oil deflector plates in position, the completed rocker arm units bolt to the heads. Note the cast aluminum rocker shaft stands that the 428 shared with lesser 390, 352, and 332 engines. The high-performance 406 and 427 engines came with stronger cast iron stands, which should be used with extreme valve spring pressures and radical cams. 17 Like all FE engines, the 428 has an unusually long crankshaft snout. Its only drawback is a tendency to fracture when loaded with a crank-driven supercharger. Notably absent here is the “hatchet head” crankshaft weight seen on 1969-1970 428 Super Cobra Jet (SCJ) engines. Their heavier 427 LeMans-type cap-screw rods require the added mass (plus a specific flywheel/flexplate) to achieve balance. SCJ engines were installed in 1969-1970 when the Drag Pack, with its 3.91 or 4.30 axle ratio, was chosen. 18 The benefit of the FE engine’s abbreviated cylinder heads is obviated by its husky intake manifold. R.A.D. Auto Machine’s Steve Chmura poses a 23-pound 427 aluminum intake manifold next to the CJ’s 85-pound cast iron unit. In a nonresto build, swapping the stock iron heads and intake for aluminum replacements chops a quick 100 pounds off the nose of any FE-powered car. 19 Each of the 18,049 428 CJ Mustangs built in 1968-1970 (Mustangs only, this figure excludes thousands of additional Mercury and Ford Shelby, Fairlane, and Torino applications) inhaled through a 735-cfm Holley four-barrel. The 446-cfm Ford-Motorcraft four-barrel used on non-CJ 428s pales by comparison. Stock jetting specs were maintained for the dyno test with satisfactory air/fuel ratios. 20 Built half a decade before Mustang’s 1975 switch to electronic ignition, all 428 CJ’s came with a single-point distributor. Fully capable of handling the 6,000-rpm ceiling, total timing is set at 35 degrees BTDC, all in by 2,000 rpm. Spark plug wires are date-coded reproductions from Marti Autoworks (PN SPW-11D 4Q67). 21 Oddly mismatched to avoid the Mustang/Fairlane spring towers, the CJ exhaust manifolds are still an improvement over the small-outlet logs supplied on 390-powered Mustangs. Weights are 16.4 pounds (driver-side, bottom) and 19.0 pounds (passenger-side, top). RPM",

      "text": "GM Pledges to Fix Safety ‘Failures,’ But Questions Remain \nFord workers are being paid to plant incorrect and faulty parts onto the assembly line, including incomplete steering wheels and defective engine components. \nBut the cars aren’t lemons in the making: It’s part of a system to make sure all vehicles built at the automaker’s mega-plant in Valencia, Spain, meet rigorous quality standards. \nIt sees employee Xabier Garciandia spend his working day trying to put a spanner into the works by making sure the wrong parts and flawed components secretly are placed on the assembly line. \nFord ’s industry-first Vision System photographs, checks and tracks every part of each of the 400,000 cars and vans assembled and 330,000 engines built at the Valencia plant each year. \nGarciandia, a technical specialist at Ford of Europe’s Valencia Engine Vision System, says the so-called gremlin tests ensure the industry-first digital-photo-monitoring system is working correctly. \nFaulty engine parts, wrong steering wheels and even mismatched dashboards have been sent down the line, with the gremlin test covering all 34 stages of assembly. \n“The Vision System is crucial to ensuring every single part of each vehicle is just right,” Garciandia says in a statement released by Ford. “The gremlin test means we can ensure the system is working perfectly. It is a game with a very serious point; we are making them harder to spot all the time.” \nThe Vision System captures more than 1 billion photos every 14 days. This also helps generate a composite image consisting of 3,150 digital photographs that alerts plant engineers to any discrepancies. \n“The way in which we all use digital cameras has totally changed the way we record our daily way of life, and is now transforming the way we build engines and cars,” Garciandia says. “But we also have to test the tests, and we are doing this in a way that is very simple, but which we believe is unique in the auto industry.” \nFord has a range of rigorous and, in some instances unusual, quality processes at the plant where a new vehicle rolls off the production line every 40 seconds. \nThese include ultra-sensitive microphones used to register engine connectors; engine listeners to ensure each new Ford Focus RS is running flawlessly; ostrich feathers that are used to dust models before painting to enhance paint quality; an industry-first digital-camera system that identifies vehicle body-shell paint defects; tests that assess customer use of audio streamed via Bluetooth; and a virtual rolling road test to evaluate advanced driver technologies. \nFord models built at the Valencia plant include the Kuga, Mondeo, Galaxy, S-Max and Transit Connect and Tourneo Connect. The facility also builds 2.0L and 2.3L EcoBoost engines.",

      "text": "By Patrick Rall G+ 2016-11-21 14:08 2018 Ford Mustang Could Lose V6, Gain 10-Speed and MagneRide According to information gathered from Ford’s dealership system and posted on the enthusiast website Mustang6g.com, the 2018 Ford Mustang could lose the V6 engine option while adding the 10-speed automatic transmission and the MagneRide suspension setup from the current Shelby GT350 – while still offering the GT350 and GT350R for those who want a stronger-handling pony car. \nFord Motor Company hasn’t had anything to say about the 2018 model year, but a member of Mustang6g.com who has access to the Ford Motor Company dealership computer system has done some digging with very interesting results. This member found that there are some new colors coming, but more importantly, the 10-speed automatic is listed as is the MagneRide suspension setup and those options are both seemingly available for both the EcoBoost and GT Mustangs. \nNo More V6? First off, the person who did the investigating for Mustang6g.com found that the body codes for the current V6-powered Ford Mustang come up as invalid for the 2018 model year. This leads the member to believe that the V6 engine option will no longer be available for 2018, and I am inclined to agree. The EcoBoost 4-cylinder is more powerful, more efficient and all around a better engine, so it will serve as a great base engine in the 2018 Ford Mustang. \nThis could technically increase the Ford Mustang base MSRP, since the V6 is the standard engine in the least expensive current Mustang, but the price difference between the V6 and the EcoBoost is negligible when you consider how much better the EcoBoost engine is than the V6. \n10-Speed Automatic Transmission Next, the dealership employee found that the 2018 Ford Mustang will seemingly be offered with the 10-speed automatic in both EcoBoost and GT trim – so both the turbocharged 2.3L 4-cylinder and the 5.0L V8 could benefit from this new gearbox. \nThis is a similar transmission to the one used in the 2017 Ford Raptor F150 and the 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, having been developed jointly by Ford Motor Company and General Motors. Replacing the current 6-speed automatic with this new 10-speed unit should make the 2018 Mustang more efficient while also improving low end and mid-range acceleration. \nIn the Camaro ZL1, the 10-speed is promised to shift quicker than the Porsche PDK dual-clutch transmission, so this gearbox in the Ford pony car should go a long way in making the 2018 Mustang an all-around better performance car. \nMagneRide Suspension One of the features of the new Shelby GT350 and GT350R which makes these pony cars so incredible on a road course is the MagneRide dampers, which will seemingly be offered on the 2018 Ford Mustang EcoBoost and GT. Considering the cost, I don’t expect that the MagneRide dampers will be standard across all of the non-Shelby Mustangs, but I would expect that these suspension goodies will be included in some sort of Performance Package – if not as a standalone option.",

      "text": "November 21, 2016 11:00 AM Mexican restaurant opens in old Ford’s Real Hamburgers spot near Land Park City Beat \nNews, insight and discussion on Sacramento and its neighborhoods Dali’s Kitchen opened over the weekend in the spot once occupied by Ford’s Real Burgers on Sutterville Road in Land Park. Ryan Lillis rlillis@sacbee.com i \nBy Ryan Lillis \nDali’s Kitchen, a family-run Mexican restaurant, opened Saturday in the building once occupied by Ford’s Real Burgers across from Land Park. \nThe restaurant is the work of Dali Magallon and her family. Magallon, a native of Bellavista, Mexico, is known in south Sacramento for selling food from her home near Florin Road. \nSo far, Magallon and her family are rolling out a small menu as they build their business. The menu has some staples, like burritos, carne asada and enchiladas, and is expected to expand with Magallon’s specialties from her native Mexico. The restaurant does not sell alcohol yet. \nThe restaurant’s building at 1948 Sutterville Road was the site of Ford’s Real Hamburgers for 25 years until that restaurant closed in 2012. It is behind Shabu Pub, a “hot pot” restaurant that opened a few weeks ago in the building that once housed a Blockbuster video store.",

      "text": "The Jeep B-SUV will target emerging markets like India and will be smaller than the Renegade. \nEarlier this year, at the launch of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wrangler Unlimited , FCA India had confirmed that the first locally made Jeep (the C-SUV a.k.a. 556) will roll out from Ranjangaon facility in 2017. This will be in the form of Jeep Compass, which made global debut last month. \nInterestingly, Jeep India is also working on an even smaller B-segment derivative to be primarily made in India. Codenamed Jeep 526, the B-SUV is likely to be a sub-4 m crossover which will have mass market products like Maruti Vitara Brezza, and Ford EcoSport in its sights. The C- and B-SUVs are likely to be based on the Renegade but one will be larger and the other will be smaller. \nThe company is hoping to leverage the Make-in-India campaign as far as the C- and B-SUVs are concerned. According to Economic Times’ sources, the Jeep 526 would be a mini Renegade and will be targeting select markets like India. It will also be exported to several RHD markets. \nThe Jeep B-SUV is reportedly being benchmarked against a product from a higher segment. Market positioning will be a notch higher than the mainstream sub-4 crossovers but Jeep will pack its product with best-in-class features to justify the premium tag. The Jeep 526 B-SUV will lock horns with the likes of Maruti Vitara Brezza. \nET also reports that the company is planning annual volumes of 40,000 – 50,000 units from the B-SUV including exports. The vehicle is expected to have a starting price of INR 10 lakhs. \nMeanwhile, Jeep India will inaugurate 10 outlets in 9 cities across India by the end of this year. \nJeep Renegade 75th Anniversary Edition – Photos",

Smith University, both of which are receiving funds to implement their community-focused projects\n- Now in its fourth year, the challenge has donated $400,000 in scholarships, grants and implementation funds\nDEARBORN, Mich. , Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Four architectural students from Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Texas , won top honors at the 2016 Ford Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge with a software app that enables homeowners to monitor water and energy use in real-time. The innovative app, which helps homeowners adjust their utility use and save money, earned the students $75,000 in scholarships, grants and implementation funds.\nSecond place and $15,000 was awarded to a team from Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia . Hampton students developed a program that tracks sea levels for communities at risk of flooding. Students from Johnson C.

Each team member also received an iPad.\n\"We received numerous outstanding entries from Historically Black Colleges and Universities across the country,\" said Pamela Alexander , director of community development, Ford Motor Company Fund. \"Although selecting the three winners was extremely difficult, we're proud the challenge encouraged all of the students to think about how they can support their communities.\"\nNow in its fourth year, the Ford Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge is modeled after the Ford College Community Challenge, a signature Ford Fund program that challenges students globally to design innovative projects that address critical sustainability needs in their communities. To date, the program has awarded $400,000 in scholarships, grants and implementation funds.\nRaj Register, Ford manager for multicultural communications, said teaming up with Historically Black Colleges and Universities on a program with positive, far-reaching community impact is a natural move for an innovation leader like Ford.\n\"Ford is proud to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities with this unique program showcasing such talented and pioneering students,\" she said.\nFord's Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge is jointly supported by Ford marketing and Ford Fund, the company's philanthropic arm, with participation from national radio personality and longtime booster Tom Joyner .

For now, Joe and I think it will be bullish. \nHowever, like everyone else, we are doing our best to stay on top of all the after-shocks that have resulted from the initial shock of Trump’s big win. \nConsider the following: (1) Will Ford stay home? Trump was widely viewed as a bully during the election campaign. Nevertheless, he won. Now the bully-in-chief will soon have the world’s most prominent bully pulpit. He might already be starting to achieve some of his policy goals as the world responds to the fact that he will soon have lots of power to change it as he sees fit. For starters, Ford seems to be responding to Trump’s criticism of the company during the campaign for moving factories out of the US to Mexico. Trump berated Ford for planning to move all its North American small-car production to Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the US. He threatened to slap Ford’s Mexican-built cars with a 35% tariff. He also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the US, and Canada without tariffs. Bloomberg reported : “Ford, which has expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he was elected, has been in ‘constant contact’ with his transition team, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told analysts Thursday.” At the end of last week, we learned that Ford announced that it would not move its Lincoln MKC plant from Louisville, Kentucky to Mexico. Even though the company had never previously indicated that it was even seriously considering the move, Trump issued a victory tweet on Thursday: “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky--no Mexico.” (2) Will Apple come home? While speaking at Liberty University in January, candidate Trump said, “We’re going to get Apple Computer to build their d@mn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.” On Friday, the Nikkei Asian Review reported , “Key Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S.” It is conceivable that if Trump can score enough tweet points by bringing jobs back home using the power of his bully pulpit, he won’t pursue a much more damaging legislative agenda to restrict trade. (3) Will China promote free trade? On Saturday, Chinese state media blasted Trump for “trade-bashing” rhetoric that threatens global economic stability. “The billionaire-turned-politician needs to prove that derailing the global economy has not been one of the reasons why he ran for U.S. president,” the government’s official news agency, Xinhua, said in a commentary piece. At this weekend’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Peru, Chinese President Xi Jinping strongly defended free trade. He said the best response to rising protectionism would be for APEC’s 21 members to negotiate a free trade area encompassing the entire Pacific Rim. “Closed and inclusive arrangements are not the right choice,” Xi said, taking a veiled stab at the TPP. “Building a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific is a strategic initiative critical for long-term prosperity.” (4) Is Iran dumping heavy water? Saturday’s WSJ reported : “Iran will ship around 11 metric tons of heavy water out of the country in the next couple of days, according to people familiar with the plans, defusing a conflict with the U.S. and others over the Iranian nuclear deal.” Heavy water is used to cool uranium in a process that can be used to form plutonium, which can be used in a nuclear weapon. Iran’s nuclear deal set a limit on how much heavy water Iran could store. The article noted: “People involved in overseeing the Iranian nuclear deal say that at the very least, they believe Mr. Trump is likely to crack down on any breach of the terms of the nuclear deal by Iran.” (5) Will Europeans have to defend themselves? In addition to wanting to make America great gain, Trump has said that he would like Europeans to defend themselves. Apparently, they got the message. In December, the European Council is expected to vote on the creation of a European Defense Community with its own headquarters. “Europe needs to be able to act for its own security,” French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters. He said, “This will allow Europe to take a step towards its strategic autonomy.” Le Drian, along with Germany and EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini, has led the EU efforts for greater independence from Washington. \nDr. Ed Yardeni is the President of Yardeni Research, Inc., a provider of independent global investment strategy research.

      "text": "Evan J. Smith Freelancer November 21, 2016 \nOn a blustery weekend in October, hundreds of furious Fords converged on Maryland International Raceway for the Ford Fever Classic that featured tire-burning heads-up, Index and bracket drags, plus a car show, swap meet and manufacturers display that packed the facility with miles of Blue Oval goodness. \nFord fans were treated non-stop action with wheel-standing Mustangs and Fords in a variety of classes including Limited Drag Radial, X275, Ultra Street, the all-new Nitrous No Time Small-Block Shootout. The event also offered Open Comp-style racing in Super Stang and the dial-in crowd could select from Mod ET, Street ET or gear-banging Stick ET for those who like to jam gears. Truckers competed in the Lightning Shootout and classic drag fans loved the 422 Motorsports Nostalgia Super Stocker, which threw us back in time with massive FE power. As a special treat, fans got to watch some awesome Match race cars, plus Danny O’Day’s Wheelstander. The Ford Fever Classic at Maryland International Raceway brought high-flying ponies out of the barn. This was Russell Vargo, who went low 10s with his 331 that’s backed by a G-Force Racing T5. \nRacing kicked off Saturday with a howling, which forced the track officials to limit the majority of racing to the eighth-mile. This didn’t affect some of the heads-up classes, such as X275, Ultra Street and Limited Street, because they normally race to the 660-foot mark. Thankfully, the wind mellowed for Sunday, and racers legged their machines out on the full quarter-mile. \nThe Ford Fever Classic brought out colorful and very fast Fords and Mercs, and we hustled around MIR’s facility to capture the endless action. It’s always exciting to see the classics, the late-models and the unique rides as we traverse the country at various Ford events. Best of Show went to Vicki Rahmer and her spectacular 1967 Pro Street GTA Fairlane. Rahmer has owned the Ford 33 years, and the ground-up restoration was finished in 2015. \nAnd the Maryland crowd didn’t disappoint. We’ve never see so many Mavricks in one place, and there was a plethora of “Big” Fords competing in the show and on the strip. While MM&FF predominately covers 1979-present Mustangs and Fords, we haven’t forgot about the 385-series and FE Big-Blocks out there. The MIR staff worked hard to ensure the Ford Fever Classic provided us with an amazing array of cars and trucks and we can only wonder what we’ll see in 2017.

      "title": "Westworld Episode 8 Recap",
      "text": "\nWestworld Episode 8 Recap After last week’s shocking reveal on HBO ‘s Westworld , Ford brings Bernard back online to discuss what happened. Bernard is in tears because he killed her and he really loved her. Ford finds his anguish remarkable and assures Bernard he only killed Theresa because he told him to. “They would have destroyed the art I created,” Ford reasons, pointing out that management would have also destroyed him. Pointedly, he mentions that Arnold felt the way Bernard does, and “He couldn’t stop me, either.” Ford has Bernard cover their tracks, destroy any evidence that the pair were involved in Theresa’s murder, and when he is done, Ford will free Bernard from his memories of what he had done, and his love for Theresa. “You will be at peace.”\nMaeve is in the saloon like normal, but is having a hard time accepting the blonde that is the new Clementine. She flashes back to her life with her daughter, then is in the lab with Felix and Sylvester. She can’t tell what is real anymore, and declares that she is getting out of Westworld. Sylvester dares her to leave, and Maeve knows about the exploding failsafe buried deep in her central code. She wants them to reprogram her and give her administrative privileges in order to get her own “army” to break out of the compound. “It’s time to write my own f***ing story.”\nDolores feels like she is close to being home. But first she sees a half dozen or so men on the beach, dead. Impaled by arrows belonging to the Ghost Nation. One of the men is still alive, barely, and begs for water. William hesitates to help, but Dolores insists. The soldier admits that Logan sent the soldiers to kill William and Dolores, but Dolores won’t let him die. She goes to get him more water and is confronted with the sight of herself face down in the water. It is just a vision, and after a moment everything returns to normal. By the time she returns to William, the soldier is dead.\n\nFord reveals to Charlotte and Stubbs that Theresa was found in the same place they found the Woodcutter. It appears that she simply slipped and fell to her death. There were no guests or hosts nearby, but they did find pieces of the satellite device nearby. Ford’s theory is that she had programmed the hosts to transmit the data, and when that failed, she went up to do it herself. Charlotte shows genuine remorse for Theresa’s death, which Ford tries to temper by explaining that yesterday’s demonstration was a hoax perpetrated by Theresa and the QA team. Ford plans to significantly restrict QA’s access to the code until they can get a more trustworthy team in place. Bernard will be reinstalled as the head of behavior.\nSylvester is concerned with how tightly wounded the higher-ups are. There was an accident in the park, and they need to wrap up this Maeve situation. After examining her code on a tablet, Maeve found what she needed and needs her techs to take her to the behavioral unit during the shift change. It is quite complicated, what she needs done, but then she can be someone else’s problem. Sylvester takes Felix outside and convinces him to wipe Maeve completely, brick her, and claim she came in that way. They roll her down the hall on a stretcher – nothing out of the ordinary here. Felix starts the process and warns her that, in order to do what Maeve requested, he has to shut her down.\nTeddy and the Man in Black are still riding together. They come across a number of dead people and find a blonde woman, who the Man in Black recognizes, still alive. He thought they retired her. Wyatt’s men did this. Teddy cuts her free and a huge man jumps out, in full samurai-style armor, complete with a mask with huge horns. He attacks and the men fight. The Man in Black finally takes him down with a rope to the neck. Teddy remembers this is similar to the way in which he attacked Dolores, and hits him.\n\nLee is trying to direct a cannibal host to be more realistic and frightening. Charlotte comes in, devastated by Theresa’s death. In hopes of making her feel better, Lee points out that Theresa was smuggling out data, but Charlotte defends her, saying that everything she did was at the command of her corporate overlords. Ford is almost done with his narrative, one that Lee isn’t needed for. She wants to give him a new job. They go into cold storage, where Charlotte chooses a deactivated host to upload 35 years of data into. Lee’s job is to give him some semblance of a backstory then get him on the train and out of the park. This happens to be the same host who was once Dolores’ father.\nFelix feels bad about Maeve, but then Maeve sits up on the stretcher. He didn’t brick her at all. Sylvester is terrified, especially when she explains they’ve been tinkering with her core code. She grabs a scalpel and slices open Sylvester’s throat, which upsets Felix – she said she wouldn’t hurt anyone. “You know how duplicitous I am,” Maeve defends. She gives him a cauterizer and tells Felix to fix Sylvester – he might need him. “Now it is time to recruit my army.”\nMaeve wakes and goes to the saloon, as she always does. While she waits for Hector’s gang, she tests some of her new skills by getting the bartender to pour her a free drink. A little girl outside reminds Maeve of her own little girl, and of the Man in Black coming in to kill them. Maeve tells the new Clementine to go distract some new guests and sends the bartender in the back as Hector’s squad rolls in – right on time. They start their mayhem, and Maeve strolls outside, telling the sheriff to be on his way. He leaves the thieves alone. The deputies practice their quick-draw on each other. Hector and his men steal the safe and Maeve smiles. It all went off without a hitch.\n\nBernard is worried that Charlotte will be an impediment to Ford’s new narrative, but Ford is more concerned with what Bernard feels: a machine that knows its own true nature. Bernard understands how he is coded, but doesn’t understand his feelings. Are they real? He doesn’t understand the difference between himself and Ford, between the different kinds of pain they each feel. Ford says this is the same question that drove Arnold mad. He maintains that there is nothing that makes us alive. Consciousness doesn’t exist. We all live in loops, seldom questioning our choices. Before he is wiped, Bernard has one more question: has Ford ever made him hurt anyone like this before? “Of course not,” Ford assures him, even as Bernard’s mind flickers to the briefest of memories: him killing Elsie.\nAfter more walking, Dolores comes to the vista she painted. She is home. In her mind she sees a bustling little town, and she is back in her chaste dress. This is one of the earliest iterations of Westworld, with a tech coaching stiff, barely life-like hosts to dance. Suddenly there are shots and screams. Dolores sees herself with a gun, then putting the gun to her own temple. William grabs the gun from her and Dolores, back in the here and now, is panicked. She thinks she is going crazy. She can’t tell what is real and what is a memory from a life long ago. “This is what Arnold wants, he wants me to remember.” He used to meet her there. William wants to get her out of here, get her back to Sweetwater. It’s like she is breaking down the further outside of town she gets. Some soldiers approach, and William is hopeful it is a Union scouting party that can take them back to town. No such luck. It is Logan and some Confederados. “You two are f***ed!” he cries gleefully.\nStubbs is glad to see Bernard has been reinstated – he thought the decision to remove him was short sighted. He offers his sympathies for Theresa, which Bernard brushes off. Stubbs tries to gently bring up that he knew about Bernard and Theresa’s relationship, but Bernard has no idea what he is talking about: “I barely knew her.” Stubbs tries to brush off the weirdness and asks about Elsie. Bernard is sure she is just enjoying her time off. Stubbs knows something is wrong.\n\nTeddy has the Man in Black tied up. He has no idea who he is and starts punching the Man in Black to get answers out of him. Teddy remembers he took Dolores and hurt her. The Man in Black laughs and calls Teddy an idiot, a glorified pimp. Teddy threatens to kill him but the Man in Black isn’t worried. In fact, he is ready to share his story with him. “I am a god, a titan of industry,” he says. “Philanthropist, family man.” He insists he is a good guy. Last year, in a tragic accident, his wife took the wrong pills and died. Thirty years of marriage vanished. He tried to console his daughter at the funeral, but his daughter believed her mother killed herself because of him, that she lived in terror because of the anger and hatred she saw in him. He insists they never saw him like he is in Westworld, and returned to prove her wrong. He came back here and made his own story. He wanted to see if he had it in him to do something horrible, to be something horrible. The Man in Black picked a homesteader, Maeve, and stabbed her before killing her daughter right in front of her. He did it just to see what he thought. But Maeve refused to die, and slit his throat. The Man in Black felt nothing. He saw Maeve rush her daughter outside, the two collapsing onto the ground, and in that moment she was alive, truly alive. It was then that the maze revealed itself to the Man in Black, telling him there was a deeper game, “Arnold’s game.” A game that cuts deep.\nAs the Man in Black is telling his story, Maeve is a hundred miles away, in Sweetwater, reliving the tale, slitting the new Clementine’s throat instead of the Man in Black’s. The townspeople are all around Maeve, staring in disbelief as the woman falls apart. She whispers to Hector to start shooting, and it scares the townsfolk away. In the lab, techs are nervous because Maeve isn’t responding to commands. A team is authorized to extract her.\nIt is Ford and Bernard who study Maeve back in the lab after the Man in Black tried to kill her. Her cognition is fragmented, and Ford takes the memories from her so she need not suffer. She begs Ford to be allowed to keep the pain; that is all she has left of her little girl. Ford puts her in sleep mode, but it doesn’t take and Maeve stabs herself in the throat.\nThe maze is all that matters to the Man in Black, and besting Wyatt is all that stands in the way. The blonde wants to kill the Man in Black; he is much worse than Wyatt’s men. Teddy puts his gun to the Man in Black’s head, but he can’t pull the trigger. The girl will help, and stabs Teddy in the chest with an arrow. “You’ve been gone a long while,” she says. “It’s time you came back into the fold.” From out of the woods comes a shadowy army of men in similar armor to the horned one they encountered earlier.\nYou can watch a preview for “The Well-Tempered Clavier,” the first season’s penultimate episode, by clicking here . \nWestworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 8 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 Westworld Episode 7 The post Westworld Episode 8 Recap appeared first on ComingSoon.net .",

      "text": "  Ford Could Be Killing The V6 Mustang In The US When 2018 Rolls Around by Michael Hines   Turbocharging claims another victim. It looks like turbocharging has claimed another victim, that is if this forum post from Mustang6G is to be believed. A member of the forum, who apparently works at a Ford dealership, was checking out the order guide for the 2018 MY Mustang and discovered that the V6 engine option was no longer being offered. If true that means the 2018 Mustang would be offered solely with a turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost and a 5.0-liter V8. It’s difficult to imagine Ford canning the V6 but it’s not impossible either. For one, Ford only offers the EcoBoost and GT Mustangs worldwide. Also, turbo engines are easier to tune. Ford Performance recently released a tuning kit for the EcoBoost Mustang that ups its power output to 335 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. A quick check of the Ford Performance parts site shows quite a few upgrade kits for both the EcoBoost and GT Mustangs but nothing for the V6. So, yeah, the V6 Mustang dying off isn’t the hardest thing in the world to believe. However, we do have an issue with the idea that Ford would willing cede V6 muscle car sales to both Chevrolet and Dodge. Eliminating the cheapest option in the lineup would undoubtedly affect the Mustang’s monthly sales figures. But as we’ve said before, Ford may be rethinking how it defines the Mustang’s success . The goal may not be to sell x amount of units, but rather to just beat the competition. Eliminating the V6 Mustang would tighten up the lineup and make each Mustang sale more valuable, that is if the EcoBoost Mustang doesn’t drop in price. Anyway, there was actually more in this forum post than just news about the V6. Also found in the order guide was an optional 10-speed automatic transmission and MagneRide dampers like the ones found on the Mustang Shelby GT350. The very thought of a Mustang GT with a 10-speed auto and MagneRide dampers is making our mouths water. Please, please let this leaked info turn out to be true.",

      "text": "By Will Burchfield \nMidway through the Lions’ 26-19 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday came a reminder that it was merely a game.\nHonoring our country’s veterans can have that effect.\nOn Salute to Service Day at Ford Field, U.S. Army Sergeant Jarrett Zimmer of Grand Rapids was presented with the Purple Heart. Upon the announcement of the award, the fans and players rose as one and gave Sgt. Zimmer a standing ovation.\nIt was a moment that stuck with Jim Caldwell, who brought it up at his Monday afternoon press conference.\n“I just think overall, our fans have a great understanding of the game in itself and probably what was unique about the other night was when they were honoring the military personnel. I just thought that the way our fans reacted, the way our players also certainly took part in it, it was a pretty unique experience in our stadium,” Caldwell said.\nEarlier in the game, the Lions recognized Earl Roberts, a 95-year-old World War II veteran, as their honorary captain.\nVery special day at @fordfield honoring so many of our nation's heroes and getting the win to top it off. #SaluteToService #JAXvsDET pic.twitter.com/TdWOJPHJQu \n— Rod Wood (@RodWood_Lions) November 20, 2016 \n\nThe positive vibes at Ford Field on Sunday have Caldwell excited for what’s to come this Thursday, when the Lions take on the Minnesota Vikings in arguably the biggest Thanksgiving game in franchise history .\n“Number one, Thanksgiving Day games are really special here. There’s no question about that and I think that our fans have been absolutely outstanding. They were great the other night,” Caldwell said. “It’s always a challenge to come in here and play because of the fact that they will certainly give you some difficulty operating at the line of scrimmage.\n“I think a lot happens at home that certainly gives us a lot of energy, but like I said before, you’ve got to play well no matter where you are. No matter who you’re playing, no matter what the situation might be, you’ve got to play well in order to win.”\n",

      "text": "  Brian Scott qualified 22nd and stayed out of trouble throughout the Ford EcoBoost 400 to finish respectably in 15th. Brian Scott announced his retirement from Cup racing earlier this year in order to spend more time with his family. He has the moral victory of a top-15 to complete his career, which is his sixth top-15 in 53 races. Richard Petty Motorsports continues to search for a driver to fill the No. 44. Nov 21 - 3:47 PM Brian Scott has finished in the 30s in his last five efforts on short, flat tracks. Scott has generally raced worse than he qualified in these events also, which means he is not only scoring minimally but also losing place-differential points. Earlier this season he finished 27th at Phoenix International Raceway and 26th at Martinsville Speedway, but he was unable to back that up this fall on the half-miler. He finished 34th in his last Martinsville attempt. Nov 10 - 5:24 PM Richard Petty Motorsports and Brian Scott today announced Scott, driver of the No. 44 Richard Petty Motorsports Ford, will retire from full-time competition in NASCAR at the end of the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. Scott has made the personal decision to focus on his young and growing family and also the next phase of his career. He began competing in NASCAR's national series in 2007, debuting in the NASCAR Camping World Series (full-time in 2008 and 2009). From 2010 through 2015, he competed in the NASCAR XFINITY Series. He finished inside the Top 10 in championship standings in five of his six seasons. In 2016, Scott was signed by Richard Petty Motorsports to compete in his first full-season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.-Breaking Limits Nov 10 - 1:07 PM With 34 minute remaining in practice for the Goody's Fast Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway, Brian Scott slapped the wall with the right rear of his car. Scott is coming off a career-best finish of second last week at Talladega SuperSpeedway, but this sport will humble a person quickly. Scott finished 26th in the spring’s Martinsville race, which is his best result in 2016 on a short, flat track. Oct 28 - 11:56 AM",

Porunga, a wish-granting dragon, attempts to tell them that all their wishes can be granted with a Ford Focus but is interrupted. Finally, he’s had enough of their antics and grants them their wishes via a Focus. \nThe spot comes in at No. 1 with 3,974,187 views, with the rankings compiled by Visible Measures. \nWatch it and more new spots from Kia and Audi below. 1",

      "text": "The Evening Rush is your daily roundup of auto, gear, and lifestyle news, all in one place. Less time searching, more time driving. Motor on. \n\nAutomotive \nAs many of you already know The Grand Tour finally aired on Amazon last week and it definitely held up to expectations. The show was chalk full of the classic Top Gear theatrics and had the production value of a James Bond film. Plus, the opening scene had three monstrous Mustangs in it so we were smiling right off the bat. It will be interesting to see where the show goes from here as they have already featured a LaFerrari, a P1 and a 918. \nLeaked images and mild detective work have indicated some significant changes to the 2018 Ford Mustang . According to credible sources, Ford may be dropping the V-6 engine and further marketing the EcoBoost four-cylinder. This doesn’t come as a huge surprise as the EcoBoost seemed to be edging out the V-6 in the performance category. In addition, spy photos seem to indicate that the front end will see cosmetic changes due to a heavy amount of camouflaging. \nPorsche has announced they have no intension of adding another “affordable” or entry-level Porsche into their line-up. Porsche will be sticking with the Boxster and the Macan for the foreseeable future. Porsche Global Sales Chief Detlev von Platen indicated that the brand has “nothing to gain” by introducing a cheaper model to the line-up as they are more focused on producing quality and not quantity. \n\nGear \nFour Sevens has always done a fantastic job of making durable tactical flashlights. Now they have shrunk their talent but kept the same (or more) lumens. The new Mini Mk II Combo stands just a few inches off the ground yet it can crank out 1020 lumens. Four Sevens \nEasily upload your old photos to your phone or computer with the new PhotoScan App . Without distorting or reducing the quality of the photo, PhotoScan combines multiple images to enhance the quality and reduce any glare that might have occurred when taking a picture of the image. \nLifestyle \nI am not going to tell you where to buy the best flannel (although I know where…sshhh), instead I am going to point you towards the comprehensive list generated by GearMoose . Featuring 20 different flannels, you are bound to find one you love. \nThis is your friendly reminder that snow is coming and you might want to invest in a new plow. Whether you are a “yute” looking to make some cash or a proud owner of a large plot of land, a new plow is an exciting purchase. Make things a little easier and go over to bossplow.com to find the perfect plow for your truck. Boss Plow",

      "text": "This crazy detail about the music Ford used to calm Maeve will low-key blow your mind One of the coolest things about Westworld is the show’s use of music. And we’re not just talking about the awesome reimaginings of classics by Radiohead, Soundgarden, and the Rolling Stones. Because in Episode 8, “Trace Decay,” Ford used a PARTICULAR classical piece to calm Maeve down (in a flashback from about a year ago). And, if the cue sounded familiar to you , that’s because we’ve heard it before. And the NAME of this beautiful piece of music will not just blow your mind, but also make you question everything.\nThe song is called “Reverie” by famed French composer Claude Debussy. HBO \nAnd here’s a close-up for clarity. HBO \nThat’s right, Westworld has been low-key trolling everyone this whole time by playing a ~reverie~ just for us.\nBecause, believe it or not, we first heard this song in Episode 3, “The Stray.” HBO \nIf you recall, in that episode, Bernard had a private convo with Ford in his office and a Host pianist played a gentle tune… And, YEAH, it was Debussy’s “Reverie.” At first we thought it was just a clever Easter Egg referring to the “reveries” Ford recently installed in the Hosts. But now we wonder if this song has a more important meaning in the show?\nBecause we’re super intrigued by the whole, “An old trick from an old friend” comment. HBO \nIs the “old friend” Ford is referencing Arnold?! I mean, PROBABLY. Because who the eff else is going to know how to control Hosts from the backend with a little ~trick~? Oh, right, ARNOLD.\nWe also want to know why Ford has the song playing automatically when he enters his office. HBO \nIs this a “trick” he has setup in case an unruly Host makes its way to his private office? Obviously, Bernard was no threat, so he turned it off then. But, what if a more ~dangerous~ Host posed a threat? You know, à la Maeve!? Would the music just keep playing?\nAnd, in case you’re curious, here’s what the entire Debussy song sounds like. \nBeautiful and eerie just like the show!\nWe won’t be surprised if Debussy’s “Reverie” makes it back into the show before the end of Season 1. Because with two episodes left there’s still plenty of time for Westworld to blow our minds again a few times over.\nThe post This crazy detail about the music Ford used to calm Maeve will low-key blow your mind appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

The writing has been on the wall for the 3.7-liter V-6, and now it appears Ford is officially making the turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost I-4 the Mustang's base engine.\nResearch ford mustang See All Model Years See Pricing A user on the Mustang6g forums posted the info, which comes from Ford's ordering system. According to the user, the V-6 Mustang's body code comes up as invalid in the system, suggesting it has been discontinued. This shouldn't come as a huge surprise as the V-6 received very few changes when the 2015 Mustang debuted, and hasn't received updates in the years since. The 3.7-liter V-6 currently makes 300 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque. That's down from the 2.3-liter EcoBoost, which Ford has positioned as the upgrade engine with its 310 hp and 320 lb-ft.\n© Motor Trend Staff 2018 Ford Mustang front three quarter 06 The 10-speed automatic transmission again appears on the options list. That transmission, which was jointly developed by Ford and GM, will also be used on the 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 , Ford F-150 Raptor, and F-150 3.5 EcoBoost models . Another interesting tidbit is that the new Mustang can be equipped with the MagneRide magnetorheological dampers of the Shelby GT350. Also interesting is the appearance of a \"Performance Package 2,\" which comes in addition to the existing GT Performance Package. There are no details on what this package includes, but it could be Ford's answer to the Chevy Camaro's high-performance 1LE package .\nNew colors include Orange Fury, Royal Crimson, and Kona Blue. Sadly, Grabber Blue, which returned just last year, is no more.\nA Ford spokesman was unable to confirm the info, saying only that there will be more news on the 2018 Ford Mustang closer to launch.\nCheck out the full ordering guide over at Mustang6g to see what could be in store for the refreshed pony car .\nSource: Mustang6g\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Found! 1923 Ford T-Bucket Striped by Von Dutch in 1969 HOT ROD 11/15/2016 < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 30 NEXT SLIDE > © Hot Rod\nVon Dutch in a Basement\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo When Michael Lightbourn agreed to look at an old hot rod buried in a garage apartment basement in El Paso, Texas, he never expected to find a work of art. “I’ve known Gary Hawkins for years. I grew up around him with my uncles, my dad, and everybody.” Michael knew Gary had an old ’23 T-bucket powered by a Corvette L88 big-block.\nHe just had never seen the car. In 2011, Gary asked Michael to check out the T-bucket for the codes on the 427 to assess the engine’s value. The T, Gary assumed, was just an old kit that “wasn’t worth anything.” Michael found the famous IT engine suffix code for a factory-issue L88, date coded December of 1967, and apparently correct for a ’68 Corvette. But more than the motor impressed him.\nThe paint job from 1969 still looked “really nice” and featured gold leaf, cool pinstripes, a pair of holograms resembling a marijuana leaf, plus painted emblems that looked oddly familiar. Finally, when Michael worked his way around the car to the tailgate and discovered “Von Dutch ’69” painted there, he quickly lost interest in the motor and asked Gary point blank who had painted this car.\n“He told me some guy who called himself Kenny.” Michael wondered if this Kenny could be Kenny Howard, also known as legendary painter Von Dutch.\nAs Gary revealed facts about the summer of 1969 and Kenny’s appearance in El Paso, Michael became transfixed on the events three years shy of a half-century passed.\n© Hot Rod\nDutch in El Paso\nKenny “was striping some guy’s, I think it was a race car, over here on Mesa Street at the Royal Arms Hotel,” Gary remembers. He had already been through three failed attempts for a good paint job on his ’23. So, he stopped to see what was going on. “I asked him if he would be interested in painting a car for me.” Kenny was interested but needed a place to stay. He was living, at that time, in “a bus of some sort.” The Von Dutch bus, converted to rolling living quarters, is well known.\nGary eventually got to go inside. He described a walkway in the center and a shop up front that included, he thinks, “a mill, all kinds of painting apparatus, buckets of paint, brushes, and whatnot.” In the rear of the interior was a bed. On the back of the bus was a motorcycle, probably of German origin. So yes, this Kenny was definitely Von Dutch, which made the pinstripes and painting on the car all the more interesting. To Michael, the car itself was a canvas for a work of art.\nGary says that Kenny “rough sanded it” and “painted it” before adding pinstripes and gold leaf. Instead of living in the bus, Kenny accepted an invitation to stay in Gary’s garage apartment, situated in a basement, which had become something of a hangout. Born September 7, 1929, Von Dutch would have turned 40 a month or so after he painted Gary’s T. Born in 1943, Gary was 14 years his junior. Apparently, the Hawkins’ hangout proved a fun lodging place for Kenny as well as a shop to paint.\nFor the summer of 1969, Hawkins had made building this car his full-time job. He worked on the T from the time he got up until the time he went to sleep, right there in that garage apartment. Gary describes that summer as one of the best times of his life, subsisting on $200 rent paid for two separate dwellings above his head. Von Dutch painted the car and lived with Gary in this small space. In retrospect, Gary today is a little incredulous, recalling paint overspray on the walls and fumes misting in the air of the small apartment where he and Von Dutch slept at night.\nTo say the two shared some party time together would be an understatement. Nightly, some 20 to 30 hot rods would be parked up and down the steeply inclined neighborhood street outside the apartment’s pair of garage doors, where young men and women gathered. Gary recalls the name of the hot rod club of that era was The Little Giants. We ask Gary about what kind of wild things Von Dutch would do. “He’d take his motorcycle off the back of his bus and drive out in the middle of the street and go crazy doing donuts. I guess it was a stress reliever for him.”\nAnother stress reliever was to go out into the street and fire his handgun into the air. “It was an odd-shaped thing. I can’t remember the caliber,” Gary says. “It had a funny way of cocking. As I recall, the top of it would form into a V.” This was the 1960s in El Paso, and the neighbors did not get upset or call the police. In fact, when things “really got crazy,” the people partying would run streaks of gasoline across the street and light them, so there would be a “constant fire from one end to the other,” and still no complaints.\nTheir favorite drink in those days was Ripple wine, which they bought in gallon containers to mix with 7-Up and ice.\n© Hot Rod Valuable Artwork\nGary’s reason for contacting Michael had been to verify that the engine in the T was, in fact, an L88. If so, he planned to remove the very valuable big-block to sell and insert another engine that was “more streetable” and maybe less collectible. Then he could drive his old hot rod again. But now another issue was much more important.\nThe ’23 T-bucket that Gary kept telling Michael was “not worth anything” and was “just an old fiberglass kit” was far more valuable than the L88 engine. Michael might have taken advantage of this situation by keeping quiet about the car’s heritage and making a really good buy. “I’m not like that,” Michael says. Instead, he explained to Gary that the T was a “valuable piece of artwork” painted by the late Von Dutch, a cult hero in the car hobby who passed away in 1992.\nMichael began investigating the Von Dutch stripes and artwork. Of particular interest was the famous Von Dutch trademark Flying Eyeball, which Von Dutch said went back to the Egyptian culture of 5,000 years ago. But, on this particular car the eyeball did not appear between the familiar Von Dutch wings, painted atop the radiator shell and on the cowl in front of the windshield. Gary explains why. “Kenny first painted an eyeball with wings on it.\nAnd the eyeball looked like it was bloodshot. I just didn’t like it. I said I don’t want that. I don’t think you can see the eyeball anymore. The gold leaf is starting to flake off. He wanted to put on an eyeball. As a matter of fact, we scraped it off.” Gary bent down close to the wings on the top of the radiator shell to try to detect any remains of the eyeball. But he could not see them. That lack of an eyeball atop the wings “threw me off when I first saw it because everything Von Dutch does has the eyeball,” Michael says. “I recognized the wings. I just didn’t see the eyeball. And I kept going back to the signature, but this makes it more like a one-off because it doesn’t have the eyeball.”\nOn part of the chassis at the base of the radiator is an odd symbol in more gold leaf that Gary guesses is an “abstract finger.” Gary pointed directly above the car to the original design, formed into a three-dimensional shape out of a wire coat hanger in 1969 and still hanging in place. Gary explains how he had to argue with Kenny to add this symbol. Von Dutch didn’t want to add it, but he finally did. He was very much opposed to it. Just opposite the 10-inch-wide slicks—the widest available at the time—on either side of the body are what Michael describes as hologram images, in bright pink, of a marijuana leaf. Von Dutch added his name and the year, ’69, to the top rear of the body on the tailgate.\nGary explained he had two different tailgates for preservation of the Von Dutch logo. The garage apartment hid another treasure, a sign Von Dutch painted for Gary to display with the ’23 T-Bucket at car shows. Gary wishes he had taken better care of the sign, which shows the effects of exposure to the weather. We looked at the area of this garage apartment where Von Dutch spent several weeks and found a half dozen photo albums. The beds were gone for sleeping, but many of the remnants of Gary’s summer college days remain. Of considerable interest is the tiny office area with bookshelves and walls that could be preserved for a museum to recall the college student lifestyle of the ’60s.\nThe place almost looks like Gary walked away one day and left the car and his summer of ’69 behind, but one to which he could return through the years. In one photo album we found a damaged print of Von Dutch standing beside the ’23 T-bucket. Visible in the background was the shelf above the workbench. And on that workbench we could see today, in 2016, many of the same items, left undisturbed, that we could see in the 1969 print. Looking at this photo of Von Dutch and the ’23 T-bucket is enough to give anybody an eerie feeling. Maybe if Von Dutch could have added the eyeball, like he wanted, the job would have been complete. The car could have moved on, been sold. Maybe Gary could have let go.\nSometime in the late 1970s or early 1980s, Gary put the T-bucket up for sale. But he backed down when he found out the buyer was solely interested in the L88. And now, in 2016, Gary has finally discovered, through his friend Michael Lightbourn, the identity of Kenny Howard, whose work is now considered art. Gary is thinking about selling the garage apartment. Then, what would happen to the ’23 T-bucket? Where would it go? “The flying eyeball in the sky knows all and sees all.”\nGo to MSN Home",

The Fiesta ST is also performing well, with sales up 7 percent to 3,215 units. The recently introduced 350 horsepower Focus RS has recorded 1,674 deliveries through September.\"For decades, we heard criticism from customers that Ford sold its best small cars only in Europe, yet in five short years we've built a reputation here for making very serious but affordable performance cars with our Focus ST and Fiesta ST one-two punch,\" says Jessica Bishop, Ford Focus brand manager. \"Buyers now know Ford is committed to affordable performance.\" Prices for Ford's hot hatches range from $20,970 for the Fiesta ST to $36,120 for the full-boat Focus RS. \n ",

      "text": "2018 Ford Mustang Axes V-6 Engine Option: Report Magnetic dampers will be on options list By: Alex Nishimoto November 21, 2016 \nT he 2018 Ford Mustang will lose its V-6 engine option, according to dealer information obtained by Mustang6g . The writing has been on the wall for the 3.7-liter V-6, and now it appears Ford is officially making the turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost I-4 the Mustang’s base engine. \nA user on the Mustang6g forums posted the info, which comes from Ford’s ordering system. According to the user, the V-6 Mustang’s body code comes up as invalid in the system, suggesting it has been discontinued. This shouldn’t come as a huge surprise as the V-6 received very few changes when the 2015 Mustang debuted, and hasn’t received updates in the years since. The 3.7-liter V-6 currently makes 300 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque. That’s down from the 2.3-liter EcoBoost, which Ford has positioned as the upgrade engine with its 310 hp and 320 lb-ft. 2.3-liter EcoBoost engine \nThe 10-speed automatic transmission again appears on the options list . That transmission, which was jointly developed by Ford and GM, will also be used on the 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 , Ford F-150 Raptor, and F-150 3.5 EcoBoost models. Another interesting tidbit is that the new Mustang can be equipped with the MagneRide magnetorheological dampers of the Shelby GT350. Also interesting is the appearance of a “Performance Package 2,” which comes in addition to the existing GT Performance Package. There are no details on what this package includes, but it could be Ford’s answer to the Chevy Camaro’s high-performance 1LE package . \nNew colors include Orange Fury, Royal Crimson, and Kona Blue. Sadly, Grabber Blue, which returned just last year, is no more. \nA Ford spokesman was unable to confirm the info, saying only that there will be more news on the 2018 Ford Mustang closer to launch. \nCheck out the full ordering guide over at Mustang6g to see what could be in store for the refreshed pony car .",

      "text": "Ford EcoSport to be first India-made car to be exported to US Last Updated: Monday, November 21, 2016 - 09:06 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nFord hit the right note with the EcoSport in the Indian markets, cracking open the compact SUV segment in the peninsula. But the car couldn’t really compete for aesthetics against its rivals in the US. Perhaps that’s why the facelift of the car was recently unveiled and its India-made version is all set to be exported to The States, where sales are slated to commence by 2018. \nThis also makes the EcoSport the first vehicle to be imported by the US from India. Prior to this announcement, the company was under fire from President-elect Donald Trump for moving the manufacturing of all its smaller cars to Mexico. Though the move has not affected any jobs for American workers, Trump has vowed to impose a 35 percent tax on cars that are built in Mexico for the US market, which, he says, will force automakers to bring jobs back to US plants. \nThus, Ford has now resorted to India to at least take care of the EcoSport supplies in the American market. But exports are nothing new for the India-made EcoSport that is rolled out of the company’s Chennai plant. The facility caters to more than 100 markets across the globe. Notably, around 15 percent of the total production is consumed domestically. \nTalking about the car, its forthcoming iteration broke cover earlier this week, ahead of the Los Angeles Motor Show. In India, the car has been a shadow of itself ever since the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza was launched in the summer of 2016. An update was long due and with the US launch slated for 2018, it would be safe to say that the new EcoSport will make its way onto the subcontinent sometime before that. \nSource: CarDekho.com ",

      "text": "Seven titles might not be enough for Johnson NASCAR: Ford EcoBoost 400 Mark J. Rebilas/USA Today NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Jimmie Johnson celebrates after winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup championship and the Ford Ecoboost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. With his seventh championship, Johnson is tied with Richard Petty and the late Dale Earnhardt Sr for championships. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Jimmie Johnson celebrates after winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup championship and the Ford Ecoboost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. With his seventh championship, Johnson is tied with Richard Petty and the late Dale Earnhardt Sr for championships. (Mark J. Rebilas/USA Today) Bill Center first climbed into a NASCAR Sprint Cup car in 2001, he had a number he was chasing.\nIt wasn’t seven championships. It wasn’t 80 race wins. \nIt was one. \n“I wanted to win one race,” Johnson said Monday via telephone. “I thought if I won one race, they’d keep me around for a couple of years. \n“I thought if I won one race, I might be in position to have a shot at two.” \nToday, of course, Jimmie Johnson is an icon in his sport. Sunday afternoon he moved alongside Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt as the only seven-time season champions in NASCAR’s 68-year history. \nIf there was a Mount Rushmore of stock car racing, Petty, Earnhardt and Johnson would be the first three faces carved in stone. The fourth could be Jeff Gordon , or David Pearson, or Cale Yarborough. \nThe point is that El Cajon native Jimmie Johnson — whose roots are in dirt bikes and off-road racing — is now inarguably one of the three greatest competitors in the history of his sport. \nAnd Johnson isn’t done. Some NASCAR drivers race into their 50s. \nJohnson is 41, the youngest seven-time champion. \n“I don’t think that will be me racing at 50,” Johnson said Monday of his future. “The last thing I want to do is put a set number on the question of when. I want to race until the fire goes out. Jeff (Gordon) was in a good place when he walked away, he was in peace with his decision . . . that is the key for any athlete.” \nBut Johnson’s drive to race on is not propelled by some grand quest to be the only driver with eight titles. \nHe has a unique view of his success. \n“I’m extremely competitive,” he said. “Anytime I’m in the car, I want to win that race. But I’m not really counting. This happened because we’re very good as a team. I love celebrating wins as a team. \n“Am I happy to be there on a level with Petty and Earnhardt? I’m honored. We’ve accomplished so much. And I’m there for it all with one team ( Hendrick Motorsports ), one crew chief (Chad Knaus) and one sponsor (Lowe’s) . . . one team. I can’t tell you how much that means to me. \n“I was really at peace with six titles. Did I want the seventh title? Yes. But last week was the calmest I’ve ever been going into a race like that. I was so content with where I was, and yes, I wanted to win number seven. \n“Does that make sense?” \nSure, Johnson would love to have an eighth title. \n“I love to win. I’d love to stand alone. But that is not what motivates me. That’s the desire to compete.” \nCompeting brings race wins, which brings us to another category where Johnson is climbing. After Sunday, he ranks seventh with 80 wins. \nPetty is the all-time leader with 200, although many of those came when NASCAR ran as many as 70 races a year and the fields weren’t deep with quality cars. Pearson, who also ran during the times of expanded schedules, has 105 wins. Gordon is third with 93 followed by Darrell Waltrip and Bobby Allison at 84 and Yarborough at 83. \nSince his first win, at Fontana in 2002, Johnson has averaged more than five wins a season. \n“Pearson’s mark is way out there,” said Johnson. “Ninety-three, to be there with Jeff would be quite an honor. Without Jeff ...” It was four-time champion Gordon who in 2000 championed Johnson’s cause with car owner Rick Hendrick. \nJohnson loves and respects the history of his sport and talked about Petty and Earnhardt. \n“Pioneer legends are few and far between and Richard Petty was that to our sport,” said Johnson. “Kyle (Petty) told me his dad was never stuck on numbers but just loved racing. Richard set the bar so high and did it with a style that drew fans and attention to the sport \n“Dale Earnhardt took the sport to another level. I’ve had a chance to get to know Richard, but I got a chance to meet Dale only twice and he scared the heck out of me both times. I wish I had gotten the chance to know him better and race against him.” \nJohnson figures to race NASCAR into the next decade. \n“I don’t have an end point other than thinking of 45 being a time to start slowing down. Even if competitive, I won’t make it another 10 years. But that probably won’t be the end of my racing. \n“I want to get back into off-road trucks and maybe drive endurance sports cars. I also want to do a full-distance Ironman and a triathlon.” \nCenter is a freelance writer",

      "text": "Planners begin to envision how Ford site will interact with transportation Streets long dead-ended will connect through the big new development. By Janet Moore Star Tribune November 21, 2016 — 8:24pm Purchase: Order Reprint Several hundred residents and planning officials gathered Monday evening to learn how cars, mass transit, bikes and pedestrians will fit in with the ambitious redevelopment of the former Ford plant site in St. Paul. The results of a recent transportation study are highly preliminary for the 122-acre site where Ford once produced cars and trucks on the shores of the Mississippi River. Opened in 1926, the plant was closed in 2011. The city plans to build multifamily housing, park and green space, and a busy commercial district. The Ford Motor Co. plant site has long \"been a barrier to movement,\" said City Planner Merritt Clapp-Smith. Traffic in the neighborhood essentially stops at the site, which is closed to non-plant traffic. This has created a serious traffic bottleneck at the intersection of Cleveland Av. and Ford Parkway in the Highland Park neighborhood, also a popular area for pedestrians. Broadly speaking, streets that now dead-end on Ford Parkway would connect through the new development, dispersing traffic throughout the area. Cretin Av. and Montreal Av. would serve as primary streets. And the inactive Canadian Pacific Railway spur likely would become some type of thoroughfare for bikes and pedestrians. While the site already is well-served by several Metro Transit bus routes, including the new A-line rapid bus, it's unclear how the proposed Riverview Corridor transit project along West 7th Street would connect with the Ford site. The Riverview project involves transit, possibly bus, bus-rapid transit or light rail, that would connect Union Depot in downtown St. Paul to the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Those attending the meeting were asked to submit comments on various transportation proposals for the Ford site, and no decisions were made at the meeting. Clapp-Smith said another transportation study will be completed before the start of any construction of roads or paths. A formal master plan for the entire site will be presented to the city's Planning Commission next spring, and to the City Council during the summer of 2017. Final adoption is expected in late summer or early fall. Officials with have said that they plan to begin marketing the site to a master developer in late 2017 or early 2018. Currently the company is cleaning up the site, a process that began in 2012. Once that is done, it will be sold to a developer, probably in 2019. City officials say the mix of uses and the density of dwellers on the property will support transit \"through and around\" the site. The area is bordered by Ford Parkway, Cleveland Avenue and Mississippi River Boulevard. Planners have also called for an interconnected system of streets, bikeways and walkways that is safe and accessible for people of various ages and abilities. The idea is to reduce the number of trips taken by car, and manage the impact of traffic.",

      "text": "News & Views Holiday Gift Ideas: Traxxas Releases 2017 Ford Raptor R/C Righteous Raptor: Traxxas offers scale off-road fun with R/C version of Ford’s new 2017 F-150 Raptor in time for Christmas Mark Houlahan Tech Editor, Mustang Monthly November 21, 2016 Photos By: Manufacturer \nSure, we’re Mustang fanatics first and foremost around here at Mustang-360.com, but we’re also fans of all of Ford’s performance vehicles. From the new Focus RS to the hot new Ford GT supercar, we’d love to have one of each in our dream garage. One of the most anticipated Ford performance vehicles to return to the showroom for 2017 is the new Ford F-150 Raptor pickup. Featuring a 3.5L EcoBoost twin-turbo V-6, stiffer frame, all new styling, and even better suspension than its predecessor, Ford truck enthusiasts are lining up to order one. Whether they plan to tackle the desert, use it as a tow rig, or simply be the baddest truck in their work parking lot, who cares. We’re just thrilled Ford is bringing the Raptor back. Under that beautiful polycarbonate scale body is Traxxas’ tried and true Slash short-course chassis. With a 13-inch wheelbase and over 3½-inches of ground clearance, the 1/10th scale chassis is molded in black and features sealed waterproof electronics, adjustable coilover shocks, and easy battery fitment. \nThe radio controlled car and truck peeps at Traxxas [https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/58094-1fordraptor] must certainly feel the same way, as they’ve crafted up a trick version of their famous Slash short-course R/C truck with the new 2017 Raptor body on it. Officially licensed by Ford, this new electric R/C truck features a true to scale F-150 Raptor body with Raptor graphics pre-applied and available in one of three official Ford colors (Lighting Blue, Oxford White, and Magnetic), with BFGoodrich Mud Terrain T/A tires, oil filled coilover shocks, geared differential, and sealed waterproof electronics for fun out on the trails in any condition or weather! \nIf you’re considering buying a 2017 F-150 Raptor how cool would it be to have a “mini me” for your kids to play with (or the kid in you)? Or if you’re like us and only dream of owning one of Ford’s hot new Raptor trucks you could pick one of these Traxxas Raptors up to help ease the pain of not owning the full size version! That’s our plan anyway, to have one of these bad boys under our Christmas tree this year—make it Lighting Blue please!",

Church CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nHIGH POINT, NC – For six years, thousands stood outside the open doors of Williams Memorial C.M.E. Church; looking forward to collecting a box filled with food for Thanksgiving. \nA turkey, green beans, corn, stuffing, yams and cranberry sauce, all delicately packed into a box by volunteers at the High Point Church. \nWhen the idea of giving food to thankful people began in 2010, the church managed to give away 5,000 free boxes of food. Over the years, the number grew to 7,000, 8,000 and now, in 2016, 10,000 people. \n“I’ve had people come up to me and tell me, ‘Man, if it hadn’t been for that box, I don’t know where I would have been at that particular time,’” said Pastor Robert Williams. \"We see a lot of people who are down on their luck at this time but next year they will be able to help us better serve the community.\" \nLike Isaac Alexander. A year ago, Alexander lost his job because of a back injury. \n\"For nine months there was no income coming in except for my wife's disability,” Alexander said. Loading... One man found himself needing the food Williams Memorial provided and the next year, the same man found himself helping others receive.

I don't because I was in those shoes,” Alexander explained. \"Can't nobody tell me how somebody feels when they don't have something to eat. I can cause I been there.\" And so, a year later, he's back at the church, in a better place financially and able to give back the exact same thing he once needed. Alongside 40 volunteers, Alexander carefully packed the boxes, with a smile on his face.\"I owe it to Him to love everybody that comes through those doors. Often times when you got things, you don't look at the times when you didn't.\" \nVolunteers will hand out the food starting at 11AM on Tuesday, November 22 at 3400 Triangle Lake Road. NASCAR superstar Richard Petty and Julian Brittano from Oprah’s ‘Greenleaf’ will help pass out food. The boxes are first come, first serve. \nCopyright 2016 WFMY ",

      "text": "2018 Ford Mustang To Ditch V6 And Adopt 10-Speed Auto | By Share It seems as though the facelifted 2018 Ford Mustang will lose the current 3.7-liter V6, making it solely available with the EcoBost 2.0-liter four-cylinder and the naturally-aspirated 5.0-liter V8. According to Mustang6G , the body type codes for the V6 are now longer valid in the dealer system for the Mustang, suggesting that the engine will soon be resigned to the history books. This isn’t all that surprising considering the four-cylinder is more fuel efficient and more powerful, delivering 310 hp versus 300 hp of the V6. The turbo also has an extra 40 lb-ft of torque. Beyond the abandonment of the V6, it has been confirmed that the new Mustang will be available with a 10-speed automatic transmission co-developed with General Motors and already in use in the updated Camaro. Perhaps even more significant than the option of this new gearbox will be the availability of the advanced MagneRide dampers for both the EcoBoost and Mustang GT models. These shocks are only currently available on the Shelby GT350 and GT350R and play a huge part in making those two such track monsters. Elsewhere, it is reported that the new Mustang will receive an additional performance package, poised to compete with the Camaro 1LE package. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": " Ford Motor Company\n- Prairie View A&M University's multi-energy conservation system secures first place in 2016 Ford Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge\n- Second and third place go to Hampton University and Johnson C. Smith University, both of which are receiving funds to implement their community-focused projects\n- Now in its fourth year, the challenge has donated $400,000 in scholarships, grants and implementation funds\nDEARBORN, Mich. Four architectural students from Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Texas , won top honors at the 2016 Ford Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge with a software app that enables homeowners to monitor water and energy use in real-time. The innovative app, which helps homeowners adjust their utility use and save money, earned the students $75,000 in scholarships, grants and implementation funds.\nSecond place and $15,000 was awarded to a team from Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia . Hampton students developed a program that tracks sea levels for communities at risk of flooding. Students from Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina , took third place and $10,000 for a project that raises freshwater fish for consumption in local homes. Each team member also received an iPad.\n\"We received numerous outstanding entries from Historically Black Colleges and Universities across the country,\" said Pamela Alexander , director of community development, Ford Motor Company Fund. \"Although selecting the three winners was extremely difficult, we're proud the challenge encouraged all of the students to think about how they can support their communities.\"\nNow in its fourth year, the Ford Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge is modeled after the Ford College Community Challenge, a signature Ford Fund program that challenges students globally to design innovative projects that address critical sustainability needs in their communities. To date, the program has awarded $400,000 in scholarships, grants and implementation funds.\nRaj Register, Ford manager for multicultural communications, said teaming up with Historically Black Colleges and Universities on a program with positive, far-reaching community impact is a natural move for an innovation leader like Ford.\n\"Ford is proud to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities with this unique program showcasing such talented and pioneering students,\" she said.\nFord's Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge is jointly supported by Ford marketing and Ford Fund, the company's philanthropic arm, with participation from national radio personality and longtime booster Tom Joyner . In addition to Alexander and Joyner, other judges include Henry Ford III , Ford Performance global marketing manager; and Burt Jordan , Ford vice president, global vehicle and powertrain purchasing and supplier diversity.\nFord has long been a supporter of diverse communities, with a particular focus on education. Ford Fund invests $10 million a year in educational outreach including grants, scholarships and other programming.\nTo view the journey these students took, follow #FordHBCU.\nAbout Ford Motor Company\nFord Motor Company is a global automotive and mobility company based in Dearborn, Michigan .

      "title": "2018 Ford Mustang getting new suspension, ditching V6?",
      "text": "Tuesday, Nov 22nd, 2016 @ 1:00 am Ford will update the sixth-generation Mustang for the 2018 model year, and a leaked ordering guide gives us an early look at some of the changes in store.One of the most noteworthy changes for the next model year is that the Mustang will no longer be available with a V6 engine, according to documents uncovered by enthusiast website Mustang6G . The 3.7-liter six makes 300 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 280 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. Buyers who don't want a V8-powered 'Stang will be left with the turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost, which makes 310 horses and 320 pound-feet of torque.The list of options will grow with the long-rumored addition of a 10-speed automatic transmission. Buyers will also be able to pay extra for a dual exhaust system with four tips, adaptive dampers borrowed from the Shelby GT350 (pictured), and a bundle named \"Performance Package 2.\" It's too early to tell what it will include, though Mustang6G believes it will add track-focused components designed to position the Mustang in the same arena as the Chevrolet Camaro 1LE . The mechanical upgrades will be complemented by a new look, though the updates will be more evolutionary than revolutionary. Inside, the Mustang will receive a minor makeover and it will likely adopt a new infotainment system.The 2018 Ford Mustang will be presented to the public in the coming months. Sales will kick off shortly after in the United States and abroad. \n ",

      "text": "India got its first official pony car earlier this year and it seems Ford is already working on building a new one for 2018. The Mustang – the typical muscle car it is known to be – will look subtly different from the current car. The big changes would be underneath and we suspect the new 10-speed automatic gearbox might make it to the ‘Stang. The not so good news being the naturally aspirated V6 petrol might get the boot.\nThe free-revving charm of the old school naturally aspirated V6 will be the only thing to reminisce in spite of the V6’s replacement being slightly more powerful. Yes the replacement is a 2.3-litre turbocharged four cylinder EcoBoost petrol – two cylinders knocked off and 1400cc less in cubic capacity. But it develops 310bhp of power against the 300bhp of the V6 and the turbocharging makes torque available much lower in the rev range.\nThe flagship 5.0-litre naturally aspirated V8 will continue to be the star in the Mustang line-up. The 2018 Mustang might also feature the new 10-speed automatic torque converter gearbox that has made its debut with Ford F-150 trucks. The 10-speed box will get the Mustang on par with its arch-rival the Chevrolet Camaro which already gets the 10-speed transmission on the ZL1. The torque converter automatic gearbox has been jointly developed by the two American giants and holds the bragging rights for the ‘most number of gears on a production car’ as of now.\nWe are also expecting the new Shelby GT500 to debut with the 2018 Mustang. In India, we only get the 5.0-litre V8 and being Ford’s halo car, there are slim chances of the EcoBoost Mustang making it to the country. But there is a high chance of the Shelby GTs coming to India before the 2018 Mustang.",

      "title": "Marcotte Ford Named Leading Dealer of Ford's Energi Vehicles in Massachusetts",
      "text": "Marcotte Ford sells more earth-friendly Ford Energi vehicles than any other Massachusetts Ford dealer, according to state records.\nHOLYOKE, Mass. (PRWEB) November 22, 2016\nMarcotte Ford announces that they are the number one Ford Energi Dealership in Massachusetts for Energi vehicles sold or leased under the Ford brand. This includes the Fusion Energi, Focus Electric, and C-Max Energi .\nIn-state residents who purchase or lease these vehicles can receive a $1,500 upfront rebate for Energi vehicles and up to $2,500 for electric vehicles from the Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles (MOR-EV) program. In conducting the program, MOR-EV also maintains statewide records about the adoption and use of such vehicles. These statistics identify Marcotte Ford as selling the most Ford Energi vehicles in the state. In addition to the MOR-EV rebate, these vehicles are also eligible for state tax benefits to Massachusetts residents.\n\"Our dealership sells or leases about a dozen Energi brand vehicles per month,\" said Mike Marcotte, President of Marcotte Ford. \"As a third generation Ford dealer with more than 50 years in the Holyoke community, I'm especially proud to be the number one seller of these eco-friendly cars among my statewide peers.\"\nMarcotte adds that Energi vehicles have the potential to use no gasoline for low-speed, in-town driving with a 20-mile range on a single overnight charge. A typical seven-hour charge can be quickened using a 2.5-hour high-speed charger found in nearby public places, like the Holyoke Mall, or specially installed in one's home. Typical travel distance on a single gasoline fill-up is over a thousand miles in conjunction with work or home battery charging. An average 100 miles per gallon is possible under this arrangement.\nMarcotte Ford says that Energi vehicles have lower maintenance costs than traditional gasoline-only cars. The Ford dealer employs specially trained Energi vehicle technicians for regular maintenance and repairs. Oil changes are fewer and brake pads receive less wear due to a newly developed Ford braking feature called hydraulic power assist. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, the vehicle's kinetic energy powers a special pump that helps slow it to a stop. At the same time, the car's kinetic energy, or momentum, is regenerated into electricity that recharges the onboard battery.\nMarcotte Ford is located at 1025 Main St. in Holyoke, MA 01040. The dealership can be contacted at (413) 536-1900 or http://marcotteford.com/ .\nMarcotte Ford is a third generation family business and Ford dealer serving Holyoke and Western Massachusetts with vehicles including the latest environmental, infotainment, and road performance technologies. They have an inventory of new and certified used vehicles, OEM parts, and commercial cargo vans and trucks. The dealership includes a comprehensive service center for routine maintenance and repairs that is open Monday - Thursday 6am - Midnight, Friday 6am - 5pm, and Saturday 7:30am - 1 pm.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/forddealership/holyoke/prweb13839059.htm\n ",

      "title": "Ford Sets Aggressive Goals For Water Savings",
      "text": "  \nIf you were asked to name the resources that go into car manufacturing, obvious answers may include things such as energy, steel and plastics. These are all perfectly correct answers, of course, but perhaps a less obvious one might be water. Yet this increasingly scarce resource is nonetheless a vital part of the manufacturing process and is traditionally consumed in vast quantities during auto manufacture. \nBack in the early 2000s, Ford realized that while its team knew everything about the production process of building a car — for example, how many seconds it takes for someone to pick up a nut or a bolt, how long it takes to attach it to a vehicle and so on — what they didn’t know much about was how much water was consumed in the manufacturing process. “We just had a water bill,” says Andy Hobbs, director of Ford’s Environmental Quality Office. \nThat bill was big though. And at the turn of the millennium, Ford knew it would be a huge issue going forward, prompting the automaker to focus on developing improved manufacturing techniques that would bring about significant water savings. The result? Ford saved 10.6 billion gallons of water between 2000 and 2015. \nOver that 15-year period, Hobbs explains, “It has been a huge cost avoidance, as opposed to a huge cost savings.” By which he means despite having saved billions of gallons of water, the price of water has become much higher — resulting in a cost-neutral position to the company’s production. Nevertheless, such cost avoidance more than justifies the ongoing business case of saving water. \nAs a result, Ford is extending its commitment by setting a goal to reduce water consumption by a further 30 percent by 2020; this translates to a 72 percent reduction in water use per vehicle as compared with 2000 . \nOn top of that, Hobbs says, going forward the automaker is “looking to definitely not use potable water in manufacturing.” This is important because Ford builds vehicles in certain water-stressed locations, such as Mexico. There, access to fresh water might mean dropping a well 1,800 feet. And if that water is used to build cars, it deprives fresh water to local communities, Hobbs explains. \nSo, what are the chief uses of water in the process of building cars? \nNo. 1 is the paint shop. In order to get a pristine paint finish on a vehicle, car bodies must be perfectly cleaned in vast baths of chemical-infused water to eradicate any contamination. Following that, yet more water is consumed during the spraying phase as residues are collected in “overspray baths.” \nThe solution? Firstly, Ford made gains by reducing water use and recycling water more efficiently in the paint shop through an innovation the company calls a “three-wet” painting process. In basic terms, this allows Ford to prime, apply a base coat, apply a clear coat and then bake a vehicle body all within the same booth, rather than moving it through a series of separate ones — thereby saving water in the process. \nParts machining also requires water. Traditionally, as metal parts are cut to make various components, machine-tool heads are flooded with a milky-colored, water-based emulsion — which both lubricates and cools the metal as parts are fabricated. Rather than “flood” the cutting tools with fluids, Ford now uses a process it calls “minimum quantity lubrication,” which involves injecting a small amount of lubricant on the tool head. Hobbs says this innovation made Ford “light years ahead in terms of installing and managing that process” compared with its competitors. \nThe result of improvements in theses two processes alone saves hundreds of thousands of gallons of water a year. \nFord also addressed water efficiency in its manufacturing plants’ cooling systems. Factories typically use cooling towers to create evaporative cooling — a system that might require a throughput of water of up to 50 gallons of water per minute. \nCooling is required for things such as as temperature control during the welding process, but ranges to include things such as “comfort cooling” for workers on the production line in certain facilities too. The company has outsourced this process to a third party. And by improvements in the water recycling process in these cooling systems, and monitoring leaks and other inefficiencies, the company has become a leader in water reduction in cooling technologies. \nAs well as having the goal of using non-potable water, Ford ultimately wants to achieve “zero water withdrawal” in all its manufacturing locations. This will be achieved by recycling water in its facilities and innovating new technologies such as those described above, but also by increasing the use of grey-water feeds from municipalities in which the company does business. Ford already takes grey-water, otherwise unfit for human consumption, in some of its manufacturing locations today. \nThe net effect of all this is that at Ford’s most efficient facilities, water use is down to about one cubic meter per vehicle. To put that in perspective, that’s roughly the same as you taking a five-minute power shower each day for a couple of weeks. \nThough Hobbs says Ford does none of this to receive plaudits, the company is nonetheless proud to announce that it received last week, for the second consecutive year, an ‘A’ rating for its actions to conserve water from the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project). Ford said it is the only North American company to earn the agency’s highest honor for corporate water stewardship. \nGoing forward, Hobbs emphasizes the business case for Ford’s efforts in water reduction saying, “I believe this is a real integration of great environmental practice with great business decisions, with great performance financially and for our shareholders, and that’s not going to change.” \nImage provided by courtesy of Ford Motor Co.",

      "text": "  \nThe 2018 Ford Mustang will lose its V-6 engine option, according to dealer information obtained by Mustang6g . The writing has been on the wall for the 3.7-liter V-6, and now it appears Ford is officially making the turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost I-4 the Mustang’s base engine. \nA user on the Mustang6g forums posted the info, which comes from Ford’s ordering system. According to the user, the V-6 Mustang’s body code comes up as invalid in the system, suggesting it has been discontinued. This shouldn’t come as a huge surprise as the V-6 received very few changes when the 2015 Mustang debuted, and hasn’t received updates in the years since. The 3.7-liter V-6 currently makes 300 hp and 280 lb-ft of torque. That’s down from the 2.3-liter EcoBoost, which Ford has positioned as the upgrade engine with its 310 hp and 320 lb-ft. \nThe 10-speed automatic transmission again appears on the options list. That transmission, which was jointly developed by Ford and GM, will also be used on the 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 , Ford F-150 Raptor, and F-150 3.5 EcoBoost models . Another interesting tidbit is that the new Mustang can be equipped with the MagneRide magnetorheological dampers of the Shelby GT350. Also interesting is the appearance of a “Performance Package 2,” which comes in addition to the existing GT Performance Package. There are no details on what this package includes, but it could be Ford’s answer to the Chevy Camaro’s high-performance 1LE package . \nNew colors include Orange Fury, Royal Crimson, and Kona Blue. Sadly, Grabber Blue, which returned just last year, is no more. \nA Ford spokesman was unable to confirm the info, saying only that there will be more news on the 2018 Ford Mustang closer to launch. \nCheck out the full ordering guide over at Mustang6g to see what could be in store for the refreshed pony car .",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe sixth-generation Ford Mustang will receive a series of mechanical and visual updates for the 2018 model year. The Blue Oval is remaining tight-lipped about what the future holds, but leaked documents uncovered by ‘Stang enthusiasts give us a better idea of what to expect. \nThe biggest change to the Mustang lineup for 2018 is that the V6 engine will no longer be available, according to website Mustang6G . The naturally aspirated 3.7-liter six develops 300 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 280 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. It’s overshadowed by the turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder, a unit that develops 310 horses and 320 pound-feet of twist. \nThe decision to deep-six the V6 will upset some Mustang enthusiasts. Those who don’t like the idea of a pony car with a turbo four under the hood will need to step up to the GT model, which will continue to offer a powerful V8. The Shelby GT350 is expected to stick around for at least one additional model year, and earlier rumors claim the range-topping GT500 will return with up to 800 horsepower on tap. Dodge’s vaunted Challenger Hellcat might not be the most powerful muscle car on the block for long. \nMore: Looking back at five models that made the Ford Mustang the icon it is today \nFord will expand the list of extra-cost options with a 10-speed automatic transmission, a dual exhaust system with four exhaust tips, and an adaptive suspension named MagneRide borrowed from aforementioned GT350. The leaked documents also reveal the launch of a new option package named Performance Package 2, though they don’t shed insight into what it includes. Mustang6G believes it will include track-sourced components needed to help the Mustang fight head-to-head against the Chevrolet Camaro 1LE . \nAs is typically the case, the mechanical upgrades will be joined by a handful of visual tweaks. Expect the redesign to include new lights and redesigned bumpers on both ends, new-look alloy wheels, and two additional paint colors named orange fury and royal crimson, respectively. \nThe 2018 Ford Mustang could debut either in January during the Detroit Auto Show or in April at the New York Auto Show. It will go on sale shortly after its official introduction. Also watch: Superformance Ford GT40 MkII Review",

      "text": "2018 Mustang Tipped for 10-speed Auto and no V6 12:34 pm By Shane McGlaun \nIn recent years Ford hasn’t been one to let its Mustang get stale in the looks department. While the new Mustang has only been around a few model years, it’s getting an update for the 2018 model. All we have seen so far are heavily camouflaged version and the indication is new taillights and headlights. \nSome new details on other options that will be coign for the 2018 model have turned up thanks to a dealership employee with some time on their hands. For 2018 the Mustang will reportedly get a 10-speed automatic, which should help in the fuel economy department. No word on if that 10-speed will be a paddle shifted option. \nOne notable loss is that there is no V6 engine offered, the EcoBoost four and V8 are the only options listed. A Performance Pack 2 is listed, but what that has we don’t know. Dual outlet active exhaust is also tipped as an option. Grabber Blue is discontinued, but Orange Fury and Royal Crimson are new colors and the car will get optional MagneRide dampers. It also appears that the Shelby GT350 will carry over and be available in 2018.",

Smith University, both of which are receiving funds to implement their community-focused projects\n- Now in its fourth year, the challenge has donated $400,000 in scholarships, grants and implementation funds\nDEARBORN, Mich. , Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Four architectural students from Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Texas , won top honors at the 2016 Ford Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge with a software app that enables homeowners to monitor water and energy use in real-time. The innovative app, which helps homeowners adjust their utility use and save money, earned the students $75,000 in scholarships, grants and implementation funds.\nSecond place and $15,000 was awarded to a team from Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia . Hampton students developed a program that tracks sea levels for communities at risk of flooding. Students from Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina , took third place and $10,000 for a project that raises freshwater fish for consumption in local homes. Each team member also received an iPad.\n\"We received numerous outstanding entries from Historically Black Colleges and Universities across the country,\" said Pamela Alexander , director of community development, Ford Motor Company Fund. \"Although selecting the three winners was extremely difficult, we're proud the challenge encouraged all of the students to think about how they can support their communities.\"\nNow in its fourth year, the Ford Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge is modeled after the Ford College Community Challenge, a signature Ford Fund program that challenges students globally to design innovative projects that address critical sustainability needs in their communities. To date, the program has awarded $400,000 in scholarships, grants and implementation funds.\nRaj Register, Ford manager for multicultural communications, said teaming up with Historically Black Colleges and Universities on a program with positive, far-reaching community impact is a natural move for an innovation leader like Ford.\n\"Ford is proud to support Historically Black Colleges and Universities with this unique program showcasing such talented and pioneering students,\" she said.\nFord's Historically Black Colleges and Universities Community Challenge is jointly supported by Ford marketing and Ford Fund, the company's philanthropic arm, with participation from national radio personality and longtime booster Tom Joyner . In addition to Alexander and Joyner, other judges include Henry Ford III , Ford Performance global marketing manager; and Burt Jordan , Ford vice president, global vehicle and powertrain purchasing and supplier diversity.\nFord has long been a supporter of diverse communities, with a particular focus on education.

      "text": "Real - Time X-Ray Inspection - A Non - Destructive Examination Technique Used by Ford \nWithin the material composition, long stainless steel fibres increase shielding effectiveness, which ranges from 44 to 71 dB depending on the frequency. In addition, glass fibre reinforcement helps to enhance mechanical strength. Its tensile strength at break, for example, is 89 MPa. \nAmong the applications set to benefit are housings for automotive electronics, motors and sensors, along with connector bodies, infotainment enclosures and handheld devices for military and industrial metering tasks. Life science enclosures, telecoms equipment and IT rack/server components are further target applications. \nSignificantly for the moulding process, the advanced processing of PBT-225 into a single pellet composition permits even material dispersion and a tightly controlled conductive material ratio across complex geometries, delivering a matrix of polymer and conductive filler. The inconsistent mix ratio issues associated with multi-pellet blends are therefore eliminated, along with the time required for weighing and mixing. Improved pellet integrity with no harmful agglomerations helps optimise material conveyance. \nThe company adds that it is able to combine components moulded in the material with other technologies from its range – for example, sealing and RF blocking gaskets, and gel materials with thermal properties – to offer a complete packaging solution.",

      "text": "The animated film Moana , with music by Lin Manuel Miranda, and starring the incredible Dwayne Johnson, is out this week. I’ll probably see it, just like I’ve been seeing two movies a weekend in the theater ever since the election. ( Fantastic Beasts and Arrival were excellent. Dr. Strange was good too.) The escapism bounce is real and instead of buying useless stuff people are actively seeking entertainment. I bet that more people will give to charity this year instead of buying as many gifts as well. \nWe’ve had a somewhat delightful press tour from Sexiest Man Alive Dwayne The Rock Johnson. It’s been really nice to hear him talk about his humble beginnings, and to learn what a hard worker he is, all while he’s genuinely grateful for his success. There’s a new interview with him in the LA Times and I was particularly touched by the detail that he has his truck sent to him on every film location, just so it’s familiar to him and he can drive himself around. Yes it’s probably expensive but he’s a huge box office draw and in the scheme of celebrity requests it’s practically quaint. He likes to drive himself, he likes his big ‘ol truck because some vehicles feel confining to him (he’s 6’5″) and he will admit that’s a little neurotic. He’s also still managed by his first wife, something I’ve heard before but didn’t realize was still happening and she speaks very highly of him and his career in this piece. Oh and he’s always checking social media because he wants to stay in touch with fans. \nWhy he devotes so much time to social media \n“I’m on everything all day. I’m doing my best. Because here’s the thing. When I was wrestling in flea markets and fairs and used car dealerships in front of 150 people, getting paid $40 a night, I developed a skill to listen. When those 150 people would respond to something, it was like, ‘Let’s go in that direction more.’ I think developing that has helped me.” \nHe stands by his “candy asses” post even though he got flack for it \n“I was very clear with what I said. I’ve been in the game a long time. “Would Universal [Pictures] have preferred that didn’t happen? Sure, we talked about it. The irony is after that and as they do their tracking and all their analysis, the interest shot through the roof to a whole other level.” \nHe loves his truck and gets it shipped to him \n“I like going to the gym. I like driving my pickup truck and maybe I don’t want to live in Hollywood. Maybe I want to live in Florida in the country… I get [my truck] shipped everywhere. Maybe I’ll get therapy one day for this, but there’s nothing that brings me joy, like, ‘I’m gonna go buy this yacht or Ferrari.’ But my truck is jacked up. There’s an 8-inch lift on it, it has big country tires on it — I call it brown neck. That’s my thing. I’m not into sports cars. I can’t fit into them. And I can’t have people drive me. I don’t like service that way. Maybe I’ll get therapy for that too.\n[From The LA Times] \nI guess that Johnson’s truck is recognizable too, because he doesn’t switch it up at all and drives it everywhere. Where I live in the south you can’t throw a rock without hitting a big truck like this, they’re really popular. He likes to be accessible to fans and the truck probably helps. In fact last year he shared the sweetest story about three little girls waiting for him for three hours with signs on the side of the road. He stopped and took photos with them and then post the story on social media, because that’s just the kind of guy he is. \nAs for the “candy ass” post, where he called out a Fast coworker, widely assumed to be Vin Diesel, he later staged a wrestling match with Diesel , leading many people to think the post was a put-on. I think they’re both just savvy about marketing and decided to make it seem like Vin was in on it after the fact. \nOld Glory's landed and my pick up's waitin'. So grateful for the one day I got to spend with my family today. Recharge I needed. Great for soul. Let's get back to work. #SweatEquity 👊🏾 \nA photo posted by therock (@therock) on Aug 14, 2016 at 5:52pm PDT \n\n\n\n\nphotos credit: FameFlynet and Pacific Coast News \n« Previous Post",

      "title": "2018 Ford Mustang Reportedly Killing V6, 10-Speed Auto, Performance Packs Coming",
      "text": "2018 Ford Mustang Reportedly Killing V6, 10-Speed Auto, Performance Packs Coming 22 Nov 2016, 10:28   Rumors You might have noticed Ford has been dropping plenty of Mustang EcoBoost goodies for the current S550 pony and, turbo-four love aside, there seems to be another reason for this tech reinforcement - the V6 is reportedly being put to sleep. With the 2018 Mustang currently in the works, it seems the dealership order guides for the iconic Blue Oval model have leaked, announcing a number of important changes. The tech details, which come to us thanks to the Mustang6G forum, also reveal plenty of goodies are coming our way. It all starts with the ten-speed automatic gearbox and since Ford and GM have joined hands to develop this tranny, it's only normal for the Mustang to mirror the sixth-gen Camaro on this front. The Blue Oval is also sourcing the fresh hardware from inside the current Mustang line-up, as the Shelby GT350's adaptive MagneRide dampers are set to be spread throughout the line-up, albeit possibly with a different tune. Then we have the Performance Package 2, a development that should join the current Performance Packages being offered for the current EcoBoost and GT 'Stangs. This could be Ford's response to the track-destined 1LE package of the Camaro, which has scored impressive results in terms of lap times. There's no reason to cry over the demise of the V6 Mustang, which seems like a leftover, delivering inferior performance to the turbo-four model. However, it's worth noting that Chevrolet introduced the 1LE package for the V6 Camaro alongside the one destined for the V8-animated model, following customer demand. GM has a different strategy for the Camaro line-up, as the naturally aspirated V6 is noticeably superior to the 2.0-liter turbo in terms of power, while the two are close in terms of the peak torque. Returning to the 2018 Ford Mustang, the leaked details also talk about a Dual Exhaust option, once again something that seems to follow the dual-mode exhaust of the Shelby GT350 . Then we have a Carbon Sport Package, which should bring a touch of the wonder material to the pony. With previous reports talking about the 2018 model year potentially bringing us the new Shelby GT500 forced-fed demon, we're already rubbing our hands in excitement for the unveiling of the Ford hero. Meanwhile, you can check out the spyshots of the 2018 Mustang in the image gallery to your right.",

      "title": "Marcotte Ford Named Leading Dealer of Ford's Energi Vehicles in Massachusetts",
      "text": "Marcotte Ford announces that they are the number one Ford Energi Dealership in Massachusetts for Energi vehicles sold or leased under the Ford brand. This includes the Fusion Energi, Focus Electric, and C-Max Energi . In-state residents who purchase or lease these vehicles can receive a $1,500 upfront rebate for Energi vehicles and up to $2,500 for electric vehicles from the Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles (MOR-EV) program. In conducting the program, MOR-EV also maintains statewide records about the adoption and use of such vehicles. These statistics identify Marcotte Ford as selling the most Ford Energi vehicles in the state. In addition to the MOR-EV rebate, these vehicles are also eligible for state tax benefits to Massachusetts residents.\n\"Our dealership sells or leases about a dozen Energi brand vehicles per month,\" said Mike Marcotte, President of Marcotte Ford. \"As a third generation Ford dealer with more than 50 years in the Holyoke community, I'm especially proud to be the number one seller of these eco-friendly cars among my statewide peers.\"\nMarcotte adds that Energi vehicles have the potential to use no gasoline for low-speed, in-town driving with a 20-mile range on a single overnight charge. A typical seven-hour charge can be quickened using a 2.5-hour high-speed charger found in nearby public places, like the Holyoke Mall, or specially installed in one's home. Typical travel distance on a single gasoline fill-up is over a thousand miles in conjunction with work or home battery charging. An average 100 miles per gallon is possible under this arrangement.\nMarcotte Ford says that Energi vehicles have lower maintenance costs than traditional gasoline-only cars. The Ford dealer employs specially trained Energi vehicle technicians for regular maintenance and repairs. Oil changes are fewer and brake pads receive less wear due to a newly developed Ford braking feature called hydraulic power assist. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, the vehicle's kinetic energy powers a special pump that helps slow it to a stop. At the same time, the car's kinetic energy, or momentum, is regenerated into electricity that recharges the onboard battery.\nMarcotte Ford is located at 1025 Main St. in Holyoke, MA 01040. The dealership can be contacted at (413) 536-1900 or http://marcotteford.com/ .\nMarcotte Ford is a third generation family business and Ford dealer serving Holyoke and Western Massachusetts with vehicles including the latest environmental, infotainment, and road performance technologies. They have an inventory of new and certified used vehicles, OEM parts, and commercial cargo vans and trucks. The dealership includes a comprehensive service center for routine maintenance and repairs that is open Monday - Thursday 6am - Midnight, Friday 6am - 5pm, and Saturday 7:30am - 1 pm.",

      "title": "With city plan, future of St. Paul Ford site begins to emerge",
      "text": "By Peter Callaghan | 10:07 am City of St. Paul A broader image of the Ford site in relation to Minneapolis and the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. A master developer likely won’t be chosen until 2020, and construction won’t begin until 2021, but after 10 years of talking and meeting and planning, St. Paul finally has its first glimpse of what the former Ford plant site will look like when it grows up. With the appropriately bureaucratic title of the “ Zoning and Public Realm Plan ,” the City of St. Paul released a document last week showing where streets, parks and open space might be placed inside the 135-acre site on the Mississippi River. It also details which sections of the property, which is still owned by the Ford Motor Company, will be set aside for commercial offices, mixed use, multi-family residential and even “mansion-style units” along Mississippi River Boulevard. As created by St. Paul planners — after numerous studies and dozens of community meetings — the document centers on an interactive centralized stormwater collection and retention system. Rain and snow collected on the property would be directed toward a large water feature edged with trails and green space. The collected water would flow toward Hidden Falls before reaching the Mississippi. Unveiled at a public meeting, the plan now enters into the public input phase. After the public comment period, it will be revised and then reviewed and likely approved by the St. Paul Planning Commission before reaching the city council next summer. “Somebody asked me, ‘What do you want from the Ford site,’” Mayor Chris Coleman said during a rollout of the plan last week at St. Thomas University. “I said, ‘I want everything. I want this to be our everything.’” Ford announced in 2005 that the plant, formally known as the Twin Cities Assembly Plant, would be closed. The final vehicles from the plant were assembled in 2011, and it thereafter became one of the 267 auto-related factories closed in the United States between 1979 and 2011. But the St. Paul Ford site has advantages many of those shuttered facilities didn't. Rather than being in an industrial area, for one, the Ford site sits on the bluffs near the Mississippi River, where it has come to be surrounded by residential neighborhoods, including some of the most affluent in St. Paul. As Coleman frequently points out, the site is equally close to downtown St. Paul, downtown Minneapolis and, via the Ford Avenue Bridge, the Minneapolis-St.Paul International airport. “This is gonna be the center of the future of the Twin Cities if we do this right,” he said. Ford has retained ownership of the land, and is overseeing site clearing and cleaning up environmental damage from assembly operations. The company then intends to put the entire site on the market next year in hopes of finding a master developer who will take on the massive project. That developer’s work will be guided by city zoning and infrastructure plans, but Ford has expressed support for the types of uses the city wants for the site — low-to-medium-rise residential and commercial development. City of St. Paul The Ford Plant shown in a photo from 2007. Planners estimated that once built-out, the site would be home to as many as 4,000 residential units and 1,500 jobs. Those densities are needed not only to attract the restaurants and retail amenities that urban residents want, but to give Ford a return on the investment it’s making in demolition, environmental cleanup and site preparation. “The demand will be strong if the neighborhood is strong,” Coleman said. Added City Council Member Chris Tolbert: “You need density if you want open space.” The plan foresees about 63 of the 135 acres being developable. Of the remaining acreage, 33 acres would be taken up with transportation infrastructure, nine acres for stormwater management, 15 acres for parks and open space and 15 acres for “recreational fields,” which refers to a city promise to allow the private groups that currently operate baseball and softball fields on Ford property to continue to do so. Building heights would be lowest nearest the river and gradually increase the further property is from the river. That fits in with the Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area plan, which does not favor buildings causing a visual impact on views from the river. How flexible is the plan? Must the master developer follow this exact plan? That is, can they only build what the zoning plan lays out? The city expects to build the streets and stormwater infrastructure, so it has a lot of say over where that is placed on the site. And the zoning would be binding on any developer. But Merritt Clapp-Smith, the principal planner for the City of St. Paul, said the city expects to be flexible to allow a developer to shape the eventual build out. “One of our partners from Michigan said, ‘You’re not gonna take all the fun away,’” Clapp-Smith said about showing Ford the plans. “Someone who comes in is still gonna want some fun and have some great ideas.” City of St. Paul Proposed stormwater zones. “What you see here looks kind of concrete,” she said. “But within all of it there’s so much flexibility left in terms of how each block can develop and styles. And you can do different things with heights.” Left undecided is how the city would pay for the infrastructure. There are no roads through the site now, no sidewalks, no streetlights, no trails, no stormwater management system. And while the city expects tax revenues to increase greatly as the property is redeveloped, it has not decided whether some form of tax increment financing will be used to cover up-front costs. Transportation plan also released For all of the site’s pluses, access to regional transportation infrastructure is not one of them. It does have quick access to the airport, but cars and buses must move through residential neighborhoods to get to Interstate 94 and Interstate 35E. That has made neighbors anxious that whatever is built at the site will add to traffic congestion. Those concerns have led city planners to emphasize alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles, asking consultants to look for ways to enhance transit, bike riding and walking in the area. In fact, part of the direction given transportation consultant Nelson Nygaard is to “rely on 21st century transportation planning principles to create a new place.” To encourage such alternatives, a city transportation plan — also unveiled last week — calls for streets and roads within the Ford site to accommodate cars but not encourage driving at the expense of transit, biking and walking. Many pathways will be solely for walking and biking. Surface parking lots will be minimal and parking would likely be in ramps that serve multiple buildings. City of St. Paul Proposed residential and business use for the former Ford Plant site. While there needs to be improvements in the surrounding neighborhoods at key intersections for cars and along off-site streets to better accommodate bikes and walkers (most get poor grades now), the city plan calls for no new traffic lanes in the area. The roads and lanes within the site will mostly follow the grid pattern that grew over the years in the neighborhoods to the north and east. St. Paul doesn’t control the quality and quantity of mass transit around and through the site, however, though it does expect that roadways will be designed to accommodate it. Metro Transit routed its first arterial bus rapid transit line along Ford Parkway and there is a chance that the Riverview Corridor light rail transit line could pass through the site as well. The Canadian Pacific railyard, adjacent to the Ford property, could also be used to bring light rail to the site before it crosses the river on its way to the airport.",

      "text": " 07am CST | by M. Affan , in News | Cars & Vehicles Ford's auto park features are gradually improving with each model update. Credit: AutoCar Ford to slowly introduce new driverless tech in new car models The automaker will slowly introduce new tech before launching a fully-fledged autonomous car in 2021 \nFord has announced its plan to gradually equip its new cars with driver assisting technology. The initiative is a step forward for Ford to make its fully autonomous car by the year 2021. Until then Ford will equip its car little by little with autonomous parts. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart \nThe announcement came from Ford’s marketing director in Britain; Lisa Brankin at the Ford's Driving Skills For Life event at London’s Excel. \nWhile speaking to Autocar , Brankin revealed their incremental approach to driverless technology would safeguard their future. The approach would also keep Ford relevant to market demand. \nBrankin further stated fully autonomous cars which are capable of driving from door-to-door without any input are not a near possibility. For such cars to come on the roads it will at least take another decade. \nBesides autonomous tech can’t come into the market all at once but it will come gradually. Therefore Ford is working towards adding driverless tech like Active Park Assist and Lane Keep to their car. \nThis move also reflects Ford’s step-by-step approach. More autonomous systems will become available further down model ranges. With each addition the technology will also keep on getting better. \nBrankin also hinted at the possibility of a semi-driverless car by Ford before their promised year of 2021. \nEarlier in November Ford Company revealed an all-new auto braking technology. The auto brakes work using reverse cameras. Ford stated the breaking system will be available in Ford cars within two year. \nThe brakes will be able to apply brakes to avoid impacts not seen by the driver while reversing. Ford is also working on an evasive steering technology, which will swerve the car around road hazards. You May Like",

He assumed that like many, the cost of their medications had doubled or tripled, he told KTVI . \nThey had not been able to pay several $95 a month payments, The Sun Herald reported . \nThe Kippings said they only used the car to go to the doctors, drug store and grocery stores and Ford had to take the car away. \nHe only drove a block from the Kipping's home when he pulled over to call the bank, asking how much would it cost to make the payments up to date. \nFord then set up a GoFundMe page to help pay off the car. Within eight hours, most of the money had been raised and Ford is still getting requests to help out the couple. ",
