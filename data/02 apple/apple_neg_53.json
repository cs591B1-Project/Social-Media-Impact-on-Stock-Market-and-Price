      "text": "Washington: Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on US regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company’s most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The November 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation.\n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote.\n“Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” Since software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nPotential applications \nApple’s letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” he said.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars.\nChief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nSpeculation \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.",

      "text": "An Apple fan just saved you $300 (Apple Book not included) Published by Mashable on Sun, 04 Dec 2016 Some made fun of Apple's attempt at self reflection with its debut of the Apple Book, a minimalist photo book showing off the company's product design history. The punch line' The paper book about Apple's often expensive products costs $300.Despite the $300 price tag for what amounts to a catalog, some Apple fans rushed to snag the book. One in particular (see video below) had the predictable yet brilliant idea of showing off many of the real life products next to the images of the products in the book.SEE ALSO: Stephen Colbert gives the Apple Book the spoof it deservesIf you have even a glimmer of an Apple fan in you, you'll watch the entire video. And it's a great video, worthy of Apple's tradition of marketing-driven aspirational warmth meets cold design precision. It even takes a shot at the \"trashcan\" Mac Pro, delivering some authentic Mac fan pride via video editorializing. Read more...More about Youtube, Apple Book, Apple, and Tech",

Photo: eNCA \nSAN FRANCISCO, US - Apple has revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars. \nThe company is \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Apple said in a November 22 letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offering Apple's opinion about draft regulations for the sector. \n\"Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously,\" the company's director of product integrity Steve Kenner wrote. \nApple issued the letter because it is \"investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\" \nRumors about Apple's ambitions in the sector have circulated for years. \nThe company has a separate organization called \"Project Titan\" that is developing automotive projects. \nAlthough Apple has never officially confirmed the project, several of CEO Tim Cook's comments have fueled speculation. \nAfter a $1 billion investment in a Chinese ride-hailing service called Didi Chuxing, he spoke of \"some strategic things that the companies can do together over time.\" \nHowever, in early September, The New York Times reported that the group had narrowed its ambitions, laying off dozens of staff as part of the project's \"reboot.\" \nInstead of designing and producing a complete self-driving car, the group will now concentrate on developing underlying technologies for autonomous vehicles. \nIn its letter, Apple urges the NHTSA not to penalize new participants in the sector by restricting the testing of cars under development on public roads, for which established automakers generally have exemptions. \n\"To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,\" it says. \nApple also encourages data sharing, particularly for accidents, saying that would enable the industry to \"build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone.\" \nMost major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020.

      "text": "Share View photos The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland November 22, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. A five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" Since software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. Some analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. Apple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said. In September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. But Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. Other companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. Apple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. Apple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. An auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.

That said, a small number of users report seeing similar problems with Apple's own Photos app \". I don't see the words \"AMD\" or \"Radeon\" anywhere there, but I do see the words \"third-party\" and \"Apple's own Photos app\", though. \nIn my article titled ' Apple can't launch high-end MacBook Pros without issues ', I said: \" There were issues with the new 15-inch MBP that sports AMD's new Radeon Pro 400 series graphics, with people taking to the MacRumor forums to complain about their problems. But there are a lot of people with 13-inch MacBook Pros that are experiencing issues, and there is no AMD hardware inside of those models - that's all an all-Intel MacBook Pro, with the same issues the model with the Radeon Pro 400 series graphics has \". \nI slam dunked the issue, finishing the article off with: \" The issue here is that Apple, a company that prides itself on being courageous for removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and is meant to be the top of the pyramid when it comes to their quality products. So much so, that Apple even has a $300 book on its amazing designs, yet its new $4000+ laptop was shipped with major issues resulting in thousands of people complaining about issues on their new laptops \". \nWe should have proper confirmation in the next few days, as I'm sure Apple is scrambling to write a press release about it.",

      "title": "Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race - Livemint",
      "text": "Washington: Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on US regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company’s most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The 22 November letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation.\n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote.\n“Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience—to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.”\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.”\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nApple’s letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” he said.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since 1 September, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.

      "text": "Apple’s decision to charge $19 for a charger and then $19 for a cable to plug in has had the effect you’d expect on the world: everyone just buys knockoff chargers off Amazon instead.\nBut although most chargers you buy off the internet will work just fine most of the time, a series of recent tests have shown that there’s real danger to having a fake charger plugged in at home.\nDON’T MISS: Here comes the OLED iPhone 8\nThe independent UL laboratory ran a series of basic electrical safety tests on fake chargers bought online from stores around the world. The results weren’t good: of the 400 counterfeit Apple chargers purchased, 397 failed a basic safety test conducted by the UL laboratory:\n“In total, we tested 400 adapters and the results were literally shocking. The overall failure rate exceeded 99 percent. All but three failed our basic safety tests and were fire and shock hazards. Twelve were so poorly designed and constructed that they posed a risk of lethal electrocution to the user. “\nSo that doesn’t mean the chargers will definitely shock you; rather, if a power surge hits your house, it’s likely to fry your phone at best, or cause a fire at worst.\nThis isn’t some kind of impossible bogeyman, either. We see pictures all the time of people who have been burned by faulty batteries or chargers while charging their smartphones overnight, and the Galaxy Note 7 debacle is a good reminder of how much damage a low-voltage electrical device can do.\nThe UK Trading Standards authority also examined second-hand chargers by looking in thrift stores and markets around London. Of 3,000 chargers tested, 15% were found to be unsafe in some way. On the plus side, that’s orders of magnitude better than a fake charger bought online; bad news, a 15% chance of electrical fire still isn’t “safe.”\nTo avoid buying a counterfeit charger or accessory, you might want to take a look at Apple’s guide to spotting fake products. The company has an entire support page dedicated to telling the difference between fake cables and the real thing. It’s also worth mentioning that there are two different standards to look for here. Apple produces and sells its own iPhone accessories, but it also certifies third-party accessories (although not the standard USB-to-Lightning cable!) under the “Made for iPhone” program. Under the terms of that agreement, manufacturers pay a licensing fee to Apple to use the Lightning port and Apple’s proprietary design and circuitry. That makes accessories more expensive, but it also makes them far more likely to work correctly.\nView photos\nimg_10122014_150204 More The MFi logo should be found on the packaging of any officially certified accessory, like battery chargers, cases, docks or speakers — basically, anything that attaches to your iPhone. There’s one exception to this, though — Apple doesn’t certify any USB-C to Lightning cables, so any of those with an “Made for iPhone” logo is guaranteed to be fake.\nAs for spotting counterfeit cables against the genuine Apple product, there’s plenty of details on Apple’s site.\n“An Apple Lightning to USB cable has “Designed by Apple in California” and either “Assembled in China,” “Assembled in Vietnam,” or “Indústria Brasileira” on the cable about seven inches from the USB connector. You’ll see a 12-digit serial number at the end of this text.”\nWhen it comes to the wall chargers themselves, the most important thing to look for are the UL and CE markings that those testing bodies put on devices, and to buy from a reasonably reputable source. You don’t have to buy the genuine, made-by-Apple product; just make sure you’re buying a charger that’s been appropriately tested, puts out 2.1A of current, and doesn’t have strange writing on the side.\nView photos\napple-counterfeit-lightning-cable More\nTrending right now:\nNES Classic and Hatchimals might actually be in stock at one store this weekend Apple says iPhone battery problem a result of too much air iOS 10.2 beta 5 is now available to download See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "print Apple CEO Tim Cook. AP \nApple may have stopped disclosing its overall advertising expenditure this year , but third-party data offers an interesting insight into how much it spends on digital ads — and how that compares to rival Samsung. \nData given exclusively to Business Insider by advertising intelligence and competitive tracking platform Pathmatics shows Apple spent $97 million on display, mobile, and video ads in the US in the year to November 30, 2016 — outspending Samsung's $80.4 million outlay. \nAnd if you exclude the Samsung products where Apple doesn't compete — like TVs, refrigerators, laundry, memory and business solutions — Apple outspent its rival by 179%. \nPathmatics works by using web crawlers to ping ads, identify formats, and work out how they were bought. The analysis only covers digital display and video ads — so it doesn't include social or search spend (the latter of which is where most brands spend the majority of their digital budgets). This data is also third-party and isn't independently verified by Samsung or Apple. \nHowever, it still offers a fascinating insight into how the pairs' spending racks up. \nPathmatics \nThe data also shows that Apple's total digital spend dropped by 16.3% year-on-year, whereas Samsung increased its budget by 49.2%. This appears to mirror Apple's 10-K , in which the company said its 1% decrease in selling, general, and administrative costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was \"was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs.\" \nHow Apple and Samsung spend their digital budgets online differs wildly, according to the Pathmatics data. \nMore than three quarters (76%) of Apple's digital ad spend went on digital ads, 22% went on desktop display, and just over 1% went on mobile. \nMeanwhile, Samsung leaned more heavily towards desktop, placing 73% of its overall spend there. Around a fifth (20%) of its budget went towards video and 7% went on mobile. \nDiving down further, the Pathmatics data shows that almost all of Apple's budget went towards direct deals with publishers, whereas Samsung opted to use third-party ad networks, exchanges, and trading desks too. Direct deals often come at a premium, which could be one reason why Apple is outspending Samsung. \nPathmatics \nGabe Gottlieb, CEO of Pathmatics, said: \"With 100% of Apple’s budget allocated to direct deals with publishers, it’s obvious brand integrity and ad safety is a key concern to one of the market’s biggest advertisers. Safe guarding your brand isn’t exclusively a burden for major spenders however, everyone from big retailers to small ecommerce operators need transparency to ensure their campaigns are being executed as promised.” \nThe chart below from Pathmatics shows how Apple and Samsung's digital ad spend varied month-on-month over the last year, according to the Pathmatics data. You can see a big peak from Apple in October ($22 million in that month alone), when it announced the new MacBook Pro and shortly after it began selling the iPhone 7 in mid-September. Both companies also splurged on digital ads in June. \nPathmatics ",

      "text": "Paris (AFP) - He changed technology and how the world communicates. Now, five years after he died, Apple founder Steve Jobs may be remembered in another way -- on a Paris street.\n\"Rue Steve Jobs\" is among names shortlisted for one of the new roads in the French capital's southeastern 13th arrondissement that will lead to a new incubator for hi-tech start-ups.\nThe tech titan's name was put forward by the district's socialist mayor who credited Jobs -- whose company altered the face of computing, revolutionised music with the iPod and launched the iPhone and iPad -- with \"changing our daily lives\".\nBut the mayor, Jerome Coumet, has faced a backlash from elected Communists, who in a statement said \"the reality of the legacy\" of Jobs was \"insufficient wages\" and \"forced overtime\" for Apple subcontractors.\nThey also hit out at what they alleged was the technology giant's \"use of illegal tax arrangements\" across the globe.\nCoumet said he was not seeking controversy. \"I wanted a name that speaks to as many people as possible,\" he said.\nAmong other suggestions was Alan Turing, in memory of the British mathematician and computer scientist whose wartime work allowed the allies to crack German codes and defeat Nazism.\nGrace Murray Hopper, an American computer scientist and former Navy rear admiral who pioneered coding, is also proposed.\nCurrently dubbed Station F, names for the start-up hub are to be discussed by Paris council officials in December, before it opens in March next year.",

      "title": "iPhone 8: Smartphone With An OLED Screen [New Rumors]",
      "text": "Flip \nThe latest word on the street indicates that Apple is now seriously considering releasing an OLED iPhone 8 in 2017. This has been the talk of the rumor mill for some time, with previous reports suggesting that Apple will enlist the assistance of its great rival Samsung in order to deliver this display technology. Image Credit: iDropNews OLED iPhone \nOLED Technology is significantly less greedy when it comes to power, and this would be a huge plus for the iPhone range in particular. Apple’s flagship is often been criticized for its paltry battery life , and the consumer electronics giant would undoubtedly welcome any measure which could improve the situation. \nIt seems that the OLED iPhone 8 could be just one of several releases made by Apple in 2017, and the more bog standard iPhone 8 devices may stick to traditional LCD displays. There have been suggestions that Apple will release three separate iPhone 8 handsets in September next year, with OLED being reserved for the premium of these three consumer options. \nMeanwhile, reports are also suggesting that Apple will seriously slim down the bezels in this OLED version of the iPhone 8 at least. Again, this is something that has been rumored for some time, and is considered a design priority for numerous smartphone manufacturers. There is no news on whether this bezel-light ethos will be limited to the premium OLED phone, but this would be another design parameter that would enable Apple to distinguish it from other versions of the iPhone 8. \nApple may also choose to integrate the Touch ID fingerprint button into the display itself when it unveils the OLED mobile. There have been suggestions that Apple could eliminate the Home button completely, after the company previously took the radical decision to eliminate the headphone jack from the iPhone series. iPhone 8’s curved screen \nIt seems that Apple is also considering including curved edges on both sides of the OLED release, finally delivering a curved screen display iPhone for the first time. This designer parameter has, of course, proved to be hugely successful for Samsung, with the Korean corporation having also utilized the technology in its range of premium television sets . \nAnalysts already believe that this new OLED iPhone 8 will be the most popular new smartphone to be released in 2017, and there is more positive news with regard to projected sales figures. Apple could be on line at to generate record sales of the iPhone 8 in the second half of 2017, after the corporation predicted that sales figures will recede slightly in the current calendar year. \nMeanwhile, reports in Korea suggest that Apple is making serious preparations for the release of the iPhone 8, with the Korea Herald printing a story related to component suppliers for the iconic smartphone. It seems that companies involved in the Apple supply chain have already made the decision to increase supply ahead of the iPhone 8 handset, with the likes of Interflex and BH apparently ramping up production of flexible printed circuit boards. Samsung negotiations \nKorean Media outlets also suggest that Samsung Electro-Mechanics is in negotiations with Apple over supply of the same parts, and it is notable that these three companies are all Samsung Display suppliers. The Korea Herald goes on to suggest that Samsung Display will indeed be the sole supplier of OLED screens when the iPhone 8 launches next year. \nMeanwhile, the first shipment of flexible printed boards is expected to take place in the second quarter of 2017, with providers set to deliver between 60 and 70 million parts in 2017 alone. It is expected that the components for the iPhone 8 will be assembled at a Samsung Display module plans located in Vietnam. \nIt is interesting that Apple seems to be making diversity the byword for the iPhone 8. Recent Wall Street Journal reports have indicated that Apple is testing several proposed designs for the release of the iPhone 8, and it could be that more than one of these turns up in the actual finished product. Apple is clearly hoping to deliver something spectacular and out of the ordinary with the iPhone 8 in order to acknowledge the 10-year anniversary of the vastly successful smartphone . S-generation days numbered \nAnother intriguing observation made by some analysts is that the iPhone 8 may represent the abandonment of the traditional Apple S-generation strategy. Over the last few years, the Californian corporation has opted to release S versions of the iPhone on a biannual basis. While these handsets have sold relatively well for the corporation, the fact remains that they are often rather uninspiring upgrades, as opposed to a genuine reworking of the iPhone concept. \nAnd thus many believe that the time has now come for Apple to abandon this alternation between major and minor updates to the iPhone range. This comes in a climate of the smartphone market receding significantly, with even the inordinately popular iPhone struggling to deliver year-on-year growth. It seems that Apple strategy from hereon in may instead focus on delivering a major iPhone upgrade on an annual basis. US factories \nAnother suggestion which has cropped up in the media recently with regard to the iPhone 8 is that it could be constructed, at least to some extent, in the United States. Newly elected President Trump has seemingly been in contact with Tim Cook at Apple, with a view to shifting some of the production for the iPhone 8 from China to the United States. \nWhile Trump has made rather a big deal out of this possibility, the reality is that it is much more likely to be rhetoric than any meaningful change in Apple policy. Apple relocated to Asia for several reasons, and none of those reasons has remotely changed. However, it is something that the manufacturer could consider as a possible public relations move, a figurative acknowledgement of the positive way this would be perceived by Americans. \nIn reality, the idea that Apple will seriously abandon the advantages it receives from constructing products in East Asia seems pretty laughable. So don’t expect an iPhone 8 to be built in the United States, but do expect it to go on sale in September with OLED displays",

      "text": "Apple Finally Hints At Self-Driving Car Plans  19 PST \nIt has long been rumored that Apple is working on a self-driving car and despite mounds of circumstantial evidence, the company hasn’t really come out and acknowledged that it’s working in this space. However, the company has finally dropped a hint in a letter it sent to regulators in the United States in which it provides feedback on proposed guidelines for new technology. \nAt one point it was believed that Apple is actually working on an all-electric self-driving car to rival the likes of Tesla. However, the effort codenamed Project Titan has been facing bumps in the road, with some top-level executives also giving up their positions. It seems there’s some trouble in paradise. \nRecent reports have suggested that Apple has now given up on the idea of making an actual electric car that can drive itself. The company is believed to be focusing on developing software for self-driving cars which it will be able to deploy with existing car manufacturers. \nIn a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Apple’s director of product integrity Steve Kenner writes that the company is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nThis goes to to show that while Apple might have convinced itself that developing an actual car is not the way to go, it’s willing to compete in this space by developing software that can enable cars to drive itself, but the company still needs to come out and say exactly that so that the public can really find out what it has been up to. It’s unclear how long Apple is going to do take in order to do just that. \nFiled in Apple > Transportation . Read more about apple car and self-driving cars . Related Articles",

      "text": "  4th,   0 December 4th,   \nApple’s on again, off again pas de deux with the world of automobiles is still alive. Tesla took a page from the Apple playbook when it created electric cars that are more like computers. Does Apple want to return the favor by using its expertise in computers to create electric cars? Elon Musk says the answer is yes and calls it the worst kept secret in Silicon Valley. But earlier this year, word filtered out that Apple has shut down its car making ambitions, which were known internally as Project Titan. Does that mean the company has totally withdrawn from the game? \n\nMaybe not. On November 22, Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, sent a 5 page letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The letter sad that Apple is excited about the potential for self driving transportation and ask U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of those vehicles. \n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. “Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” \nKenner’s letter urges NHTSA not to place too many restrictions on self driving car testing. In particular, it is concerned that companies like Tesla, Uber, and Google will gain an unfair advantage because they are years ahead of Apple in the development of self driving technology. “Established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,” Kenner says. \nTom Neumayr, a spokesperson for Apple, said in an e-mail that Kenner’s letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” he said. \nApple’s letter suggests that all companies involved in self driving research should share their data to move the process along faster but in a way that does not reveal trade secrets or confer a competitive advantage. Yeah, good luck with that, Apple. \nWhat’s the takeaway from all this? Based on all the backing and forthing by Apple during the past few years, an outside observer could be excused for thinking that leadership within the company is lacking. First it’s going to build electric cars, then it’s not . One day, it’s going to partner with McLaren Technology Group then the next day it’s not. Is Apple’s time as an innovator over? \nElon Musk once claimed that Tesla would match Apple’s $700 billion market capitalization some day. That’s a stretch, of course, but there is a possibility Apple’s valuation could evaporate if the company that was once an industry disruptor becomes just another in a long line of those who find themselves a day late and a dollar short when the next round of disruption begins. \nSource: Automotive News Photo credit: AutoBlog",

By Staff Writer Dec 04, 2016 09:12 AM EST Apple AirPods Advertisement \nCustomers who are anxiously waiting for the Apple AirPods need not have to wait any more as the product will be available to them within few weeks. an email conversation between a customer and Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed this news. \nThe customer asked for a release date, be it a month or 6 months, admitting that the delay in delivering the AirPods will force the customer to buy any other wireless headphone. The customer also complained that they're currently stuck on the EarPods, which can't be used when charging the iPhone 7. \nReplying to the email, Cook stated, \"Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay---we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks,\" via MacRumors . So, it can be pointed out that Apple's wireless earphones will be have release dates between December and January. \nApple AirPods were announced alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and originally, the device was scheduled to go on sale in October. But difficulties in the production process caused the device not being ready for the awaiting customers on time. \nFollowing its failure to release in October, Apple announced that it needed more time to perfect the device before selling them but did not mention any specific date. According to PhoneArena , these wireless headphones initially received criticism upon their announcement. \nBut as days went by, customers became more interested in the product than ever before and are waiting anxiously for them to be available. \nApple is heading towards a wireless future for their devices, iPhone 8 is already rumored to feature a completely wireless charging technology and now, the company is showcasing wireless headphones as well. \nCurrently, AirPods remain listed as both \"coming soon\" and \"currently unavailable\" on different sections of Apple's website and they are priced at $159.

      "title": "iOS 10 Activation Lock Bypass Discovered: Here’s How it Works",
      "text": "Since iOS 7, Apple has tried to discourage iPhone theft with its Activation Lock . This allows an owner to remotely lock their iPhone or iPad if misplaced, lost, or stolen. Additionally, anytime a thief tries to disable features like Find My iPhone or to Factory reset, an Apple ID is required. Meaning that if your handset or tablet is stolen, it can’t be wiped and resold. However, two researchers have found a way to bypass the iOS 10 Activation Lock , here’s what you need to know.\n\niOS 10 Activation Lock Bypassed Designed to be the best security software, the iOS 10 Activation Lock , has been bypassed using a previously unknown bug in Apple’s firmware.\nThe first report to reach the internet appeared on Sunday, November 27, 2016. And pointed towards an Indian security researcher named Hemanth Joseph. Apparently, he became interested in testing the iOS 10 Activation Lock after purchasing a locked iPad via Ebay.\nNow let’s be clear, there’s no indication that the initial attempt to break through Apple’s security layer was intentional. However, Hemanth was able to quickly bypass the security layer on the iPad and gain access to the Home Screen.\nImage Source: YouTube.com How was this Possible? One of the only things the iOS 10 activation lock allows a connection with is a local Wi-Fi Network. This also allows a potential thief to configure a Wi-Fi connection manually.\nHowever, when a username and password are entered, the system will require an Apple ID to continue. But, seeing as the iPhone or iPad is locked. It can’t cross reference the details on Apple’s server meaning that the iOS 10 Activation Lock is intact.\nUnfortunately, Hemanth discovered that he was able to fool the system by selecting “Other Network” from the Wi-Fi drop-down list. And then by entering an unusually long strings of characters in the WPA2-Enterprise “Name” , “Username” , and “Password” areas.\nHemanth claims that after entering the characters using this method the iPad’s screen froze. He then used an iPad Smart cover sold by Apple to place the iPad back to sleep. However, covers can switch an iPad on-and-off, and he did this while the device was experiencing the freezing error. Consequentially, Hemanth was able to bypass the iOS 10 Activation Lock and again access to the tablets Home Screen.\nHemanth also claimed that he reported this discovery to Apple on November 4, and Apple had said “it would investigate” . Discovered on iOS 10.1, Apple has supposedly fixed the problem with the release of iOS 10.1.1.\nAnother Security Breach Yes, you guessed correctly, Apple’s updated firmware iOS 10.1.1 has had its Activation Lock bypassed too. However, this time it comes from a German researcher called Benjamin Kunz Mejri. On Thursday, December 1, 2016, he posted a video to YouTube (see above) showing his bypass.\nWorking for the German company Vulnerability Lab , he has been able to create an iOS 10.1.1 exploit using the screen rotation lock and Night Shift mode. And again the entering of an excessively large amount of characters into the Wi-Fi form fields.\nWhile Apple works hard to keep its user’s devices safe, it seems that untested bugs do trip it up. So, seeing as this latest iOS 10 Activation Lock Bypass has been proven to work. It’s likely that the Cupertino-based tech giant will be working feverishly on a fix.\nDo you have an opinion, thoughts, or questions about the topic covered in this article? If you do, please share it with us via the comments section below.\nThe post iOS 10 Activation Lock Bypass Discovered: Here’s How it Works appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

Video: On the road in a driverless car \nFollowing years of speculation, the letter is the first time Apple has publicly acknowledged it has plans to develop self-driving cars. \n:: Supercar firm McLaren approached by Apple - but denies it is in talks \nThe company has an electric car project, codenamed Titan, which has been in the works for two years. \nIn September, the New York Times reported Apple had narrowed its ambitions and sacked dozens of employees as part of the project's \"reboot\". \nIt said those working on Titan would concentrate on developing underlying technologies for autonomous vehicles, rather than designing and producing a complete self-driving car. \nHowever, Apple has urged NHTSA not to penalise firms testing driverless cars on public roads. Video: Ford to mass produce driverless cars by 2021 \nMr Kenner wrote: \"To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nHe called on the US highways regulator to encourage data sharing between firms \"to build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone\". \nMr Kenner added: \"Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously.\" ",

      "text": "Apple reveals plans for self-driving car Dec 4, 2016 0 248 Apple has acknowledged for the first time that it is investing in building a self-driving car. In a letter to US transport regulators , Apple said it was “excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation”. The Italian-Romanian vehicle designer Liviu Tudoran has designed a car in the tradition of the Apple products: round, smooth, futuristic. \nIt added that there were “significant societal benefits of automated vehicles” to be realised. \nThere have long been rumours about the firm’s plans but it has not publicly admitted them. \nHowever, Ford, which itself plans to have self-driving cars on the road by 2021, has said it was working on the basis that Apple was building one. \nThe tech firm has already registered several car-related internet domains , including apple.car and apple.auto. Sharing data \nA company spokesman for Apple said that the letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was prompted by its “heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems” and that it wanted to help define best practices in the industry. \nThe five-page letter, written by Apple’s director of product integrity Steve Kenner, urges the regulator to not introduce too many rules on the testing of self-driving cars, saying that “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” \nIt also proposes that companies in the industry share data from crashes and near-misses in order to build a more comprehensive picture than one company could manage alone, and therefore enable the design of better systems. \nHowever, it adds that an individual’s privacy should not be compromised by the sharing of such data. It suggests that the industry and regulators “address privacy challenges associated with the collection, use, and sharing of automated vehicle data”, with collaboration from privacy experts outside the automotive industry. \nGoogle is already testing self-driving cars on the roads. In October, electric carmaker Tesla announced that all the cars it now builds will have the hardware installed to drive on their own. \nIn the UK, an autonomous vehicle was test-driven in Milton Keynes in the summer, with further trials in London planned.

Wolfe December 4, 2016 \nThe video streaming industry took some key steps forward in the last few days as DirecTV Now arrived and Apple’s TV app became closer to becoming a reality. Meanwhile, the smartwatch industry took a decidedly less positive turn on two fronts. Top News Stories Top News Stories \nExpect iOS 10.2, tvOS 10.1 very soon \nOn Friday, Dec. 2, Apple released the fifth iOS 10.2 to developers. With the iTunes Connect holiday shutdown set to begin on Dec. 23, expect new public versions of iOS 10 and tvOS 10 to arrive in the coming days. \nThe next-generation versions of both operating systems feature Apple’s new unifying TV app, which was first introduced in October . \nMeanwhile, the long-anticipated DirecTV Now service went online . Available for as little as $35 per month, the satellite-free video streaming service is available on Apple TV and other platforms including iOS and Roku.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Apple talks self-driving car regulation in letter to regulators Apple has never publicly confirmed Project Titan. However, a new letter from Apple to US regulators calls for fairness to new players in the self-driving car industry. | Topic: Innovation Apple CarPlay, Image: Ford \nApple in a November letter to US regulators publicly acknowledged work on autonomous vehicles for the first time, after years of reports surrounding Project Titan. Read this Read More \nSteve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, sent a five page letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, urging regulators not to impose too many restrictions on self-driving as the iPhone maker begins testing the technology. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \nApple argued regulation should be fair across the entire industry and that \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nApple also discussed how self-driving car data should be handled : \"Apple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses. Data should be sufficient to reconstruct the event, including time-series of vehicle kinematics and characteristics of the roadway and objects. By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone. This will allow everyone in the industry to design systems to better detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios.\" \nApple told Reuters in a statement: \"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\" \nIn the two years since rumors began of Apple's car plans, the secretive company has never confirmed Project Titan or its automobile intentions. \nAfter reports Project Titan was hitting snags, Bloomberg said in July Apple isn't abandoning its car efforts, but instead it's leaving the option open to partner with automakers while it focuses on the underlying technology.",

      "text": "30 Uses Of Apple Cider Vinegar You Need To Know About \nWhen I was a young girl, one of my abiding memories from childhood was my grandmother treating everything with apple cider vinegar.\nIt always seemed that, whenever anything went wrong, my grandmother would whip out her trusty bottle of apple cider vinegar and save the day. She called it her “magic potion” and convinced me that if she didn’t keep a bottle stocked all the time, things would go very wrong indeed.\nAs children, we can be either very trusting or very sceptical. And it wasn’t long before I decided that my grandmother was crazy.\n“It’s an old wives tales,” I told her as I get a bit older. “Apple cider vinegar doesn’t really work, grandma.”\nBut as I’ve gotten even older, I now know how very right she was.\nApple cider vinegar, which is made from apples (obviously, I know!), has been used over the centuries for many many things. People have used it to kill weeds, make pickles, polish their armour, dress salads, and even clean coffee makers.\nSounds amazing, right? A substance that can polish armour and dress a salad!!\nIts potency and versatility is largely down to its high content of minerals and vitamins, including calcium, potassium, copper, magnesium, vitamins A, B1, E and C. It’s also acidic, and helps your body to get the most out of the nutrients you consume.\nIf you’re wondering what things apple cider vinegar can do for you, here are 30:\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Control Your Blood Sugar Levels \nYou might be thinking “but my body already produces insulin, which regulates the amount of sugar in my blood. It’s got me covered. Why do I need any further help?”\nBecause insulin can’t do it all alone all the time. As recent times have shown us, too many of us are putting the wrong foods into our body which is leading to insulin resistance.\nApple cider vinegar can boost insulin sensitivity, and anyone who happens to already have insulin resistance is advise to take a drop of apple cider vinegar each time you eat a meal. All you need to do is mix a single tsp of the stuff with a glass of water.\nI recommend that you drink this up to 3 times each day, as it will help to better regulate your blood sugar levels.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Whiten Your Teeth \nThere are many reasons for off-white (or even yellow) teeth, and it’s down to your lifestyle choices. For example, coffee drinkers are more likely to have stained teeth, as are wine drinkers. There isn’t really anything to be embarrassed about, but just in case you are embarrassed, apple cider vinegar can save the day.\nUsing apple cider vinegar to whiten your teeth is a much cheaper alternative to the dentist. It kills the bacteria that is hanging around in your mouth, and removes stains.\nAll you need to do is drop a pinch of apple cider vinegar into your cup each morning before gargling just before you brush your teeth.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Be Mixed With Sparkling Water \nI’ve done this a few times, and if you love sparkling water too, you should definitely try it. Mixing apple cider vinegar with sparkling water is not only good for your liver, but it’s also very refreshing.\nIt also tastes quite nice (remarkably).\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Rinse Dreadlocks \nIf you have dreadlocks and are finding it difficult to rinse them quickly and effectively, apple cider vinegar could be just what you need.\nIt really penetrates your scalp, and can remove even the most stubborn of build-up.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Treat Sunburn \nYou know how it goes. The summer is here and the sun is out. It’s Saturday and you’re gonna hit the beach.\nAnd no one is gonna stop you.\nBut despite covering yourself in sun screen, you still wake up on the sand with burning skin. Gosh darn it!\nShould we be made to pay for wanting a bit of sunshine after such a long, miserable winter? It just doesn’t seem fair!\nFortunately, if the sun decides it’s going to kill your mood, you can treat sunburn effectively using apple cider vinegar. All you need to do is soak a facial cloth in the stuff before applying it to any affected area.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Treat Constipation \nConstipation can be a bit of an embarrassing problem, especially when everyone in your house knows that you’re heading upstairs to “have a try”.\nFortunately, there are remedies that can ease your shame – and apple cider vinegar is easily one of the most potent.\nIt’s also one of the most simplest to take, and thanks to its water-soluble fibre content, it fires up your bowels in no time at all.\nAll you need to do is drop a pair of tbsp of the stuff into a glass of water three times a day – and drink it.\nIf you dislike the taste, you could add some fruit juice, such as grape or apple juice.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Cure Bad Breath \nAlthough bad breath is certainly not going to kill you, it does make like hellish if you can’t get rid of it. It knocks your self-esteem, and can stop you from going out. After all, it’s really embarrassing when you know someone can smell your bad breath.\nTo eliminate a bout of halitosis, add half a tbsp of apple cider vinegar to a glass of water before gargling.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Remedy A Sore Throat \nYou can also treat a sore throat in the same way as the method above. Just be careful not to swallow, as it doesn’t taste all that fab!!\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Treat Acne \nAcne is a skin condition that can be terribly debilitating. If you’re not careful, it could end up covering your entire face.\nBut even just a few spots here and there can be enough to wreak havoc with your self esteem, as anyone who has suffered with acne will tell you.\nAnd even when it does decide to finally pack up its bags and leave, you’re still left with scars that seem to linger forever.\nAnd it’s really these scars that apple cider vinegar can help you with. Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, apple cider vinegar is able to reuse inflammation, stop infection, and thereby prevent any more outbreaks.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Relieve Itchy Skin, Too \nItchy skin is a nightmare. Dab ACV over the affected areas for instant relief.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Aid Weight Loss \nLosing weight is hard work. I know, I’ve been there. Finding the motivation is hard, while actually sticking to all these new diet plans and workout regimes is even harder. Is it even worth the effort?\nIt’s always worth the effort. Moreover, it doesn’t actually have to be all that difficult.\nThere are many simple weight loss hacks that help you to shed the pounds quicker, and regularly consuming raw apple cider vinegar is one of them. It might sound nasty – but it’s hugely effective.\nStudies have indeed shown that overweight people who consume acetic acid (which is found in apple cider vinegar) show a much bigger decrease in body weight than overweight people who do not.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Lower Blood Cholesterol \nThe whole world now seems to be so obsessed with blood sugar that we’ve forgotten all about blood cholesterol. But blood cholesterol is bad, and can cause diabetes and heart disease.\nApple cider vinegar has been proven to boost your blood’s profile. How? It does this be lowering the amount of bad cholesterol in your system while boosting the amount of good cholesterol.\nIn this way, it is able to ward off a number of debilitating diseases, including diabetes.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Marinate Your Steak \nIf you’re fond of a good steak but are tired of marinating in the same way all the time, try apple cider vinegar as an alternative!\nYour friends might think you’re crazy, but it tastes divine.\nIt’s probably best that you don’t request it at a restaurant.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Trap Flies \nI’m a vegetarian who can’t even bring herself to harm a fly. If a spider ever enters my house, I’m like “take it! I’ll pop out for a few hours!”\nBut if you don’t mind trapping pesky flies in a fly trap so that they don’t land on your food or just generally annoy you by buzzing around your house as you try to work, you should put a layer of apple cider vinegar on a bar of soap and lay it out on your counter.\nIt will attract the flies who will invariably get stuck.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Lighten Dark Skin Spots \nDark skin spots, which are otherwise known as age or sun spots, aren’t really all that attractive to look at, are they? They’re pretty hideous, and many of us will do all that we can to get rid of them before we have to leave the house.\nAnd if we can’t get rid of them, we lie to all our friends that we’re locked indoors and can’t see them for like a week.\nTo eliminate dark skin spots, take a cotton ball and dab it in apple cider vinegar, before applying it to your sun spots. Then, leave over night.\nApple Cider Vinegar Is Good For Your Hair \nHair troubles are the worst. Your friend might convince you that her relationship woes are worse – but, No. Seriously, hair troubles are always the worst. Whether our hair is thinning or falling out in great clunks, it’s a nightmare that can scare us to death.\nA solution of water and apple cider vinegar can be your saviour if you’ve got hair that is unhealthy and lacking its usual shine and lustre right now. It makes for a fab conditioner, nourishing and replenishing your mane.\nApple cider vinegar also targets fungus that leads to dandruff, and it levels out your pH levels.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Stop Hiccups \nHiccups are bad news. We’ve surely all had the persistent hiccups that just don’t seem to want to go away, and which you think you will have forever (surely this can’t just be me?).\nThere are many home remedies for treating hiccups, but not all of them are effective. My grandma always brought out her trusty bottle of apple cider vinegar whenever my brother had the hiccups and although I didn’t like to admit it at the time, ACV actually did work.\nApple Cider Vinegar Warms Your Muscles \nWe all could do with a massage every now and then. I know I certainly could! And did you know getting someone to massage you with apple cider vinegar is very effective?\nThis is because it contains acetic acid, which is known to soothe and warm up your aching muscles. It can even provide relief from back pain.\nTo penetrate your muscles and give yourself a break from the pain, mix together apple cider vinegar with some water, before rubbing onto any affected area (you could get your partner to do this for you, as it will be much more effective).\nWarn him about any cuts and cracks you might have, though, as it can be painful!\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Fend Off Infection \nInfections are bad news, but did you know that some people are more vulnerable to infection than others?\nIf you find that you’re getting way more infections than your friends, you might just think you’re terribly unlucky and that there is nothing you can do about it. But, actually, you’re not unlucky and, yes, there are things you can do to reverse the situation.\nApple cider vinegar comes with anti-septic properties, which means that it can battle fungal and bacterial infections – and win. For example, it can be used to treat bladder infections, ear infections and even candidiasis.\nEar infections are common. To treat it, rinse your ear with a pinch of apple cider vinegar.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Protect Your Wires From Your Cats \nI LOVE cats. Although I don’t have any cats myself (I’m not allowed any in my apartment, drat), my friend has two that I love to play with.\nThe thing with cats, though, is that they’re all really mischievous. When they see something worth playing with, they don’t hesitate.\nAnd they love to play with our wires and cords!\nIf you have wires lying around that your cat keeps biting into, such as a phone charger lead, you should try dabbing a pinch of apple cider vinegar on it. The smell alone will repel the cat!\nApple Cider Vinegar Eliminate The Smell Of Cat Urine \nAlso, if you do have cats, you know what it’s like when your cats urinate.\nAgain and again and again.\nAnd again.\nEventually, it starts to smell real bad. And although you’re pretty good at clearing it up, someone always pops round to your house unexpectedly when you haven’t cleared it up.\nAnd he’s usually a really cute guy. Gosh darn it!\nWell, if your cat’s blanket stinks of urine, all you need to do is add apple cider vinegar to it before you put it in the washing machine.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Be Used As A Deodorant \nIf you need to smell nice for a meeting, a date or whatever, you might want to swap your usual deodorant for apple cider vinegar.\nThe problem with deodorants bought from cosmetic stores is that, although they make us smell great, they are laced with potentially harmful chemicals and toxins.\nApple cider vinegar is a more natural way of smelling nicer.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Rejuvenate Your Skin \nYour skin is your largest organ. It’s also your most visible one. If something goes wrong with it, other people are probably gonna notice. This can affect your self-esteem.\nGlowing, healthy skin is what we all long for. If yours isn’t looking at its best right now and needs a bit of a rejuvenation, there are many methods you can try. Applying apple cider vinegar is just one method – but a very good one.\nApple cider vinegar can treat all kinds of skin issues, including wrinkles and blemishes. All you need to do is take a cotton pad before soaking it in apple cider vinegar. Then, apply it to any affected areas.\nYou can also use the vinegar as an effective toner. To do so, you just need to mix together a glass of water with half a cup of the vinegar, before applying to your face. If you do this regularly, you will restore your skin’s pH balance, and ward off future skin infections.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Treat Bruises \nIt’s not that bruises are necessarily painful – it’s more that they look unsightly.\nIf you’ve got a pretty big bruise that you’d like to heal quicker, dabbing a cotton ball in apple cider vinegar and applying to your bruise always works. It speeds up the healing process, quickly reducing your bruise’s size.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Tackle Leg Cramps \nIf you suffer from night time leg cramps, you’ll know just how painful they can be. Help is at hand, though, and it comes in the form of good old apple cider vinegar.\nWhenever your legs seize up in pain in the middle of the night, simple drop a pinch of apple cider vinegar into a glass of water before drinking. The effects are almost instant, and after just a few minutes your aches and pains should have soothed.\nFor a bit more taste, add honey.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Be Added To Your Soups \nAs well as adding a bit of a flavoursome kick, apple cider vinegar will also create a bit of colour to your home-made soups.\nBe careful not to overdo it, though!\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Cure Smelly Feet \nIf someone in your house has smelly feet (let’s face it, it’s probably your partner), you can treat them with a dose of apple cider vinegar.\nAll you need to do is get them to soak their feet in a bowl of ACV mixed with water for instant relief for the whole house!\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Treat Coughs And Colds \nI always used to say that I didn’t mind a cough or a cold because at least I knew what it was. The worst thing for me is being sick and having to wait for a diagnosis.\nHowever, after some rather nasty coughs and colds, I now admit that there are no positives whatsoever.\nMy grandmother would always treat our coughs and colds when my sister and I were children with apple cider vinegar – and now I know why. It’s a potent remedy that always works.\nAll you need to do is mix together a single tsp of apple cider vinegar with warm water and a pinch of honey before drinking.\nFor it to be even more effective, add ginger.\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Kill Weeds \nGot weeds in your garden that you can’t seem to get rid of? Instead of using weedkiller, try mixing a gallon of ACV with a quarter cup of salt and dash of dish soap. Then, lace the weeds with it. It will attack the roots and kill!\nApple Cider Vinegar Can Be Added To Your Smoothie \nI always start my day off with a delicious smoothie, and although I don’t add apple cider vinegar each time, I know that when I do add it, it’s going to bring me some awesome benefits.\nThe only thing you’ve got to be wary of is putting too much vinegar in your smoothie. It has a very strong taste that can be overpowering, so just add a dash.\nUse It For Anything You’d Use Vinegar For! \nApple cider vinegar is vinegar after all. So the next time you get your bottle of vinegar out, stop for a second and use ACV instead.\nAnd, yes, it can be added to your fish and chips!\nDo you know other benefits and uses of apple cider vinegar?\nStay beautiful!",

      "text": "Apple’s Jade overpowers Vroum Vroum Mag in Hatton’s Grace at Fairyhouse • Grade One victory boosts Gordon Elliott but frustrates Willie Mullins • Michael O’Leary acknowledges Mullins’ role in sourcing Apple’s Jade Apple’s Jade, far side, jumps the last flight alongside Vroum Vroum Mag in the Hatton’s Grace Hurdle at Fairyhouse. Photograph: racingfotos/Rex/Shutterstock Sunday 4 December 2016 18.24 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nThe keenly fought battle to be Ireland’s champion jumps trainer was represented on the track on Sunday when Apple’s Jade held off Vroum Vroum Mag in a head-bobbing finish to the Hatton’s Grace Hurdle. That continued the recent theme of success for the upwardly mobile trainer Gordon Elliott and frustration for the long-standing champion, Willie Mullins , trainer of the odds-on runner-up, though the older man had the better of it on the rest of Fairyhouse’s prestigious raceday. \nFor Mullins the additional sting in this outcome lay in his having had Apple’s Jade at his Carlow stable only three months ago until a fallout over fees with her owner, Michael O’Leary, resulted in the departure of 60 horses. The best of them went to Elliott, who has now won his first Hatton’s Grace and his first Grade One since Don Cossack landed the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March. \nO’Leary acknowledged Mullins’s role in sourcing Apple’s Jade for him and offered the change of yards as part-explanation for the fact that she began her season with two defeats, at Down Royal and Newcastle. “She may have suffered a bit in the transition from Willie’s to Gordon’s,” the owner said. “When we ran her first, she probably just wasn’t fit enough. I think Newcastle brought her on a tonne.” \nElliott was praised for his brave decision to run Apple’s Jade only eight days after her narrow defeat in the Fighting Fifth but the County Meath trainer said his filly made the decision for him, having made such a show of wellbeing in the past week. “She actually put on weight since she went to Newcastle,” Elliott said. \n“I even weighed her again this morning to check it was right. Martin Pipe always said I should weigh my horses and I thought it was a bit mad but I’ve started it this year. Maybe he’s right.” \nApple’s Jade is now expected to have a break until after Christmas, unless she somehow persuades Elliott to send her out again next weekend. Her Cheltenham Festival target is likely to be the subject of some debate, as she was cut to 14-1 for the Champion Hurdle by several firms but is only 11-4 for the Mares’ Hurdle, in which she may meet the runner-up again. Willie Mullins loses 60 Gigginstown Stud horses after training fees row Read more \nThe World Hurdle could also be discussed, given how well she coped with this first attempt at two and a half miles. No horse as young as five has won that race for decades but then Apple’s Jade is the first four-year-old to win the Hatton’s Grace since it was created in 1994. For now, at least, Elliott seems clear in his own preference. “The Mares’ Hurdle will be her Gold Cup,” he said. \nWhile there is no denying the winner’s bravery and resolution Vroum Vroum Mag did not appear to get the run of this race, being held up by Ruby Walsh at the back of the main bunch until the second-last flight. From there she made up several lengths in a short time to mount a strong challenge. \nAsked if he had expected her to win at that stage, Mullins replied, wryly: “Probably but we also know what Apple’s Jade is, so I thought, ‘She’ll keep pulling it out,’ which she did. They had a real ding-dong battle. Two good mares.” \nThis was a first defeat for Vroum Vroum Mag in 11 races since she joined Mullins from France. The rest of her campaign can only be guessed at, since she has shown high-class form over hurdles and fences. “She can go anywhere,” Mullins said. “She’s an extraordinary mare, to do what she did. And we’ll see about the other horses as well. It’s not all about her. There’s others to think about.” \nBryan Cooper, who rode Apple’s Jade, had seemed at risk of having to sit out the Hatton’s Grace when he limped to an ambulance after an earlier fall. That became a theme of the day, as the first two jockeys home in the Drinmore Novice Chase were Mark Walsh and Barry Geraghty, who had been involved in a nasty incident in the previous contest, Geraghty’s mount bringing down Walsh’s. \nWalsh pushed out Coney Island for a surprise Drinmore success, Eddie Harty’s charge having come here without a previous win over fences. But Harty said he had been sure of the horse’s quality and felt he would benefit from the stronger pace of a top-class contest. \nAsked whether Coney Island was a Gold Cup prospect for a future season, Harty replied: “You’d like to think so. You hate to say those things with five-year-olds but you couldn’t have asked him to do a lot more than he did today and he travelled so well, it wasn’t like he just ground it out. \n“All things being equal, you’d love to see him be a Gold Cup horse at some stage. There’s a lot of things to go right and not go wrong in the meantime, but that’s what we’d like to be thinking.” \nThe result meant a one-two for the owner JP McManus, who also has plenty to look forward to from the runner-up, Anibale Fly. An unexposed type from Tony Martin’s yard, he kept on nicely from the rear without quite getting into the argument. \nMullins got a Grade One winner on the card with Airlie Beach, who made all the running to land the Royal Bond Novice Hurdle despite jumping left at times. The favourite, Peace News, fell two-out, possibly as a result of being distracted by the winner crossing his line. ",

      "text": "12:00 AM, December 05, 2016 / LAST MODIFIED: 12:00 AM, December 05, 2016 Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race 0 Copy this link Reuters, Washington \nApple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on US regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.

      "text": "Apple reveals plans for self-driving car By Allen Cone | Dec. 4, 2016 at 2:45 PM Comments | License Photo \nCUPERTINO, Calif., Dec. 4 (UPI) -- For the first time, Apple has revealed plans to develop a self-driving car. \nThe computer company, which has revolutionized computers, phones and the music recording industry, wrote a letter dated Nov. 22 to National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator Mark Rosekind explaining its plans. Apple said it was \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\" \n\"Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal,\" Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity wrote in the five-page letter. \"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\" \nAs a prelude, Apple has already registered several car-related internet domains, including apple.car and apple.auto. \nThe Cupertino, Calif.,-based company wants the NHTSA to exempt rules for the cars on public roads. It also wants companies to share crash data and near-misses but doesn't want an individual's privacy to be compromised. \nIn closing, the letter says, \"Apple appreciates the opportunity to comment on the policy. Apple commends the Department of Transportation and NHTSA for facilitating a national conversation about the safe and ethical development and deployment of automated vehicles. Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously. \nIn October, Apple abandoning its car plans \"for now\" but remaining members of the Apple Car team were said to be focusing on autonomous systems rather than a full car. \nIn September, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"vehicle performance guidance\" for safety aspects of the vehicles. \nSeveral companies are working on self-driving cars, including automakers. Google has been testing them on the roads. Tesla announced in October that all the cars it now builds has the hardware installed to drive on their own.",

      "text": "Image source: Apple.\nContinue Reading Below\nAs arguably the most successful company ever, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't prone to many mistakes. However, the company's most recent product rollouts have left some investors worried that the tech giant might be losing its legendary ability to make products that consumers simply can't live without.\nApple certainly left something to be desired with its recent refresh of the Apple Watchand MacBook Pro. However, in terms of Apple's recent errors, investors should be most concerned over the potentially underwhelming prospects of the Apple iPhone 7.\nApple lays an egg with the iPhone 7? More From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE! Heres how to play the largest growth opportunity in history Forget Apple! Heres a Better Stock to Buy He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick Breaking with its tradition of overhauling the iPhone's form factor every even year, Apple elected not to do so in 2016, and that lack of differentiation could well prove to be the handset's fatal flaw. Largely copying the form factor of the iPhone 6 and 6s, the exterior of the iPhone 7 simply gives consumers more of the same. In fact, other than the removal of the visible antenna bands from the back, the addition of dust- and water-resistance, and the shift in color schemes to make way for the new Jet Black color, it's hard to visually tell the difference between this year's and last year's iPhones.\nThis is all the more unfortunate since Apple actually introduced a number of minor but respectable improvements to the iPhone 7's internal hardware across a number of important areas like processor speed, screen brightness, camera resolution and performance, battery life, and storage. Despite those hardware improvements, there is reason to believe that Apple's iPhone 7 might not have received the same kind of initial reception from consumers as have past models.\nContinue Reading Below",

      "text": "Apple’s decision to charge $19 for a charger and then $19 for a cable to plug in has had the effect you’d expect on the world: everyone just buys knockoff chargers off Amazon instead. But although most chargers you buy off the internet will work just fine most of the time, a series of recent tests have shown that there’s real danger to having a fake charger plugged in at home.\n\nDON’T MISS:  Here comes the OLED iPhone 8 \nThe independent UL laboratory ran a series of basic electrical safety tests on fake chargers bought online from stores around the world. The results weren’t good: of the 400 counterfeit Apple chargers purchased, 397 failed a basic safety test conducted by the UL laboratory:\n\n“In total, we tested 400 adapters and the results were literally shocking. The overall failure rate exceeded 99 percent. All but three failed our basic safety tests and were fire and shock hazards. Twelve were so poorly designed and constructed that they posed a risk of lethal electrocution to the user. “\nSo that doesn’t mean the chargers will definitely shock you; rather, if a power surge hits your house, it’s likely to fry your phone at best, or cause a fire at worst.\nThis isn’t some kind of impossible bogeyman, either. We see pictures all the time of people who have been burned by faulty batteries or chargers while charging their smartphones overnight, and the Galaxy Note 7 debacle is a good reminder of how much damage a low-voltage electrical device can do.\nThe UK Trading Standards authority also examined second-hand chargers by looking in thrift stores and markets around London. Of 3,000 chargers tested, 15% were found to be unsafe in some way. On the plus side, that’s orders of magnitude better than a fake charger bought online; bad news, a 15% chance of electrical fire still isn’t “safe.”\nTo avoid buying a counterfeit charger or accessory, you might want to take a look at Apple’s guide to spotting fake products. The company has an entire support page dedicated to telling the difference between fake cables and the real thing. It’s also worth mentioning that there are two different standards to look for here. Apple produces and sells its own iPhone accessories, but it also certifies third-party accessories (although not the standard USB-to-Lightning cable!) under the “Made for iPhone” program. Under the terms of that agreement, manufacturers pay a licensing fee to Apple to use the Lightning port and Apple’s proprietary design and circuitry. That makes accessories more expensive, but it also makes them far more likely to work correctly.\nimg_10122014_150204 More The MFi logo should be found on the packaging of any officially certified accessory, like battery chargers, cases, docks or speakers — basically, anything that attaches to your iPhone. There’s one exception to this, though — Apple doesn’t certify any USB-C to Lightning cables, so any of those with an “Made for iPhone” logo is guaranteed to be fake.\nAs for spotting counterfeit cables against the genuine Apple product, there’s plenty of details on Apple’s site.\n“An Apple Lightning to USB cable has “Designed by Apple in California” and either “Assembled in China,” “Assembled in Vietnam,” or “Indústria Brasileira” on the cable about seven inches from the USB connector. You’ll see a 12-digit serial number at the end of this text.”\nRead More When it comes to the wall chargers themselves, the most important thing to look for are the UL and CE markings that those testing bodies put on devices, and to buy from a reasonably reputable source. You don’t have to buy the genuine, made-by-Apple product; just make sure you’re buying a charger that’s been appropriately tested, puts out 2.1A of current, and doesn’t have strange writing on the side.\napple-counterfeit-lightning-cable More  \nTrending right now: \nNES Classic and Hatchimals might actually be in stock at one store this weekend Apple says iPhone battery problem a result of too much air iOS 10.2 beta 5 is now available to download See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "title": "Apple Confirms Its Intent To Develop Autonomous Vehicle Technology In Letter To NHTSA",
      "text": "by Rob Williams   Apple Confirms Its Intent To Develop Autonomous Vehicle Technology In Letter To NHTSA \nFinally . That's all that can be really said about Apple admitting to the world that it's working on autonomous driving technologies. The company has been infamously, and perhaps infuriatingly mum on the fact that it's been working on such tech, even though there have been a countless number of hints to it. Well, we now know that Apple is indeed working on self-driving technologies. Apple could be targeting the likes of Tesla sooner than later... \nIn a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Apple says that it's feeding off of its expertise in machine-learning to help create automated systems, particularly in the transportation market: Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. \nApple goes on to highlight some obvious benefits of its ventures, including making the roads safer, which will of course result in less fatalities. Another interesting angle was mentioned: autonomous driving will allow those who've never driven before to do so. This isn't a matter of simply not having a license; picture those who physically can't drive. Autonomous driving could make a dramatic improvement to their lives. A future autonomous car showroom? \nOne of the biggest hurdles companies targeting autonomous driving have faced is the slowness of getting new laws passed, or current outdated laws holding back innovation. Apple thus asks in its letter that the NHTSA \"expedite requests for exemption and interpretation and petitions for rulemaking\". It's hard to say whether or not this plea will be successful, but it'll be interesting to find out. \nIt's not made explicitly clear in the letter whether or not Apple is working on its own automobile, or if it's simply going to be licensing its technology to traditional automakers.",

The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation.“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote.“Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.”Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.”Since software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the “implications of algorithmic decisions” for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.GuidelinesSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.In September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.Apple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. CEO Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.But Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.Other companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc. and General Motors Co.Apple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.Apple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.An auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.

      "text": "E-mail \nRumors have been going around about Apple’s autonomous vehicle for almost two years now, and during that time, a few of the world’s leading experts shared their opinions on this open secret project, including Elon Musk . He said that he welcomes the idea, as competition in the electric car segment can only mean good things for consumers, and it looks like there will definitely be some competing going on, as Apple has just confirmed that it is working on its own electric vehicle. The news was revealed through a letter addressed to the U.S. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), in which the company confirms its ongoing efforts to create an autonomous transport system. \nWritten by Apple’s Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner, the letter states that Apple is using ‘machine learning’ in order to make sure that the driver and other traffic participants would be completely safe. \n“Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nFurthermore, it looks like the company wants to be treated fairly when it commences its testing sessions for this upcoming vehicle, which means that it doesn’t want hurdles just because it’s not a car-only brand. Even though we know that Apple is indeed working on a self-driving car, we still have no idea how it’s going to work or what other projects will serve as inspiration for it.",

      "text": "Last week, Apple wrote a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration telling it that \"new entrants\" to the auto industry should get the same rights as the established companies in the industry, reports VentureBeat. In the letter, Apple admits to its interest in \"machine learning and automation\" as it pertains to transportation.\n\nApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\n\nApple points out that established car manufacturers do not have to pursue exemptions to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards when attempting to test cars on public roads due to the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. New entrants in the auto industry, like Google and others, are not granted the same right under the FAST Act.\n\nThe Cupertino company argues that the best way to maximize safety benefits for autonomous vehicles, ensure fair competition and encourage innovation is for the NHTSA to amend policy to state that seeking exemptions isn't necessary for internal development vehicles on public roads.\n\nThe other half of the letter, which is dated November 22, addresses the Federal Automated Vehicles policy and a proposed data sharing program. \"Apple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses,\" the letter says. \"Data should be sufficient to reconstruct the event, including time-series of vehicle kinematics and characteristics of the roadway and objects.\" Apple also points out that data sharing should not come at the expense of privacy, and that companies should invest resources to protect the \"individuals' fundamental right to privacy.\"\n\nIn October, it was reported that Apple was abandoning its car plans \"for now.\" After numerous layoffs and reassignments, the remaining members of the Apple Car team were said to be focusing on autonomous systems. Dozens of employees are also working on a car operating system in Canada. The letter was signed by Apple VP of Product Integrity Steve Kenner, who used to be Ford's Global Director of Automotive Safety. It's not known when Kenner joined Apple, as his LinkedIn still lists Ford as his employer.\n\n*Update*: Apple issued a statement to Financial Times confirming the letter and Apple's interest in helping to define rules for self-driving vehicles.\n\n“We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” the Apple spokesman said. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.”\n\nRelated Roundup: Apple Car\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "title": "Apple Unveils Its Plans to Get Involved in Self-Driving Cars",
      "text": "\nWhile Apple has never publicly disclosed its plans on developing an autonomous vehicle, reportedly titled Project Titan , a recent letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration makes it clear that the Cupertino tech giant is getting involved in the process. Amidst doubts as to whether or not they are working on building the actual car , the company appears to be focusing on the initial phases of the development. In the letter, Apple's product director of integrity Steve Kenner asked regulators to loosen the restrictions on self-driving as they prepare to test the technology. The company's only comment vaguely mentioned that \"there are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\" \nWith more brands like Google and Uber experimenting in this field, it seems like a natural fit for one of the biggest tech companies to take part in what's expected to be the future of driving. Apple's five-page letter was sent in response to the U.S. government's recent Federal Automated Vehicle Policy, which included increased scrutiny from regulators before autonomous vehicles are put on the road, with a detailed 15-point safety assessment. Read the full letter below. \nApple letter to NHTSA Nov 2016 by CNET News on Scribd\n\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Give your smartphone photography a boost Kit Eaton, Dec 05, 2016, INYT: With Apple’s iPhone 7 and Google’s new Pixel phones putting such an emphasis on powerful camera technology, smartphone photography is more robust than ever. And while phones typically have great built-in photography apps, many other options can be easier or expand your range.\nProCamera is an excellent option for iOS devices. Using this app feels like raising a single-lens reflex camera to your eye: The first thing you see is a view through the camera lens, superimposed with many controls and information like the exposure and whether the flash is activated.\nWith a few taps on the screen, you can display a grid to help compose a shot properly and a guide to warn if your composition is tilted. You can also control the white balance and the ISO setting and bring up a live histogram that shows how saturated the colours in the final photo will be. There are quick-access buttons to shoot in video, photo, high dynamic range or other modes and there’s even a bar code scanner option.\nMost impressive is ProCamera’s anti-shake feature, which waits for you to stop moving before it activates the shutter.\nBecause of its complexity, ProCamera takes awhile to get used to, and the exact features depend on which iPhone you have. The app costs $5 (Rs 341) and some features, like a low-light mode to help shoot better pictures at night, are upgrades that cost a few dollars each. It’s definitely worth it.\nOn Android, one equivalent to ProCamera is Camera FV-5. This app also feels like using a single-lens reflex camera, with similar manual control. Camera FV-5 includes features like a live histogram, burst-mode shooting, exposure bracketing and time-lapse imagery. It also offers choices over the kind of files it saves to your device, and has a comprehensive settings page.\nUnlike some other Android camera apps, Camera FV-5 has a professional-looking and easy-to-use interface. It costs $4 (Rs 273).\nTo edit that perfect portrait or landscape photo, Adobe’s software is the choice of professional photographers. There is a version for mobile devices too — Adobe Photoshop Fix — which lets you heal an image’s blemishes, adjust shadow intensity, fix the contrast or add effects like vignetting. There is also a powerful liquefy tool that can distort the image in a smooth way to pull off some shape-modifying effects.\nMastering the features of Photoshop Fix so your final images don’t look too artificial will take time. Its interface is sometimes confusing, and I have found myself getting lost in its menus and submenus, but the app has built-in help and, best of all, is free for both iOS and Android.\nFor those who find Photoshop too complex, Darkroom Photo Editor is a slightly simpler alternative for iOS. This free app offers speedy edits before sharing that selfie on social media (note that more advanced editing features like colour curve correction cost $2 or Rs 136 and up each).\nOn Android, the free Fotor Photo Editor app is roughly equivalent to Darkroom in terms of image-editing features, and it comes with an elegant, minimal interface. It is also available for iOS devices.\nPolaroid, once a huge name in instant photography, is also on the try-it list. The company is now trying to teach the smartphone generation how to take photos with its Polaroid University app. This app starts with photography basics like how to compose a good shot. It also has videos on how to achieve more complicated goals, like slow-motion video or low-light photography.\nWhile the app is free, a year’s subscription to the full video content costs $20 (Rs 1,365). The app is iOS-only for now, though an Android edition is in the works.",

      "text": "Faced with slipping smartphone sales, Apple may have found a new way to edge in on Google’s map monopoly: a fleet of survey drones.\nThe new drones will join the company’s current line of camera-equipped minivans, an anonymous source told Bloomberg last week, as Apple attempts to improve its much-maligned Maps service. The craft will record changes to road conditions and track construction areas, the source said, providing on-the-fly travel updates to users.\nWith 2012’s disastrous launch in the rearview, Apple has plenty of incentive to revamp Maps. As the company seeks to integrate with ride-sharing and retail apps, accurate location services will be essential. But the new tech could also represent a conceptual redirect for the tech giant, which has long relied on smartphone sales.\nRecommended: Do you belong on the road? Take our driver's test. Throughout its history, Apple has often changed focus. A dedication to creative professionals kept the company afloat in its most difficult years in the mid-1990s, but consumer products – namely the iPod and the iPhone – made Apple what it is today. That, and a self-perpetuating brand culture.\nTest your knowledge Do you belong on the road? Take our driver's test. “iPhone marketing campaigns make people believe they are a part of a grand social movement, even when that community appears so highly commercialized,” Isabel Pedersen, a professor of digital culture at the University of Ontario, told The Christian Science Monitor last month. “iPhone has mastered the feeling that you belong to a tribe and that you earned it – not only through an expensive phone, but also through your identity , your personality, your friends, and your loyalty.”\nBut as smartphone sales decline, Alphabet is gambling on smart lifestyle essentials – and making big gains in the process. To catch up, Apple may again shift focus to new services and products. In November, the company hinted about its autonomous car development in an open letter to US regulators.\nBut such services have been historically difficult for the company. That’s because in many cases, Apple wasn’t excelling at tech, but at integration. Sure, its music players – and touch screens, news aggregation, voice recognition, and so on – were second-rate, but where else could you get all of those things in such a user-friendly package?\nWhen Maps launched in 2012, critics slammed its poor functionality: the app mixed up hospitals with supermarkets and directed drivers to travel on airport runways. At that point, Google Maps had comfortably led the market for years, and Apple’s alternative was a non-threat.\nWhen current CEO Tim Cook took over, he asked executives to reexamine the development process. The famously secretive company began public beta testing, widening the service’s scope far beyond the Silicon Valley.\n“We made significant changes to all of our development processes because of it,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s SVP of Internet software and services, told Fast Company in August. “To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good. Right? So [the problem] wasn’t obvious to us. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. Now we do.”\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is rapidly reorganizing beyond individual products. The search giant has invested big in a number of “moonshot” technologies in the past year, but there’s one common thread: Google wants to be essential to users’ daily lives. That’s why services like Maps may be essential to Apple’s so-called “ thermonuclear war ” on its competitor.\n“We had long discussions at the ET [executive team] level about the importance of Maps, where we thought it was going in the future, and could we treat it as a third-party app?” Mr. Cue said. “We don’t do every app. We’re not trying to create a Facebook app. They do a great job. We decided that Maps is integral to our whole platform. There were so many features that we wanted to build that are dependent on that technology, and we couldn’t see ourselves being in a position where that was something that we didn’t own.”\n“Let’s say I’m at home doing email before work,” Cue added. \"I’d like Maps to tell me, ‘Don’t leave now. Your commute will be cut by 15 minutes if you stay home for a while.’ That would be very helpful.”",

Will Rand Paul Fight Fake News With a Filibuster? by TDB - Dec 3, 2016 2:37 PM \nHe could help his father who apparently stands accused of supporting Russia at the expense of the West. Redneck Investin Part 4 - Free on the Fringe by globalintelhub - Dec 4, 2016 12:02 AM \nWe can't always rely on traditional tools to work. Think outside the box and expand your horizons. If Rednecks can do it - why can't we? Apple Officially Enters Self-Driving Car Race Dec 4, 2016 6:30 PM 0 \nSubmitted by Michael Shedlock via MishTalk.com, \nThe race for self-driving car technology heats up. \nApple officially tossed its hat into the ring with a letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the US National Highway Safety Administration. \nRumors of a secret autonomous vehicle lab surfaced earlier this year but Apple denied them. Apple can no longer hide its intent. \nApple has for the first time publicly acknowledged its plans to develop self-driving cars , with a letter that urges the US highways regulator to promote “fair competition” between newcomers to the automotive industry and traditional manufacturers. \n\nIn an unusually direct statement accompanying the letter, an Apple spokesman confirmed its work on autonomous systems that could be used to transform “the future of transportation”. Apple’s letter touts the “significant societal benefits of automated vehicles”, which it described as a life-saving technology, potentially preventing millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year. \n\nThe disclosure highlights how Apple may struggle to maintain its notorious secrecy in new product development as it enters more highly regulated markets, from transportation to healthcare. \n\nHundreds of Apple staff have been working on an electric car for more than two years, people familiar with the project say. The Financial Times first reported the secret research lab , which is based outside its Cupertino headquarters in neighbouring Sunnyvale, in February last year. \n\nSince then, despite leaks about the project’s sometimes difficult progress , Apple executives have refused to admit that the automotive initiative exists. \n\nThat position will be harder to maintain after the publication of a letter from Apple to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , as part of the regulator’s regular dialogue with manufacturers about its rules for the fast-developing technology. The letter was signed by Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, and was submitted on November 22. \n\nAn Apple spokesman confirmed the letter, giving the clearest statement yet of the company’s intentions. \n\nIn one of the five-page letter’s more controversial passages, Apple says that manufacturers should pool their data as they develop automated systems, to help everyone identify the multitude of unusual situations or “edge cases” that cars might encounter on the roads. \n\n“Companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses,” Apple writes. “By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive data set than any one company could create alone.” \n\n“Because automated vehicles promise such a broad and deep human impact, companies should consider the ethical dimensions of them in comparably broad and deep terms,” Apple writes. These considerations include privacy, how the cars’ software systems make decisions and the impact on employment and public spaces, it says. \n\nExperts are divided on whether driverless cars could cause huge congestion or clear the roads, and on the extent to which they might free up space in cities that was previously used for parking lots and garages to build new housing or parks. Automation of jobs such as taxi and truck drivers might increase unemployment among low-skilled workers, some analysts have warned. \nAnother Competitor \nAs I have been saying for years, self-driving cars and trucks will eliminate millions of jobs no later than a 2022-2024 timeframe. \nMy number one reason was competition. Add Apple to the list of competitors. \nThat said, reading between the lines, Apple may be far behind. If Apple was ahead, it just might not be promoting data sharing. \nRegardless, Apple has significant resources and wants a piece of the pie. Competition is officially up. \nHow Many Jobs Lost? \nMy statement that “millions of long haul truck driving jobs will vanish in the 2022-2024 time frame” is likely way off on the low side if one counts Uber, taxi, and chauffeur driven vehicles. \nTake a look at Uber’s goal once again: “ replace Uber’s more than 1?million human drivers with robot drivers—as quickly as possible.” \nThat’s just Uber. And those jobs will vanish. All of them. What about Lyft? Taxis? \nRelated Articles",

On Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2016, Apple announced it is extending its push into selling business technology by forging a partnership with the Deloitte consulting firm to advise companies on using iPhones, iPads and Apple software in the workplace. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \nApple Inc. has big plans to outfit its next iPhone with vibrant, energy-sipping organic LED displays, seeking to entice consumers with new technology that's already been embraced by other high-end smartphone makers. \nThe trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won't have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company. \nOLED screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities, the people said. The four largest producers are Samsung Display Co., LG Display Co., Sharp Corp., and Japan Display Inc. \nWhile Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand. \nThe supply constraints may force Apple to use OLED in just one version of the next-generation iPhone, push back adoption of the technology or cause other snags. \n\"Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they've also figured out there will be constraints to these panels,\" said Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit. The combination of Apple's stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels will likely lead to supply constraints, he said. \nApple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone's debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. A pair of other new iPhone models will likely feature screens that use older LCD technology, partly because there won't be enough OLED displays to satisfy anticipated demand, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. \n\"Display technology is still a pretty key driver of the purchasing experience,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple has previously used new display features as iPhone selling points. For example, the iPhone 4 in 2010 added Apple's first Retina Display, the iPhone 5 in 2012 introduced the iPhone's first display size increase, and the iPhone 6 in 2014 brought new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen options. \nThe OLED iPhone, at least, will have a new look that extends glass from the display to the device's back and edges, according to a person familiar with Apple's plans. This all-glass design will have a virtual Home button embedded in an edge-to-edge screen, rather than a physical button that can be pressed, the person added. \nApple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they're unveiled every September, as it did for 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All current iPhone 7 models have LCD screens. Still, Apple may have no choice. \nSharp and Japan Display are still working on test procedures for OLED screens and have said that they are on track for production in 2018, while seeking to manage expectations. \n\"There is all this talk about OLEDs, but I'm not at all sure about their future,\" Sharp President Tai Jeng Wu said recently. \"We need to work on developing the technology, but whether we can succeed remains to be seen.\" \nShuji Aruga, president of Japan Display, said earlier this month that he sees a 50-50 split between OLEDs and LCDs that will be used in high-end phone screens. \"We are not yet at a stage where we can decisively choose between OLED and LCD,\" he said. \"We need to develop OLED capacity so that we are not caught empty-handed if the technology does end up capturing a majority.\" \nLG Display is the laggard. \"It's true that we were late in OLED investment for smaller electronics devices compared to that of televisions,\" LG Display Chief Executive Officer Han Sang-beom said earlier this year, adding that the company now understands OLED's importance for smartphones.",

      "text": "Submitted by Michael Shedlock via MishTalk.com,\n\n*The race for self-driving car technology heats up.*\n\nApple officially tossed its hat into the ring with *a letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the US National Highway Safety Administration.*\n\nRumors of a secret autonomous vehicle lab surfaced earlier this year but Apple denied them. Apple can no longer hide its intent.\n\nPlease consider Apple Reveals Plans for Self-Driving Car.\n\n\n\nApple has for the first time publicly acknowledged its plans to develop self-driving cars, with a letter that urges the US highways regulator to promote “fair competition” between newcomers to the automotive industry and traditional manufacturers.\n\n\nIn an unusually direct statement accompanying the letter, an Apple spokesman confirmed its work on autonomous systems that could be used to transform “the future of transportation”. Apple’s letter touts the “significant societal benefits of automated vehicles”, which it described as a life-saving technology, potentially preventing millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year.\n\n\nThe disclosure highlights how Apple may struggle to maintain its notorious secrecy in new product development as it enters more highly regulated markets, from transportation to healthcare.\n\n\nHundreds of Apple staff have been working on an electric car for more than two years, people familiar with the project say. The Financial Times first reported the secret research lab, which is based outside its Cupertino headquarters in neighbouring Sunnyvale, in February last year.\n\n\nSince then, despite leaks about the project’s sometimes difficult progress, Apple executives have refused to admit that the automotive initiative exists.\n\n\nThat position will be harder to maintain after the publication of a letter from Apple to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as part of the regulator’s regular dialogue with manufacturers about its rules for the fast-developing technology. The letter was signed by Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, and was submitted on November 22.\n\n\nAn Apple spokesman confirmed the letter, giving the clearest statement yet of the company’s intentions.\n\n\nIn one of the five-page letter’s more controversial passages, Apple says that manufacturers should pool their data as they develop automated systems, to help everyone identify the multitude of unusual situations or “edge cases” that cars might encounter on the roads.\n\n\n“Companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses,” Apple writes. “By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive data set than any one company could create alone.”\n\n\n“Because automated vehicles promise such a broad and deep human impact, companies should consider the ethical dimensions of them in comparably broad and deep terms,” Apple writes. These considerations include privacy, how the cars’ software systems make decisions and the impact on employment and public spaces, it says.\n\n\nExperts are divided on whether driverless cars could cause huge congestion or clear the roads, and on the extent to which they might free up space in cities that was previously used for parking lots and garages to build new housing or parks. Automation of jobs such as taxi and truck drivers might increase unemployment among low-skilled workers, some analysts have warned.\n\n\n\n*Another Competitor*\n\nAs I have been saying for years, self-driving cars and trucks will eliminate millions of jobs no later than a 2022-2024 timeframe.\n\nMy number one reason was competition. Add Apple to the list of competitors.\n\nThat said, reading between the lines, Apple may be far behind. If Apple was ahead, it just might not be promoting data sharing.\n\nRegardless, Apple has significant resources and wants a piece of the pie. Competition is officially up.\n\n*How Many Jobs Lost?*\n\nMy statement that “millions of long haul truck driving jobs will vanish in the 2022-2024 time frame” is likely way off on the low side if one counts Uber, taxi, and chauffeur driven vehicles.\n\nTake a look at Uber’s goal once again: “replace Uber’s more than 1?million human drivers with robot drivers—as quickly as possible.”\n\n*That’s just Uber. And those jobs will vanish. All of them. What about Lyft? Taxis?*\n\n*Related Articles*\n\n· November 28: “Otto” Self-Driving Truck Test on Ohio Roads this Week\n· September 20: DOT Embraces Self Driving Vehicles: “Rise of New Technology is Inevitable, Unknowns Today Become Knowns Tomorrow”\n· August 24: New Lidar Chips for Self-Driving Vehicles are Smaller Than a Dime, Cost $10 to Manufacture\n· July 26: What a City With Driverless Cars Will Look Like (In 10 Years or Less)\n· May 17: Ex-Google Engineers Launch “Otto”: Completely Driverless Truck Testing Underway\n\nFor further discussion, including a rebuttal to the often stated claim that driverless vehicles cannot work in snow, please see Uber Offers Driverless Rides This Month! What About Snow, Rain, Pigeons, 80-Year-Olds on Roller Skates?\n\n*My long-stated timeframe for millions of long-haul trucking jobs to vanish by the 2022-2024 is likely too distant.*\n\nThe components are all in place. Regulation has five years to catch up, and it will. Competition ensures success and DOT is already on board.\n\nAmusingly, some accused me of being “religious” when it comes to self-driving vehicles. This is not religion, this is science, and it will happen far sooner than deniers think, and quite possibly sooner than I think.",

      "text": "After the iPhone 8 , then what? That’s essentially the question that Oppenheimer’s Andrew Uerkwitz and others are now asking.\nIn an investment note, Uerkwitz and his colleagues remarked that Apple “lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation” in fields such as artificial intelligence , cloud services and messaging . The company “will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone,” something to be apparent over the next ten years of “malaise.”\nIn its fourth quarter earnings call , CEO Tim Cook said that Apple has “the strongest [product] pipeline that we’ve ever had,” though as usual, he declined to detail that path which supposedly includes more integrated multimedia and an autonomous car. Perhaps something we haven’t covered might take us by the feet, but from what we’ve heard, that Apple Car project has suffered some setbacks and is on a thin rope for its survival .\nInfinite Loop has indeed been losing its grip on its stellar financial performance over the past decade and a half. Annual revenue was down for the first time in 15 years. That development followed iPhone sales hitting a ceiling over the last year or so.\nThe note, obtained by Business Insider , goes on to say that Uerkwitz continues to see hardware and software revenues attempt equilibrium as iPhone sales peak — forecast to happen in 2018 — while software and services are only just coalescing as a coherent package to consumers. That said, Oppenheimer retains a “perform” rating on AAPL stock.\n“We believe [Apple’s] profitability,a cash hoard for protection, and one last ‘growth’ hurrah from the tenth-anniversary phone will keep investors interested in the company,” Uerkwitz noted.\nThe post Oppenheimer: Apple too “reliant” on iPhone, unprepared for next decade appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Apple has revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars. The company is \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Apple said in a November 22 letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offering Apple's opinion about draft regulations for the sector.\n\"Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously,\" the company's director of product integrity Steve Kenner wrote.\nApple issued the letter because it is \"investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP.\n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\"\nRumors about Apple's ambitions in the sector have circulated for years.\nThe company has a separate organization called \"Project Titan\" that is developing automotive projects.\nAlthough Apple has never officially confirmed the project, several of CEO Tim Cook's comments have fueled speculation.\nAfter a $1 billion investment in a Chinese ride-hailing service called Didi Chuxing, he spoke of \"some strategic things that the companies can do together over time.\"\nHowever, in early September, The New York Times reported that the group had narrowed its ambitions, laying off dozens of staff as part of the project's \"reboot.\"\nInstead of designing and producing a complete self-driving car, the group will now concentrate on developing underlying technologies for autonomous vehicles.\nIn its letter, Apple urges the NHTSA not to penalize new participants in the sector by restricting the testing of cars under development on public roads, for which established automakers generally have exemptions.\n\"To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,\" it says.\nApple also encourages data sharing, particularly for accidents, saying that would enable the industry to \"build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone.\"\nMost major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020.\nsoe/grf/oh\nAPPLE INC.",

      "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite \nIt is a bit disappointing from Apple that we can't so far dual-boot Ubuntu (or simply Linux) on the new MacBook Pro 2016 (See David Foerster's Answer ). I'll take a chance to ask this question, but I'm not expecting a lot of good results. \nRoughly, I followed steps from that Video for trying installing Ubuntu, but after that page (Please wait 2 minutes) nothing happened except a big black page. \nCould anyone be able to display a full procedure of how it is possible to install the Ubuntu on this device? I'm pretty optimist that there exists, now, a real good solution to this problem. \nThanks in advance!",

Now, five years after he died, Apple founder Steve Jobs may be remembered in another way — on a Paris street. \n“Rue Steve Jobs” is among names shortlisted for one of the new roads in the French capital’s southeastern 13th arrondissement that will lead to a new incubator for hi-tech start-ups. \nThe tech titan’s name was put forward by the district’s socialist mayor who credited Jobs — whose company altered the face of computing, revolutionised music with the iPod and launched the iPhone and iPad — with “changing our daily lives”. \nBut the mayor, Jerome Coumet, has faced a backlash from elected Communists, who in a statement said “the reality of the legacy” of Jobs was “insufficient wages” and “forced overtime” for Apple subcontractors. \nThey also hit out at what they alleged was the technology giant’s “use of illegal tax arrangements” across the globe. \nCoumet said he was not seeking controversy. “I wanted a name that speaks to as many people as possible,” he said. \nAmong other suggestions was Alan Turing, in memory of the British mathematician and computer scientist whose wartime work allowed the allies to crack German codes and defeat Nazism. \nGrace Murray Hopper, an American computer scientist and former Navy rear admiral who pioneered coding, is also proposed. \nCurrently dubbed Station F, names for the start-up hub are to be discussed by Paris council officials in December, before it opens in March next year.",

      "text": "0 \nApple promised it’d be third-party developers who demonstrated just why the Touch Bar was the right way to make the new MacBook Pro finger-friendly, and now those devs are wading in. Microsoft is expected to push out a Touch Bar enabled version of Office later in the year, and Adobe is readying a Touch Bar Photoshop upgrade too. However, there are equally interesting things coming out of smaller coding studios as well, as the potential for the OLED touchscreen strip is explored. \nOne such example is TouchSwitcher, the handiwork of macOS app developer Maxim Ananov. He’s already developed one app which uses the Touch Bar, with the latest version of HazeOver – a distraction dimmer that helps you focus on whatever app is in the foreground – getting integration with the new strip in its latest update. TouchSwitcher, though, tests out a more simple theory. \nThat’s whether using the Touch Bar to navigate between apps is quicker or slower than the traditional way of command+tab, or picking from the launcher bar. TouchSwitcher is straightforward, basically putting the command+tabbing interface into the Touch Bar instead. It joins the buttons in the so-called Control Strip that’s persistently shown on the right side. \nTap it, and you get a row of icons showing your recent apps. Those used most recently are closer to the right. \nUnfortunately, due to the way Apple manages the Control Strip, sometimes the TouchSwitcher icon is replaced by system icons such as for the App Store or iTunes. Ananov says that’s a known problem, and that right now the only way to restore it is to relaunch the app itself. If you want to close it manually, you can long-press on its icon in the Touch Bar. \nI’ve been trying it out, and while I’m not sure whether it’s necessarily any faster than command+tabbing at first blush, I suspect it’s the sort of UI that you’d quickly get used to. While I was fairly skeptical about the Touch Bar initially, over a few weeks with it I’ve found myself reaching up and tapping more, as my fingers relearn. I’m still of the opinion that those who are familiar with keyboard shortcuts will have the most trouble migrating to Touch Bar controls, which right now is what most of the commands offered seem to replicate. \nNOW READ: New MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review \nStill, that’s the lowest-hanging fruit, and as developers dive into the Touch Bar – helped, of course, by the first orders of the notebook finally reaching buyers – it’s likely we’ll see more implementations that move away from just doubling up on what you can already do with a keyboard combo. At some point, we’re likely to bump into the restrictions that Apple itself has placed – browser-based webapps, for instance, can’t have their own individual Touch Bar controls, and you can’t pin macros or Automator workflows to the strip – at which point the Cupertino firm will have to decide what it’s willing to be flexible on in order to make the new control surface a success. If you want to try TouchSwitcher out yourself, it’s a free download. \nVIA Nate Swanner ",

      "text": "Apple reveals self-driving car plans 4 December 2016 From the section Business Image copyright Getty Images \nApple has acknowledged for the first time that it is investing in building a self-driving car. \nIn a letter to US transport regulators, Apple said it was \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation\". \nIt added that there were \"significant societal benefits of automated vehicles\" to be realised. \nThere have long been rumours about the firm's plans but it has not publicly admitted them. \nHowever, Ford, which itself plans to have self-driving cars on the road by 2021, has said it was working on the basis that Apple was building one. \nThe tech firm has already registered several car-related internet domains, including apple.car and apple.auto. Sharing data \nA company spokesman for Apple said that the letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was prompted by its \"heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems\" and that it wanted to help define best practices in the industry. \nThe five-page letter, written by Apple's director of product integrity Steve Kenner, urges the regulator to not introduce too many rules on the testing of self-driving cars, saying that \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nIt also proposes that companies in the industry share data from crashes and near-misses in order to build a more comprehensive picture than one company could manage alone, and therefore enable the design of better systems. \nHowever, it adds that an individual's privacy should not be compromised by the sharing of such data. It suggests that the industry and regulators \"address privacy challenges associated with the collection, use, and sharing of automated vehicle data\", with collaboration from privacy experts outside the automotive industry. \nGoogle is already testing self-driving cars on the roads. In October, electric carmaker Tesla announced that all the cars it now builds will have the hardware installed to drive on their own. \nIn the UK, an autonomous vehicle was test-driven in Milton Keynes in the summer, with further trials in London planned.",

      "text": "Editors' Note: This story was updated on Dec. 2 with news of Apple's tool for eligibility. As we reported last month , Apple is starting a battery replacement program to fix a bug that's causing certain iPhone 6s models to randomly shutdown due to faulty batteries. Now, we've learned that you can check whether or not your iPhone qualifies for this new battery program, using a new tool made available from Apple itself.\n\nImage: Samuel C. Rutherford / Tom's Guide More Image: Samuel C. Rutherford / Tom's Guide \n9to5Mac reported that you can check the characters in the \"4th and 5th\" position match an item in a list below to see if your iPhone 6s qualifies. The lack of a source for this information, though, gave me doubt, so I reached out to Apple Support and an agent told me that you can't check it yourself. \nMORE: Best Places to Buy and Sell a Used iPhone \nThe fastest way to find out is to visit this page and enter your iPhone's serial number into the form at the top and click Submit . You can find the serial number by opening Settings , tapping General and then tapping About .\n\nAlternatively, you can find out your device's status by visiting Apple's Support page . Once you're there select iPhone , select Battery, Power & Charging , select Unexpected shutdown or restart , select No and select a customer support option such as Chat . This way you can read the serial number to an Apple advisor to confirm its eligibility. \nTo prepare your iPhone for the battery replacement, first backup the handset to iTunes or iCloud . Then, disable Find My iPhone by opening Settings , tapping iCloud , tapping Find My iPhone , turning off the switch next to Find My iPhone . Your iPhone will then prompt you to enter your iCloud password and tap OK . \nThe battery replacement program covers \"iPhone 6s batteries for 3 years after the first retail sale of the unit,\" so you don't need to worry about the expiration of your warranty or AppleCare. That said, using the program won't extend your warranty. \nWhile we bet users would be excited for the chance to solve this wonky problem, Apple notes that the battery malfunction \"is not a safety issue\" ( see what they did there? ) and that it \"affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015.\" So don't worry about rushing down to your nearest Apple store (or Authorized Apple Service provider) immediately. \nBefore going to a store for the program, call first and ask about the status of the battery replacement program for that store. It appears that not all stores have the program up and running at the moment, and we've seen reports that some stores have the replacement battery parts on backorder. \nWhat's causing the problem? Apple hasn't said officially, though Business Insider reports that a note on Apple's Chinese language website blames the problem on a battery component being exposed to ambient air for too long before it was assembled.\n\nSee also : Best Big Phones: Top Picks 5.5 Inches or Larger \nSmartphones with the Longest Battery Life The 10 Best Smartphones You Can Buy\nOur Favorite Phones For Taking Photos",

      "text": "Apple Shows Ambition to Get Into Self-Driving Car Race Reddit \nApple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on US regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The November 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience - to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" Apple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since September 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles. \n© Thomson Reuters 2016",

      "text": "Apple reveals self-driving car plans Monday 5th December , 2016 4:10 am Apple has acknowledged for the first time that it is investing in building a self-driving car. \nIn a letter to US transport regulators, Apple said it was “excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation”. \nIt added that there were “significant societal benefits of automated vehicles” to be realised. \nThere have long been rumours about the firm’s plans but it has not publicly admitted them. \nHowever, Ford, which itself plans to have self-driving cars on the road by 2021, has said it was working on the basis that Apple was building one. \nThe tech firm has already registered several car-related internet domains, including apple.car and apple.auto. Sharing data \nA company spokesman for Apple said that the letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was prompted by its “heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems” and that it wanted to help define best practices in the industry. \nThe five-page letter, written by Apple’s director of product integrity Steve Kenner, urges the regulator to not introduce too many rules on the testing of self-driving cars, saying that “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” \nIt also proposes that companies in the industry share data from crashes and near-misses in order to build a more comprehensive picture than one company could manage alone, and therefore enable the design of better systems. \nHowever, it adds that an individual’s privacy should not be compromised by the sharing of such data. It suggests that the industry and regulators “address privacy challenges associated with the collection, use, and sharing of automated vehicle data”, with collaboration from privacy experts outside the automotive industry. \nGoogle is already testing self-driving cars on the roads. In October, electric carmaker Tesla announced that all the cars it now builds will have the hardware installed to drive on their own. \nIn the UK, an autonomous vehicle was test-driven in Milton Keynes in the summer, with further trials in London planned. \n–",

      "text": "0 iPhone game of the year “Tiny Wings” now has an Apple TV version which includes new levels and features. Andreas Illiger \nApple iPhone’s 2011 game of the year is headed to Apple TV. The popular iOS game “Tiny Wings” now has its own Apple TV version which the tech giant launched on Thursday. The game has also been updated for the first time in years. \n“Tiny Wings” was developed by German game developer Andreas Illiger and was launched on Feb. 18, 2011. The title was an App Store top grosser for a couple of weeks starting late February to early March 2011. “Tiny Wings” was voted as the best iPhone game of the year in 2011, selling a combined 12.3 million copies on both iPhone and iPad devices according to Apple's Game Center data. \nThe launch of “Tiny Wings” on Apple TV is somewhat surprising. The game has been updated for only the third time since its release and the first time since August 2014. The new update added resolution support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus’ larger displays. It also included new levels and an Apple TV controller feature that allows users to use their iOS devices as a controller for the “Tiny Wings” TV app. \nREAD: 'Super Mario Maker Nintendo 3DS' Australia launch: Price and details revealed \nIn “Tiny Wings,” the player controls a bird that isn’t able to fly wings due to its small wings. The objective is to use hills to increase momentum and flap where possible to make the bird fly. Timing is required to allow the bird to glide down hills and fly over them. “Tiny Wings” reception has been extremely positive, thanks to its simple gameplay and intricate details. \nThe Apple TV version of “Tiny Wings” is available for US$2.99 (AU$3.99). The TV game allows two-player gameplay via split screen where a Siri remote is utilised along with an iPhone or iPad as the secondary controller. All progress made on the iOS version can be synced with the Apple TV app as well, so no work or play is wasted.",

      "text": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation.\n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\"\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)",

      "text": "0 A new iMac computer is seen follownig a presentation at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California October 16, 2014. Reuters/Robert Galbraith \nThe Apple iMac 2017 is a highly-anticipated device and the all-in-one (AIO) computer is expected to come with some interesting specs. The debate currently is on the processor the iMac 2017 is going to sport. Many believe, the release of the iMac 2017 got delayed due to the Kaby Lake processor that Apple is incorporating into the device. \nNumerous reports have suggested that the Apple iMac 2017 may be released during the next Apple event. The logical choice for Apple has to be the Intel Kaby Lake chipset though supply delays may force the Cupertino-based tech giant to go for the Skylake SoC, just like the Apple MacBook Pro 2016. \nIntel could be revealing its latest high-advanced Kaby Lake processors at the Consumer Electronics Show 2017 in Las Vegas. As the upcoming AIO is expected to be decked with features, a Kaby Lake chipset can only make them better. The Kaby Lake chipset is required to run all high-end features successfully. \nSome of these top features include a 4-core processor, 5K Display and native support for 4K video. Tech enthusiasts believe that the iMac 2017 will be a precious possession for graphic artists, film and photography professionals. Other potential specs USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, Touch ID and Touch Bar. \nFor many, the Apple iMac 2017 is long overdue. Hence, they all want a very powerful device that can make up for this long refresh gap. The 27-inch model may also be VR-ready. The MacBook Pro 2016 has recently got the touch strip along with a fingerprint scanner. The Apple iMac 2017 could become the first VR-ready Apple desktop. \nIf this feature really comes to the iMac, Apple will have an instant upper hand over Microsoft Surface Studio writes iTech Post . A 16GB RAM in iMac 2017 may also become the new standard for all iMac devices. A full Flash Storage is also expected. \nStay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the Apple iMac 2017.",

      "text": "Apple revealed that iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain condition. Apple has acknowledged and apologised for the iPhone 6s battery issue which causes an unexpected shutdown following faster battery degradation.\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant addressed the iPhone 6s battery issue on its Chinese website last week. The statement published on Apple’s website explains, “iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs,\" which caused these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and led unexpected shutdowns to occur.\nApple on its website highlighted not to consider the battery issue as a safety issue.\nApple is offering customers, who are experiencing the issue, replacement of batteries free of charge. iPhone 6s owners can easily find out if their device is eligible by typing in their device’s serial number on the iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues web page.\nApple also revealed that iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain condition, such as extremely cold temperature. “To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage,” Apple said.\nApple had looked for any other factors that could cause the iPhone to shut down unexpectedly, however it could find any new factors. “After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyse customer reports,” Apple added.",

      "text": "The Apple Watch Series 2 is the company’s second-generation smartwatch The existing Apple smartwatches come in a square design. The Cupertino tech giant feels that there is not much function that a circular design can offer to its consumers for the time being. “When a huge part of the function is lists, a circle just doesn’t make sense,” Apple Design Chief Jony Ive had said to The New Yorker last year. However, it seems like things are about to change as far as that statement is concerned.\nApple’s latest patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) titled ‘Electronic device having display with curved edges,’ suggests that the company might be exploring the possibility of a round watch. While the company had filed the patent way back in 2015, the former was only approved of recently.\nApple’s latest patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) titled ‘Electronic device having display with curved edges,’ suggests that the company might be exploring the possibility of a round watch.\nIf rumours are believed to be true, Apple is likely to compete with other major companies like Samsung, Huawei and Motorola with similar circular design smartwatches in the coming year.",

      "text": "Renzi resigns, Apple takes the wheel, Tweeter-in-chief Italy’s prime minister suffers heavy defeat in another blow to the European establishment by: Mercedes Ruehl and Neil Munshi \nSign up to receive FirstFT by email here \nIt was a momentous weekend for European politics. In another blow to the European establishment, Italy’s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi suffered a heavy defeat in a referendum on his constitutional reforms and announced his intention to step down. The result has plunged Italy into political crisis and raises fears of banking system turmoil . The euro dropped to its lowest since March 2015 in Asian trading on Monday after Mr Renzi conceded defeat. \nThe string of populist victories across the EU and the US this year did hit a snag in Austria however, when the left won the presidency on Sunday. Voters rejected far-right Freedom party candidate Norbert Hofer in favour of Alexander Van der Bellen, a Green politician who ran as an independent. The result is a relief for Europe’s mainstream political leaders. (FT, Economist) In the news \nTweeter-in-chief A diplomatic firestorm was kicked off at the weekend after president-elect Donald Trump’s phone call with Taiwan’s president — the first between a leader of Taiwan and a US president or president-elect in more than 30 years. A rattled Beijing initially played down the impact on relations — but Mr Trump had a late-night outburst on Twitter , using language that is difficult for China to ignore. Stay tuned. (FT) \n‘A very expensive mistake!’ In a separate round of tweeting, Donald Trump stepped up his warnings that US companies will be punished for shifting production overseas. The president-elect said he would impose a punitive 35 per cent tariff on US companies that import products from their factories abroad. (FT) \nJohn Key resigns New Zealand’s prime minister, citing family reasons and the need to make room for new political talent, said it felt like “ the right time to go ” and that he wanted to leave on his own terms ahead of next year’s general election. (FT) \nApple takes the wheel The tech group for the first time publicly acknowledged its plans to develop self-driving cars , with a letter that urges the US highways regulator to promote “fair competition” between newcomers to the automotive industry and traditional manufacturers. (FT) \nCarl Icahn and the EPA One of the billionaire investor’s companies is facing hundreds of millions of dollars in costs to comply with an Environmental Protection Agency regulation. He has been a harsh critic of the EPA — and now he’s helping his friend Donald Trump pick its next leader . (WSJ) \nStanding Rock victory The US Army has decided not to allow an oil pipeline to go under a reservoir on land it controls in North Dakota in a move praised by protesters. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have been protesting against the multibillion-dollar Dakota Access pipeline since April . The win is more of a temporary reprieve, writes the FT’s Ed Crooks . (BBC, FT) It's a big day for \nBrexit The Supreme Court is due to hear the government’s appeal against a ruling that Prime Minister Theresa May cannot trigger Article 50 to leave the EU without approval from MPs in one of the biggest constitutional cases for decades. All 11 justices at the UK’s highest court will hear four days of arguments starting with the government, which will say the earlier court was wrong to back claimants led by Gina Miller, co-founder of fund manager SCM, and hairdresser Deir Dos Santos. (FT) \nKeep up with the important business, economic and political stories in the coming days with the FT’s WeekAhead . Food for thought \nUBS chairman says markets are not ready for central bank shifts Axel Weber, former head of the Bundesbank, warned that investors are dangerously unprepared for a sharp rise in eurozone bond yields when US interest rates march higher and European quantitative easing ends. (FT) \nBusiness since birth A deep dive into the Trump children, the president-elect’s closest advisers, and the myriad of tangled conflicts of interest that await the first family and the country. (NYT) \nThe last diplomat As Robin Raphel worked for the state department in Pakistan, her brand of traditional diplomacy ran into the new realities of covert surveillance . The collision turned her life upside down. (WSJ) \nThe weight of corporate debt After Donald Trump’s pledge to push for an aggressive fiscal stimulus of the US economy, recent blockbuster corporate debt sales suddenly look like hallmarks of a very different market environment. As investors and markets try to anticipate what a Trump presidency will mean, one early conclusion is that a dose of fiscal shock treatment will result in much higher interest rates and accelerating inflation. (FT) \nA man on the verge of a nervous breakdown A long profile of Pedro Almodóvar , the Spanish director of raunchy, transgressive films. (New Yorker) \nThe best books of 2016 From Sebastian Mallaby’s The Man Who Knew to Paul Beatty’s Man Booker-winning The Sellout , from science to the arts to poetry, the FT names the best tomes of the year . (FT) \nVideo of the day \nA look at the week ahead Seb Morton-Clark looks at the big stories in the coming week, including a meeting of Nato's foreign ministers following Donald Trump’s election victory, the health of Europe's tourism industry on the back of tour operator Tui's full-year results, and eurozone business data.

By: Tech Desk | Published:December 5, 2016 11:38 am Apple security lock can be bypassed easily on iPhone and iPad: Here’s how a Kerala youth managed to do so. \nApple has always focused on user privacy and security, but it looks like the company’s ‘Activation Lock’ feature can be easily bypassed. Hemant Joseph, an engineering student from Kerala who calls himself a security researcher, managed to bypass through Apple’s secure activation lock on a second-hand iPad he bought from eBay. \nJoseph put out the details on his blog and in a video he shared on Google Drive. Incidentally the same vulnerability was also discovered by researchers at Vulnerability Lab, who have also put out a video bypassing the activation lock with a similar trick. \nAccording to Joseph, he bought an iPad Air on eBay, but it was still linked to the previous owner’s account thanks to the Find My iPhone feature. The feature ensures that a new user cannot sign into your iPhone or iPad device, when it is stolen, and thus ensures that your data is protected. However, Joseph’s trick proved that iOS 10.1 has a pretty simple bug, which can help anyone bypass the activation lock. \nEssentially on the activation lock page, Joseph went to the Secure WiFi connection and and then chose a new WPA2-enterprise network as the option. He processed to fill the username and password fields with 1000s of random characters because he figured that nobody keeps a WiFi password or user name that was so long, and it might cause iPad to crash. That’s what happened. He then tried the same thing, but with an iPad smart case where the magnetic case which shows the old screen when the cover is lifted. \nAlso read: Apple users facing calendar, photo album spam: Here’s how to deal with it \nIn Joseph’s case, once WiFi page crashed and he opened the smart case it showed the original home screen for a few seconds. The bug was discovered in iOS 10.1, but Apple has patched it in iOS 10.1.1, according to a report on Security Week. He also contact the Apple Security team, who got in touch with him over the bug. \nThe issue was also discovered by researchers at Vulnerability Labs, except they used the screen rotation feature and Night Shift mode to bypass the issue. They’ve apparently managed to replicate it in 10.1.1 as well, but Apple has not commented on the same. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ",

Though I took off my Trade of the Week (short iShares Russell 2000 Index (ET ( IWM ) calls and long IWM puts) -- which worked like a charm and was quite profitable. I cleaned up tag ends in a number of very small shorts Thursday and took off five names from my Best Ideas List. Halved my favorite large-cap long, DuPont ( DD ) , and my favorite large-cap short, Coca-Cola ( KO ) , down to small size, based on changing risk/reward ratios. A short grows in Apple ( AAPL ) . I covered half of my remaining Starbucks ( SBUX ) short at around $55.25 after the Howard Schultz resignation announcement. Thoughtful \"El Capitan\" comments/input .\nClosed-end muni bond funds and more . Peak Refinancings . Danielle and the French Connection . The downside to lower tax rates for Citi ( C ) and the other financial intermediaries. Regarding the Donald Trump speech at the Carrier facility, I have some brief thoughts: I believe that speech was one of the more reckless speeches I have ever heard from a president or president-elect. Let me explain. To me it is chilling when companies are threatened -- and many Republicans and Democrats will think the same. To say, public/tax policy will made on the basis of making companies fearful is insane. A president should want to create a sustainable atmosphere in which companies will stay in the U.S., not participate in ad hoc or isolated and random attacks on companies. While the president has vast powers, I don't even think he has the \"authority to tax heavily at the border.\" What criteria is he basing such a decision on? This is going to be an eventful four years.",

      "text": "Other companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation.\n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\"\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.",

      "text": "Apple iPhone 5s. Foxconn is among the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturers. It also assembles products for brands such as Apple and Sony. The company has a work force of over one million employees across all its factories in China. However, the tech giant has faced a number of scandals in the recent years especially from employees.\nRecent report suggests that a former senior manager at Taiwan has been accused of stealing and selling 5,700 iPhones, worth US$1.56 million in China. The manager is identified by his family name, Tsai. He worked in the testing department.\nAccording to Taiwanese prosecutors, Tsai instructed around eight employees at Foxconn’s factory in Shenzhen city to smuggle thousands of iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s. Tsai and his accomplices sold the testing phones, which were supposed to be scrapped, to stores in Shenzhen and made nearly Tw$50million from 2013 to 2014, said the New Taipei district prosecutor’s office.\n“Foxconn reported the case to Taiwanese authorities following an internal audit and Tsai was questioned after he returned to the island earlier this year and was released on bail,” reported news agency Asiaone. “Tsai was charged with breach of trust and faces a maximum 10-year jail term,” the report added.",

      "text": "Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race Reuters X \nApple is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on US regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company’s most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The November 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation. \n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. \n“Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple’s letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.

      "text": "Technology Apple Confirms Self-Driving Car Interest, 'Investing Heavily' In Automation Apple publicly acknowledged its interest in autonomous vehicles, telling regulators that its work could revolutionize the \"future of transportation.\" (Apple) Reprints \nApple ( AAPL ) has publicly acknowledged its interest in autonomous vehicles, telling transportation regulators that its work could revolutionize the \"future of transportation.\" \nSteve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, in a Nov. 22 letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , said that Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\" \nKenner added, \"Automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple didn't actually confirm a specific project related to autonomous cars, but this is the strongest signal yet. \nApple for years has been rumored to be working on a self-driving car via Project Titan, grabbing executives from Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) and other automakers. Earlier this year Project Titan reportedly had a staff shake-up as Apple's focus appeared to shift from building a self-driving car to the automated systems. \nThe NHTSA letter did indicate Apple's focus is on autonomous systems vs. a full-blown car, but again, didn't say anything definitive. \nApple called for \"fair competition\" between traditional automakers and new entrants. Specifically, the company points out that automakers can do controlled tests of self-driving cars, while upstarts need to seek and receive exemptions. \nApple also backed the NHTSA's idea that companies should share data on accidents and near-misses to improve the software. \nGeneral Motors ( GM ) and Ford Motor ( F ) object to sharing data. \nIn addition to Tesla, General Motors and Ford, Apple faces a slew of other potential autonomous driving rivals. Alphabet ( GOOGL )-unit Google has been testing autonomous systems and cars for years. Mobileye ( MBLY ) is working with BMW and Intel ( INTC ) on an autonomous vehicle. Mobileye and auto parts giant Delphi ( DLPH ), using Intel chips, plan on creating autonomous systems for use by carmakers.",

      "text": "Apple Confirms Interest In Autonomous Tech In Letter To NHTSA | By Share For the first time, Apple has confirmed that it is indeed investing into autonomous driving systems in a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Written by Apple’s director of product integrity, Steve Kenner, the letter doesn’t specially reference a potential vehicle which the technology company may be developing and instead focuses on its interest in machine learning and automation and pinpoints transportation as a key area of interest.“Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” the letter says. The letter also tells the NHTSA that new entrants in to the auto industry should have the same rights as established companies. As it stands, existing automakers don’t have to pursue exemptions when testing vehicles on public roads but new companies do. In the letter, Apple also describes the importance of data sharing for autonomous technologies.“By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone. This will allow everyone in the industry to design systems to better detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios.... Data sharing should not come at the cost of privacy. Apple believes that companies should invest the resources necessary to protect individuals’ fundamental right to privacy.\" Until Apple releases a statement to the contrary, the latest reports claim that the brand’s ambitions to launch a self-driving, all-electric vehicle have been scrapped and that it is instead focusing solely on developing autonomous systems.

      "text": "Jody-Anne Lawrence Bragg Organic, Apple Cider Vinegar \nI love products and I do not know a 'naturalista' who does not. But using a lot of products causes build-up, and that means our hair needs a proper cleanse to get rid of all that build-up. \nFor that, there is nothing better than apple cider vinegar with the mother, of course. \nIf there was ever anything that I am addicted to (besides food) it would be hair products. I love my hair feeling and looking a particular way especially when trying to achieve the perfect twist out. So apart from mixing - I use a little bit of this, a little bit of that - and even after finding a product that works, I have to find a back-up plan in case the one I love is hard to get, and then a back-up plan for that back-up plan. Mixing and matching products for the perfect concoction is also a must. So my hair gets a battering even though I do try to wash it weekly. \nSULPHATE-FREE RULE \n\nNow, if you follow the sulphate-free shampoo rule, which I most certainly do, you will realise that even though you wash your hair frequently, there comes a time where it looks dull and does not have that clean feel. \nI am not here to tell you about the pH of your hair, because I am not a hair expert, and pH sounds like something in chemistry class. But I will tell you about a good cleanse. I heard about vinegar from a friend, and I thought that using any kind of vinegar in my hair was utter madness. However, I am a don't-knock-it-until-you-try-it kind of girl - so I tried it. \nI bought a spray bottle and got Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar with the Mother (that is the one that has been strongly recommended. I have not tried any other). I filled the spray bottle with half apple cider vinegar and half water. I fully saturated my hair, and the result was amazing. I am yet to find a shampoo that stripped my hair so clean. You will be happy if you try it, trust me. \nYou can repeat it if you are concerned that you can't get all the build-up off in one rinse. You can also detangle your hair with the apple cider vinegar in it. I tried it and it worked. My hair tangles very easily - I will say the strands are in love because they love to form knots, but the apple cider vinegar takes care of that. \nDEEP CONDITION A MUST \n\nYou then rinse with water and deep condition. Since your hair will be completely stripped, deep conditioning is not a recommendation, it is a necessity. You do not use apple cider vinegar without deep conditioning, ever! If you do not have the time to deep condition, use a shampoo until you have the time. \nI wash my hair weekly or every other week, but I use the apple cider vinegar once a month, or one every two months. You will feel when your hair needs it. I do not recommend you strip your hair every week because it can weaken your hair causing breakage. Too much of a good thing can be bad - everything in moderation. \n• For tips and suggestions email ",

      "text": "November 15, 2016 U.S. urges stronger security for internet-enabled devices \nApple users have been hitting the forums discussing ways around the issue. The programming forum StackExchange crowd-sourced solutions and came up with the following workaround: Using a desktop computer, log into the iOS Calendar function, select “preferences,” then “advanced,” then switch how invitations are received in the”invitations” section by clicking away from “in-app notifications” to the”e-mail to” option. This will turn off the function that automatically pushes event invitations into the Calendar app and forces them into the regular inbox, meaning that users can delete the invitation rather than being forced to accept or decline it. \nAlternatively, a TechCrunch tutorial recommends creating a new and separate calendar to filter spam events into, just like how a spam filter works in most e-mail inboxes. Unwanted messages can be directed to this new spam-specific calendar by opening the invitation and selecting the new calendar destination, then repeating for all invitations from the spam senders. From there, users can delete the spam calendar invitations without notifying the spammer that their address is valid. The key is to hit “delete and don’t notify” to make sure that spammers don’t receive the message. \nFor Photo Sharing, the only way to fix the issue is by turning off iCloud syncing features, as 9to5Mac explains. Users can navigate to the “settings” menu and hit “disable” for the iCloud Photo Sharing feature. Tags:",

      "text": "Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race Sat Dec 3, 2016 3:53pm EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O: Quote ) is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation. \n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote. \n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\" \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.

      "text": "Print Subscribe \nRecently, Apple has given a near clean indication that it is ambitious of joining global race of driverless cars makers. Apple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed US’ National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nMoreover, Apple CEO Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nFurthermore, according to a news report by Reuters , a five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company’s most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation. Advertisement \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motors, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors and General Motors. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Invested $710,000 in A revolutionary Waterless Toilet \nFew knows that The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a private foundation founded by Bill Gates and his wife in year 2000 has funded a project four-years back which is called – “Nano Membrane Toilet” or Waterless Tiolet which will be able to treat human waste on-site without external energy or water. \nThe waterless toilet is being developed by developers at Cranfield University . \nThe Cranfield toilet is still under development. The toilet flush uses a unique rotating mechanism to transport the mixture into the Cranfield toilet without using any water whilst simultaneously blocking odour and the user’s view of the waste. \nThe Nano-membrane is expected to be heading its way to India as well, for information on same keep looking at this space. 48",

The other 8 countries included in this development are Egypt, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Tanzania and Vietnam. \nAs such, prices of paid downloads on these local App Stores be no more be shown in US dollars but rather, the App Store in these markets will now show prices of apps and In-App Purchases in their domestic currency. \nAs for developers, they have been sent a mail notifying them of changes in the pricing policy as their proceeds will be changed from US Dollars to the local currency used to purchase their products. “We will automatically assign a respective price for current and future price intervals for your subscriptions to the nearest retail available in the local currencies,” the company notified developers. \nFor users who already are on auto-renewable subscriptions, their subscriptions for apps in these countries won’t be interrupted as a result of the change but they will receive an email from Apple informing them of the currency change. 0",

The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. Apple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses. \nData should be sufficient to reconstruct the event, including time-series of vehicle kinematics and characteristics of the roadway and objects. By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone. This will allow everyone in the industry to design systems to better detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios. \nApple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously",
