      "text": "Amazon is the US’s largest online retailer, and there aren’t many things on this big blue sphere that you can’t buy through an Amazon checkout. Automobiles, for a long while, were one of the site’s few blind spots, but not anymore. Reuters reports that the online shopping behemoth has struck a landmark deal with Fiat Chrysler to sell three different models via the web, and for a pretty significant discount over what a dealership charges. The cars, which will initially only be available to Amazon shoppers in Italy, are the 500, 500L, and Panda — the best selling car in Italy as a whole. \nMUST SEE:  ‘The Grand Tour’ recap: So, uh, ‘Top Gear’ is back \nBuying a car from Amazon might sound like a ridiculously risky maneuver, so Chrysler is going to sweeten the pot in a big way; the company plans to enhance some of its existing promotional pricing but up to one-third for those shopping on Amazon.\nThe cost savings is a boon for the would-be car buyer, but it makes sense for the manufacturer as well. After all, if a car shopper is buying the vehicle online, there’s no haggling and less upfront cost for the company. A customer buying online doesn’t waste an hour or more of a sales rep’s time, there’s no commission to be paid, and no wear and tear as a test driver kicks the wheels and floors the gas pedal.\nStill, dealerships haven’t been entirely removed from the equation: Amazon buyers will be contacted shortly after their purchase and directed to an authorized dealer to sign off on the paperwork and actually pick up the vehicle. There is expected to be a delay of less than two weeks between ordering and pick-up.\nTrending right now: \n10 hidden iPhone tricks Apple never told you about All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon Release date for Pokemon Go Generation 2 might have just leaked See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "12:00 AM, November 20, 2016 / LAST MODIFIED: 12:00 AM, November 20, 2016 Fiat Chrysler teams up with Amazon to sell cars online 0 Copy this link Reuters \nFiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said it has teamed up with U.S. internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online offering an additional discount. \nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon. It will be limited to three models - the 500, the Panda and the 500L. \nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy's biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to. \n\"The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,\" Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said. The manager at the world's seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that existing promotions will be improved by up to 33 percent for online customers. \n ",

      "text": "Amazon’s Marketplace merchants get help ‘poking the dragon’ for profit   2:25 pm Rachel Greer, head of Cascadia Seller Solutions, an advisory for Amazon merchants. She’s in her home office in Lynnwood. (Greg Gilbert/The Seattle Times) For some third-party merchants who sell wares on the Amazon website, dealing with the company can be so bewildering that a cottage industry of consultants has sprung up to help them navigate the company’s rules and practices. Share story Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter \nTo some of the independent merchants who make a living from selling on Amazon.com, the tech giant can come across as baffling and unforgiving if they run afoul of its rules. \n“I’m afraid of them. I’m afraid to send them an email because you never know what their guy’s going to do,” David Gruman, a New Jersey merchant who runs a large apparel and beauty products reselling business, says of the Amazon team charged with keeping merchants in line. “I call it poking the dragon.” \nThat’s where Chris McCabe comes in. \nMcCabe is a former seller-performance investigator at Amazon who is now an independent consultant. He helps merchants like Gruman communicate with Amazon analysts who evaluate hundreds of troubled sellers a day. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \n“It’s kind of like being a translator or an interpreter,” McCabe says. \nGruman employs McCabe on a retainer basis, and he’s not the only one. The Boston-based consultant has clients as far as China. “There’s a tsunami of work coming to me on a daily basis,” McCabe says. \nMcCabe is part of a growing industry of consultants, in many cases former Amazonians, who purport to offer insight into the mysteries of the Seattle colossus. \n“It’s become a big thing” in the past three years or so, says Rhonda Schneider, the organizer of the Sellers’ Conference for Online Entrepreneurs, a twice-yearly gathering for online merchants, about the consultants. \nThe proliferation stems from the rapid growth of Amazon’s Marketplace, the platform that allows third-party merchants to hawk their wares and who now account for half of the items sold on Amazon.com. Consultants’ claim \nMany of these consultants claim they owe their livelihood to how Amazon has become stricter in recent years, as it tightens up what for years was a freewheeling arena. That means an increasing number of merchants running afoul of Amazon’s rules and getting their selling privileges revoked. \nAmazon sees the situation differently. Scott Kubicki, the executive in charge of the seller-support team, says Amazon isn’t becoming stricter, just more effective at communicating already established requirements. \nThe company is focused on creating a seamless self-service experience using machine learning and automated tools to help merchants stay ahead of trouble on their own. \nIt also employs thousands of associates in 30 call centers worldwide to assist merchants with their problems. \nKubicki acknowledges that suspensions of merchants have been rising, but that increase lags far behind Marketplace’s overall growth. \n“Only 1 percent of sellers tell us that we miss the mark,” he said in an interview. \nMichael Ghiyam, co-founder of MaryRuth Organics, a seller of organic supplements, is one of those happy merchants. “Anytime I call, middle of the night, during the day, someone’s picking up the phone,” he says of his dealings with Kubicki’s seller support team. \nHe acknowledges he’s been frustrated before when one of his listings was removed because of a customer complaint. But that forced him to up his game. \n“In hindsight I did see a tremendous benefit,” he says. “For us the pain of going through some of those things did help us improve our product.” \nYet there are enough bewildered sellers to provide fertile ground for a nascent industry of advisers. \nRachel Greer held various roles at Amazon, including in global regulatory compliance and product safety. She left Amazon last year to found Cascadia Seller Solutions, a consultancy that promises to help merchants navigate “Amazon’s murky, snake-infested waters” and stay compliant with the company’s policies. \nHer firm helps clients deal with product-quality issues, customer service and brand development. From her experience at Amazon “I knew that a lot of third-party sellers didn’t know anything about policy and compliance,” she said in an interview. \nGreer says she has helped about 160 clients so far and now has seven full-time employees. “We’re very busy — to the point that I’m just completely overwhelmed,” Greer said. \nAttorneys are also jumping into the mix. C.J. Rosenbaum, a New Yorker, calls himself the “Go-To Amazon Attorney.” \nRosenbaum helps clients deal with intellectual-property complaints, which occur when merchants are accused of purveying fakes or selling a restricted product without authorization. \nThe latter is increasingly common, according to Rosenbaum, as major brands become important players in the Marketplace. \nMany of these brands aim either to sell their wares exclusively or to tightly control distribution, and resellers are often required to get permission from the brand. Rosenbaum claims to help strong-arm brands into responding to these requests. \n“What’s my special sauce? I’m a lawyer, and I can actually address these IP complaints,” Rosenbaum says. “When I write to the brand manager, to the lawyer, I can say this is (B.S.).” \nWhat many merchants fear most is a sudden suspension of selling privileges, usually after customer complaints, shipping delays or other performance issues. \nAmazon typically sends out an email to the merchant announcing the suspension and citing some of the product listings at the source of the trouble. Amazon expects sellers to investigate these issues and respond with a “plan of action” that shows the seller addressed the complaints and is making sure they won’t recur. \nSome sellers find this guidance, and the ensuing feedback, frustratingly vague. Gruman, the New Jersey seller on Amazon, says in 2014 one of his items, a beauty cream, was suspended because customers complained it was inauthentic. Gruman says the reason was that the manufacturer used to make a purple cream and then switched it to a white cream, but it took him a while to suss it out. \n“They don’t tell you the exact complaint,” Gruman says of Amazon. In various emails with Amazon’s seller-performance team, including after submitting the plan of action, “I got a generic response” requesting more information, he said. Merchant banned \nDanielle Strome concurs. A Portland-based merchant, she was banned in April after operating for more than eight years over what she says were unsubstantiated claims of fake items. The emails “left one doubting that a human had been involved in the review or email writing,” she said. \nA typical example, provided by Strome: “Thank you for responding to our request for information. However, the plan of action provided is not viable. We still need more information regarding your plan of action for these complaints before we can reinstate your selling privileges.” Various Amazon emails sent to her in a back-and-forth had very similar wording. \nMcCabe, the consultant, says that in fact there’s a human behind those emails, but the responses are canned. Investigators in the seller-support centers on the globe usually pick responses from a drop-down menu, McCabe says. \nIt’s that way because investigators have to police a market populated by millions of third-party merchants and they have to move fast, according to the consultant. \nMcCabe says many of the merchants submitting plans of action may not be the best communicators, either. \n“Both sides are reading tea leaves,” he says. \nKubicki, the Amazon executive, said the emails “may not be personal, but they help sellers quickly identify action.” The merchants are used to the consistency and structure, he said. \nBut he emphasized that humans are in charge of dealing with suspensions. On average, investigators see five to 10 cases in an hour, but if they run into a complex issue they can spend more time focusing on a single case. “Quality always trumps speed,” Kubicki said. \nThe executive said Amazon “consciously” overstaffs its centers so there are enough associates to help sellers. Those merchants who have a critical issue can be sure an Amazon associate will be reading their email within 15 minutes more than 95 percent of the time. \nAnd if sellers need to chat or talk with seller support, they can get someone on the phone within 40 seconds on average. Most questions are resolved within minutes, he said. \nBut Amazon’s focus is to minimize interactions in the first place, by constantly releasing new self-service solutions, including using artificial intelligence to anticipate sellers’ questions and warn about potential enforcement actions. \nIn the second quarter of this year, more than 85 percent of sellers who were warned by Amazon about a potential enforcement action managed to fix the problem before being suspended, Amazon said. \n“We don’t want to have an intervention if we don’t need to,” Kubicki said.

      "text": "Amazon.com is turning to merchants who sell on its marketplace for extra warehouse space, a less-costly way to expand inventory available for quick delivery.\nInventory available for delivery within two business days expanded by 6 million items under the Seller Fulfilled Prime program, the company announced Thursday. Amazon earlier this year introduced the program, which lets independent merchants sell goods on Amazon as \"Prime Eligible\" even if Amazon isn't handling packaging and delivery.\nIt's the latest sign the world's biggest online retailer can't build facilities quickly enough to meet demand for an ever-expanding assortment of goods that customers want delivered fast and free. Warehouse capacity issues and the cost of new facilities helped increase Amazon's spending on order fulfillment 34 percent in the third quarter. The big expenses caused the Seattle-based company to miss analysts' profit projections, driving down shares 8.8 percent since the results were reported Oct. 27.\nA look at the Amazon warehouse in Kenosha, Wis., as Amazon announces plans to more than double its presence in Joliet, adding a second warehouse that it says will add more than 2,000 full-time jobs. Those positions will be in addition to the 1,500 jobs Amazon announced last summer for Joliet, site of its first Illinois warehouse.\n(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Amazon's revenue is projected to increase 28 percent to $137 billion this year, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The fast growth prompted the company to accelerate its warehouse building spree, with more than 15 fulfillment centers opening in California, Texas, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida that will collectively employ more than 12,000 workers.\nIn addition to adding capacity, Amazon introduced Seller Fulfilled Prime to take advantage of the warehouse space of its merchant partners. Amazon sells its own inventory as well as products owned by merchants who give the company a cut of each sale, similar to a consignment shop.\nMany of those merchants send their products to Amazon warehouses and pay the company extra to handle packing and shipping, which lets their products be listed as Prime eligible. Seller Fulfilled Prime is a way to let select merchants get the Prime label on products without using Amazon's facilities.\nPrime subscribers pay $99 a year for faster, free delivery in addition to other benefits such as access to the company's video service.\nJeff McDonald, owner of Raw Paws Pet Food in Indianapolis, joined the program in August about a year after he began selling products on Amazon. His company had to pass a test by fulfilling 300 orders with little wiggle room for returns, defective products or late shipments, he said.\nIf Amazon is really opening brick-and-mortar grocery stores, it's a big deal Sarah Halzack Rumors have been brewing for about a year now that e-commerce titan Amazon.com wants to open grocery-centric brick-and-mortar locations. In Seattle and Sunnyvale, Calif., there have been reports that outposts are in the works allowing shoppers to drive up and retrieve grocery orders they place...\nRumors have been brewing for about a year now that e-commerce titan Amazon.com wants to open grocery-centric brick-and-mortar locations. In Seattle and Sunnyvale, Calif., there have been reports that outposts are in the works allowing shoppers to drive up and retrieve grocery orders they place...\n(Sarah Halzack) \"It was a really hard approval process,\" he said.\nThe advantage is that he can now list all of the pet food and chew toys in his inventory as Prime eligible to see which ones are the most popular.\nEarlier this year, Amazon began restricting access to its warehouses due to capacity concerns and it changed its fee structure to penalize merchants who store slow-moving and off-season products during the busy holiday shopping period.",

      "text": "Amazon’s Marketplace merchants get help ‘poking the dragon’ for profit  25 pm For some third-party merchants who sell wares on the Amazon website, dealing with the company can be so bewildering that a cottage industry of consultants has sprung up to help them navigate the company’s rules and practices. Share story Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter \nTo some of the independent merchants who make a living from selling on Amazon.com, the tech giant can come across as baffling and unforgiving if they run afoul of its rules. \n“I’m afraid of them. I’m afraid to send them an email because you never know what their guy’s going to do,” David Gruman, a New Jersey merchant who runs a large apparel and beauty products reselling business, says of the Amazon team charged with keeping merchants in line. “I call it poking the dragon.” \nThat’s where Chris McCabe comes in. \nMcCabe is a former seller-performance investigator at Amazon who is now an independent consultant. He helps merchants like Gruman communicate with Amazon analysts who evaluate hundreds of troubled sellers a day. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \n“It’s kind of like being a translator or an interpreter,” McCabe says. \nGruman employs McCabe on a retainer basis, and he’s not the only one. The Boston-based consultant has clients as far as China. “There’s a tsunami of work coming to me on a daily basis,” McCabe says. \nMcCabe is part of a growing industry of consultants, in many cases former Amazonians, who purport to offer insight into the mysteries of the Seattle colossus. \n“It’s become a big thing” in the past three years or so, says Rhonda Schneider, the organizer of the Sellers’ Conference for Online Entrepreneurs, a twice-yearly gathering for online merchants, about the consultants. \nThe proliferation stems from the rapid growth of Amazon’s Marketplace, the platform that allows third-party merchants to hawk their wares and who now account for half of the items sold on Amazon.com. Consultants’ claim \nMany of these consultants claim they owe their livelihood to how Amazon has become stricter in recent years, as it tightens up what for years was a freewheeling arena. That means an increasing number of merchants running afoul of Amazon’s rules and getting their selling privileges revoked. \nAmazon sees the situation differently. Scott Kubicki, the executive in charge of the seller-support team, says Amazon isn’t becoming stricter, just more effective at communicating already established requirements. \nThe company is focused on creating a seamless self-service experience using machine learning and automated tools to help merchants stay ahead of trouble on their own. \nIt also employs thousands of associates in 30 call centers worldwide to assist merchants with their problems. \nKubicki acknowledges that suspensions of merchants have been rising, but that increase lags far behind Marketplace’s overall growth. \n“Only 1 percent of sellers tell us that we miss the mark,” he said in an interview. \nMichael Ghiyam, co-founder of MaryRuth Organics, a seller of organic supplements, is one of those happy merchants. “Anytime I call, middle of the night, during the day, someone’s picking up the phone,” he says of his dealings with Kubicki’s seller support team. \nHe acknowledges he’s been frustrated before when one of his listings was removed because of a customer complaint. But that forced him to up his game. \n“In hindsight I did see a tremendous benefit,” he says. “For us the pain of going through some of those things did help us improve our product.” \nYet there are enough bewildered sellers to provide fertile ground for a nascent industry of advisers. \nRachel Greer held various roles at Amazon, including in global regulatory compliance and product safety. She left Amazon last year to found Cascadia Seller Solutions, a consultancy that promises to help merchants navigate “Amazon’s murky, snake-infested waters” and stay compliant with the company’s policies. \nHer firm helps clients deal with product-quality issues, customer service and brand development. From her experience at Amazon “I knew that a lot of third-party sellers didn’t know anything about policy and compliance,” she said in an interview. \nGreer says she has helped about 160 clients so far and now has seven full-time employees. “We’re very busy — to the point that I’m just completely overwhelmed,” Greer said. \nAttorneys are also jumping into the mix. C.J. Rosenbaum, a New Yorker, calls himself the “Go-To Amazon Attorney.” \nRosenbaum helps clients deal with intellectual-property complaints, which occur when merchants are accused of purveying fakes or selling a restricted product without authorization. \nThe latter is increasingly common, according to Rosenbaum, as major brands become important players in the Marketplace. \nMany of these brands aim either to sell their wares exclusively or to tightly control distribution, and resellers are often required to get permission from the brand. Rosenbaum claims to help strong-arm brands into responding to these requests. \n“What’s my special sauce? I’m a lawyer, and I can actually address these IP complaints,” Rosenbaum says. “When I write to the brand manager, to the lawyer, I can say this is (B.S.).” \nWhat many merchants fear most is a sudden suspension of selling privileges, usually after customer complaints, shipping delays or other performance issues. \nAmazon typically sends out an email to the merchant announcing the suspension and citing some of the product listings at the source of the trouble. Amazon expects sellers to investigate these issues and respond with a “plan of action” that shows the seller addressed the complaints and is making sure they won’t recur. \nSome sellers find this guidance, and the ensuing feedback, frustratingly vague. Gruman, the New Jersey seller on Amazon, says in 2014 one of his items, a beauty cream, was suspended because customers complained it was inauthentic. Gruman says the reason was that the manufacturer used to make a purple cream and then switched it to a white cream, but it took him a while to suss it out. \n“They don’t tell you the exact complaint,” Gruman says of Amazon. In various emails with Amazon’s seller-performance team, including after submitting the plan of action, “I got a generic response” requesting more information, he said. Merchant banned \nDanielle Strome concurs. A Portland-based merchant, she was banned in April after operating for more than eight years over what she says were unsubstantiated claims of fake items. The emails “left one doubting that a human had been involved in the review or email writing,” she said. \nA typical example, provided by Strome: “Thank you for responding to our request for information. However, the plan of action provided is not viable. We still need more information regarding your plan of action for these complaints before we can reinstate your selling privileges.” Various Amazon emails sent to her in a back-and-forth had very similar wording. \nMcCabe, the consultant, says that in fact there’s a human behind those emails, but the responses are canned. Investigators in the seller-support centers on the globe usually pick responses from a drop-down menu, McCabe says. \nIt’s that way because investigators have to police a market populated by millions of third-party merchants and they have to move fast, according to the consultant. \nMcCabe says many of the merchants submitting plans of action may not be the best communicators, either. \n“Both sides are reading tea leaves,” he says. \nKubicki, the Amazon executive, said the emails “may not be personal, but they help sellers quickly identify action.” The merchants are used to the consistency and structure, he said. \nBut he emphasized that humans are in charge of dealing with suspensions. On average, investigators see five to 10 cases in an hour, but if they run into a complex issue they can spend more time focusing on a single case. “Quality always trumps speed,” Kubicki said. \nThe executive said Amazon “consciously” overstaffs its centers so there are enough associates to help sellers. Those merchants who have a critical issue can be sure an Amazon associate will be reading their email within 15 minutes more than 95 percent of the time. \nAnd if sellers need to chat or talk with seller support, they can get someone on the phone within 40 seconds on average. Most questions are resolved within minutes, he said. \nBut Amazon’s focus is to minimize interactions in the first place, by constantly releasing new self-service solutions, including using artificial intelligence to anticipate sellers’ questions and warn about potential enforcement actions. \nIn the second quarter of this year, more than 85 percent of sellers who were warned by Amazon about a potential enforcement action managed to fix the problem before being suspended, Amazon said. \n“We don’t want to have an intervention if we don’t need to,” Kubicki said.

      "text": "oUkTuRkEyIII pennyfarthing88 Nice one Turkey - make a great gift for someone' in answer to the question I liked them all but I think the last one was especially good maybe because of the tribute to the late Paul Walker RIP - amazing how they managed to complete the film without him actually completing it himself. My favorite is Tokyo Drift which was kinda like a spin off? Was the backstory to Han. Personally, thought that was the worst of the series. It was only the backstory after 4 was made, when Tokyo Drift was made they didn't know if the others would make another so technically It wasn't at the time.",

      "text": "‘Small Puddles: The Triumphant Story of Yale’s Worst Oarsman. Ever,’ by Michael Danziger now an e-book on Amazon \"Small Puddles: The Triumphant Story of Yale’s Worst Oarsman. Ever\" by Michael \"Zig\" Danziger Michael \"Zig\" Danziger NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, November 19, 2016 / EINPresswire.com / -- An outrageous new memoir, \"Small Puddles,\" entails true stories of rowing, rites of passage, persistence, and trying to find your way. Michael “Zig” Danziger projects a certain devil-may-care persona. But don’t let the larger-than-life, hail-fellow-well-met routine fool you. Zig’s intense experience as a Yale oarsman is a case study on the journey itself being the reward. He was never going to make the first varsity boat . . . or the second . . . or even the third boat. But he worked his tail off to earn a seat in the fourth boat—and became a Yale Crew legend. \"Small Puddles\" tells the story of those years at Yale and the people who shaped Zig’s one-of- a-kind view of the world. \"Small Puddles\" is a heart-warming and hilarious memoir, but don’t expect any syrupy soft-focus vignettes of New England collegiate life. Zig’s raucous yarns are warts-and-all, high-def windows into the glory days. No punches pulled. \"Small Puddles\" has plenty for everyone, but anyone who has had the good fortune to pull an oar will feel Zig’s pain. Up and down stadium stairs until you can’t walk another step? Barfed after crushing an erg piece? Pulled a power ten? Given a shirt? Gotten a shirt? Been up at 5 am for practice after a big night out? Felt the adrenaline surge at “Êtes-vous prêt? Partez!”? Stood on the bank to cheer friends at The Head of the Charles, The Dad Vails, Eastern Sprints, Henley? Don’t miss this book. \"'Small Puddles' will take its rightful place next to Emory Clark’s Olympic Odyssey and Ginny Gilder’s Course Correction as a classic story of rowing at Yale. Pretty sure Emory and Ginny would kick Zig’s ass in a seat race though…” – Mike Hard, US National Team, World Rowing Championships 1988 and 1989. If you think you might enjoy a version of Halberstam’s \"The Amateurs\" co-authored with Tucker Max, or you’re hoping Quentin Tarantino might direct the film adaptation of \"The Boys In the Boat,\" don’t miss \"Small Puddles.\" About the author After stints at Oxford and Harvard, Danziger became a teacher and found his calling. In 1990, he founded the Steppingstone Foundation, which prepares students from underprivileged and underrepresented backgrounds to get into schools, which led to college and eventually graduation. To date, 2,700 Steppingstone Scholars have graduated from college thanks to their hard work in the Steppingstone Academy. All the while, Danziger had been working on a book about his rowing experience at Yale. The original draft of the book was on the computer that he sold because it was too big to fit into the trunk of his car. Danziger never printed or saved that draft, so he started over. A shade over 30 years after selling that computer, the book, \"Small Puddles: The Triumphant Story of Yale's Worst Oarsman. Ever\" was completed. ",

      "text": "By Tonya Garcia, MarketWatch\nThe off-price retailer is resonating with a key demographic: millennials\nComing off a third-quarter in which Ross Stores Inc. reported a same-store sales increase of 7%, Wedbush analysts say the off-price retailer's in-store experience is driving traffic through the doors and keeping Amazon.com Inc. at bay.\n\"More than half of Ross Stores' comp was driven by traffic, suggesting at least a +4% traffic increase year-over-year,\" Wedbush wrote in a Friday note. \"Given the struggles most retailers are having navigating traffic challenges, we believe this speaks to how relevant the treasure hunt experience is to the customer. We see no reason to expect any near-term impact from Amazon or other e-commerce players.\"\nWedbush rates Ross (ROST) stock outperform and raised the price target to $71 from $67.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/bG130k2AmEt)\nRoss reported sales of $3.09 billion for the quarter, up from $2.78 billion last year and ahead of the $2.96 billion FactSet consensus. Earnings per share were 62 cents, up from 53 cents and ahead of the 56-cent FactSet consensus.\nRoss shares are up 4.4% in Friday trading.\nSee also:Ross Stores raises outlook as profit tops target (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ross-stores-raises-outlook-as-profit-tops-targets-2016-11-17)\nSee also: Wal-Mart could give Amazon a run for its money this holiday season (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-could-give-amazon-a-run-for-its-money-this-holiday-season-2016-11-17)\nCowen & Company analysts walked away from a meeting at the company headquarters this summer believing Ross is Amazon-resistant (AMZN) due to the moderate prices of Ross' goods, the off-price retailer's lower-income demographic and the aforementioned \"treasure hunt experience\" as well. Moreover, Ross has millennial appeal.\nAfter the earnings, Cowen said Ross is its \"top pick\" in the sector.\n\"We are encouraged to see the third quarter comp beat driven by traffic and basket increases, with strength broadly seen across geographies,\" Cowen analysts wrote in a note published Thursday.\nCowen rates Ross shares outperform and raised its stock price target to $74 from $67.\nAnalysts at Stifel aren't quite as bullish about Ross, favoring competitor TJX Cos. (TJX) for three reasons: TJX dominates the off-price market, it has greater growth prospects and a higher dividend yield.\nSee also:Online retailers tighten vice grip on department stores (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/online-retailers-tighten-vice-grip-on-department-stores-2016-11-15)\n(http://www.marketwatch.com/story/online-retailers-tighten-vice-grip-on-department-stores-2016-11-15)\n(https://w.graphiq.com/w/3r0GUz81vzn)\n\"We reiterate our hold rating [on Ross shares] as we believe that the anticipated success of the entry into new markets and the continued improvement of Ross Stores and dd's despite [the anniversary of] peak margins is nearly fully reflected in the share price,\" Stifel wrote in a Thursday note.\nDd's Discounts is a moderately-priced chain of 172 stores located across 15 states.\nStifel raised Ross' price target to $68 from $60.\nSee also:TJX beats but holiday outlook falls short (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tjx-beats-but-holiday-outlook-falls-short-2016-11-15)\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets believe Ross has momentum, \"driven by a continuing increase in traffic, with share gains from mid-tier department stores, improving merchandising at key categories including home with better buying and opportunistic use of packaway, and a new store maturation curve which should alone add low-single-digit percent to comps,\" analysts said in a Thursday note.\nPackaway seasonal merchandise is stored by off-price retailers to sell at a later time.\nRBC rates Ross shares sector perform and raised their price target to $68 from $65.\nRoss shares are up 27.1% for the year so far. the S&P 500 index is up 6.7% for the same period.\n-Tonya Garcia;\n 1922ET\n ",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nShe can’t clean your home (at least not yet), but now she can help you get it cleaned. Amazon Alexa’s newest skill comes from Handy, and allows folks to book a cleaning simply by chatting with Alexa. That marks the first time that the Amazon Echo has made it possible for its users to book a cleaning service using nothing more than their voice. And with Handy’s more than 600,000 customers, you can bet that Alexa will be getting plenty of requests for some tidying up. \n“With the world moving toward a smarter home and technology now performing many of our daily tasks for us, we are excited to be the first and only cleaning app integrated with the Amazon Echo,” said Handy’s CEO and co-founder, Oisin Hanrahan. “We aim to make people’s lives as easy as possible and with the ability to order our services by voice, we are freeing up time that would be spent searching for domestic chores further down the line; just one sentence and it is all in hand.” \nMore : Allrecipes adds an Alexa skill that will help you in the kitchen this holiday season \nTo use the new Alexa Skill, users need only say, “Ask Handy, when is my next booking?” or “Ask Handy to schedule a booking” to their Amazon Echo. From there, Handy (by way of Alexa), can chat with users to confirm a time, date, and location, and even take care of payment online via the credit card associated with the Handy account. \nAlready, Handy is available in 28 cities across 15 states and three countries, and has facilitated over 2.5 million bookings. “It was a natural extension for us to be integrated with The Amazon Echo as the app itself is already designed to give people more time to do the things they enjoy,” Hanrahan added. “We want the experience and process to be as simple, seamless, and effortless as possible and that’s why this integration is hugely significant to us and our customers.” Also watch: PhotoFast iType-C is a Handy iPhone Storage Extension",

      "text": "Home > Web > Amazon customers will be able to buy Fiat Chrysler… Amazon customers will be able to buy Fiat Chrysler cars with an online discount November 19, 2016 4:19 PM Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \n“Alexa, I want to buy a car.” Amazon and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are going to start selling cars online, according to Reuters . Buyers who purchase new cars on Amazon will receive an additional discount over existing promotions. \nThe program will start in Italy and be limited to three models, the Fiat 500, Fiat Panda, and Fiat 500L. According to Fiat, the Panda is the company’s largest selling car in Italy. The Fiat 500 and 500L are included in the Amazon launch program because the young and adventurous buyer demographic of current buyers matches the group the program is reaching for on Amazon. \nMore: Abarth’s reloaded Fiat 500 is a scorpion with a meaner sting \n“The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” said Gianluca Italia, a Fiat Chrysler executive in Italy. The company wants to take advantage of the shift to online purchases and the wide availability of online deals in this initial partnership. \nItalia said prospective buyers who prefer to search for deals at home will be drawn to Amazon as a new car marketplace, particularly because FCA is going to increase any existing promotions by as much as 33 percent for Amazon Fiat purchases. \nIn researching the partnership with Amazon, however, FCA found that while half of the Italians surveyed were fine with buying a vehicle online, almost all (97 percent) still wanted to pick up their new vehicle at a conventional dealer. Therefore, after buyers have clicked through the purchase transaction, Amazon will contact them to have buyers choose a regular dealership where buyers will complete their purchase and pick up their new car. In most cases, cars sold via Amazon should be available within two weeks of online purchase. \nIf the Amazon and FCA program works out favorably for all parties, it could be just the beginning of yet another market disruption by the U.S. internet giant.

      "text": "handy amazon alexa woman in yellow rubber gloves cleaning tv with pink cloth More Daniel Jędzura/123RF\nShe can’t clean your home (at least not yet), but now she can help you get it cleaned. Amazon Alexa’s newest skill comes from Handy, and allows folks to book a cleaning simply by chatting with Alexa. That marks the first time that the Amazon Echo has made it possible for its users to book a cleaning service using nothing more than their voice. And with Handy’s more than 600,000 customers, you can bet that Alexa will be getting plenty of requests for some tidying up.\n“With the world moving toward a smarter home and technology now performing many of our daily tasks for us, we are excited to be the first and only cleaning app integrated with the Amazon Echo,” said Handy’s CEO and co-founder, Oisin Hanrahan. “We aim to make people’s lives as easy as possible and with the ability to order our services by voice, we are freeing up time that would be spent searching for domestic chores further down the line; just one sentence and it is all in hand.”\nMore : Allrecipes adds an Alexa skill that will help you in the kitchen this holiday season\nTo use the new Alexa Skill, users need only say, “Ask Handy, when is my next booking?” or “Ask Handy to schedule a booking” to their Amazon Echo. From there, Handy (by way of Alexa), can chat with users to confirm a time, date, and location, and even take care of payment online via the credit card associated with the Handy account.\nAlready, Handy is available in 28 cities across 15 states and three countries, and has facilitated over 2.5 million bookings. “It was a natural extension for us to be integrated with The Amazon Echo as the app itself is already designed to give people more time to do the things they enjoy,” Hanrahan added. “We want the experience and process to be as simple, seamless, and effortless as possible and that’s why this integration is hugely significant to us and our customers.”\nAlexa texts as you talk — Amazon’s AI assistant can now send SMS messages What can’t she do?

      "text": "amazon fca online car sales fiat l More “Alexa, I want to buy a car.” Amazon and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are going to start selling cars online, according to Reuters . Buyers who purchase new cars on Amazon will receive an additional discount over existing promotions.\nThe program will start in Italy and be limited to three models, the Fiat 500, Fiat Panda, and Fiat 500L. According to Fiat, the Panda is the company’s largest selling car in Italy. The Fiat 500 and 500L are included in the Amazon launch program because the young and adventurous buyer demographic of current buyers matches the group the program is reaching for on Amazon.\nMore: Abarth’s reloaded Fiat 500 is a scorpion with a meaner sting\n“The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” said Gianluca Italia, a Fiat Chrysler executive in Italy. The company wants to take advantage of the shift to online purchases and the wide availability of online deals in this initial partnership.\nItalia said prospective buyers who prefer to search for deals at home will be drawn to Amazon as a new car marketplace, particularly because FCA is going to increase any existing promotions by as much as 33 percent for Amazon Fiat purchases.\nIn researching the partnership with Amazon, however, FCA found that while half of the Italians surveyed were fine with buying a vehicle online, almost all (97 percent) still wanted to pick up their new vehicle at a conventional dealer. Therefore, after buyers have clicked through the purchase transaction, Amazon will contact them to have buyers choose a regular dealership where buyers will complete their purchase and pick up their new car. In most cases, cars sold via Amazon should be available within two weeks of online purchase.\nIf the Amazon and FCA program works out favorably for all parties, it could be just the beginning of yet another market disruption by the U.S. internet giant.\nHas Fiat-Chrysler been cheating on emissions, too? Here’s your FCA brand cheat sheet for every 2017 model-year vehicle",

It has excellent 4.8 star reviews. \nThis is one of my favorite board games out there and it has similarly awesome reviews on Amazon from hundreds of other players. While I’m a huge Settlers Of Catan fan (don’t judge me, so are the Green Bay Packers ), that game requires 3 players, 1-2 hours of time, and often leads to some rather unpleasant fights 😉 \nTicket To Ride Europe combines a high level of strategy in a game that can be played with just 2 people or as many as 5 people in under 1 hour. And it doesn’t end in people giving each other the silent treatment 😀 Posted in Amazon , Games | By Dan Both comments and trackbacks are currently open for this entry. Trackback URI:",

      "text": "SHARE Posted: 6:00 p.m. 0 \nHoliday shopping is rapidly approaching and we online shoppers know what that means: scouring the internet for killer deals. \nIf you're like me, that means heading to Amazon. Aside from Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you probably already know about Gold Box and Today's Deals, but there are other ways to save money on your online purchases. Here are a few insider tips for getting the most out of your Amazon shopping experience. \nShare your Prime Membership. If you're a frequent Amazon shopper, Prime membership can save you some serious cash over the year with its free two-day shipping, unlimited streaming of Amazon Instant Video movies and TV shows and Kindle lending library e-book borrowing. But $99 a year can be a hefty price for some families. \nWhen my mother-in-law was tight on cash last year, we shared our Amazon Prime account with her. While Amazon only recommends sharing your shipping benefits with someone living in your household, they've currently no formal restrictions on it. \nYou can ship to multiple addresses and add any credit cards to the account that you like. As long as you're sharing your account with someone you trust, splitting the cost of the account can make the deal even sweeter. \nThe only mishaps we experienced were the occasional wrong shipping address and/or credit card used, so just remember that each purchaser will need to pay attention every time they click \"place your order.\" \nDiscounted Prime for students and parents. If you're a student with a valid .edu email address, your yearly membership is only $49. Parents can receive Amazon Family free shipping benefits for three months before paying the $99 membership fee. \nTake advantage of 20 percent off diapers and other discounted baby items through the program. Don't forget to subscribe-and-save on items you use all year long. We still have my son's overnight diapers automatically shipped every month, and it's so nice to not have to think about it. \nShop around for the best prices. It can be tedious to bounce around from site-to-site doing price comparisons, but as a savvy shopper you know it's the best way to assure that you get the cheapest price. Enter Wikibuy (www.wikibuy.com), an add-on for iPhone and Chrome desktops. With it, you shop as you normally would on Amazon. Behind the scenes, Wikibuy compares prices at other big retailers like Wal-Mart, Target, and eBay and if it finds a better deal elsewhere, you're notified. \nWorried about buying from an unknown retailer? You'll actually buy the product through Wikibuy and they guarantee your shipment will be on time and that it will match size and color to your Amazon selection, or your money back. \nTake advantage of deal tracking. CamelCamelCamel ( www.camelcamelcamel.com ) tracks prices on Amazon as they change over time. Set a target price, and when Amazon drops below it the website will send you an alert so you can snatch up the deal. The website also provides pricing histories on millions of items so you can see if it's the right time to buy or if you need to wait a few weeks to make your purchase. \nCamelCamelCamel also helps you take advantage of Amazon's 30-day price matching policy. If you purchase a big-ticket item, set a CamelCamelCamel alert so that if the price drops you can request a refund of the difference. \nCoupon clipping isn't just for the grocery store. It's a real feature of Amazon that you probably didn't even know existed. Go to www.amazon.com/Coupons/ to take advantage of savings on everyday items, electronics, tools, toys and more. Simply \"clip\" the coupon by clicking on the deal you want and adding the product to your cart. The discount is automatically applied when you complete the purchase. Sign up for Amazon's email mailer detailing all their daily deals. \nHoney ( www.joinhoney.com ) works with Amazon (and any other online shopping cart), to find discount and promo codes that you can use on items you are ready to purchase. Download the extension to your browser and click it before you check out. It tries all available coupon codes and applies the one that will save you the most money. Honey also automatically searches through all the Amazon third party sellers to find the best price among them. It's not necessarily the one with free shipping. \nShop Amazon Warehouse. You can find big discounts on items that are deemed \"open box\" through Amazon Warehouse. Goods have either been returned, warehouse- or transit-damaged, used or refurbished. You won't receive the manufacturer's warranty, but Amazon's return policy is pretty generous, and Amazon promises that it thoroughly tests the condition of each item before offering it though Warehouse sale. For ease of shopping, consider downloading the Amazon Assistant to your browser to quickly access Warehouse deals. You can find the assistant here: www.amazon.com/assistant. \nAmazon is an outlet store, too. At www.amazon.com/Outlet , you'll find outlet prices and markdowns on electronics, jewelry and clothes all year long. Just like traditional outlet stores, the goods offered are last season's items or discontinued fare. Subscribe to the deals e-mails and receive notification of the Gold Box Deal of the Day delivered to your inbox. \nUse the Amazon app on your phone to shop retail stores. Another way I save is by having the Amazon app on my phone. When I am shopping in a store and I am unsure if it's a good price, I can easily check Amazon by simply scanning the barcode of the item I'm considering buying. \nMany brick-and-mortar retailers will price-match. Often times the item can be purchased at Amazon for cheaper, and shipped to my home for free. No more lugging that large item home from the store.",

      "text": "Amazon will let Italians buy Fiat cars with a click You still have to visit a dealer to finish the deal, but it's easier than usual. Save Reuters/Gary Cameron \nAmazon has made it easier to research cars online, but actually purchasing a car? That's another story. Even a recent deal with Seat in France limited customers to making a downpayment on the web -- they still had to agree to a phone interview to clinch the sale. However, the dream of one-click vehicle shopping just came a bit closer to reality. Amazon is partnering with Fiat to let Italian motorists buy the 500, 500L and Panda on the web at discounts up to 33 percent greater than seen at retail. They'll still have to visit a dealership to complete the purchase, but this is about as direct as it gets if you're not ordering a Tesla . \nOrders should be ready about two weeks after you pull the trigger, Fiat says. \nThis is clearly a competitive move on Fiat's part. While its sales were turning a corner before this (it swung from a loss in Q3 2015 to a profit this year), incentivized online sales could help it keep that edge. You might be more likely to buy a 500 if you can order it from home and get a better bargain. Just don't expect to see dealerships cut entirely out of the loop in the near future. As Tesla learned first-hand , dealers routinely fight attempts to introduce direct sales -- Amazon can get close to that business model, but it faces a backlash if it makes dealerships obsolete.",

      "title": "Amazon's Threat To Netflix Grows As Video Content Spending Booms",
      "text": "Efforts by Amazon ( AMZN ) to significantly expand its global video streaming service will put it near the same level as Netflix ( NFLX ) in how much they spend on content and distribution.\nAmazon on Thursday disclosed on a webpage it will expand its video streaming service to 200 countries, up from five currently, ratcheting up their competition with Netflix. Amazon said it will launch \"The Grand Tour,\" an Amazon original series, worldwide in December. Starting Friday, the series will launch in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Australia and Japan.\nNetflix airs in some 190 countries, with China the only major holdout.\nAmazon did not issue a press release announcing the global expansion, leaving that role to CEO Jeff Bezos in a tweet.\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \n\nJefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald in a research note estimated that the launch of a global video streaming service by Amazon would require an additional $1 billion to $2 billion in video content spending in 2017. That would bring Amazon's annual content expenditure in line with Netflix, at about $6 billion for 2017, Fitzgerald wrote. The $6 billion is up from an estimated $4.5 billion Amazon will spend this year, he estimates.\n\"Three weeks ago Amazon reported a mixed quarter with solid top line performance and soft margins; margin guidance disappointed too. Now we know where a major piece of incremental investment might be going to — digital content for Amazon Video,\" Fitzgerald wrote.\nAmazon missed the consensus estimate on earnings per share by a wide margin when it reported third quarter earnings Oct. 27, while its profit guidance for Q4 also fell short. The main reason for the earnings miss was larger-than-expected investments in video content, Amazon Web Services and an expansion of fulfillment centers.\n\"Considering the fact that in general Amazon makes announcements of strategic initiatives only after the bulk of the necessary assets are already in place, we believe that the company has more or less secured the global rights for a core streaming video offering,\" Fitzgerald wrote.\nAmazon's global rollout begins with \"The Grand Tour\" and is expected to expand rapidly into new markets.\nNetflix, in addition to the increased competition from Amazon is confronting a more aggressive Hulu, which plans to launch a live streaming TV service in 2017, in addition to its original and third-party content. Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney ( DIS ), NBCUniversal parent Comcast ( CMCSA ), 21st Century Fox ( FOXA ) and Time Warner ( TWX ).\nJefferies analyst John Janedis, in a research note on Netflix, said Amazon appears to be aggressively securing digital rights for content in India, much more so than Netflix. In India, Amazon has been developing relationships with local talent and has started making investments in high quality content, je wrote. Janedis has an underperform rating on Amazon and price target of 80. Fitzgerald has a buy rating on Amazon and price target of 950.\nAmazon stock rose 0.50% to 760.16 in the stock market today . Netflix stock rose a small fraction to 115.21.",

      "text": "By Paul Hill Neowin LLC @_paulh93 · 2 seconds ago with 0 comments \nTalkTalk says that it has added an additional 100Gbps of data capacity to its core network to help cope with the demand the company expects to see from Amazon’s The Grand Tour , featuring the ex-trio from BBC’s Top Gear , headed by Jeremy Clarkson. In total, the company has added a total of 200Gbps specifically for Amazon video content. \nThe Grand Tour , which launched on Friday, was probably one of the most anticipated IPTV-based shows to launch. With the show recorded and made available in 4K it has great potential to gobble up a lot of data, hence TalkTalk’s need to increase its capacity. \nGary Steen, TalkTalk’s Chief Technology Officer, said \n“As the show is filmed in ultra high definition 4K, and then streamed on Amazon Prime, there could potentially be tens of thousands of our customers watching it every Friday. That’s why we’ve just invested an extra 100Gb capacity into the core network to cope with the demand we expect to see, putting out Technology team into action so our customers can have a flawless viewing experience. \nThe growing trend to stream shows, and watch whenever you want, is only going to become even more popular for our customer in the future. That’s why we need to make sure our network stays ahead of the game. In total, we’ve added an extra 200GBps (sic) of capacity specifically for Amazon video content including the Grand Tour.” \nAmazon Prime Video recommends a minimum speed of 900Kbps for SD content, 3.5Mbps for its HD content, and 25Mbps for 4K content. \nSource: TalkTalk via ISP Review | Image via Amazon Tags",
