      "text": "November 21, 2016 at 11:26 AM EST New All-in-One Fillet Knife and Gut Spoon Received Well by Amazon Customers \nUltimate Kitchen’s 7” Fillet Knife and Gut Spoon received 4.9 out 5 stars on Amazon. Satisfied customers praise the new cutlery product. Ultimate Kitchen, maker of innovative kitchen products, has received 4.9 out 5 stars based on customer reviews on its page in Amazon for its new product, the all-in-one Fillet Knife and Gut Spoon. The new fillet knife is available in two colors at https://amzn.com/B01ANAIXTQ and https://amzn.com/B01ANAX90O . Carrie, one of those who commented on the page and who gave a five star rating to Ultimate Kitchen’ newest cutlery product, said “this is a must for anyone that fishes.” The happy customer remarked that the knife/spoon did an excellent job cleaning the fish that was caught in their pond. “The knife went through the skin/bones with little effort. The spoon did an excellent job cleaning out the inside,” she observed. Ultimate Kitchen’ 7” Fillet Knife and Gut Spoon is the latest product being launched by Ultimate Kitchen on Amazon. It is made from high-grade 8CR13MoV stainless steel, tempered around the Rc56 to Rc58 range to achieve a good balance of toughness and strength, with a high performance-to-cost ratio. The company released an introductory video on their YouTube account, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsVdI2KQnz0 . It has a non-slip, hunter orange-colored nylon handle, which provides a firm grip while you fillet, preventing the chances of potential injuries from slippery handles. Its built-in gut spoon helps scrape the guts and blood, which lessens the mess in cleaning the fish. The all-in-one fillet knife and gut spoon comes with a custom-fit sheath that is thick and durable to protect yourself from harm, and your knife from the elements. You can even bring it anywhere with you since the custom-fit sheath can be attached to the belt. When you purchase Ultimate Kitchen’ Fillet Knife with Gut Spoon, you will also receive a digital book with instruction guides and demos, as well as recipes. Customers can enjoy 20% discount for every purchase of the product, so that instead of paying $31.20, they may now pay only $24.95 as launch discount given by Ultimate Kitchen to its loyal customers. Free shipping can also be availed of on orders over $49.00. About Ultimate Kitchen: Ultimate Kitchen is a successful division of QRscanit, Inc., located in Coeur d’Alene, ID.

      "text": "Don’t forget there’s also a Tremors 6 coming soon!\nWhile Michael Gross prepares to play monster hunter Burt Gummer at least one more time, Kevin Bacon is currently gearing up for his own return to the town of Perfection. Bacon, who hasn’t been seen in the franchise since the 1990 film, will be reprising the role of Valentine McKee in an upcoming “Tremors” TV series for Amazon, and we’ve got a little update on the project.\nAs reported by fan site Tremors Guide , series writer Andrew Miller just appeared on the podcast The Writers Panel , and he teased what we can expect from the 10-episode series.\nInterestingly, he said the show will tell a “ Donald Trump story. ”\n“The Kevin Bacon character is now 25 years older, a horrible loser in this town that had a brief moment of glory in the ’80s or ’90s and is now worse off than it was before,” said Miller. “The town is coming face to face with failure. It’s also a Donald Trump story in that it’s the notion of nostalgia as a drug that’s killing us and looking back on a time – the longer you look at that time in the mirror without accepting reality, these monsters start to grow beneath the surface. In this case it’s these worms that are literally growing beneath the surface.” \nMiller elaborated on the real-world inspirations for the series:\n“People are trying to get over these traumas and both empower themselves and put themselves in great danger. I think we’re not processing trauma as healthily right now as we could be. I find myself not processing trauma as well as I ought to be and feel like I’m the star of my own horror movie sometimes.” \nThe series will reportedly ignore the events of the sequels.\n\n",

      "text": "Amazon Announces First eSports Tournament For Casual Games By Adnan Farooqui on 11/21/2016 09:10 PST \nAmazon today announced the first-ever eSports tournament for casual games called Champions of Fire Invitational. It takes place in Las Vegas next month. The tournament will see sixteen of the most popular gaming celebrities in the world compete against each other in some of the most popular casual games like Pac-Ma, Fruit Ninja, Crossy Road, and more. They will be competing for a share of the $100,000 cash prize. \nChampions of Fire Invitational is going to be a one-day event held on December 2nd, 2016 from 2 – 9 pm PT at Paris Las Vegas. Tickets will be available for free through the tournament’s website. \nIf you’re not able to make it to Las Vegas to watch the proceedings live, don’t worry, CBS Sports Network is going to air a two-hour special that features highlights from the tournament on December 12th at 7 am PT. \nThis tournament is actually a way for Amazon to promote its Appstore , which hosts some of the best mobile games available for Android devices and often offers a few of them for free as well. \n“The Champions of Fire Invitational will see some of the top gaming pros square off in the same fun games our customers can download and enjoy today from the Amazon Appstore,” said Aaron Rubenson, Director, Amazon Appstore. \nGaming celebrities including Boxbox, Professor Broman, Northernlion, lolRenaynay, Brian Kibler and more will be competing in the tournament. The Champions of Fire tournament is going to be live streamed via Twitch, Amazon Fire TV , Amazon.com as well as social media networks that provide live streaming functionality. \nFiled in Cellphones .

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nFor the past few years I've used a simple tactic to save money when buying gadgets:  I buy them open boxed or refurbished. \nUnless I'm buying a product the day it's released — which is very infrequently these days — I never buy it new.\nInstead, I take advantage of Amazon's \"Warehouse Deals.\" These are products that may have a scratch or two, or may just have dinged packaging.\nIn each case, Amazon gives you a clear description of the product's condition, so you can determine if it's worth it for you. If it is, go for it. If it's not, pass.\nWarehouse Deals have their own section of Amazon, and their own landing page.  They're also listed under the \"Used\" section of an individual product's page. I use these deals all the time and have been very happy with the results — oftentimes the product is in better shape than described.\nBetter yet, all Warehouse Deals have Prime shipping, so you'll get them quickly. \nHaving trouble figuring out what to get people for the holidays? You can check out all of Insider Picks' 2016 gift guides here. \nWired headphones Amazon \nIf you're looking for an incredible pair of headphones, Bower & Wilkins P7's epitomize quality luxury. \n\nI own these headphones (purchased through a Warehouse Deal) and they're incredible sounding and feeling. You can read my full review for more details , but here are the basics: \n\nThe materials used to make these headphones are sheepskin leather and aluminum. They look premium; in fact, they're the best-looking pair of headphones I've used, or seen. They don't sound totally neutral, but they offer the listener incredible clarity. If you want to  really hear every nuance of your favorite albums, these are the headphones to buy.\n\nBowers & Wilkins P7, Warehouse Price $196.59 ($349.98 New )\n\nFull review \n\n\n\nBluetooth headphones Amazon \nI searched, in vein, for seven years trying to find the perfect Bluetooth headphones. That search is over.\n\nAs with the P7's, my full review is available below, but I'll give you the highlights. These over-ear headphones are comfortable, and don't sound compromised.\n\nLike all Bluetooth headphones, the audio will be compressed between your phone and the headphones (less so if you're listening to lossy audio, or streaming), but you don't hear it. What you  do hear is great music. \n\nConnectivity is rock solid. They block out a lot of noise (they don't have active noise cancelling, though). If you're looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones, but don't want to sacrifice quality, these are for you. \nB&O Play Beoplay H8 Bluetooth Headphones, Warehouse Price $299.40 ($455 New)\n\nFull Review \n\n\nA bluetooth speaker Amazon \nSony's H.ear Go speaker is actually a lot like the Beoplay H8 headphones: Wireless without compromise. \n\nYou can use this as a Bluetooth speaker (as I did in my fully review, available below), but you can also connect to it through Wi-Fi, or a cable. This gives you the flexibility to use Bluetooth when you want, but also play full-quality, high-resolution audio files without any degradation.\n\nIn my testing, this speaker came out very well. Its sound quality is rock solid regardless of your genre of choice, and it's available in different colors, which makes it stand out (in a good way.)\n\nSony H.ear Go Bluetooth Speaker, Warehouse Price  $118.40, ($148 New)\n\nFull Review \n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "REUTERS/Rick Wilking \nIt's the holiday season, which means it's time for retailers to bombard you with sales, special offers, and other attempts to sell you things.\nFor many people, the Black Friday-to-Christmas shopping rush will lead to Amazon. It makes sense: The ecommerce giant sells a whole lot of products, and makes it very easy to buy them. Many times, those products are less expensive than they are elsewhere. \nBut not always. Though most people seem to be satisfied  with the Amazon shopping experience, certain aspects of it can still be misleading. \nThankfully, there are tools you can, and should, use to counteract them. Let’s talk about two: Camelcamelcamel , and Fakespot . \n\nFinding a good deal \nThe first is pretty straightforward. Camelcamelcamel is one of many product price trackers floating around the web, but it’s been popular and reliable for the better part of a decade. Simply copy and paste in the URL of whatever item you’re considering, and CCC brings up a chart that lays out how that item's price has fluctuated over time.\n\nFor instance, Amazon is currently promoting  this Dell monitor  as part of a pre-Black Friday sales event.  It's a little dated, but at $199, it's said to be $150 off its list price. \n\n\nScreenshot/Jeff Dunn \nPretty good deal, right? Sort of. Throw  the link into CCC , and you’ll see it’s been at $199 several times in the past. At one point, Amazon had for $185. Over the last few months, it's often sat around $210 or $220. So you're really saving about $10-30, not $150. \nThat's not bad, but on a day like Black Friday, when Amazon and the rest of the internet plan to overwhelm you with so-called savings, it may not be the impulse buy it first appears to be. \n\n\nBusiness Insider/Jeff Dunn \nThere are more egregious examples. Though Amazon is home to many legitimate bargains, its status as the best place to shop is often overblown. Like any other retailer, the vast majority of its \"deals\" aren't really deals — in fact, some independent studies have found it to  promote its own stuff  over cheaper options, and that  Google is often  just as, if not more, competitive. \nThis is all just to remind you that retailers aren't charities. While not perfect — Amazon has prevented certain products from being price tracked in the past — a tool like CCC (or the  browser extension  Keepa) provides the context that Amazon often withholds. That it lets you create a  price watchlist  only helps. \n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "print REUTERS/Rick Wilking \nIt's the holiday season, which means it's time for retailers to bombard you with sales, special offers, and other attempts to sell you things. \nFor many people, the Black Friday-to-Christmas shopping rush will lead to Amazon. It makes sense: The ecommerce giant sells a whole lot of products, and makes it very easy to buy them. Many times, those products are less expensive than they are elsewhere. \nBut not always. Though most people seem to be satisfied with the Amazon shopping experience, certain aspects of it can still be misleading. \nThankfully, there are tools you can, and should, use to counteract them. Let’s talk about two: Camelcamelcamel , and Fakespot . View As: One Page Slides Finding a good deal \nThe first is pretty straightforward. Camelcamelcamel is one of many product price trackers floating around the web, but it’s been popular and reliable for the better part of a decade. Simply copy and paste in the URL of whatever item you’re considering, and CCC brings up a chart that lays out how that item's price has fluctuated over time. \nFor instance, Amazon is currently promoting this Dell monitor as part of a pre-Black Friday sales event. It's a little dated, but at $199, it's said to be $150 off its list price. What the monitor's actual price history looks like. Screenshot/Jeff Dunn \nPretty good deal, right? Sort of. Throw the link into CCC , and you’ll see it’s been at $199 several times in the past. At one point, Amazon had for $185. Over the last few months, it's often sat around $210 or $220. So you're really saving about $10-30, not $150. \nThat's not bad, but on a day like Black Friday, when Amazon and the rest of the internet plan to overwhelm you with so-called savings, it may not be the impulse buy it first appears to be. What the monitor's actual price history looks like. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn \nThere are more egregious examples. Though Amazon is home to many legitimate bargains, its status as the best place to shop is often overblown. Like any other retailer, the vast majority of its \"deals\" aren't really deals — in fact, some independent studies have found it to promote its own stuff over cheaper options, and that Google is often just as, if not more, competitive. \nThis is all just to remind you that retailers aren't charities. While not perfect — Amazon has prevented certain products from being price tracked in the past — a tool like CCC (or the browser extension Keepa) provides the context that Amazon often withholds. That it lets you create a price watchlist only helps. Weeding out shoddy reviews \nFakespot isn’t as plainly beneficial as CCC, but it’s still a good thing to keep tabs on. \nThe literary masterpieces we call Amazon user reviews aren’t always forthright — there’s the inherent shakiness of the user-solicited Amazon Vine program, for one, but it’s also not uncommon for a company to outright fake batches of glowing reviews to boost a product’s appeal. Amazon has fought this for a long time, and is getting better about it. \nThe idea with Fakespot is to quick get a sense of just how genuine those reviews are. Again, all you have to do is paste a link; Fakespot will then analyze the product’s user reviews, and grade them on their trustworthiness. Regardless of how good the monitor is, it looks like we can say Dell hasn't been paying people to build up its Amazon rating. Screenshot/Jeff Dunn \nNaturally, it’s harder for something like this to be foolproof. Fakespot says it primarily judges a review’s authenticity on “the language utilized by the reviewer, the profile of the reviewer, correlation with other reviewers’ data, and [a] machine learning algorithm that focuses on improving itself by detecting fraudulent review,” but sometimes, people with poor English are just excited about a thing. And again, this isn't the only site to use this idea. \nNevertheless, if you’re on the fence about a certain product, especially if it comes from a brand you don't know, it’s always good to be safe. This helps with that. The next time you find a deal that seems too good to be true, just know that it actually might be.

Credit Dado Galdieri for The New York Times The thundering waves of the Pororoca were legendary: Adventurers from the world over flew, drove, trekked, jet-skied and canoed to Brazil ’s remote Araguari River to ride the Amazon’s stunning tidal bore that formed when water flowed in from the Atlantic. But the exhilarating waves that once reached five feet high are gone now, squelched by man-made factors, such as the large-scale ranching of Asian water buffaloes, an invasive species introduced to the Amazon decades ago, and new hydroelectric dams built along the Araguari. Brazilian surfers are expressing anguish about the end of the Pororoca (which means “mighty noise” in the indigenous Tupi language) on the river, in the state of Amapá in northern Brazil. Continue reading the main story Video Shrinking Waves The Pororoca tidal bore in Brazil was last surfed in 2013. Since then, aficionados have been grasping for answers as to how such a wondrous occurrence could cease to exist. By MIGUEL GUTIÉRREZ on Publish Date November 21, 2016. Photo by Dado Galdieri for The New York Times. “The Pororoca in Amapá was the best in the world,” said Serginho Laus, 36, a professional surfer who has pioneered trips to Amapá and set a record in 2003 for surfing nonstop for 6.3 miles. “Now it’s a warning of how man’s actions can change our rivers forever.” Surfers rode the last Pororoca on the Araguari River in 2013. Some blame the buffaloes: For years, ranchers have opened canals from the river to slake their herds’ thirst, while the buffaloes themselves trampled around the banks of the Araguari, depleting the river’s flow, according to environmental activists. The ranchers say two dams diminished the Araguari’s strength. Photo The Araguari River in the state of Amapá, Brazil. Credit Dado Galdieri for The New York Times Either way, the end of what was considered the Amazon’s mightiest Pororoca is a bummer lamented on national newscasts. Some optimists point out that the conditions persist for creating tidal bores, albeit of lesser intensity. When the sun crosses the Equator during equinoxes in September and March, the gravitational and lunar conditions bolster tidal bores as the flow of other rivers around the Amazon is reversed. \nAdvertisement ",

      "title": "Amazon Echo sales reach 5M in two years, research firm says, as Google competitor enters market",
      "text": "\nAmazon’s Echo device has reached a sales milestone, with a new report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimating that the retail giant has sold 5.1 million of the smart speakers in the U.S. since it debuted two years ago.\nThe Echo first went on sale in late 2014 only to Prime members, but became generally available in June 2015. CIRP estimates that approximately 2 million units were sold in the first nine months of 2016.\nAmazon doesn’t release its own sales numbers for the Echo, but CIRP’s estimates line up with other research firms. New York consulting firm Activate Inc. estimated that Amazon sold 4.4 million Echo units in its first full year of sales, after becoming available to the general public in 2015. Taking into account other factors like the number of units required for a household versus an individual, Activate noted that Echo sales are in the same ballpark with early iPhone sales.\nCIRP also reported that awareness of the Echo continues to increase, climbing to 69 percent of U.S.-based Amazon.com customers in September, up from 20 percent in March 2015.\nThe firm, which polled 3,500 Amazon customers, said that the Echo Dot and Echo Tap, two smaller and cheaper versions of the traditional Echo device, accounted for at least 33 percent of sales in the past six months.\nThe Alexa family: Echo, Tap, Dot. The Echo, also sold in the U.K. and Germany, uses the cloud-based AI Alexa to answer queries, control smart home devices , play games with users , set timers , and much more.\nGoogle Home. “Our research shows that more than half of Echo owners use the device as more than a voice-controlled music speaker,” added CIRP co-founder Josh Lowitz. “Users report asking about weather and news, and increasingly controlling other connected devices.”\nAmazon has been called the “accidental” early winner in the voice-controlled home, leading Google, Apple and others with surprisingly strong sales of Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices. Speaking of Google, the search giant just debuted its own smart speaker, Google Home, which some reviewers say is “smarter” than the Echo , but lags behind Amazon’s device when it comes to integrating third-party apps.\nDevelopers have embraced Alexa, building more than 3,000 skills since Amazon opened it up last year . Developers who want to add to Alexa’s abilities can write code that works with Alexa in the cloud, letting the smart assistant do the heavy lifting of understanding and deciphering spoken commands. AT&T announced a new Alexa skill this week that lets users program up to 10 contacts into their Alexa-enabled devices and send them messages via voice command.\nAmazon also started a $100 million fund to invest in companies that will push the boundaries of voice-based interaction. So far, Amazon said, this fund has invested in 16 startups, mostly focused on smart home and wearable products. In the next year, the fund’s scope will expand to include areas like robotics, developer tools, healthcare and accessibility.\nAmazon is discounting its Echo devices for Black Friday this weekend. It is knocking $40 off the traditional Echo and the Tap, and $10 off the Dot.",

      "text": "TOP 5338685 \nAs part of “ Black Friday Deals Week ,” Amazon is offering a sale on a variety of cookware options. This deal includes six different products, such as steamer sets and entire cookware sets. The best bargain, however, is on this skillet . It normally costs $100 but today is just $27. Seventy-five percent of the 139 customers who have reviewed this product gave it the perfect 5 out of 5 stars (Photo via Amazon) \nRachael Ray Hard Anodized II Nonstick 14-inch Skillet with Helper Handle, Gray with Orange Handle on sale for $27.75 \nFor what it’s worth, customer Nicholas Calderone “absolutely loves this plan”: \nI absolutely love this pan. That is what my grandmother says. I bought it for her because she’s been needing a 14-inch pan to go along with the rest of her Rachael Ray pans she has. She had been complaining about not being able fry more then one or two items in the smaller pans and needed something bigger, but wanted to stay with the same style she had with the current set she owned. \nI went to the local stores in my town looking for the 14-inch pan that would match her set but had no luck. I finally found it here and jumped on picking it up for her. When it came in she was so surprised her eyes lit up like a kid in a candy store. \nShe quickly took it to the kitchen and cleaned the pan and started cooking I don’t even think she was hungry she just wanted to try it out. She’s 83 years old and doesn’t get out of the house much so cooking and visiting the store is her entertainment. \nWhen she finished cooking I asked how she liked it and she told me she loves the new pan and is so happy to have this one. It looks very sturdy and has some weight to it. The pan cooked her food evenly and she really likes it. It seems like a great option for anyone needing a 14-inch nonstick pan. \nIf Nicholas’s grandma “really likes it,” I don’t see how anyone could possibly argue against it. \nYou can check out the rest of the cookware deals here: \nSelect Circulon and Rachael Ray Cookware on sale from $27.75 to $118 Rachael Ray uses her skillet (Photo via Amazon) \nHave a suggestion for a cool product or great deal that you think Daily Caller readers need to know about?

      "text": "  S&P at record levels, but Amazon lags ahead of Cyber Monday   17:42:01 GMT Author: share We will buy on Amazon, but will traders buy AMZN? The S&P index is trading at all time record highs today. Yippee. Great news for the broad market. Looking at the daily chart for the SPX above, the price correction into the US election fell to the 200 day MA (green line in the chart above). It actually fell below that MA in after hour trading on Election night but during normal trading hours, the price held the level perfectly. Subsequently, the pair moved above the 50 and 100 day MA a week after the election, and has traded above those MAs since that time. The inability to move below the 100 (blue line) and 50 (white line) day MAs shows a desire to buy from the market traders. Bullish. As we enter the Thanksgiving week in the US, the BIG shopping days lie ahead. Friday is affectionately called Black Friday. Monday has taken the name Cyber Monday. Now there may be some who think those \"sale days\" are not always reflective of the best prices - or the best days - for shopping, but they certainly get a lot of attention, and attract a lot of shoppers. The largest of the largest is Amazon. People will shop on Amazon on cyber Monday - for sure. It is just so convenient. They will also shop on Black Friday and after cyber Monday (and beyond) as well. Amazon is just so convenient at all times. So certainly the stock must be at all time highs too. Right? Wrong. Convenience and price is important for consumer shopping, but for stocks, price AND earnings are important too. AMZN's stock price is not exactly a bargain with regard to earnings. Earnings were a disappointment in the 3Q and the PE at near 200 is a bit high. There is no Cyber Monday sales with regard to the AMZN stock price. Looking at the stock technically (see daily chart below), the price moved lower and tested it's 200 day MA (green line in the chart below) into the US election - just like the S&P. Holding the MA is bullish technically. Buyers came in and bought. In addition, the buyers also bought against the 38.2% retracement at 705.106. So buyers leaned against TWO key techincal levels and the price is now higher. We currently trade at around $775. However, note where the price remains vs. the 100 (blue line) and the 50 day MA (white line). Versus the 100 day MA (blue line), the price remains below it at $777 today. The high reached $776.25 today - just short of that key MA. The 50 day MA is higher still at 796.97 currently. We remain $20 away from that level. So technically, the picture for Amazon is mixed as we head into the holiday shopping season. We are above the 200 day MA. We are above the 38.2% retracement, BUT the price remains below the 100 day MA and 50 day MA. Those levels are key. In fact just look at the 50 day MA line. In September it held support. In November, it held resistance. That MA will be key going forward. So overall, we are not into open seas for the grand daddy of all consumer related stocks with the biggest of all shopping days ahead. Do we get above and stay above into Cyber Monday, OR is this stock just too expensive? The answer will come with help from the key technical tools like the 100 day MA and the 50 day MA. Get above 100 day MA and things are looking good. Get above the 50 day MA and things are looking even better. Fail and there could be an after holiday hangover for the stock. You may buy on Amazon, but will your buying list include AMZN? What do you think?",

Friday, 18 Nov 2016 | 2:40 PM ET | 03:16 Amazon shares are surging some 2 percent on Monday, and a global rollout of its streaming video service could mean further upside for the stock following weakness postelection. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that Amazon is planning a massive expansion of Amazon Prime Video, which would bring more competition to video streaming offered by Netflix and will reportedly cost between $4 billion and $5 billion.\n\"It's absolutely expensive, but they addressed this in their earnings call, when they had their call last quarter, so I look at it and say, this is just another page out of the Netflix playbook, if you will,\" David Seaburg, head of sales trading at Cowen & Co., said Friday on CNBC's \" Power Lunch .\"\nSeaburg is bullish on the expanded streaming for Amazon, and sees it as a feature being used to go \"head-to-head\" against Netflix in more countries and gain market share, and he believes that \"long term, they're going to benefit from this.\" \nWhen it comes to the original content-streaming space, Seaburg said that there is \"plenty of room for multiple players in that. It's not a zero-sum game.\"\nAnd despite recent weakness on investors' postelection rotation out of large-cap tech names like Amazon and Facebook — Amazon fell over 6 percent in the two days following Election Day — Seaburg marks Amazon as a buy. \nThe prospect of Amazon investing further into media may be risky in the near term, according to Anthony DiClemente, media and internet research analyst at Instinet, an arm of Nomura. \n\"Like a lot of things that Amazon is doing in media now, this is a very expensive proposition,\" he said.\nHe noted investors tend to own Amazon not because of its add-on streaming business but for its hand in two markets: e-commerce and its cloud feature, Amazon Web Services.\n\"So people who own the stock need to be patient that this could, in the near term, impact margins the way margins were hurt in the third quarter,\" DiClemente said. Yet seasonally, he said, right now is a good time to own Amazon, as it tends to outperform in the fourth quarter. \nDiClemente has a \"buy\" rating and a $950 price target on the now-$775 stock.",

      "title": "Oracle buys DNS provider Dyn, seeks to compete against Amazon in the cloud",
      "text": "Cloud Oracle buys DNS provider Dyn, seeks to compete against Amazon in the cloud Oracle recently announced that it will acquire Dyn, the DNS provider that suffered a massive DDoS attack in October. Could the deal be the key to Oracle success in the cloud? By Conner Forrest | November 21, 2016, 9:36 AM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/peangdao \nOracle has signed an agreement to buy cloud-based DNS provider Dyn, the company announced in a press release on Monday. The acquisition could help bolster Oracle's cloud offerings. \nAccording to the release, the Dyn acquisition \"extends the Oracle cloud computing platform and provides enterprise customers with a one-stop shop for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).\" \nDyn provides performance boosts and additional optimization of internet applications and certain cloud services. Thomas Kurian, president of product development at Oracle, said in the release that the scalability and global nature of Dyn's DNS is the \"critical core component and a natural extension\" to Oracle's cloud offerings. \n\"Oracle cloud customers will have unique access to Internet performance information that will help them optimize infrastructure costs, maximize application and website-driven revenue, and manage risk,\" Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, said in the press release. Must-Read Cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy \nIf successfully leveraged, the addition of Dyn could help position Oracle as a stronger cloud provider. As noted by ZDNet's Charlie Osborne , despite Oracle CTO Larry Ellison's declaration that \"Amazon's lead is over,\" cloud has not been Oracle's strong point in the past. \nOracle has long been known for its legacy products in hardware, databases, and services. And, although the company has begun to include more references to the cloud in its marketing materials, some have claimed that the company is just cloud-washing its existing solutions, instead of pursuing new products. \nHowever, a recent analyst conversation at CXOTalk seemed to point to the idea that Oracle is, in fact, all-in on the cloud. But, it remains to be seen if the company will be able to compete aggressively with AWS. \nIf the name Dyn sounds familiar, it's because the company made headlines in late October when it suffered a DDoS attack that left major web properties like Twitter, Amazon, Reddit, and Netflix without service. Despite that attack, the DNS service provided by Dyn is very valuable to Oracle's future in the cloud. \n\"Oracle's building out its IaaS and PaaS offerings as quickly as possible,\" said Forrester analyst Dave Bartoletti. \"AWS has a strong and popular DNS service in Route53. It's an essential element, and Oracle can buy its way in quickly with Dyn. The fact that Dyn was at the center of the DDoS attack is unfortunate, but it underscores how reliance on DNS services is critical to building resilient and scalable cloud apps.\" The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Oracle recently agreed to acquire Dyn, a DNS provider that offers other services for cloud-based applications. The acquisition of Dyn could improve Oracle's cloud offerings, where it has historically struggled, but it will need more than just that to compete with AWS. Dyn was the subject of a massive DDoS attack in October that killed service to many major web properties. Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Cloud Insights newsletter.

      "text": "An E-Reader With Months of Battery \nThe thinnest, highest-resolution e-reader Amazon has ever created. By Tucker Bowe \nForget the fact that it costs as much as an Xbox One S. Quite simply, the Kindle Oasis is the best e-reader that Amazon, the industry leader, has ever created. It has the brightest, highest-resolution display of the Kindle line, and it’s thinner and lighter than any other Kindle. \nThe ergonomic bezel is made for one-handed holding. (If you’re a lefty, flip the eReader upside down and the screen will orient the page for you.) And the battery lasts months, so if you forget your charger on your next one, two, three or four vacations, you’ll make it out fine. And with access to Amazon’s cavernous library, you’ll never complain about lack of reading options. Battery Life: up to eight weeks Charging Time: 3 hours Storage: 4GB or thousands of books Connectivity: wi-fi Display: 6-inch Amazon Paperwhite display technology, with E Ink Carta Pixels: 300 ppi Size: 5.6 x 4.8 x 0.13 inches Tech",

      "text": "Opinion Facebook trolls should learn from Amazon's new Prime ad Abusing friends and relatives on Facebook has become all too common, particularly following the recent presidential election. Amazon took a refreshing tack in a new Prime ad — and internet trolls should take note. CIO | Nov 21, 2016 11:27   Credit: Thinkstock Facebook drones will deliver Internet from the sky \nFour years ago, my friend Tiffany barely knew there was an election. Today, she wakes up extra early before work so she has time to check out the latest news on TV and the internet. She is well informed and the kind of engaged, independent Millennial voter that Republicans and Democrats swoon over. \nSo why did Tiffany stop posting political commentary on her Facebook feed? \"I found myself being treated like a bad guy,\" she told me the week after the election. \"Private messages, text messages, even glares at work. I had friends at war on my page.\" \nAnother friend, Stacy, cut off some of her Facebook contacts. \"I supported Hillary in the primary, and the Bernie people were giving me lots of grief, telling me I was a sellout,\" she says. \"I told them I won't look at their posts or messages, and if they need to reach me, send an email.\" Abuse among friends on Facebook \nSadly, countless people had similar experiences during and after the ugly 2016 election. Facebook, already an echo chamber for many people, deteriorated even further, becoming a combat zone in which friends and family denounce and abuse one another over political differences. \nPeople repost absurd, patently false \"fake news stories, \" and get mad when their friends don't believe what they have to say. Even relatively small differences — such as the Bernie versus Hillary contests — become matters of grave principle on Facebook. \nWhen I grew up, my family sat at the dinner table and argued politics. I've been politically active for much of my adult life, so I'm no stranger to high-decibel arguments. Debates are great, and I'd never suggest that \"we all simply get along.\" A real divide exists in the Unite States, and we can't just ignore it. \nHowever, beating on close friends and relatives in a public venue is ugly and self-defeating. Calling a lefty friend \"a libtard,\" or telling your Trump-supporting uncle that he’s a \"proto-fascist,\" won't change their minds. In fact, such abuse makes people dig in their heels, and it creates lasting ill will. Amazon Prime, priests, imams, tea and trolls \nAll of that brings me to a related Amazon Prime video ad, called \"A priest and an imam meet for a cup of tea.\" It's getting a lot of attention. The ad is sweet, if a bit treacly, and in 80 seconds it makes a great point about brotherhood. \nTwo aging clergyman, one a Catholic the other a Muslim, greet each other warmly, share a cup of tea and commiserate about their painful knees. After they take their leave, each man pulls out a smartphone and orders something — from Amazon Prime, of course. The packages arrive the next day, and both contain a gift in the form of knee pads, designed to ease their respective pain while kneeling at the altar or at a prayer rug. \nThe message is obvious, but the ads reinforce the idea that making your point in a clever, engaging way beats abusive rhetoric every time. It's also worth noting that Amazon's Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has a real beef with President-elect Trump, who threatened antitrust action against the company because he was upset about coverage in the Bezos-owned Washington Post . \nBezos was smart enough to avoid the bait, and we could all learn from his example — especially you trolls.

      "title": "Score These Premium JBL Bluetooth Headphones At Their Lowest Price Ever Today, Only $39.95",
      "text": "\nAmazon is currently offering a ridiculous deal on some premium JBL Synchros E40BT wireless headphones. Priced at just $39.95 via AcousticSoundDesign right now, that’s $20 cheaper than any other retailer is listing them for, and 60% off their $99.99 MSRP . \n\nThe Synchros E40BTs offer JBL’s signature sound utilizing PureBass performance, and their premium 40mm drivers deliver full spectrum sound with uninhibited clarity and powerful bass.\nJBL’s Bluetooth-enabled technology makes these Synchros perfect for getting superb quality out of your music while wireless on the go, and the ear-cup-based microphone with echo-cancelation technology allows for hands-free calling while maintaining a pure connection to your wireless device.\n\nThe E40BT’s built-in, USB rechargeable lithium-ion battery provides an absurd 16 hours of uninterrupted listening. And when the battery dies, the included aux cable allows for passive listening with no need for you to recharge. \n\nAnd don’t sweat the fact that these particular Synchros are without reviews after the jump to Amazon, as other (more expensive) retailers have rated the E40BTs extremely highly, including 4.5 out of 5 stars from 47 ratings on Crutchfield Audio .\nSlim chance you’ll be able find a better deal on premium quality headphones like these any time soon, so why not go ahead and up your daily audio experience right now? \nBUY THEM NOW: $39.95 \n\nThe BroBible team writes about gear that we think you want. Occasionally, we write about items that are a part of one of our affiliate partnerships and we may get a percentage of the revenue from sales. \n",

Keeping a secret, making it portable \nFirst up is the ability to associate environment variables with specific Lambda functions, which allows API keys or other secrets to be used without having to hard-code them into a function. The variables themselves can be stored as encrypted key/value pairs in AWS Key Management Service and are decrypted on-demand—so it’s not as if Amazon is reinventing the wheel to make it all work. There’s a hard per-function limit of 4KB of storage for variables, but that should cover the vast majority of use cases. \nThe other new feature, the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), speaks directly to how AWS Lambda-created apps can be made easier to create, manage, and even port between infrastructures. \nAWS SAM is essentially a manifest file for an AWS Lambda application that describes all the different pieces it speaks to in AWS’ architecture, such as Amazon API Gateway resources (for creating API endpoints) and Amazon DynamoDB tables. SAM files can be used by AWS CloudFormation, and can be automatically generated from an existing Lambda function to be used as a model for other Lambda functions. Going mobile \nAnother set of improvements , announced earlier this month, allows Lambda features to be used with Amazon’s mobile application development system, AWS Mobile Hub. In this scenario, Mobile Hub isn’t just being used to connect to existing Lambda functions, but can be used to create functions and equip them with API Gateway endpoints that are used in mobile apps. \nAmazon’s rationale for doing this is that it allows front-end developers to build back ends as they need them, starting from the app side rather than from the server side. It’s meant to improve workflow for developing mobile apps as much as it’s meant to improve their infrastructure—and it gives more devs a reason to build something in a “Lambda-first” fashion. Don’t fence (or lock) me in \nOne ongoing concern about serverless architectures is lock-in—something which users of almost any cloud service have had to consider. In AWS Lambda’s case, the lock-in is not because of the construction of the functions themselves, but rather that Amazon makes it easy to become highly dependent on the web of Amazon-only services surrounding them. \nThe problem isn’t insurmountable, though. Third parties have already stepped up to offer ways to liberate AWS Lambda workloads from those constraints (e.g., Iron.io’s Project Kratos or the Serverless Framework ). SAM itself appears to be part of Amazon’s effort to make Lambda less closed-ended. In theory, the SAM file for a given Lambda function can be used to replicate it in an entirely different environment that matches Amazon feature-for-feature. That’s not too far-fetched, given how Amazon’s APIs and feature sets have become de facto standards.

      "text": "Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images The Amazon.com Inc. Prime logo is displayed on computer screens for a photograph in Tiskilwa, Illinois, U.S. Amazon has held talks with the NBA, MLB and NFL and others to stream live sports, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. \nIn at least some of the talks, Amazon has proposed a premium, exclusive sports package as part of its Amazon Prime subscription service, sources told the Journal. The U.S. online retailer has even looked to foreign sports like cricket, and has asked traditional broadcasters like Disney and Univision for rights to games they choose not to air. \nDisney, the parent company of ESPN, saw shares fall as much 0.8 percent on Monday afternoon. CNBC has reached out to Disney and Amazon for comment. \nAmazon announced aggressive plans earlier this year to build out its video content platform, saying it would double its video content spending and triple its spending on original content in the second half of 2016. Amazon joins fellow tech titans like Twitter and Facebook , who have also looked to sports to bolster their video offerings this year. \nBut these companies may face a challenge, since many broadcasters already have long-term deals to air the games, the Journal reported. \nFor more on the story, see the article at WSJ.com. \n—CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this report. \nDisclosure: CNBC's parent company, NBCUniversal, also owns NBC, which broadcasts sports like NFL games.",

      "title": "Amazon Explores Rights for Live Sports Packages on Prime",
      "text": "Amazon Explores Rights for Live Sports Packages on Prime November 21, 2016, 03:25:00 PM   \nAmazon.com Inc. is exploring an ambitious offensive aimed at infiltrating the last bastion of traditional pay-television: live sports. \nIn recent months, the e-commerce giant has been in talks for live game rights with heavy-hitters like the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League, as well as smaller players like Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League, the people said. \nWith at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership, though the details are unclear, the people said. A premium sports package could entice new subscribers to Prime and to Amazon's potential \"skinny bundle\" of live channels online. \nAmazon also is scouting abroad, on the cusp of a global video expansion. It paid $10,000 for a tender document to potentially bid on the popular Indian Premier League cricket games. And it is discussing licensing an international package of NBA games, a person familiar with the talks said. \n\"My sense is they are interested in anything that might be out there,\" said Chad Swofford, vice president of digital for the ACC, a college sports conference. \nAn Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment on its sports efforts. \nAmazon's potential entry into sports broadcasting could shake up a lucrative business that has long been a stronghold of traditional pay-television. That is in part because \"they take such a view of the long game, while near-term financial returns drive the agenda for most companies,\" one senior sports executive said. Amazon executives are keenly aware that the premium NFL Sunday Ticket package of afternoon football helped DirecTV acquire subscribers when it launched as a new rival to cable, people familiar with their thinking say. \nAmazon even asked to exclusively license the NBA's League Pass, which offers live out-of-market games, one of the people said, but the NBA demurred, having long preferred selling it through many outlets. \nAmazon also is seeking sports packages like NFL Game Pass, which shows replays of matchups, to sell to Prime members as add-on channels, the people said. \nLeading the talks is Amazon's head of sports, James DeLorenzo, a former Sports Illustrated executive hired in March. Also on Amazon's acquisition team: Sunil Dave, a former Dish Network Corp. executive who negotiated with sports networks. \nAmazon is racing to compete against rival tech giants like Facebook and Twitter, as well as BAMTech, the spinoff of Major League Baseball, which are seeking sports rights to beef up their video offerings. \nOne big hurdle: many premium rights are tied up. The NBA's deal with ESPN and TNT stretches until the 2024-2025 season, while the NFL's pacts with ESPN, CBS, Fox and NBC run through early next decade. Many college conferences' rights lie with various TV networks. And Disney's recent investment in BAMTech means ESPN's extra sports rights likely will land in its forthcoming multisport streaming service with BAMTech, one person familiar with ESPN's thinking said. \nAmazon has the firepower and willingness to bid for top-tier, exclusive sports rights when they become available, people familiar with its thinking say. Coming up next year: the NFL-Twitter deal for streaming 10 games. Amazon had bid for those rights this year, a person familiar with the matter said. \nAmazon would be wagering that sports will attract enough new Prime members to offset potentially large yearslong costs. Rival Netflix Inc. has long said viewers don't care to watch sports on-demand after the fact, making it an unattractive investment compared with shows or movies. Already, Amazon's ballooning investments in video are a drag on its meager profits. \nThe company may first grab a toehold in the \"long tail\" of sports, like lacrosse, gymnastics or surfing, sports executives say. Amazon executives believe the e-commerce giant can uniquely target a lacrosse viewer with lacrosse gear, for instance, allowing Amazon to land a greater return on a sports investment. \n\"Amazon's ability to aggregate information about individual consumers is without peer,\" said Alexander Brown, chief executive of TV network ONE World Sports. \nThe ability to re-target consumers could be key to justifying expensive sports rights as traditional networks grapple with declining ratings for some events, like NFL games this season. \nIt isn't uncommon for Amazon to float various ideas and retreat—a potential outcome of its sports foray as well, media executives cautioned. At times there are several overlapping video efforts going on at once—a model that Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos encourages for a bit of \"business Darwinism,\" one person close to Amazon said. \nThere is debate internally about whether a sports package should be available free with Prime or as a premium add-on subscription, the people said. It is still possible Amazon may just opt to license channels, like traditional cable distributors do, rather than acquire sports rights. \nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com  161525ET  ",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) are higher by $3.32, or 3%, at $118.53, after Brean Capital ’s Alan Gould initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating, and a $145 price target, writing that the company “has created an unstoppable lead in the internet TV business and is positioned to dominate the business long term.”\nThe company’s vast spending — it will spend $25 billion annually in five years from now, he estimates — will be a “content moat” to competition, and though it looks expensive as a stock now, after 15 years, it will have 300 million users around the world and $19 in revenue per user, for a 29% Ebit margin and $25 per share in EPS.\nJust think of how much they’re spending:\nNetflix will add almost $9 billion of content to its streaming library this year, up from less than $4 billion in 2014, and we project the company could be spending over $25 billion annually in 10 years. The company is trying to capture a global first mover advantage providing the best content and service. Netflix has entered the virtuous circle that HBO used to claim – the more subscribers it has the more it can spend on great content, leading to more subscribers, which in turn, allows it to spend even more on content, and so on. Netflix can now amortize that content over 83 million paying subs, growing to over 100 million next year and a projected 200 million in the next decade. To put the $9 billion in context, Time Warner is spending an estimated $12.4 billion this year on programming costs between HBO ($2.2 billion), Turner ($4.1 billion) and Warner Brothers at ($6.1 billion); CBS (CBS $60.00, Buy) will spend about $6 billion including approximately $1.2 billion on the NFL and $0.4 billion on March Madness; Disney (DIS $98.24, Hold) will spend about $14.8 billion including an estimated $5 billion on sports; and Amazon is reportedly spending an estimated $3 billion on content. IHS Technology estimates global TV program expenditures were $130 billion last year with a little more than one third from North America. NFLX reportedly spent $10 million per episode for The Crown, similar to the reported budget of HBO’s Game of Thrones, and with cost overruns Baz Luhrmann’s The Get Down reportedly cost $16 million per episode, or $190 million for the 12-episode first season that NFLX is splitting between 2016 and 2017. CEO Reed Hastings compares the $100 million per hour that studios spend on the most expensive theatrical movies with the top $10 million per hour TV shows and speculates what a $20 million per hour TV show would look like. We recognize that great story telling is more important than costs, but if there is a discernible difference to spending more, NFLX could begin to create a competitive edge.\nJust like Amazon.com ( AMZN ), this stock is being valued on long-term potential of earnings, he thinks:\nIn the US market, it has captured a 45% share of broadband homes in nine years and should generate $1.8 billion of contribution profit. In the five international territories in which it launched service between 2010 and 2013, all are profitable and in aggregate they should generate $500 million of operating profit this year. Based on that history and the fact that its content library is improving and becoming more economical with scale, we have confidence that NFLX should be able to execute as it builds on its global launch from earlier this year. The company has a very flexible model, the more it invests, the less near-term profit it generates but the larger long-term market share it should be building. Not unlike AMZN, we assume the Street will be paying a multiple not on NFLX’s near-term or even medium-term earnings, but more on its long-term earnings potential. Specifically, we look out 15 years and believe NFLX will have 300 million global subscribers, paying about $20 per month, generating a 40% contribution margin.\nHis only real concern, he writes, is, in fact, Amazon’s own spending:\nOur primary competitive concern is Amazon, which provides the content for free as part of its Prime package. Amazon operates in the US, UK, Germany, Japan and is entering India and announced it will release The Grand Tour worldwide. It is reportedly spending $3 billion this year on content vs. NFLX’s estimated $4.8 billion on a P&L basis and $8.8 billion on a cash basis. While we believe NFLX’s higher planned spending should differentiate its service from AMZN and others, we note that AMZN did outbid NFLX for the high profile The Grand Tour with the stars from Top Gear reportedly spending $250 million for 36 episodes, 12 per year for 3 years, or $7 million per episode. In addition to AMZN, there are all of the traditional content and distribution players including HBO, Sky TV as well as consortiums such as Hulu.",

      "text": "Softpedia > Drivers > Tablets > Amazon > Amazon Fire HD 10 5th Generation Tablet Firmware 32.5.6.0 GO DOWNLOAD 8 downloads File size: 674.4 MB Manufacturer: Amazon Added on: November 17th, 2016 The latest software version for Fire HD 10 5th Generation is 5.6.0. This update automatically downloads and installs on your Kindle Oasis when connected wirelessly; however, you can also manually download the software and transfer the update to your device via USB cable. This update includes performance improvements and the following new features: - You can use Alexa on your Fire tablet to ask questions, shop, search, play music, and more. To activate Alexa on your Fire tablet, hold the device Home button until you see a blue line. When you see this, Alexa is ready and you can give a command or ask a question. You do not need to say “Alexa” when you do this. - Note: Alexa will be disabled if you have any Parental Controls turned on for your Fire tablet. You cannot use Alexa and Parental Controls at the same time. Alexa does not work within child profiles on your Fire tablet. - The software update includes general improvements and performance enhancements. Installation Instructions: - Before you perform these steps, make sure you determine your software version. - From your computer, go to Fire Tablet Software Updates and download the applicable software update file. - Transfer the software update file to your Fire Tablet: - Turn on your device and unlock the screen. - Connect your device to your computer using the USB cable. - Open the device drive (titled Fire), and then drag and drop the software update file into the Internal storage folder. - Note: Do not drop the file into any other folder in Internal storage. - If you've installed the Android File Transfer application on your Mac OSX 10.5 or above computer, the application will automatically open when you connect your Fire Tablet to your computer. - Monitor file transfer and disconnect: After the file transfer is complete, disconnect the USB cable from your device and your computer. - Start the software update. - Swipe down from the top of the screen and then tap Settings. - Tap Device Options, and then tap System Updates. - Tap Update. Your Fire Tablet will restart during the software update. After the restart, the message \"Installing system update\" will appear on the screen. About Tablet Firmware: By applying this firmware, your tablet can benefit from improved system stability, network-related functions and performance, enhanced touch experience, various fixes for problems encountered throughout the device’s usage time, as well as several other changes. The installation process isn’t much of a hassle because each manufacturer tries to make it as easy as possible: usually, you must transfer the new firmware to the tablet, and initiate the upgrade from the setup menu. However, due to the large number of tablets and manufacturers, as well as various ways for entering update mode, we recommend that you read the installation guide, and perform the upgrade only once you have familiarized yourself with the steps. Bear in mind that, before you get this release, you must check to see if the available firmware is developed for your tablet model and SKU (stock keeping unit) – if you apply an incompatible software, the device will encounter serious malfunctions and can even be rendered unusable. Therefore, if this package is developed for your tablet, click the download button, refer to the update instructions, and apply the new firmware. Also, don’t forget to constantly check our website so that you don’t miss any new releases.",

But shopping for your little one is to get simplified this holiday season, leading childcare brand Luliey has arrived with a huge practical range of great baby stuff on Amazon to make parenting wee easier from now on. \nThe NY-based brand promised convenient baby stuff for both at-home needs and while on the go. \n“We are here to make parenting breezier for you with our broad scale of functional and premium baby goodies on Amazon that will ensure a fulfilling shopping experience for the new moms & dads. From products to help while feeding the baby to taking the little one out in the nearby park to driving right to the granny’s house for the weekly visits, we have all the necessary baby stuff to ensure an easier life for both the parents and the little one”, smiled a leading spokesperson from Luliey. \nFounded in 2013, Luliey has come up with cool Baby Roll up silicone bibs that will keep the baby clean while feeding. Made with half silicon & half-fabric, it comes with a convenient “roll up” feature that will help one to carry it easily in purses or the baby’s diaper bag. The spokesperson also mentioned about their versatile diaper messenger bag with multiple pockets that makes room not only for the diapers but for other essentials too like the baby’s favorite teddy, feeding bottle etc. \n“Luliey is your one-stop solution when you are wheeling with your baby in tow. We have got a great waterproof car seat protector in luxe PVC leather finish that would safeguard your car seat from the sudden baby pukes, spills, mud and other messes.

With 3 compartments, the mat will double up as a cool organizer and it’s easy to fit with adjustable strap. There is a lifetime guarantee with the Luliey kick mat. \n“We have even got sunshades to protect the tender eyes and skin from the sun while the little one is travelling with you.

It’s equipped with 4 packets and its adjustable strap makes it really handy to strap it with the stroller”, added in the second spokesperson. \nLuliey has also come up with an adorable dutiful fashionable designed stylish baby bag purse. \n“Our inventory would be amazing whether you are planning to shop for your own child or your bestie’s baby shower.” \nTo start your baby shopping from Luliey, visit WWW.LULIEY.COM .",

      "text": "Technology News  31pm EST Amazon explores live sports streaming: WSJ Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo \nAmazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. \nAmazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday. \nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty program offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99. \nThe company, which has reached out to smaller leagues, has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the Journal reported. \nAmong those approached include Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] for Mexican soccer league games, Walt Disney Co's ( DIS.N ) ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said. \nAmazon, NBA, NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment. \nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. \nTech-giants such as Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) and Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) have signed up deals to beef up their video services. \nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some U.S. men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA. \n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "Technology Photos | Tue Nov 22, 2016 | 3:01am IST Amazon explores live sports streaming: WSJ Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo \nAmazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. \nAmazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday. \nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty program offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99. \nThe company, which has reached out to smaller leagues, has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the Journal reported. \nAmong those approached include Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] for Mexican soccer league games, Walt Disney Co's ( DIS.N ) ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said. \nAmazon, NBA, NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment. \nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. \nTech-giants such as Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) and Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) have signed up deals to beef up their video services. \nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some U.S. men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA. \n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila) Next In Technology Photos",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc. is exploring an ambitious offensive aimed at infiltrating the last bastion of traditional pay-television: live sports.\nIn recent months, the e-commerce giant has been in talks for live game rights with heavy-hitters like the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League, as well as smaller players like Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League, the people said.\nWith at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon AMZN, +2.61% has floated creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership, though the details are unclear, the people said. A premium sports package could entice new subscribers to Prime and to Amazon’s potential “skinny bundle” of live channels online.\nAmazon executives have even canvassed traditional TV networks for game rights they aren’t using. They have asked if Univision Communications Inc. would consider producing and packaging the extra Mexican soccer league games that it has rights to but doesn’t air, one of the people said. And they approached Walt Disney Co.’s DISN, +4.11% ESPN and ONE World Sports, which airs offbeat sports like Russian hockey league matches, to seek leftover, unproduced live games, other people said.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nVenezuela’s nemesis is a hardware salesman at a Home Depot in Alabama.\nEarthquakes: Reckoning with ‘The Big One’ in California — and it just got bigger.\nMore from MarketWatch Donald Trump and Mitt Romney Make Move to Reconcile Social Media Companies Tackle Fake News and Abuse How Trump’s latest potential hires could send the stock market ‘through the roof’",

      "text": "Share Tweet \n(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. \nAmazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday. \nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty program offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99. \nThe company, which has reached out to smaller leagues, has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the Journal reported. (http://on.wsj.com/2eZJ4dy) \nAmong those approached include Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] for Mexican soccer league games, Walt Disney Co's <DIS.N> ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said. \nAmazon, NBA, NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment. \nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. \nTech-giants such as Facebook Inc <FB.O> and Twitter Inc <TWTR.N> have signed up deals to beef up their video services. \nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some U.S. men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA. \n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

(Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)  40 PM \nAmazon has it eye on the sports TV business. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Amazon has discussed the acquisition of “live game rights” with a number of leagues, including the NFL, MLB, and the NBA. \nThe Journal reported Amazon has talked about “creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership.” \nAmazon could use sports to attract new subscribers to Prime or a skinny bundle of channels Amazon could create. \nIf Amazon did enter the marketplace it could further hasten a trend where subscribers are cutting the chord from networks like ESPN. \nThe immediate obstacle for Amazon is most the leagues already have long term TV contracts. The NFL’s contracts with Fox, CBS, NBC, and ESPN run into the next decade. The NBA’s contracts with ESPN and TNT end following the 2024-2025 season. \nAccording to the Journal, the NFL-Twitter deal for streaming 10 games will be up for bid, which Amazon had bid on.

      "text": "Close Jeremy Clarkson and Showrunners Brainstorm Name of Amazon Car Show Jeremy Clarkson’s new car show The Grand Tour has launched on Amazon Prime, more than 18 months after his infamous firing from the BBC’s Top Gear , and is already receiving acclaim from critics and on social media.\nThe series reunites Clarkson with former Top Gear co-stars Richard Hammond and James May. The trio signed a rumored £160 million deal spanning three years with Amazon in 2015, following an intense bidding war from various broadcasters and streaming platforms.\nSign up Sign up to our daily newsletter for up to date global news and features. Your browser does not support iframes.\nBut the gamble has apparently paid off. Early reviews for the first instalment, titled “The Holy Trinity,” praised The Grand Tour for having a humorous familiarity and commented on its cinematic scope in comparison to Top Gear .\nAmazon car show \"The Grand Tour\" has opened to critical acclaim. Amazon Prime Video The Guardian said the new show left “the BBC in their dust,” adding that “fans of old Top Gear are going to be happy.” The review continues: “Because more than format, more even than the amount of money you throw at something, what really gives a television show its personality is the personnel. You can pour something into a different container, but it still tastes the same. And, like it or not, this tastes of Clarkson, Hammond and May.”\n“The scale of the production, the quality of the cameras, the epic sweeping shots and the pastiches of old movies—it seemed the show was aimed at the big screen, not the telly,” said BBC’s arts editor Will Gompertz, praising the filmic cinematography.\n“Petrolheads can rejoice,” said The Daily Telegraph in its review, making reference to the poor start BBC’s Top Gear reboot with Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc had earlier in 2016. “The BBC may wonder how Matt LeBlanc and whoever joins him next year can possibly compete,” said the newspaper.\nReaction on Twitter was also positive, with many car enthusiasts watching the first episode in the early hours of Friday morning.\nFilmed in the California desert, the first episode features Clarkson and Hammond road-testing supercars, including the Porsche 918 Spyder and the McLaren P1. A new segment sees test driver The American, who Clarkson identified as Nascar driver Mike Skinner, taking laps around the show’s new racetrack, dubbed the Eboladrome (so called because it's shaped like the virus).\nGuests in the initial outing were U.S. actors Jeremy Renner and Armie Hammer, and U.K. television personality Carol Vorderman.\nThe opener made many tongue-in-cheek references to the trio’s former show and Clarkson’s firing. It began with Clarkson leaving a building that looked suspiciously like the BBC’s headquarters in a cloud of disgrace. “It’s the end of the road for motoring presenter Jeremy Clarkson,” a news reporter is heard saying.\nLater, the presenters joked about the concept of having celebrities drive race cars and creating a leaderboard of the fastest times—a reference to a popular Top Gear segment. “I don’t think it would work,” said Clarkson.\nThe Grand Tour is available now on Amazon Prime . New episodes air every Friday.\nTry Newsweek: Subscription offers Share Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Like us on Google Plus Follow us on LinkedIn Share with Whatsapp More reddit Pinterest Tumblr Comments",

However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday.\nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty program offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99.\nThe company, which has reached out to smaller leagues, has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the Journal reported. (http://on.wsj.com/2eZJ4dy)\nAmong those approached include Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] for Mexican soccer league games, Walt Disney Co's ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said.\nAmazon, NBA, NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment.\nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections.\nTech-giants such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc have signed up deals to beef up their video services.\nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some U.S. men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA.\n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "It’s only been a few days since the news broke that Amazon is rolling out its Prime Video streaming service in more than 200 countries to go head-to-head with Netflix . And now the e-commerce giant is said to be looking at putting together a premium sports package to go with it.\nThe company has been in talks with a wide range of different sports leagues about acquiring broadcasting rights, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .\nObviously, Amazon would probably be most interested in the top National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and National Football League events, but it is also talking to the National Lacrosse League and the World Surf League, the newspaper’s sources said.\nThe big problem with trying to buy up basketball, football, and baseball programming is that the major networks--especially ESPN--have already locked up most of them for the next decade or so.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nFor example, the deal that ESPN has with the NBA doesn’t end until 2024, and the rights packages that ESPN, CBS and NBC have for National Football League games run into the next decade as well. Even college football teams have locked up rights with various cable networks.\nESPN’s parent Disney is also looking to expand its streaming offerings, including a new service that is expected to be launched soon. That’s why the entertainment giant recently spent $1 billion to buy a stake in BAMTech, the tech provider that handles streaming for Major League Baseball and a number of other clients including ESPN.\nAccording to the Journal , Amazon is “keenly aware” that the NFL Sunday Ticket games offered by DirecTV helped give that cable competitor a boost when it first launched, and therefore Amazon wants to do something similar by signing up whatever sports it can.\nAmazon gets a head start on Black Friday. Watch: \nAs with almost everything Amazon does, the content in this case is just a lure to get customers to sign up for its Prime subscription service, which generates significant returns for the company and now incorporates everything from free shipping on products to a Spotify-style music service.\nThere’s one big reason why we shouldn’t dismiss either the online giant’s sports ambitions or its global Netflix competitor: Namely, Amazon’s $380 billion market capitalization, and the massive river of cash that spins out of its Amazon Web Services division, where hundreds of Fortune 500 companies store their data. It generates about $10 billion in revenue every year.\nThat’s definitely enough to spend buying up sporting rights. All Amazon has to do is find someone who is willing to sell and who hasn’t already cut a deal with an existing network.",

      "text": "With aggressive online deals from the likes of Walmart ( WMT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ), this may be a down year for in-store shopping. The National Retail Federation (NRF) forecasts holiday sales in November and December to increase 3.6%, and online sales to increase up to 10% — to as much as $117 billion. \n“Black Friday is decreasingly important throughout the course of the holidays. We see there are other days like Super Saturday and Dec. 23 that are rising in popularity,” Foursquare editor-at-large Sarah Spagnolo told Yahoo Finance. \nBy analyzing foot traffic from more than 50 million global users of Foursquare’s City Guide and Swarm apps and websites, the company’s data scientists looked at visits to all retail stores in the US as well as for specific store categories, including department stores, big-box stores and discount stores, within the top 500 US chains, from September through December of 2014, 2015 and 2016. \nFoursquare predicts a 3.5% drop in foot traffic from last year, but Spagnolo says it’s actually a stabilization from the double-digit year-over-year drops from 2014 to 2015. \nWhile Tuesday, Nov. 29 will be the slowest shopping day of the season (mark your calendars), what are the best days to shop for specific items on your list? \nOverall, Spagnolo says Mondays between Thanksgiving and Christmas are the best days to go shopping if you want to avoid crowds. When shopping for cosmetics, clothing, candy and jewelry, Monday afternoons and evenings are your best bet. If you’re a man, shopping for a man or just want to check out home-improvement products, consider Thursday mornings, which are great for hardware stores. Bookstores and places that sell beer are empty on Thursday evenings. And Friday mornings are good for big-box stores like Walmart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ). Best of all, Friday evenings are the best time to shop for toys, she says. \n“For everybody else, think about shopping on Sunday — especially department stores,” Spagnolo says. \nThe no-brainer No. 1 takeaway, of course, is to avoid shopping on Saturdays. \nWho will be the big winners this Black Friday? Department stores have unusual foot traffic patterns over the course of the holiday season and may not fare well during Thanksgiving week, says Spagnolo. Foursquare showed that visits to department stores in September and October were down by 7% year-over-year – twice the decline of overall retail. But later in the season, people go to fancier stores to splurge on higher-end gifts, and make trips to see window decorations , says Spagnolo. \nFoursquare also expects a surge in trips to big-box and dollar stores later in the season (perhaps for last-minute stocking stuffers or smaller gifts for friends). “There’s an increase year-over-year in foot traffic. Dollar stores make up some of that foot traffic later in the holiday season. We’re predicting that they’ll do better than the overall pattern for retail — a 5% increase year-over-year from what we’ve seen.” \nSpagnolo predicts that there will be several winners across each of the retail categories for Black Friday retail: Dollar Tree ( DLTR ) and Big Lots ( BIG ) will be the big winners in discount and big-box stores, respectively. Marshalls ( TJX ), Dillard’s ( DDS ) and Macy’s ( M ) are the bright spots for midrange department stores. Within the luxury sector, Lord & Taylor ( HBC.TO ), Saks ( HBC.TO ) and Neiman Marcus are expected to fare well on Black Friday. \nMelody Hahm is a writer at Yahoo Finance. \nRead more from Melody here & follow her on Twitter @melodyhahm .",

      "text": "\nAmazon’s next Prime membership benefit could be the ability to stream live sports.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Amazon is in talks with leagues like the NFL, NBA, MLB, and a handful of others about live game rights.\nThe fact that Amazon wants to stream live sports isn’t a new development . But the Journal did have a noteworthy tidbit: Amazon could offer a “premium, exclusive sports package” to those who pay for a $99 per year, or $8.99 per month, Prime membership.\nAmazon is exploring streaming rights to multiple sports at a variety of levels. The Journal reported that Amazon wanted to exclusively license NBA’s League Pass streaming product; it is also reaching out to traditional broadcasters like Univision and ESPN about the content they own but don’t end up airing on TV.\nOutside of deals like Twitter’s streaming partnership with the NFL this season — which Amazon bid on — it will be tough for Amazon to do something with the top leagues, given existing TV contracts that run through the next several years.\nBut the Journal noted how Amazon may first start with the “long tail” of sports, which include less popular activities like lacrosse or gymnastics. It could potentially make revenue by targeting viewers with sport-specific products via its e-commerce marketplace — selling gymnastics gear to the people watching gymnastics content, for example.\nHeading up Amazon’s sports rights efforts is James DeLorenzo , who came to Amazon in May as its new head of sports for “Amazon Video Channels.” DeLorenzo is a digital media veteran, having worked in executive roles at CBS and Time-owned Sports Illustrated, where he helped launch the 120 Sports digital venture .\nAmazon has already waded into sports programming. Its series All or Nothing , which followed the Arizona Cardinals through their run to the NFC championship game last season, premiered on Amazon Video over the summer\nIn July, Amazon said it planned to double down on its spending for video content during the second half of 2016 compared to the same period last year. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky added that the company will “nearly triple our offering to customers of new Amazon original TV shows and movies” compared to last year. \nAmazon, which is preparing to expand its video service worldwide , uses video content to draw in more Prime members. In his annual letter to shareholders , Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos noted Amazon’s original shows, saying how they “feed the Prime flywheel.”\n“These shows are great for customers, and they feed the Prime flywheel – Prime members who watch Prime Video are more likely to convert from a free trial to a paid membership, and more likely to renew their annual subscriptions,” Bezos wrote.",

Set during the height of the studio system, The Fade Out dives into the underbelly of the golden age of Hollywood and turns up a sordid tale of sex, murder, and influence, all set against the backdrop of the looming Red Scare and Hollywood blacklist. \nThis gorgeous hardcover edition collects all 12 issues (presented in three \"acts\") of Brubaker’s story, in a glossy format that does justice to the noir-inflected art from Sean Phillips and Elizabeth Breitweiser. An extra 50 pages of back matter fills readers in on the research and artistry that went into The Fade Out and more than justifies the \"deluxe\" tag. Amazon/$35.52 David Bowie's Who Can I Be Now? (1974–1976) box set \nThis exhaustive collection spanning five years of David Bowie’s career boasts every song from Diamond Dogs to Station to Station — all on pristine 180-gram vinyl. More importantly for Stardust completists, the set features a remastered version of The Gouster , the legendary unreleased Bowie album; this is the first time fans can hear them in their original glory. A hardcover photo book and handwritten note from the singer himself round out the selection. Amazon/$214.49 The Decemberists' reissue of The Crane Wife \nThis indie classic is now 10 years old, and to mark the occasion the Decemberists are reissuing it as a box set full of music geek goodies: five LPs (including demos, B-sides, and outtakes), a Blu-ray of a concert at Washington, DC’s 9:30 Club, and a 20-page booklet with liner notes by Rolling Stone’s David Fricke and an essay by Hamilton creator and Decemberists superfan Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Decemberists Shop/$125 Star Wars R2-D2 coffee press \nYou don’t need to be a coffee drinker to appreciate this R2-D2 coffee press; its first function is being cute and making your kitchen a better place. Of course, if you’re a Star Wars fan who also appreciates smooth French press coffee, this is definitely the droid you’re looking for. ThinkGeek/$39.99 Abbi Jacobson's Carry This Book \nPeek into the pockets and handbags of several real and fictional people, from Oprah to Batman, to see what they carry around with them, as illustrated by Broad City star Abbi Jacobson. Donald Trump, for example, carries huge gloves (\"for show\") and five different varieties of self-tanner. Jacobsen’s artwork is playful and funny, and each page contains multitudes. Amazon/$15.14 The Ultimate Laika Collection \nOver the course of seven years and four feature films, the Portland stop-motion animation studio Laika has established itself as America’s most idiosyncratic animation purveyor. This collection assembles Laika’s four features to date — Coraline , Paranorman , The Boxtrolls , and this year’s Kubo and the Two Strings — in a Blu-ray format that emphasizes the visual splendor of the studio’s modern, kinetic approach to the often staid stop-motion format. Perfect for kids and animation lovers alike. Amazon/$39.99 Wonder Woman 75th-anniversary box set \nWonder Woman is turning 75 in 2017 and finally getting her own movie. In honor of her upcoming birthday, DC Comics has released a four-volume comic book collection commemorating the legendary hero, featuring some of the game-changing writers — Greg Rucka, George Perez, Gail Simone, and Brian Azzarello — who helped shape her legacy. (If you have a Wonder Woman devotee on your gift list but don’t want to shell out for the full box set, pick up a copy of the character’s 75th-anniversary special issue for $7.99.) Amazon/$35.53 The Defenders season one \nAn all-time TV classic is on DVD for the first time, thanks to Shout Factory. The legal drama — which touched on many of the hot-button issues of the 1960s — hasn’t been aired anywhere since the 1970s, so this DVD is a vital historical document. A multiple Emmy winner, The Defenders also features an essential performance by E.G. Marshall as a crusading lawyer.
