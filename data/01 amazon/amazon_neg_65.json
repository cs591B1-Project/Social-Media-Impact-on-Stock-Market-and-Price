      "title": "Amazon Stock: Why Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Is A Strong Buy Going Into The Holiday Season?",
      "text": "Amazon.com has been picked as a standout performer on Black Friday by multiple Wall Street firms. The retailer is off to a strong start to Holiday season 2016. AMZN stock is now down nearly 5% in the last one month. Is it time to buy into this sell-off? Flickr \nAmazon.com Inc. (NSDQ:AMZN) had started the 2016 holiday shopping season with the launch of its exclusive TV program The Grand Tour , featuring the popular trio of Top Gear hosts, which was accompanied by a one-day discount on its Prime membership program. The opening episode of the program became the biggest show premiere on Amazon's streaming service, with new Prime memberships during the day setting a non-prime day record. Contrastingly, the AMZN stock has headed south over the last one month, losing nearly 5% in the period. However, there are many positive reasons to be bullish about the biggest e-commerce player in the world. Amazon Is Set For A Record Holiday season \nAmazon is off to a strong start to the holiday shopping season. As reported by Fortune, Amazon could be on course for a record holiday sales season with the 2016 Thanksgiving day sales surpassing Thanksgiving as well as Cyber Monday 2015 sales. Separately, in an emailed statement, Amazon stated that Black Friday sales were on pace to beat the year-ago numbers. Also, with over 75K deals planned for the Cyber Monday week, Amazon should have no problem in maintaining its strong performance through the Cyber Monday week. (See also: Amazon.com Inc Could Gain Big By Acquiring Souq.com ) \nWhile the performance of Amazon has certainly been encouraging, investors should also take note of the broader holiday sales trends, which point to a very strong holiday shopping season in 2016. As per Adobe, total online spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday crossed $5.27B, a 17.7% YoY growth. Quoting from the Adobe report : \nMore than $5 billion ($5.27 billion) was spent online by the end of Black Friday, a 17.7 percent increase year-over-year (YoY). Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the three-billion-dollar mark for the first time at $3.34 billion (21.6 percent growth YoY) while Thanksgiving accounted for the remaining $1.93 billion. Black Friday became the first day in retail history to drive over one billion dollars in mobile revenue at $1.2 billion, a 33 percent growth YoY. \nAdobe also expects the 2016 holiday shopping season to net a record $91B in total online sales, an 11% ($9.1 B) improvement over the 2015 holiday sales season. In a separate report, retail consultant Customer Growth Partners also sees this holiday season headed for a record finish , expecting the fastest growth since 2012. Amazon had accounted for 60% of US online sales growth in 2015 and held 68% market share of US online sales. Assuming the company can maintain its share of total growth this year, the holiday season could net the company an incremental $5.5B in total sales. Amazon Prime Memberships Are Now Over 50M \nCowen and Company recently estimated Amazon's US prime member base at 49.5M. Given the strong start the in-house produced 'The Grand tour' has enjoyed, the US prime membership base could well have exceeded 50M. As per Amazon, \" the day The Grand Tour debuted, total new Prime membership sign-ups exceeded all previous days with the exception of Amazon’s renowned Prime Day. \" What's even more interesting is that the show premiered in just 4 countries and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has stated that the show will be available globally in December. Well, Amazon's global Prime membership base could be in for a 'Swell'. The Amazon CEO tweeted that the show will be globally available by December. Amazon is probably taking a leaf out of Netflix's book. Long wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \nSo why is the growing Prime member base important to Amazon? Well, an average Amazon Prime customer spent 2.4X the amount spent by an average non-prime customer in 2015. With the number of Prime customers rising, Amazon's top line growth will be steeper than it would be with a non-prime dominated customer base. Recent Sell-Off Makes AMZN Stock An Attractive Buy \nAmazon stock sold-off following its Q3 2016 earnings, in which the company missed EPS estimates. However, what drove the lower EPS were investments which should help the company to drive long-term earnings growth. The margins should rise as the investment tapers in the coming quarters. Moreover, its Q3 EPS of $0.52 was still good for over 200% YoY growth. Hence, it's fair to conclude that the company continues to move in the right direction and the market is probably taking a very short-term outlook while punishing the stock. (See also: Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Headed For A Rally? ) \nAMZN stock currently trades at a PE ratio of around 180, and while that does not come across as attractive, investors need to understand the bigger picture. Analysts expect this company to grow its annual earnings at a whopping 42% over the next 5 years, meaning that the company could very easily outgrow its current valuations. The key is to sustain the solid earnings growth, which the company has displayed over the last few quarters. It is here that investments like content for Prime, investing in fulfillment centers, etc.... will help the company to drive long-term earnings growth. \nAMZN stock has recently bounced off its 200 day moving average on the daily chart. The stock is now approaching its 50 Day moving average. A breakout above the 50 day moving average accompanied by high volume would indicate a clear reversal of the recent downtrend the stock has been caught in. Conclusion \nAmazon is off to a very strong start this holiday season. With the broader industry trends indicating a solid growth in 2016 holiday shopping, Amazon should be able to ride these tailwinds and deliver a strong Q4 performance. Also, with the recent quarter's margin being hit by increased investments, the margin should recover, as the investment activity tapers. Hence, the EPS miss driven sell-off is temporary and should be used as an opportunity to go long AMZN stock. Amazon stock is now over its 200 day moving average and approaching the 50 day moving average. Any break out over the 50 day moving average accompanied by strong volumes would be a clear signal to go long AMZN stock, as the long term growth story remains as strong as ever. Hence, long term investors should make use of the pullback to accumulate AMZN stock. \nEvaluating tech stocks?

      "text": "Amazon Can Deliver Surprising Numbers This Holiday Season Nov.29.16 Send Message Summary \nThe latest study of holiday discounts shows signs of major upheaval within big retailers who have increased their discounts from 2 to 7 percentage points compared to 2015. \nThere are few levers available with retailers in their fight with Amazon, and we should see some major course correction by brick-and-mortar stores in 2017. \nAs retailers fight to attract customers in their stores who have been \"locked in\" by Amazon, they would need ever larger discounts leading to a squeeze in margins. This holiday season is a make or break opportunity for traditional retailers. They are engaged in a turf war with Amazon and are now using heavy discounting as a last ditch effort to prevent migration of customers to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Bloomberg news recently published an article where it looks at a Market Track study of holiday circulars. The study points at the higher levels of discounts available within stores compared to last year. Major retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) are giving an average discount of 39 percent compared to 35 percent offered last year. Target (NYSE: TGT ) has increased average discounts to 38 percent from 36 percent. Other retailers have also followed suit. Click to enlarge Fig: Higher discounts given by retailers to attract customers Retailers like Best Buy (NYSE: BBY ) and Macy's (NYSE: M ) have also increased discounts by as much as 7 percentage points. Retail business has always been fiercely competitive as there are few differentiators within rivals. In the past few years, some companies have been able to create decent moats. Wal-Mart did it with its scale, Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM ) created a moat with higher-quality goods and dollar stores used their proximity to customers as a distinct advantage. Amazon's moat is its prime membership through which it can tap a loyal user base to deliver ever more goods and services. Not only is the level of prime membership increasing within US, but there is also higher density of fulfillment centers. Currently 44% of domestic population is within 20 miles of an Amazon delivery station compared to only 7% in 2012. Going ahead, we should see this number reach high-70s to 80s level as Amazon increases its footprint in the remaining white spaces. However, the reason why Amazon has the strongest moat is due to its stock. YES!!! Low profitability is also baked in within the stock price of AMZN. Current investors in Amazon do not look ahead for the dividend growth provided by the company or forward PE multiples or any other parameters which are a must for retailers. If Wal-Mart declares a lowering of dividend, it will play havoc with its stock price. Hence, the company needs sustainable profit margins as it tries to turn around. Similarly, other retailers need respective PEs to make a case for investment. However, if Amazon, which is trading at over 170x PE, were to forecast loss for the next few quarters, the impact on price would be minimal. If the company can continue to deliver 20%-plus growth in sales, investors would be willing to forego dividends, massive logistic expenses, investments in new products or services, etc. Brick-and-Mortar retailers caught between a rock and a hard place These holiday promotions certainly help in lifting the sales number and also provide incentives for customers to visit the stores, but they also end up squeezing the margin. Last year, when Target gave similarly heavy discounts, it saw the comp sales rise by 1.9 percent, however, its gross margin also slipped from 28.5 percent to 27.9 percent. An additional 2 to 7 percentage point discount in this year would create further pressure on margins. The traditional retailers cannot focus on sales growth, but have to show reasonable profit margins for dividends, investments and buybacks (in cases like Wal-Mart). This puts a ceiling limit to the level of discounts which the retailers can give. Seamless comparison of prices between different stores adds to their woes. It leaves little wiggle room to increase prices. Online shopping options will continue to provide better deals than traditional stores, especially when one factors in the fuel costs and time invested in making purchases. Unless brick-and-mortar stores can move away from pricing and provide better \"shopping experience\" to customers, there will be a faster migration of buyers to online alternatives. Amazon against other online options Other retailers have increased their online capabilities and are looking for more omnichannel strategy. This not only requires massive investments, but also a change in leadership to a more tech-centric management. Wal-Mart has taken one of the boldest steps by not only purchasing Jet.com, but also giving its head, Marc Lore, a greater power over the future online segment of the company. However, Amazon is light years ahead of other online retailers. Last year, the company cornered 60% of online sales growth in US. Further expansion of private labels and video services would give Amazon additional edge over other online competitors. It is also becoming a big player in international markets like India and is looking to enter Southeast Asia. But the biggest advantage with Amazon will remain its ability to grow without the pressure to deliver profits. If there is a race to the bottom within online retail space, Amazon will be a clear winner. Even on a long-term horizon, retailers like Wal-Mart have little chance of taking away online market share away from Amazon. This is one of the reason why even a long-term investor like Buffett dumped Wal-Mart's stock during the quarter when it made the Jet.com purchase. Investor takeaway Amazon continues to attract bearish and bullish views on the future of the company. The current discount levels during the holiday season show a move of desperation from traditional retailers. They might not only see a big margin squeeze during Q4, but would also be forced to make major course correction in 2017. They would need to use levers other than pricing to attract customers to their stores and make it worth their while. Amazon has significant tailwinds which support the bullish sentiment for the company. These include higher prime membership penetration, greater fulfillment center footprint, international growth prospects and increasing preference for online purchases by customers.

      "text": "on Nov 29, 2016, 12:45 PM TechSpot \nAmazon’s Echo smart speake r may be selling better than expected but if you’re considering purchasing one this holiday season (either for yourself or as a stocking stuffer for a loved one), you may want to read this first. \nAccording to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Amazon is developing a premium Echo-like speaker featuring a seven-inch touchscreen display that’ll be positioned in such a way that it could easily be viewed when it sits on a counter and the user is standing nearby. \nSources say the display will make it easier to access things like weather forecasts, calendars, news, appointments and more. Amazon is also testing a feature that would allow users to pin photos and the like on the device’s screen, much like how people affix pictures and drawings to their refrigerator doors using magnets. \nIn addition to the display, the premium Echo will employ a higher-quality speaker for audio playback. The device will run an optimized version of Amazon’s Fire OS (the same operating system that powers its Fire tablets and Fire TV media streamers) and like its predecessors, it will respond to verbal commands. \nThe premium Echo smart speaker could be unveiled as early as the first quarter, perhaps even at CES 2017 in Las Vegas come January. Amazon will reportedly keep its current lineup – the $50 Dot, the $130 Tap and the $180 Echo – around after the launch. Related Reads",

      "text": "Courtesy of Amazon November 29, 2016 | 10:18AM PT \nAmazon is working on a Echo-like devices with an integrated touch screen, according to a Bloomberg report . The new device will respond to voice commands just like Amazon’s existing line of Echo speakers, but also feature a 7-inch touch screen. \nAmazon could release the new device as early as Q1 of 2017, according to the report, which also included a few details about its design: The device could potentially give consumers an option to change its orientation so that they can look at the screen from a variety of angles. \nThere have long been rumors that teams within were working on a kitchen computer. These efforts were initially thought to be an extension of the company’s line of Fire tablets, potentially featuring a larger touch screen. \nHowever, the success of the Echo has put a bigger emphasis on voice control. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners recently reported that Amazon has sold an estimated five million Echo speakers since the introduction of the device two years ago. \nIt’s still not known how much the new device will sell for, which could be a critical factor for making it a success story. The Echo succeeded in part because of a price tag that puts it within reach of existing Bluetooth speakers. \nAmazon’s new kitchen device could come with a significantly higher price tag, and not just because of the integrated touch screen: The device will also feature a higher-end speaker with a better sound quality than the existing Echo, according to Bloomberg. \n",

      "text": "An Amazon employee emailed hundreds of fellow Amazonians—including CEO Jeff Bezos —before leaping from a building at company headquarters in Seattle Monday morning. The man survived the jump, which police believe was a suicide attempt. A source tells Bloomberg that the man, one of 20,000 workers in multiple buildings at the Amazon campus, had asked to be transferred to a different department but had instead been placed on an employee improvement plan, which the source says tends to be a first step toward firing. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"live\", \"id\" : 6043, \"name\" : \"NBC News Radio\", \"description\" : \"The news you want, when you want it\" } } The man, whose role with the company has not been disclosed, made it clear that he was unhappy with the company's handling of the transfer request and hinted that he would harm himself, the source says.

      "text": "Amazon employee jumps off company building after sending email to hundreds of co-workers, including CEO Jeff Bezos Spencer Soper, Bloomberg News \nAmazon.com Inc. headquarters in the South Lake Union neighbourhood of Seattle, Washington, U.S. / Financial Post Share Adjust Comment Print \nAn Amazon.com Inc. employee was injured when he leaped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters in what police characterized as a suicide attempt. \nThe man, who wasn’t identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. The man survived the fall from Amazon’s 12-storey Apollo building at about 8:45 a.m. local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said. \nThe man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. More than 20,000 people work in multiple buildings at Amazon’s headquarters. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nIn the email, the man expressed criticism of how the company handled his transfer request, and he hinted that he might harm himself, according to the person. \nSuicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead. Amazon disputed the characterization of the company. ",

      "text": "Selling books and stereos to consumers online is a much different proposition than renting computing horsepower to businesses. It is striking that Amazon.com follows a similar playbook for both.\n\nAmazon’s cloud-computing business, known as AWS, cut prices on several of its key services earlier this month. Those cuts come as the company prepares to kick off its annual re:Invent conference this week, which will draw more than 30,000 attendees to Las Vegas to hear about the latest services intended to grow a business that is...

      "title": "Amazon begins reselling Frontier’s internet service on its site",
      "text": "Amazon begins reselling Frontier’s internet service on its site Posted Just like Uber, Lyft launches upfront fares \nEarlier this year, Amazon launched a new storefront dubbed the “Amazon Cable Store, ” which focused on reselling Comcast’s internet and television service from the retailer’s site. Of course, the generic name “Cable Store” seemed to hint that Comcast wouldn’t be the only company featured on this site in the future – and that has turned out to be true. Amazon has now added Frontier Communications to the storefront, allowing online shoppers to compare internet plans from Frontier, as well as browse Comcast Xfinity bundles that include TV, internet and phone. \nAlong with the Frontier addition, the storefront no longer calls itself “Amazon Cable Store.” Rather, it simply reads “ Amazon Internet | TV | Phone .” \nOn the site, you can scroll down to see the available internet plans from each provider, ranging from starter plans for one device (10 Mbps+) to those for households with half a dozen or more (150 Mbps+). There are also links that let you browse all the internet plans and the bundles available from both Comcast Xfinity and Frontier. \nWhen you click through to see a given plan, it’s listed much like any other Amazon product. There’s a title, image, description, rating, and customer reviews. But instead of an “add to cart” or 1-click checkout button, consumers click a “Proceed to Service Setup” button to place their order. \nSome of these packages are available to new customers, while others are also available to existing customers. Some are available contract-free, too. Pricing and availability for the packages are based on the customer’s zip code. \nAmazon’s move into this space has been interesting because of several reasons. While the site makes comparing plans and sign-up easier, it also lets consumers leave reviews about the service provider directly on Amazon’s site. And poor customer service is something that many internet and TV providers have struggled with in the past. \nTo help address that problem, Amazon’s partners have promised “exclusive customer service” for those who buy from Amazon. Comcast, for example, said earlier it had dedicated two call centers in Tucson, Arizona and Spokane, Washington, to handling inquiries from Amazon customers. \nFor participating providers, it’s clear Amazon’s site is a lead gen play. The service providers like that Amazon simplifies setup by reducing the clicks it takes to place an order. \nAmazon didn’t disclose its deal terms, but, according to prior reports, there’s an affiliate revenue stream involved. \nIn addition to its cut of these sales, Amazon benefits in other ways. For example, it can direct customers shopping for products like new TVs to visit this Internet/TV/Phone storefront and compare plans. It can also point those shopping for packages to related items, like third-party modems, routers, hotspots and other networking equipment. \nThe retailer’s plans for the site include expanded to other interested providers in the future. Charter Communications said it had talked with Amazon earlier this year about participation, for instance. And with Amazon’s expansion beyond just “cable” services, the site is now poised to take on reselling a broader array of bundles, including those that aren’t just internet or tv. 0",

Cyber Monday is here. \nAt the 1.1 million square foot Amazon Fulfillment Center in Tracy, more than 6,500 workers know not to miss a beat -- especially not today. \n\"We're offering new deals as often as every 5 minutes,\" Amazon spokesperson, Lori Richter said. \nCyber Monday is Amazon's Superbowl. \nLast year, customers ordered 54 million items in one day, or 629 items every second. \nIt is incredibly challenging, but not impossible, thanks to hundreds of Amazon Robots. \n\"You think they're going to crash into each other. But last minute, they stop and take off in another direction,\" Amazon spokesperson, Craig Bergman said. \"Robots are doing all the walking around work. Human beings are still incredibly good at being told pick item X, seeing item X on a shelf, and getting it on a crate.\" \nThis massive operation is something a service small businesses cannot afford to do alone, so they partner with Amazon. \n\"That just enables us to increase our selection and offer a wide variety of products that customers love,\" Richter said. \nAnson Liang launched his San Mateo-based electronics company, Rowkin, last year on Amazon. His new product is the Rowkin Wireless Bluetooth with portable charger. \nHe is one of 2 million business owners who use the \"Fulfillment by Amazon\" program. \n\"For us, as a seller, we are able to reach more customers much quicker and easier than before,\" Liang said. \nRowkin is offering 20 percent off all of their products on Amazon on Cyber Monday. Amazon is also slashing prices on a variety of products all day. 37.739651 -121.425223 ",

They used to call these people fools. \nNothing like those aristocrats as models of human thriving and virtue. Let's all wallow in excess and still be horrible to each other! coupe said... \nEmployment has been so socially engineered that it collapsed-in on itself.Imagine being required to pay for your employees health care. To garnish their wages to pay their taxes. Millions of ambulance chasers suing companies for whatever buck they can extract.I like my life now much better. I pay my own taxes, and the government provides for my welfare. I am free to work on anything I want and not worry about compensation.Dollars per hour is no longer a metric with me. I have attained employment nirvana. Sebastian said... \n\"How would human nature itself change as the ancient, aristocratic privilege of leisure becomes the birthright of human beings as such?\" Human nature wouldn't change. By assigning everyone a new \"birthright,\" society would simply give free rein to the basic human impulse to exert arbitrary power over others and extract by force the value they created. Dave D said... \nOnly a free-time enabled tenured professor at a major university (or some other similar egghead) would think of such ridiculous things. Most of us in the 53% are too busy working 9-12 hour days jobs that are probably NOT our ideal dream positions in order to try to feed our families and to retire before we die. Rob said... \nAny discussion of this subject is incomplete if it doesn't reference John Maynard Keynes's stunningly good \"Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,\" which contains the following passage:The “purposive” man is always trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his acts by pushing his interest in them forward into time. He does not love his cat, but his cat’s kittens; nor, in truth, the kittens, but only the kittens’ kittens, and so on forward forever to the end of cat-dom. For him jam is not jam unless it is a case of jam to-morrow and never jam today. Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality. Bad Lieutenant said... \nJust because human labor is not needed, why do you think people would be given the necessities let alone luxuries of life, instead of being obliged to find new ways of earning a living other than what forms of work you think will be obsoleted?Will everybody get a free car?Only one?Will it be a Hyundai or a Cadillac?Will it be a compact or an SUV? Sebastian said... \nOK, I've now made it through half of this drivel.\"because there aren’t enough jobs.\" WSJ today: tight labor market is forcing Amazon to slug it out with rivals, low unemployment and recent pay gas for the nation's lowest-wage workers have forced Amazon to get nimbler etc. Last week: famers bitchng abut not getting enough Mexicans to do the field jobs.\"We already have some provisional answers because we’re all on the dole, more or less.\" But there's the rub: some more, some less. The dole only works long term if some are less on the dole than others. gadfly said... \nHow should work change? We should have standards under which we can bar lazy-ass SOBs from ever entering any location where productivity is generating economic growth and maintaining economic stability.We should further reduce welfare payments to non-workers in order to eliminate the possibility of a writer ever gaining income for even suggesting that humanity excludes work. \nProf. Livingston needs to spend some time with Mike Rowe.11/29/16, 10:17 AM Absolutely. Livingston is another great example of an over credentialed idiot, he proves that before the 6th paragraph. That which he does not out-right get wrong, he confuses cause and effect.The \"official\" US unemployment rate is 6%? Wait until the day after Trump is sworn in and then check what the papers report as the unemployment rate! The current reported rate does not include those that have just given up looking for work.As for that fourth of adults that earn less than the poverty rate, dig into that and you will see that part of the reason for that is those adults have multiple part-time jobs so as to enable their employers to avoid Obamacare and other excessive regulations. mikee said... \nThe steps from a welfare state to a totalitarian dictatorship where people starve as they are led to the prison labor camps have been demonstrated multiple times in the past century, with Venezuela as a recent example. It is not the individual citizens that one need fear in the welfare state, it is the state itself. cubanbob said... \nWhere does Althouse find the time to spend looking for such stereotypical leftist crap as this? Yes Professor Livingston lets say fuck you to tenured positions subsidized by taxpayer money. See if you can earn a living wage outside your artificial bubble. Nonapod said... \nAlmost half of employed adults in this country are eligible for food stamps (most of those who are eligible don’t apply). Typical idiotic big government waste. Assuming that this group of people aren't starving in the streets (they aren't), why in gods name do we have a program that covers so many people that don't need it. As to the subject of this article: in the future there's obviously going to be fewer and fewer jobs, whether we like it or not. If you believe that things like \"punctuality, initiative, honesty, self-discipline\" can only be achieved through gainful employment, then I suppose the future must look very grim indeed. Personally I'm not so sure. Birkel said... \nThe professor must believe that food appears at the local grocery store by virtue of magic or alchemy.Some things are so stupid only the well-educated could believe them. Terry said... \nThe article is full of really stupid statements like this:\"Most jobs aren’t created by private, corporate investment, so raising taxes on corporate income won’t affect employment.\"There is so much stupid thinking in the article I was surprised to see that it was written by a history prof. It reads more like something a twenty four year journalist would write for Vox when he is under the gun to fill his daily word quota. Henry said... \n\"What evident yet unknown possibilities would then appear? How would human nature itself change as the ancient, aristocratic privilege of leisure becomes the birthright of human beings as such?\" The Freakanomics guys answered this question with their own rhetorical question: Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms? And their answer is the answer to Livingston's opaque cloud of questions. Without work, everyone gambles on glamour: So if crack dealing is the most dangerous job in America, and if the salary is only $3.30 an hour, why on earth would anyone take such a job?Well, for the same reason that a pretty Wisconsin farm girl moves to Hollywood. For the same reason that a high-school quarterback wakes up at 5 a.m. to lift weights. They all want to succeed in an extremely competitive field in which, if you reach the top, you are paid a fortune (to say nothing of the attendant glory and power). ... In the glamour professions—-movies, sports, music, fashion—-there is a different dynamic at play. Even in second-tier glamour industries like publishing, advertising, and media, swarms of bright young people throw themselves at grunt jobs that pay poorly and demand unstinting devotion. An editorial assistant earning $22,000 at a Manhattan publishing house, an unpaid high-school quarterback, and a teenage crack dealer earning $3.30 an hour are all playing the same game, a game that is best viewed as a tournament. * * *As an aside, this chapter in Freakanomics starts with a philosophical point: The first trick of asking questions is to determine if your question is a good one. Livingstone's article is a casserole of a 1000 questions larded with blobs of academic conventional wisdom (Citizens United? It's in there. Not sure why). He needs to pick one. traditionalguy said... \nWorking for themselves to succeed enobles men. It is the free man's purpose that created the Protestant Work Ethic of healthy people. It gives them success and something to teach the children by example like Fred Trump taught Donald and Donald taught his kids. Work by free men IS the pursuit of happiness for which Patriots formed our covenant Constitution. Peter said... \nWhy work? Better by far to just amuse ourselves. Just plant a few wires in our brains and stimulate us with attractive, realer-than-real fantasies while machines feed and clean and otherwise tend us until, ultimately, they dispose of our remains.Why work? Why achieve? Why do anything other than sit around all day, every day, in an adult-size diaper. So long as we can be well entertained, of course. Bruce Hayden said... \nI do think that this is going to be a problem. We aren't talking about not working, but rather, being able to work. The problem is that we are rich enough that we can afford to give everyone most of the basics. And automation has made much human labor cost ineffective. I was struck the other day reading about the history of fabrics and making clothes. Throughout most of human history, even making thread was long and laborious. We are now at the point where basic clothing is dirt cheap. Getting ready to move again, I was going through some of my clothes, and found 40-50 sport coats (almost 20 navy blazers), over 20 high quality (corporate attorney type) suits, maybe 150 ties, etc. Shirts, pants, shoes, etc. in probably almost as obscene levels. And, my partner is getting the big walk in closet for her collection of clothes. I will have to stuff all my stuff in one smaller walk in closet, and maybe two regular closets. Won't fit. And, that was after I moved half of my cold weather clothes to our house in MT last spring (my insulated navy blazer though is in our condo in the mountains here in CO). All because clothing is dirt cheap. And, then, I shop a lot at Dollar Tree (and the 99 cents store in PHX and LAS), as well as Big Lots, etc. Scissors used to be a prize. Now I buy them for $1. Flatware, plates, glasses, etc. Ditto a lot of other stuff. I don't run out of batteries, because I probably have 100 unused batteries in a box in the shop. Dozen or two of each of the popular sizes. I probably half at least a half dozen printers that I could get working if I wanted, as well as even more computer monitors. Three working iPads that I rotate through almost daily. We are planning maybe a half dozen TVs in the new house, none of them smaller than 32\". They are so cheap - why not? And, we aren't rich. It is just insanely easy to buy a lot of decent stuff these days, stuff that a couple generations ago would have cost a couple weeks work (my hourly billing rate buys me maybe a 42\" TV these days). The point is that we, as a nation, can afford to provide the basic necessities of life to most everyone (at least to the citizenry, but maybe not to the rest of the world, which is part of the problem with Obama's open border policy). And, it is getting worse. More things that used to be expensive are becoming cheap, or at least cheaper. I think that part of where we are going is that work is going to be a privilege, instead of a necessity. But without the need to strive, then what is the purpose of life? Let me add here that part of the problem that we are seeing in the inner city today is maybe a harbinger of what we may face in the future. Females no longer need males to help them raise their kids financially. The state provides for them instead. But that has negative consequences, including much of the inner city violence, esp. in lower income Black communities, because young males are not being properly domesticated.",

      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal November 29, 2016 That's what a headline yesterday said. But l ater in the day there was a statement from Trum p: “Kellyanne came to me and asked whether or not she could go public with her thoughts on the matter. I encouraged her to do so. Most importantly she fully acknowledged there is only one person that makes the decision. She has always been a tremendous asset and that will continue.” Did Kellyanne go rogue and is Trump now covering for her? Who knows? If he really was furious, I don't think he'd tell us. Amid reports of intense closed-door deliberations over who should be secretary of state, Ms. Conway had seemed intent on committing a heretical political act by an aide: boxing in her boss. She wrote on Twitter about a “deluge” of concerns from conservatives and appeared repeatedly on television, insisting that a Romney appointment would be seen by Mr. Trump’s supporters as a “betrayal.” As the linked NYT article suggests, it's got to be more complicated than that. I think it might have been a way for Trump to let Romney opponents know their voice has been heard and is represented in the discussions so they won't be so hostile when he actually does choose Romney. But I don't know. And what is Conway 's job title? Her allies describe her job as “the Kellyanne role,” a position in which the precise title does not completely capture the duties she is performing or the sway she has. Ms. Conway has a direct line to Mr. Trump, and she has said that he is supportive of seeing her on television. He should be. She is great on TV — and not by showing off herself. She spouts clear, straightforward arguments at a fast pace and appears unshakably devoted to Trump. Based on watching her on TV many times, I can't believe that her statements about Romney were not exactly what Trump wanted. The hard question is why did he want that? My bet is: Because he's going to pick Romney. Posted by Ann Althouse at 8:02 AM",

      "text": "10:50am PT by Lesley Goldberg Amazon and Execs From NBC, ABC, Fox, CBS to Skip January TCA Press Tour Getty Images; FilmMagic From left: Geller, Dungey, Greenblatt, Newman and Walden They join the previously announced Netflix, which is also bypassing the semi-annual Television Critics Association's winter tour stop. \nJanuary's semi-annual Television Critics Association press tour will be without some of the industry's biggest executives as well as another streaming outlet. \nAmazon has opted to join Netflix and completely sit out the January TCA press tour. Additionally, NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS have all eliminated executive panels from their day-long panels. Instead, insiders say, each of the Big Four networks want to focus on their midseason fare. Sources suggest that the networks will resume executive panels during the summer as they look to heavily promote their 2017-18 fall lineups. (The exec panels will return for summer 2017.) \nThe news comes as a recent poll of the TCA membership found that more than 60 percent of members felt it was important to have an executive panel twice a year. The bulk of the news that comes out of TCA largely stems from executive panels in which Bob Greenblatt, Channing Dungey, Gary Newman and Dana Walden as well as Glenn Geller are quizzed about trends, returning and new shows as well as hot topics in the industry including Peak TV, dwindling viewership and the struggle to cut through the increasingly cluttered landscape. (The CW's Mark Pedowitz as well as all the cable toppers will participate in January.) \nDuring the summer TCA, Geller — making his TCA debut — was roasted about CBS' lack of diversity during a panel in which he confessed the network needed to \" do better \" as part of a grueling 10-minute-long diversity discussion. Fox brass Walden and Newman fielded questions about the future of The X-Files; ABC's Dungey — also in her debut — opened up about axing Castle and plans for a Star Wars TV series; and Greenblatt and Jennifer Salke were quizzed on Trump. Given the near lack of a breakout broadcast hit and the absence of outright cancellations amid a lower ratings barometer, it's almost no surprise that execs from the Big 4 networks would sit out the January tour in an effort to maintain a positive news cycle. \nMany networks have voiced concerns about the rising costs and questionable value of TCA — as well as the impact on shows that take the time away from production. What was initially conceived as a way for press to have access to executives, producers and talent for both new and returning shows has evolved given the 24/7 news cycle and digital era. Gone are the days when talent was inaccessible and rarely did press. Instead, comments from the stage can often go viral before a panel ends given the prolific use of social media during the tour. The latter can make or break shows (and executives ). \nFor Amazon's part, the streamer and retail giant's summer TCA featured an exec session, followed by panels for Fleabag, Goliath, Good Girls Revolt, Man in the High Castle, Mozart in the Jungle, One Mississippi, Red Oaks and Transparent . \nMidseason broadcast shows that are expected to panel at TCA include ABC's Still Star-Crossed, Downward Dog, Imaginary Mary and Time After Time; CBS has Training Day and Superior Donuts; Fox has Shots Fired, Star, 24: Legacy, APB, Making History and The Mick; NBC has Taken, Powerless, Trial & Error, Midnight, Texas, Great News, Marlon as well as Blacklist: Redemption. \nWinter TCA will be held Jan. 5-Jan. 18 at the Langham in Pasadena. \nEditor's note: Lesley Goldberg is a TCA member.

      "text": "Buy from Amazon \nThese water-soluble crayons were launched on 17th February 2012. Four groups of colors: bright, pale, earth, and dark. Available as single sticks, as well as in tins of 12, 24, 36, or 72 colors. The set of 12 contains primaries (process cyan, process maganeta, process yellow, primary red and primary blue), tertiaries (tertiary purple and tertiary green), plus raw umber, Payne's grey, black, and opaque white.My initial thoughts on having tried them is that they're firmer than Lyra, but go down on paper smoothly and effortlessly. The paint created when you add water is intensely colored. I tried Artbars on quite absorbent paper, and had to scrub a bit with the brush to get a line to dissolve completely. I like this, as it means you can combine line and wash in a painting. The crayons are triangular, rather than round, which means it's easy to get a thin line without stopping to sharpen a point. Check Amazon rating » Image ©2007 Marion Boddy-Evans Buy from Amazon \nThese water soluble wax crayons are similar to Lyra's, but a bit harder. Size wise they're narrower and longer -- about 105mm long and 6mm in diameter. (I haven't yet melted a Lyra and Caran d'Ache to to compare if you're getting the same quantity of crayon overall.) Manufactured in Switzerland.Again the paper label is designed to be torn off in sections and you shouldn't leave them lying around in a hot spot or they'll melt. Available in 84 colors. Check Amazon rating » Image ©2007 Marion Boddy-Evans Buy from Amazon \nWoodless pencils, just the 'lead' covered with a wrapper, which means they never need sharpening. They're of medium hardness, so it's fairly easy to get a fine line and to put down a good quantity of color or only a little if you don't press hard.I often use these for sketching a composition on a canvas, using a color I know will be in my initial blocking in. When I start painting, I \"dissolve\" the sketch into the paint. Check Amazon rating » Photo ©2011 Marion Boddy-Evans. Licensed to About.com, Inc. Buy from Amazon I bought my first set of Derwent watercolor pencils about 15 years ago but never used them much as I found them too hard to get much color down easily. Most of the problem was more a question of my not working in colored pencil often enough, and forgetting I mustn't expect them to put down color like a crayon than a problem with them. Their hardness is good for getting fine lines, and for saturated color apply several layers or pick up color with a brush directly from the pencil.In January 2011 I got a new set (shown in the photo). The pencils are softer and smoother, going onto the paper more easily, but will still give a very fine point for detail. When I use them I can't help but hear a little advertising jingle going \"new and improved\". Check Amazon rating » Figure study done in water-soluble graphite. Photo ©2011 Marion Boddy-Evans. Licensed to About.com, Inc. Buy from Amazon \nDid you know you can also get water soluble versions of graphite pencils? If you use them dry, they work and look just like ordinary pencils. But put a wet brush to the pencil line, and it turns into transparent grey paint. Fabulous for working in monochrome, and for tonal studies. Water-soluble graphite is available as pencils and as woodless graphite sticks, in various degrees of pencil hardness .",

      "text": "\n\nJanuary's semi-annual Television Critics Association press tour will be without some of the industry's biggest executives as well as another streaming outlet.\n\nAmazon has opted to join Netflix and completely sit out the January TCA press tour. Additionally, NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS have all eliminated executive panels from their day-long panels. Instead, insiders say, each of the Big Four networks want to focus on their midseason fare. Sources suggest that the networks will resume executive panels during the summer as they look to heavily promote their 2017-18 fall lineups. (The exec panels will return for summer 2017.)\n\nThe news comes as a recent poll of the TCA membership found that more than 60 percent of members felt it was important to have an executive panel twice a year. The bulk of the news that comes out of TCA largely stems from executive panels in which Bob Greenblatt, Channing Dungey, Gary Newman and Dana Walden as well as Glenn Geller are quizzed about trends, returning and new shows as well as hot topics in the industry including Peak TV, dwindling viewership and the struggle to cut through the increasingly cluttered landscape. (The CW's Mark Pedowitz as well as all the cable toppers will participate in January.)\nSource: The Hollywood Reporter ",

      "text": "Buy on Amazon \nThe Perfect Club debuted in 2002, offered by a company founded by then-Golf Channel personality Peter Kessler. And Kessler was featured in infomercials that were in heavy rotation on the Golf Channel in 2002 and 2003. \nKessler is no longer affiliated with the company, and it is rare to see the clubs advertised today. But the brand is still around as \"The Perfect Club Golf Collection,\" and makes a range of clubs from drivers to chippers, in addition to the original long-iron replacement club. \nThat original Perfect Club was really one of the heavily marketed hybrid golf clubs, although back then it was more likely to be called a \"utility club.\" It used a shorter shaft to help give the golfer more control, with lots of game-improvement features including significant offset . \nThat original Perfect Club deserves its place in history as one of the first widely known and successfully direct-marketed hybrid golf clubs. \nAs noted, the Perfect Club brand today includes other types of clubs, and you can see those at theperfectclub.com. \ncontinue reading below our video Golf Shafts: Do You Need Steel or Graphite? \nHere is our original review of the original Perfect Club, originally published (that's a lot of originals) on Jan. 19, 2003. The Original Perfect Club: Pros, Cons and Keypoints \nPros Shorter shaft designed to help control shot. Lofted face, weighting get ball up in the air. Distance and loft produce long shots that land soft. \nCons Model tested felt too heavy. Offset a turnoff for some better players. \nKeypoints Shaft length of 39 inches is shorter than most fairway woods, most utility clubs and many long irons. Face of The Perfect Club is lofted 21 degrees. Low center of gravity makes clubhead easy to feel throughout swing, and helps get the ball airborne. An offset head helps many recreational players in their battles with the slice . The rounded sole, with raised \"V\", helps it glide through grass and avoid digging into sand or turf. The Perfect Club comes in right and left, men's and women's, steel or graphite shafted models. Men's model features Lamkin grip, women's model a Winn grip. Reviewing The Perfect Club \nJan. 19, 2003 - If you've caught much of The Golf Channel lately, you've probably caught some of the ubiquitous commercials featuring former Golf Channel host Peter Kessler touting The Perfect Club. \nKessler is president of the company and had a hand in the late stages of the club's development. He believes the company has built a better mousetrap by combining a clubhead that produces a higher launch angle and more distance with a shaft that helps create more control. \nThe shaft of The Perfect Club is what Kessler sees as the key. \n\"The only people who can really swing a long shaft that is lightweight ... are the 50 best players in the world,\" Kessler says. \"(They) have the swing speed and swing path to take advantage of longer, lighter shafts. The rest of us need shorter shafts, not longer shafts.\" \nThe Perfect Club features a shaft shorter than any other utility club on the market. In fact, while Kessler says the distance produced should be equivalent to your best 3- or 4-iron, he says the club should be played as you would play an 8-iron. \n\"We developed a club that allows you to play it as though it was a short iron, in the middle of your stance, but you get fairway wood kind of distance and height,\" Kessler says. \n\"The key educational thing for us is to tell people to play it where it instinctively feels right, which is in the center (of the stance), and go ahead and smash down on it like it was a pitching wedge or an 8-iron.\" \nWith more weighting in the clubhead, the player feels the clubhead throughout the swing. With a raised \"V\" wedge on the bottom of the clubhead, the club more easily glides through rough and better avoids digging into turf or sand. The loft helps get the ball airborne, while the short shaft gives a player a better shot at a good swing. \nThat's the theory. What's the result? \nWe struck the ball fairly well and fairly consistently on a day we were having some trouble with other clubs. The only drawback for us was that the club felt too heavy - but the model tested had a True Temper steel shaft. Graphite shafts are available, and are sure to be the more popular model. \nThe effectiveness of The Perfect Club was well-demonstrated, however, by a club pro who was hitting the club along with us. He hit 20 or so balls out of a fairway bunker , and 18 of them were perfect shots. \nEighteen out of 20 doesn't make The Perfect Club perfect, but it makes it perfectly clear that it's a club to be taken seriously. \nThe Bottom Line : The Perfect Club isn't perfect, but no golf club could ever be that. What The Perfect Club is is an excellent club that performs as advertised - well worth checking out.",

      "text": "Courtesy of CBS  14AM PT \nExecutives from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox will not participate in the traditional Q&A sessions at the Television Critics Association winter press tour next year. The TCA board confirmed the move by the Big Four in a note to members Tuesday. \nAmazon Studios also confirmed to Variety Tuesday that it has scuttled plans to participate in winter press tour. The streaming service had been scheduled to present Jan. 5, the first day of the more than two-week long event. \n“[TCA vice president Daniel Fienberg] and I have been in conversation with the networks and, unfortunately, given the jam-packed days ahead, Fox, ABC, CBS and NBC will not host executive sessions this tour,” TCA president Amber Dowling wrote Tuesday. “(They will resume the practice in the summer.) We’ve been assured the execs will be on hand during the networks’ respective days and that anyone needing quotes for their stories should reach out to the appropriate publicists. If you have any problems with access please let someone on the board know. (As ever, we encourage you to let the networks know how much you value executive sessions in both summer and winter.)” \nExecutive sessions have been a traditional cornerstone of press tour, which has for decades gathered reporters twice a year for a series of press conferences. The change of plans by the Big Four and Amazon comes after Netflix and Starz confirmed last month that they also will not participate int he coming tour. \nTelevision executives have grown increasingly uncomfortable with the tenor of TCA press conferences, complaining privately that they receive little benefit in the way of generating publicity for series while exposing executives and talent to virulent criticism on social media. TCA members have argued that event continues to be a useful forum for industry coverage. \nThe fifth major English-language U.S. broadcast network, the CW, still plans to hold an executive session at press tour in January.",

      "text": "Amazon Bows Out of TCA Winter Press Tour Along With Broadcast Executives \nCBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox chiefs will not appear at this year’s junket Joe Otterson   11:02 AM \nAmazon will not present any panels at the Television Critics Association (TCA) winter press tour this year, in addition to executives from NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox sitting out their executive sessions, TheWrap has learned. \nAmazon is the latest streaming service to announce that they would sit out the semi-annual event. Netflix announced earlier this year that they would not be attending the winter tour this time around. \nThe loss of the executive sessions is a serious blow to TCA, as plenty of news has been made during these sessions in previous years. For example, CBS Entertainment head Glen Geller got a lot of flack during the summer session for the lack of diverse lead characters on his network. However, the executives will return for the summer session in 2017. \nAn individual with knowledge of the networks’ decision not to include any executives this time around told TheWrap that they are choosing to focus on their midseason programming rather than the executive sessions. \nCBS is set to present “Training Day” and “Superior Donuts;” ABC will preview “Still Star-Crossed,”“Downward Dog,”“Imaginary Mary” and “Time After Time;” Fox will present “Shots Fired,”“Star,”“24: Legacy,”“APB,”“Making History” and “The Mick;” NBC will bring “Taken,”“Powerless,”“Trial & Error,”“Midnight, Texas,”“Great News,”“Marlon” and “Blacklist: Redemption.” \nThe TCA winter press tour will be held Jan. 5-Jan. 18 at the Langham in Pasadena.",

Both sale prices match what the company offered as part of its Black Friday sales. \nCyber Monday is a big sales day for Amazon. Last year, shoppers ordered more than 54 million items — 629 per second — on the Monday after Thanksgiving. \nAmazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year, will get early access to Lightning Deals. There will also be specific deals for shoppers using Alexa, the voice assistant in Echo. \nHere’s a look on what will be on sale Monday: 50-inch 1080p LED TV for $145 50-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart TV for $249.99 Amazon Voyage for $169.99 Amazon Fire TV for $74.99 Sonos PLAY: 1 compact wireless speaker for $149 Nest Cam indoor security camera for $163.98 Up to 50% off select Nerf, Playskool and Play-Doh toys Blendtec Total blender for $239.99 Up to 50% off select Callaway Golf sets ",

      "text": "TOP Santa Clara, California, USA - FEBRUARY 1, 2014: Amazon building in Santa Clara, California. Amazon is an American international electronic commerce company. It is the world's largest online retailer. [Shutterstock - Ken Wolter] 5350031 \nAn employee at Amazon, an electronic commerce corporation, jumped off a building at the company’s headquarters in Seattle after sending an email to hundreds of fellow staff including CEO Jeff Bezos. \nPolice believe that it was most likely a suicide attempt, reports Bloomberg. \nWhile the building is 12 stories high, the rooftop the man jumped from is four stories up, according to SeattlePI.com. \nAfter surviving the fall, he was sent to the hospital for his injuries. \nThe worker recently filed an official request to be transferred, but was instead put on an employment plan conditioning job safety on job performance, according to Bloomberg. (RELATED: Amazon Wants To Open 2,000 Grocery Stores In The Next Decade) \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nAmazon’s workplace culture is described as harsh and even abusive by some accounts. \nThe office environment’s reputation and public perception possibly prompted Bezos to encourage employees to report any incidences of maltreatment to the human resources department or directly to him. Bezos encouraged the change after a highly-critical New York Times piece . \nBezos event sent out a letter to shareholders soon after describing his thoughts about what his company’s true values and goals are. \n“A word about corporate cultures: for better or for worse, they are enduring, stable, hard to change,” the message read . “They can be a source of advantage or disadvantage.” \nSend tips to [email protected] .

      "text": "TOP 5350506 \nIs buying wedding/anniversary rings online a thing? I don’t really think so, but what do I know. I’ve never bought a wedding or anniversary ring, after all. If you are looking for a wedding or anniversary ring (which, judging by the sheer number of jewelry commercials I see during Sunday football each week, you are), let this one-day-only deal be an option. There are 139 rings included in this sale, so maybe you will find something you would like. I have no idea. \nAlso, I just found out that ring prices are dependent upon the size. Which I suppose makes a lot of sense. Anyway, here’s a ring I chose completely at random to display in the article. Keep in mind that I wouldn’t know a good ring from a bad one. Normally $4,000, this engagement ring is actually 61 percent off today (Photo via Amazon) \n14k White Gold Diamond Solitaire Engagement Ring (1 cttw, H-I Color, I2-I3 Clarity) on sale for $1,556.04 \nMaybe that’s a bad one to pick as an example. Maybe it’s a good one. Regardless, there are also many wedding, anniversary and engagement bands available for way cheaper than that. Go check them out yourself because I can’t offer a whole lot of help in this regard. Also, continue to look at the Daily Dealer for the best offers during Cyber Monday Deals Week. Unsurprisingly, the bride and groom in this picture are wearing wedding rings (Photo via Shutterstock) \nHave a suggestion for a cool product or great deal that you think Daily Caller readers need to know about?

      "text": "LOS ANGELES — Viewers will finally get to meet the Man in the High Castle.\nThough the show doesn't return until Dec. 16, Amazon on Tuesday announced that Stephen Root will play the actor behind the titular role.\nThe show, developed by Frank Spotnitz, is based on the bestselling 1962 Philip K. Dick novel. Set in 1962, the dystopian series takes place in an alternate history in which the Axis powers won WWII.\nRoot is most known for his role in Office Space. Most recently, he starred in the comedy film Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.\nHe's also had recurring roles on many popular TV shows including Fargo , The Big Bang Theory and Boardwalk Empire.\nSEE ALSO: Catch up with 'Man in the High Castle' in under four minutes\nIn Season 1, the Man in the High Castle remained a mystery. But starting with the first episode of Season 2, he'll have a big presence.\nHere's the full Season 2 synopsis via Amazon:\n\"The show resumes with Juliana Crain (Alexa Davalos) facing the consequences of her decision to betray the Resistance and allow Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank), a suspected Nazi agent, to escape the Pacific States with a film originally bound for the Man in the High Castle. Joe himself returns a hero to the Reich and finds himself thrust into the Nazi capital of Berlin, face to face with the father who abandoned him. Meanwhile, Frank Frink (Rupert Evans) becomes increasingly radicalized and drawn further into the resistance after seeing images of his own execution in the mysterious films.\nWith political tensions mounting between Germany and Japan, Trade Minister Tagomi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) begins to regret his success in smuggling nuclear technology from the Reich and seeks solace in the strange new world he discovered at the end of season one. Meanwhile, Obergruppenführer John Smith (Rufus Sewell) struggles to reconcile the values of the Reich with thedeteriorating health of his son— all while tasked with a mission from the Fuhrer for which failure is not an option. And Chief Inspector Kido (Joel De La Fuente) begins to take greater interest in the Man in the High Castle, the films, and how Juliana Crain is connect.\"",

      "text": "LeEco phones coming to Amazon, Best Buy, and Target LeEco Le Max Pro Although the company initially planned to have flash sales in the US, they are now dropping the idea and opening the web store 24/7. However, LeEco will sell its products in the US via other retailers as well. by Codrut Nistor, 2016/11/29 Android Phablet Smartphone Business   German-English-Translator - Details here LeEco apparently figured out that China is not the US and changed its business plan for the North American market. To be more accurate, they first decided to debut on the US market using the \"flash sale\" approach. Now, it looks like they are dropping that plan and moving to the traditional online business model widely used in the US. Starting today, the company's web store LeMall.com is open 24/7 for US customers. However, since overlooking the big retail names in the US would be a mistake, the Chinese company also plans to bring its products to Amazon, Target, and Best Buy. The three big online retailers mentioned above will have the Le S3 and Le Pro 3 in stock this Thursday, next to LeEco smart TVs. The products currently available on LeMall are Le Pro 3 ($399 USD), Le S3 ($249 USD), as well as the Super4 X43 Pro smart TV, priced at $649 USD. All come with free shipping and LeRewards instant rebates.  ",

      "text": "0 2 \nThe much maligned National Board of Review chose Amazon’s “Manchester by the Sea” for Best Film, Screenplay, Actor (Casey Affleck) and Breakthrough Performance – Male (Lucas Hedges). \nFor the first time in more than a decade, the NBR skipped over their favorite person, Clint Eastwood, his movie “Sully,” or anything else from Warner Bros., their longtime favored studio. That may be because Annie Schulhof’s pal, Dan Fellman, retired this year from the studio. So no “Sully,” nothing for Clint or even “Fantastic Beasts.” \nInstead, Schulhof concentrated on Barry Jenkins’“Moonlight,” from her new favorite studio, A24. “Moonlight” earned Best Director and Best Supporting Actress (Naomie Harris). That’s interesting in and of itself because the NBR rarely gives full acting honors to black actors. In the past they’ve either tied for an award (Morgan Freeman, in a Clint Eastwood movie) or been thrown the “breakthrough performance” bone. \nThis year, as usual, a breakthrough performance award went to black actress Royalty Hightower for her work in “The Fits.” They gave Best Ensemble to “Hidden Figures,” about three black women who were the mathematicians for NASA. \nThe NBR totally ignored a potential Oscar nominee in “Lion” but threw The Weinstein Company a bone by putting “Sing Street” on their list of Best Independent Films. \nThe NBR is a fan based, membership fee group made up of people who like movies and can afford annual membership of $600 and tickets to the gala dinner in January that cost that much as well. One woman, Annie Schulhof, calls the shots based on relationships with the studios, and who will buy tables for the dinner. “Manchester” deserves the kudos, but also Schulhof knows Amazon will buy those tables. “Moonlight” comes from A24. which has grown in favor with Schulhof because a board member, David Laub, started A24 before jumping ship to another company. \nHey, it’s all good! Last year, the 501 c 3 foundation NBR claimed its revenue was up to $490,000 from $428,000 in 2014. Salaries were $211,250. Grants to places like NYU Film school and the Ringling clown school came to a total of $61,500. student scholarships were $17,500. They have total assets of $850,000. It’s a nice little operation to rub shoulders with celebrities. No film critics allowed! (Very Trumpian.) \n\nBest Film: Manchester by the Sea \nBest Director: Barry Jenkins, Moonlight \nBest Actor: Casey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea \nBest Actress: Amy Adams, Arrival \nBest Supporting Actor: Jeff Bridges, Hell or High Water \nBest Supporting Actress: Naomie Harris, Moonlight \nBest Original Screenplay: Kenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea \nBest Adapted Screenplay: Jay Cocks and Martin Scorsese, Silence \nBest Animated Feature: Kubo and the Two Strings Breakthrough Performance (Male): Lucas Hedges, Manchester by the Sea \nBreakthrough Performance (Female): Royalty Hightower, The Fits \nBest Directorial Debut: Trey Edward Shults, Krisha \nBest Foreign Language Film: The Salesman \nBest Documentary: O.J.: Made in America \nBest Ensemble: Hidden Figures \nSpotlight Award: Creative Collaboration of Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg \nNBR Freedom of Expression Award: Cameraperson Top Films",

      "text": "Lack of fuel, guns hits Brazil's Amazon guardians Updated: November 29, 2016 — 10:11 AM EST Share Reuters Trucks loaded with tree trunks are burned by agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, during an operation to combat illegal mining and logging, in the municipality of Novo Progresso, Para State, northern Brazil, November 11, 2016. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino Mail icon \nNOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil (Reuters) - The rainforest shook with the sound of exploding tires and groaning steel as flames tore through a truck carrying giant tree trunks illegally sawn from the Amazon. \nAn agent of Brazil's environment police had, moments earlier, ordered the driver from his cab at gun point. In a scuffed blue cap and muddied jeans, the 25-year-old fought back tears as he learned his truck would be set alight right there. \nHe walked away rather than watch it burn. \nWhen able to do their job, agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, are decisive, punishing illegal loggers on the spot. \nBut this seizure was the only success in four days of operations this month near the town of Novo Progresso in Brazil's vast northern state of Para. \nHampered by poor radios with a maximum range of just 2 km (1.3 miles) and pick-up trucks easily recognised by those who cut down the forest, the exhausted Ibama agents were too often chasing shadows. \n\"The loggers are better equipped than we are,\" said Uiratan Barroso, Ibama's head of law enforcement in the state capital, Santarem. \"Until we have the money to rent unmarked cars and buy proper radios we won't be able to work.\" \nNearly twice the size of India, the Amazon absorbs an estimated 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making its preservation vital in the fight to halt global warming. \nIbama, responsible for preserving Brazil's 65 percent share of the world's largest rainforest, is one of the most important groups in that fight. But after years of surprising success, the rate of deforestation is on the rise again. \nOver the past four years it has risen 35 percent, as Ibama suffered from a lack of funding amid Brazil's worst recession in decades. \nLast year, rainforest five times the size of Los Angeles was cut down. \nLeaders from nearly 200 different countries met in Morocco this month to move forward on commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might cut funding for the deal signed in Paris last year. \nHere, in the badlands of rural Para, the challenges to those commitments are all too clear. \nA 30 percent cut in Ibama's budget has meant fewer operations this year. Helicopters and jeeps have been idle due to a lack of fuel. \n\"We haven’t even had enough money to pay for aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,” said Barroso, adding the tests only cost 200 reais ($60). \nIt is dangerous work. In June, a policeman was shot dead during an Ibama operation in Novo Progresso, a grid of dirt streets whose 25,000 inhabitants rely on illegal mining and logging for survival. \nCorruption is also a problem. Three Ibama officials in Santarem were charged last month for taking bribes from logging companies. \n\"I only trust around half the people I work with,\" Barroso said. \nNEW STRATEGY \nBrazil's environment ministry admits a lack of funds has reduced Ibama's ability to operate. \nThe situation should be helped by 56 million reais secured from the Fundo Amazonia, a fund principally financed by Norway and Germany. \nBut officials say a broader strategic change is also needed. \n\"The effectiveness of our current measures and enforcement has reached its limit,\" said Everton Lucero, the government's undersecretary for climate change. \nUntil four years ago, the approach proved highly effective. \nIbama helped to reduce the rate of deforestation by over 80 percent between 2004 and 2012. \nA mix of satellite imagery and a tough on-the-ground presence made Ibama a highly effective force in the fight against global warming. \nNow, there is a sense that Brazil's target of zero deforestation by 2030 will not simply be achieved with more 4x4s and semiautomatic rifles. \nA carrot is needed alongside the stick, officials say. \nOne option being discussed with other ministries, according to Lucero, is to create economic incentives for landowners and communities to preserve their forests. He said details on how this would work were still being finalised. \nPIONEERS \nPersuading towns like Novo Progresso to preserve the rainforest means transforming their culture and economy. \nIt lies on the BR-163 highway that runs north-to-south through the rainforest to join frontier farms with ports in the southeast. \nEnvironmental groups estimate 60 percent of Brazil's Amazonian deforestation happens along this stretch. \nNovo Progresso was one of many towns founded during Brazil's drive deep into the Amazon during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. \nThen, cutting down the Amazon to construct roads and towns was patriotic, a means of securing Brazil's borders. Many also got rich in the process. \nJose Carlos Rovaris, 62, bought his land near Novo Progresso in 1984, leaving his home in the southern state of Santa Catarina for a new life on the forest frontier. \n\"This was all trees when I arrived,\" he said, his belly protruding from a scrubby polo shirt as he moved his arm across the land now planted with soy as far as the eye can see. \"I cut it down bit by bit, every year a little more.\" \nThe impact of those pioneers is staggering. \nIn 1933, British explorer Peter Fleming described neighbouring Mato Grosso state as \"huge tracts of jungle which no white man has even attempted to enter.\" \nNow, it is Brazil's largest soy producer. Its transformation from jungle to agricultural heartland helped make Brazil the world's largest exporter of beef and soy. \nWith that has come increased power in Congress and environmentalists fear President Michel Temer's government will bow to pressure to ease environmental licensing laws as it aims to rekindle economic growth. \nThe transition from forest to farmland is a devastating double blow for the environment. Trees absorbing CO2 are commonly replaced with methane polluting cattle. \nNO JOBS \nIbama operates on the limits of a law its agents regard as too soft. \nBurning trucks is the most effective deterrent in their arsenal. They do this if the vehicle is on protected land inhabited by indigenous groups or if the truck cannot be removed because the driver has fled or the vehicle is damaged. \nBut those caught cutting down the rainforest never see the inside of a jail cell unless convicted of a more serious, related crime such as money laundering or violence. \nMany in Novo Progresso see no other way to get by. \n\"There is nothing else,\" said Elis Pereira, 25, at the Ibama office after his truck was burned. Sleep-deprived and famished after days in the forest waiting for the rain to pass, he said the fine and loss of his truck meant he would be \"pushed into crime.\" \nWith no new land legally available and farming so mechanized it requires little labour, Pereira is part of a generation growing up in towns like Novo Progresso with scant job prospects. Unless a sustainable source of employment can be created, deforestation is unlikely to stop. \nPereira's future looks bleak. He bought the truck that is now charred steel for 60,000 reais just six weeks ago. That money was borrowed from the illegal loggers for whom he worked transporting timber. \n\"I'll have to let them know,\" he said, eyes vacant with exhaustion and fear. \"I hope they understand.\" \nClick on http://reut.rs/2fsKzRB to see a related photo essay \n(Additional reporting by Ueslei Marcelino in Novo Progresso and Anthony Boadle in Brasilia; Editing by Kieran Murray) Published: November 29, 2016 — 10:11 AM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "WIDER IMAGE-Lack of fuel, guns hits Brazil's Amazon guardians Updated: November 29, 2016 — 10:00 AM EST Share \n* Photo essay at http://reut.rs/2fsKzRB \nBy Stephen Eisenhammer \nNOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The rainforest shook with the sound of exploding tires and groaning steel as flames tore through a truck carrying giant tree trunks illegally sawn from the Amazon. \nAn agent of Brazil's environment police had, moments earlier, ordered the driver from his cab at gun point. In a scuffed blue cap and muddied jeans, the 25-year-old fought back tears as he learned his truck would be set alight right there. \nHe walked away rather than watch it burn. \nWhen able to do their job, agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, are decisive, punishing illegal loggers on the spot. \nBut this seizure was the only success in four days of operations this month near the town of Novo Progresso in Brazil's vast northern state of Para. \nHampered by poor radios with a maximum range of just 2 km (1.3 miles) and pick-up trucks easily recognized by those who cut down the forest, the exhausted Ibama agents were too often chasing shadows. \n\"The loggers are better equipped than we are,\" said Uiratan Barroso, Ibama's head of law enforcement in the state capital, Santarem. \"Until we have the money to rent unmarked cars and buy proper radios we won't be able to work.\" \nNearly twice the size of India, the Amazon absorbs an estimated 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making its preservation vital in the fight to halt global warming. \nIbama, responsible for preserving Brazil's 65 percent share of the world's largest rainforest, is one of the most important groups in that fight. But after years of surprising success, the rate of deforestation is on the rise again. \nOver the past four years it has risen 35 percent, as Ibama suffered from a lack of funding amid Brazil's worst recession in decades. \nLast year, rainforest five times the size of Los Angeles was cut down. \nLeaders from nearly 200 different countries met in Morocco this month to move forward on commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might cut funding for the deal signed in Paris last year. \nHere, in the badlands of rural Para, the challenges to those commitments are all too clear. \nA 30 percent cut in Ibama's budget has meant fewer operations this year. Helicopters and jeeps have been idle due to a lack of fuel. \n\"We haven't even had enough money to pay for aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,\" said Barroso, adding the tests only cost 200 reais ($60). \nIt is dangerous work. In June, a policeman was shot dead during an Ibama operation in Novo Progresso, a grid of dirt streets whose 25,000 inhabitants rely on illegal mining and logging for survival. \nCorruption is also a problem. Three Ibama officials in Santarem were charged last month for taking bribes from logging companies. \n\"I only trust around half the people I work with,\" Barroso said. \nNEW STRATEGY \nBrazil's environment ministry admits a lack of funds has reduced Ibama's ability to operate. \nThe situation should be helped by 56 million reais secured from the Fundo Amazonia, a fund principally financed by Norway and Germany. \nBut officials say a broader strategic change is also needed. \n\"The effectiveness of our current measures and enforcement has reached its limit,\" said Everton Lucero, the government's undersecretary for climate change. \nUntil four years ago, the approach proved highly effective. \nIbama helped to reduce the rate of deforestation by over 80 percent between 2004 and 2012. \nA mix of satellite imagery and a tough on-the-ground presence made Ibama a highly effective force in the fight against global warming. \nNow, there is a sense that Brazil's target of zero deforestation by 2030 will not simply be achieved with more 4x4s and semiautomatic rifles. \nA carrot is needed alongside the stick, officials say. \nOne option being discussed with other ministries, according to Lucero, is to create economic incentives for landowners and communities to preserve their forests. He said details on how this would work were still being finalized. \nPIONEERS \nPersuading towns like Novo Progresso to preserve the rainforest means transforming their culture and economy. \nIt lies on the BR-163 highway that runs north-to-south through the rainforest to join frontier farms with ports in the southeast. \nEnvironmental groups estimate 60 percent of Brazil's Amazonian deforestation happens along this stretch. \nNovo Progresso was one of many towns founded during Brazil's drive deep into the Amazon during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. \nThen, cutting down the Amazon to construct roads and towns was patriotic, a means of securing Brazil's borders. Many also got rich in the process. \nJose Carlos Rovaris, 62, bought his land near Novo Progresso in 1984, leaving his home in the southern state of Santa Catarina for a new life on the forest frontier. \n\"This was all trees when I arrived,\" he said, his belly protruding from a scrubby polo shirt as he moved his arm across the land now planted with soy as far as the eye can see. \"I cut it down bit by bit, every year a little more.\" \nThe impact of those pioneers is staggering. \nIn 1933, British explorer Peter Fleming described neighboring Mato Grosso state as \"huge tracts of jungle which no white man has even attempted to enter.\" \nNow, it is Brazil's largest soy producer. Its transformation from jungle to agricultural heartland helped make Brazil the world's largest exporter of beef and soy. \nWith that has come increased power in Congress and environmentalists fear President Michel Temer's government will bow to pressure to ease environmental licensing laws as it aims to rekindle economic growth. \nThe transition from forest to farmland is a devastating double blow for the environment. Trees absorbing CO2 are commonly replaced with methane polluting cattle. \nNO JOBS \nIbama operates on the limits of a law its agents regard as too soft. \nBurning trucks is the most effective deterrent in their arsenal. They do this if the vehicle is on protected land inhabited by indigenous groups or if the truck cannot be removed because the driver has fled or the vehicle is damaged. \nBut those caught cutting down the rainforest never see the inside of a jail cell unless convicted of a more serious, related crime such as money laundering or violence. \nMany in Novo Progresso see no other way to get by. \n\"There is nothing else,\" said Elis Pereira, 25, at the Ibama office after his truck was burned. Sleep-deprived and famished after days in the forest waiting for the rain to pass, he said the fine and loss of his truck meant he would be \"pushed into crime.\" \nWith no new land legally available and farming so mechanized it requires little labor, Pereira is part of a generation growing up in towns like Novo Progresso with scant job prospects. Unless a sustainable source of employment can be created, deforestation is unlikely to stop. \nPereira's future looks bleak. He bought the truck that is now charred steel for 60,000 reais just six weeks ago. That money was borrowed from the illegal loggers for whom he worked transporting timber. \n\"I'll have to let them know,\" he said, eyes vacant with exhaustion and fear. \"I hope they understand.\" Click on http://reut.rs/2fsKzRB to see a related photo essay \n(Additional reporting by Ueslei Marcelino in Novo Progresso and Anthony Boadle in Brasilia; Editing by Kieran Murray) Published: November 29, 2016 — 10:00 AM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

As Amazon sells out of their stock these will be fulfilled by 3rd party vendors at a higher cost.

Instead, however, he was placed on an “employee improvement plan”--a step that could result in his termination from Amazon amzn if his performance didn’t improve, notes Bloomberg.\n \nIn the email, the man reportedly criticized the company’s handling of his transfer request and “hinted that he might harm himself,” a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.\n\"Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Fortune in a statement, who declined to comment on the matter further. \"He's receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.”",

      "title": "Amazon planning a 'premium' Echo speaker with a touchscreen",
      "text": "By James Walker 3 hours ago in Technology Amazon is planning an upgraded version of its popular Echo smart speaker with a large touchscreen display, according to a report today. The new device will be physically bigger and include higher-quality speakers but retain the same functionality. The more advanced Echo is being built as a response to the unexpected success of the original. Amazon also wants to secure its position as market leader against the likes of Apple and Google, Bloomberg reported today. The current Echo is based on a cylindrical design that's meant to be unobtrusive and easy to position in any room. At first glance, it resembles a regular speaker, primarily relying on voice control to interact with its smart functionality. The next-generation model will adopt a different form, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to Bloomberg . It will be larger and tilt upwards at the top, angling a completely new seven-inch touchscreen towards where the user is standing. Improved speakers capable of producing more detailed audio will be integrated into the device, making the Echo more suitable as a sound system replacement. The new Echo will run on an optimised version of Amazon's Fire OS. The company's Alexa digital assistant will still be the main way of interacting with the speaker. Alexa will retain its current capabilities, including basic news, weather, mail and calendar functionality alongside a rapidly growing ecosystem of third-party services. It's currently unclear what the new touchscreen will be used for. One of Bloomberg's sources suggested it could act as a digital photo board while the Echo is idling, replacing the refrigerator door as a place to store reminders, images and important notes. Smart home products are being viewed as the next frontier of consumer technology but have yet to take off in a major way. Hub products like the Echo are designed to link multiple devices together, becoming a single way to interact with everything in your home. The touchscreen could also help with this, allowing the Echo to manage other devices and expose functionality that’s too complex for voice commands alone. The Echo has been one of the most successful smart home devices to date, becoming especially popular in the U.S. Its popularity has not yet been replicated by rival smart speakers and the device has gained mainstream attention. Amazon is about to be confronted by new competition though, including Google Home . The updated Echo will help to reaffirm Amazon's market dominance and allow it to improve on the current model's hardware limitations. Amazon will unveil the device during the first quarter of 2017, according to Bloomberg's sources. Pricing is expected to be higher than the current Echo but may be subject to change.",

By Nov. 29, 2016 12:53 p.m. ET Text Size ENLARGE Online shopping isn’t much of a novelty anymore Photo: NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images \nWall Street doesn’t think much of the early numbers for online holiday shopping, as Amazon stock has been trending lower since Thanksgiving, from $780 to a recent $766. E-commerce sales growth appears to have decelerated during the three special sale days that analysts track — Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday — according to estimates from Adobe.com and Instinet. For those three days, sales rose 15%, versus 18% last year, they estimate. \nBut there’s reason to believe that Amazon no longer needs Black Friday and Cyber Monday the way it once did. \nFrankly, online shopping isn’t much of a novelty anymore. It’s become so easy that people are increasingly willing to make big purchases on their phones rather than surf on the computer. Mobile sales are expected to make up 36% of early-holiday shopping this year, from 31% last year. \nAnd those sales should sustain the holiday sales boom for the entire Christmas season, rather than just the days after Thanksgiving: “The reduced friction of an e-commerce sale is likely moving consumer holiday shopping away from a few frenzied Thanksgiving holiday days and toward a more evenly distributed timeline of purchasing behavior,” notes Instinet analyst Anthony DiClemente. \nAmazon upgraded its mobile app in time for the holidays and found more ways to get you to reach into your wallet (yoo-hoo, Alexa’s calling!), and it’s likely to keep picking up share from less agile brick and mortar competitors. MKM Partners analyst Patrick McKeever notes that Wal-Mart ’s Black Friday appears to have been a “dud.” It’s likely the big-box chain continues to lose share to Amazon, whose shares could see a boost as more holiday sales data comes out. \nBig Picture: Wall Street is too fixated on Amazon’s early-holiday sales, even as the company looks poised to take more market share. \nMore from Barron’s Next:",

      "text": "Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article \nAt the AWS re:Invent conference, which kicks off Tuesday, Amazon Web Services (AWS) partners will keep a laser focus on the company's Internet of Things (IoT) strategy. \nLast year, AWS launched its IoT platform, which helps system integrators build and host the back-end functionality needed to power IoT applications. This year, partners want to hear more about how AWS plans to loop its broader channel into this strategy and further enhance its existing offerings. \n\"I'm interested to see if AWS comments on their stance as it pertains to the channel,\" said Eric Rockwell, president and CIO of CentrexIT, a San Diego, Calif.-based managed services provider. \"I want to hear more about the future of the AWS channel program, how they'll be tailoring that in the next two to three years.\" \n[Related: The Network Must Get Smarter: 8 Ways Cisco Aims To Conquer The IoT Market ] \nThe AWS managed cloud platform enables customers to connect with cloud applications, and includes technologies like a set of SDK client libraries, an AWS management console and AWS IoT starter kits. \nRockwell, whose company secures vulnerabilities in enterprise systems and vertical markets, said Amazon is actively working on looping its channel into IoT opportunities, but he would like to see specific steps for the future. \nThe AWS IoT platform enables partners to use Amazon's popular, integrated services, including the company's Aurora database, Redshift analytics platform and the Kinesis streaming data platform. \nAater Suleman, CEO of Austin, Tex.-based Flux7, said that these services make AWS IoT a particularly strong platform – especially the integration with AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda enables users to run \"stateless\" code on servers, meaning the code isn't wed to any particular infrastructure and it is designed to always run when triggered. That service allows users to run code for their applications without having to maintain, scale, patch or own the hardware that underpins the services they're providing via those applications. \n\"AWS is a system built around individual services – not only does Lambda exist out of the box, but it works natively with IoT,\" he said. \"If you look at the entire piece from an integration perspective, it is a holistic platform.\" \nFlux7 specializes in the AWS DevOps framework and offers IoT consulting services. For instance, the AWS partner worked with integrated geotechnical and geoscience company Fugro to launch an IoT-based service that improved disaster recovery, increased developer agility and sped up time to market. \nLooking forward, Suleman said he hopes to hear more announcements surrounding AWS, particularly around the tight integration of Amazon services in AWS IoT. \n\"From an announcement perspective, there are numerous small improvements and integrations we're looking for,\" he said. \"For instance, if customers don't want to use Lambda, we currently have to re-route all those requests. We want more integration options to see where we can expand our services, particularly with customers' pre-existing business processes.\" \nThe AWS re:Invent conference kicks off Tuesday in Las Vegas.",

A petition urging a boycott was subsequently launched online. Comments on social media suggest that advertisements with pictures of doormats with Islamic symbols have been up on Amazon at least since June. One of them alleged that “Allah Islam Symbols Doormat and Dog Mat” could be bought for $17.44. People have been expressing their shock that the word ‘Allah’ – the Arabic word for ‘God’ – was written in Islamic calligraphy on a mat used",

      "text": "Amazon employee attempts suicide at company HQ after sending warning email to Jeff Bezos, co-workers This won't help Amazon's reputation for having a toxic work environment on Nov 29, 2016, 3:30 PM TechSpot \nStories of Amazon’s toxic work environment have been around for years; in 2015, CEO Jeff Bezos said a damning New York Times report didn’t “describe the Amazon I know.” But it appears that the online retail giant still has problems when it comes to employee moral, after one worker jumped off a building in what police are calling a suicide attempt. \nThe incident took place at about 8:45 local time at the company’s Seattle headquarters on Monday. Bloomberg reports that the man hasn’t been identified, but police said he survived the 12-story fall and was taken to a nearby hospital. \nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, the man had sent out an email visible to hundreds of co-workers and company boss Bezos, which criticized the way his transfer request had been handled. He wanted to be moved to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan that can lead to termination if the person doesn’t quickly show signs that he or she is improving. \nThe unidentified source said the man hinted in the email that he may harm himself. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nLast Year’s Times piece interviewed over 100 current and former Amazon employees who talked about the company’s use of cruel management practices and its lack of empathy for staff with health and family problems. The article referred to the performance improvement plan as Amazon code for “you’re in danger of being fired.” \nAmazon’s questionable attitude toward its employees isn’t limited to those in the US. A BBC investigation into one of its UK-based warehouses found workers were expected to collect orders every 33 seconds - conditions that a stress expert said could cause \"mental and physical illness.\" Additionally, Amazon staff at four of its warehouses in Germany have gone on strike several times over pay and working conditions. Whether this latest incident results in a change to management practices remains to be seen. Related Reads",

      "text": "Amazon's next Alexa device will feature a 7-inch touchscreen Amazon's next Alexa device will feature a 7-inch touchscreen Posted: Tags : Accessories - Accessories + Amazon - Amazon + Amazon's Alexa AI is easily one of my favorite creations of the Seattle-based company. I've been a proud owner of the original Amazon Echo since it was first made available to just Prime customers, and it's been fantastic to see how far the Alexa platform has grown and matured since its initial release. The experience of using the Echo has gotten so much more enjoyable as time has gone on, but as Alexa has grown smarter, the Echo hardware itself still leaves me wanting a bit more at times. The device itself is built like a tank, and as much as I appreciate that aspect of it, I do find myself occasionally wishing that the actual audio quality was a bit better at times. A new report from Bloomberg suggests that Amazon is currently working on another Alexa-powered device, and it's looking like it could shape up to be the best one yet. The new device is reportedly set to debut sometime in Q1 of 2017, and in addition to featuring updated speakers for all-around better audio quality, the new Alexa gadget will also come equipped with something quite special - a 7-inch touchscreen. This would result in the device being the first Echo product to feature any sort of built-in display, and it's reported that the screen will showcase information that's related to your interactions with Alexa. For example, asking for the weather would bring up a visual forecast, calling upon your calendar would showcase your upcoming appointments, etc. The positioning of the screen is also said to feature an upwards tilt, allowing for easier readability when it's placed on a counter or table. The original Amazon Echo is still the most expensive item in the company's product line at $179.99, and we should expect this new addition to cost even more thanks to the improved speakers and inclusion of the 7-inch touchscreen. Amazon has to officially comment on this unnamed device, but seeing as how it's slated to be released within the first bit of next year, we shouldn't have to wait too much longer before we get official confirmation on Amazon's most powerful Echo yet.

      "title": "Amazon Redesigns Its Connected Speaker",
      "text": "Amazon Redesigns Its Connected Speaker (AMZN, AAPL) By Rakesh Sharma | November 29, 2016 — 3:23 PM EST \nAmazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) is reconfiguring Alexa. \nAccording to a Bloomberg repor t, Amazon is adding a seven-inch touchscreen to Echo, its popular smart home device, to make it easier for users to scroll through weather forecasts, news, and calendar appointments on it. The touchscreen may also serve another purpose. A May Wall Street Journal story stated that Amazon’s Lab126 hardware unit was working on a tablet-like screen “so that users can summon Web pages, videos or images when, say, their hands are covered in flour.” \nThe Bloomberg report, which cites unnamed sources, also claims that the new device’s speaker will be larger and tilt upwards to enable users to better access the new touchscreen. The screen itself may be equipped with the ability for users to physically pin photographs onto it, much like a refrigerator. The device was earlier shaped like a cylinder that featured two downward-facing speakers and seven microphones. \nAmazon’s proposed redesign occurs as the market for connected speakers is becoming crowded. Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Google ( GOOG ) released Google Home, its take on the connected speaker, in September this year. Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) is also said to be working on its own version of a connected speaker. (See also: Apple Is Building Homes With Connected Devices ). \nGoogle’s device has two microphones and four speakers. It has a slanted top with colorful lights that start blinking when they hear a user command. Reviewers have praised the Google device for its design and colored base. However, Amazon’s device has come out the winner in terms of functionality and ability to get things done. This is primarily because the company has added developer integration with services, such as pizza delivery, and also open-sourced its skills kit to developers. (See also: How Does Google Home Compare With Amazon's Alexa? ) \nThe Seattle company has a head start in the market. In addition to selling more than five million units of its device since 2014, Amazon has also introduced variants at different price points. The Echo, Dot, and Tap speakers are priced at $180, $130, and $50. Learn how to invest by subscribing to the Investing Basics newsletter Thanks for signing up to Investing Basics.",
