The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": "Amazon’s new show, The Grand Tour has landed--no stormed--into our lives. The first episode, which aired Nov. 17, was Amazon’s most watched premiere.\nBut some of the show’s millions of viewers out there might have been confused at times, even as they laughed at the one-liners and sat in suspense as the track battle between the Porsche 918, McLaren P1, and Ferrari LaFerrari played out.\nThe Grand Tour is a big budget reprisal of the BBC’s Top Gear with its longtime co-presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.\nClarkson, Hammond, and May are all, of course, from the UK. Which means they speak English. Not “American.” And that can be confusing to our unsophisticated ears. The presenters even touched on this, ever so briefly in the first episode.\nWe’ve put together a guide of sorts that provides a translation on car parts and terms, as well as a few other sayings that pop up in the episodes. Fortune will update it on occasion as necessary. You never know when a new car term or turn-of-phrase will end up in The Grand Tour . There are 11 episodes left. We’re here all season.\nThe guide : A bonnet is a hood, not the headgear worn by babies and 17th century ladies.\nA boot is a trunk, not what cowboys wear. It’s also not a device slapped onto a vehicle’s tire by city law enforcement for failure to pay fines, that’s a clamp.\nA cubby box is a glovebox, not the space where kindergarteners place their backpacks and lunches.\nA dynamo is a generator, not an energetic person or professional sports star.\nA hood is a convertible top, not the hood of a car. That’s a bonnet.\nLorry is a semi truck, not a woman’s name.\nPetrol is fuel, not a--wait you should really know what petrol is even if you’ve never been out of the United States. Read a book.\nSaloon is a two- or four-door sedan, not a bar where boot-wearing cowboys and gamblers hang out. This is not Tombstone in the 1880s.\nSide curtains are removable windows, not a piece of cloth used to shield light and all those prying eyes trying to see inside your VW microbus. We all know what you’re smoking.\nA silencer is a muffler, not the firearm accessory used in movies.\nA torch is a flashlight, not a piece of wood wrapped in cloth that’s been soaked in tallow and lit on fire to provide light. Nobody does that anymore, except maybe on Survivor .\nA wing is a fender, not the spicy sauce-laden bar food made of chicken, but called buffalo.\nEpisode 2 of The Grand Tour is available on Amazon Video on November 25.",

      "text": "A federal judge late Wednesday ordered pilots for cargo carrier ABX Air, which has Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and DHL as major customers, to go back to work, easing fears of shipping delays for a deluge of holiday packages.\nJudge Timothy Black upheld a temporary restraining order requested by ABX, a unit of Air Transport Services Group. The pilots, part of the Teamsters union, walked off the job on Tuesday morning. DHL had said that the stoppage would delay some deliveries through Thanksgiving.\nAmazon said it was not yet affected by the ABX pilots action. Amazon also ships via United Parcel Service ( UPS ) and FedEx ( FDX ). This is the first holiday season that it has used ABX and Atlas Air to handle some of its cargo, reducing its dependence on UPS and FedEx.",

      "text": "Previous Next \nSEATTLE (AP) — Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

My car doesn't have an Aux in and Bluetooth on mine only does phone calls so I use one of these to stream music to FM. I have found that you should use the lowest frequency your radio will tune to (87.5 or 87.7) for best results.\n\nDescription:\n- UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY: The Car Bluetooth Receiver works with smartphones iPhone, iPad, iPod, Tablet and more；Supporting AUX output and input, work with SD, TF card or MP3, MP4 players via 3.5mm audio jack.

      "text": "Amazon to rival Ticketmaster with expanded ticketing business Convenient. Samantha O'Connor 24 Nov, 2016. Photography by Flore Diamant \nAmazon has been plotting their takeover of the ticketing business for quite some time and now the company is expanding their business. Last year, they launched their ticketing extension in the UK and now, they're opening up shop in the US, Europe and Asia. \nIt seems as though Amazon has the possibility of overtaking Ticketmaster as the \"world's premier destination\" for tickets. They're looking to have the ability to offer access to the best seats for sale by making exclusive deals with promoters and artists, as well as offering convenience since it will be tied to Amazon customer accounts. \nInteresting.",

(Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) \nSEATTLE (AP) — Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.     \nAmazon Parents looking for a way to entice their kids to read more have a new tool in their arsenal: Amazon has launched a Kindle for kids . \nThey've taken a couple of plays from their  Fire Kids Edition Tablet  playbook, but have also made some different choices. Unlike the tablet, the hardware in this Kindle is identical to the standard Kindle Amazon sells to adults.  \nIt has a six-inch touchscreen, weeks worth of battery life, and enough storage space to hold thousands of books. Unlike the regular Kindle though, all Kids Edition Kindle's come with a free outer case and a two-year protection plan. This is the same \"no questions asked\" protection plan Amazon has bundled with the Fire Kids Edition. It should take a load off your mind if you're worried about your kid breaking their new toy, I mean, reading device, in the first week. \nMaking a Kindle for kids makes sense, because unlike a tablet, the only thing you can do with a Kindle is read. This cuts down on potential distractions. The weeks-long battery life is another benefit; I have enough trouble keeping my own devices alive, never mind relying on a kid to keep theirs charged.\nSome of Kindle's built-in software can also encourage kids to begin reading more and more challenging material over time. The built-in dictionary is only a tap away, and any word a kid looks up is automatically added to a \"vocabulary builder\" for future reference. Many children's books have a feature built in called Word Wise, which puts easily understandable definitions near difficult words.\nThese tools, combined with Kindle's \"FreeTime\" parental controls, make the Kindle for Kids a compelling product for kids who want to be able to read all their favorite books wherever they go. Those same tools help the kid feel more self sufficient, by easily letting them look up words and build their vocabularies without any help. All in a device that can easily slip in a backpack or day bag.\nIf a kid in your life is already a voracious reader, this should be a no-brainer, but it could also be a useful tool for kids who struggle with traditional books. The fact that it's covered by a two-year warranty is icing on the cake. \nKindle for Kids Bundle ,  $99.99, available at Amazon \n",

      "text": "-Clip the one time use $1.75 off coupon on the product page. \n-Using Subscribe & Save waives the requirement to place a $25 order for add-on items. \n-Use Subscribe & Save for these prices and free shipping with no minimum purchase requirement. If you subscribe to 4 items or less you’ll pay $3.48. If you subscribe to 5+ items then the price drops to $2.93. If you add enough items before your next monthly Subscribe & Save order goes out, all previously ordered subscription items will automatically drop to the lower price. It can be worth adding more subscribe and save items before they ship so that you save 15% on all the items you subscribe to. \n-You can cancel the subscribe and save service with absolutely no obligation or penalty once the item ships.

USA TODAY NETWORK\nCustomers sift through merchandise at Walmart's Black Friday shopping event in Rogers, Ark., last year (Photo: Gunnar Rathbun, Invision, for Walmart)\nWith Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales upon us, retailers have upped their promotions to lure in shoppers with big “doorbuster” deals on technology. But just because a TV is “4K” or “$500 off” doesn’t necessarily make it a good deal.\nHere’s a guide on sorting the studs from the duds on the shopping holiday.\nKnow what you want to buy-- Don't be fooled by buzz words Just because something may be on sale doesn't necessarily mean you want it. If your current TV works fine and you aren't buying a 4K game system like a PS4 Pro or Xbox One S, or a streaming device like a Chromecast Ultra or Roku Ultra anytime soon, you don't need to spend money on a 4K TV this weekend. And unless you are buying a 55-inch TV or larger you likely won't even fully appreciate the difference 4K makes.\nUSA TODAY\nThe best online Black Friday deals at Amazon, Best Buy, and more\nIf you are in the market for a TV, look for something called HDR, short for high-dynamic range. This will display richer colors, deeper blacks, and brighter whites to make what you see even more realistic. As with 4K, HDR content is still lacking, but it is quickly picking up. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One S already allow you to play certain games in HDR, with more content coming next year.\nBeware of old products While Black Friday is a great time to buy products at a discount, it is also a great time for manufacturers to clear inventory. Samsung, for instance, is selling a pre-owned Sprint Galaxy Note 3 phone on its site as one of its \"Black Friday deals\" for $249.99. The Galaxy Note 3 was a great phone-- three years ago. Not only is the phone long out of date but there are plenty of better options at that price point including the Nextbit Robin and Moto G4 Plus. They aren't the most powerful phones, but they are at least modern.\nUSA TODAY\nDon't be fooled by some Black Friday 'deals'\nIf you're willing to spend a little more, you can choose some more powerful options such as the OnePlus 3T, ZTE Axon 7 or LeEco's Le Pro 3, which all retail for under $400.\nKnow the prices, the actual prices More than a few of the Black Friday deals advertise big discounts like 25% off a game or $100 off a TV. These sound great, but searching the product you're about to buy may reveal that this deal isn't all that its cracked up to be. Often times the discounts are on the manufacturer's suggested retail price, or the products' original price, and depending on how the item has been sitting on the shelves in or a warehouse, that price may outdated.\nThere is no denying that every little bit of savings counts, but a quick search could show that it may not be worth buying this product right now.\nLook up the products you're about to buy An $150 TV or an $100 laptop sounds great on its face. But know what you're about to buy.\nThat $100 computer, a staple at a few Black Friday shops such as Best Buy and Dell, is a basic, low powered machine. The processors aren't great and neither are the screens. Will it do the job for basic web browsing and working on a Word document? Sure, but you'd be better off springing the extra $20 for a Chromebook. Walmart has a Samsung Chromebook 3 for $119 on Black Friday, and we're talking the better performance.\nUSA TODAY\n4 things to know before shopping for Black Friday doorbuster deals\nSame is true for TVs, phones, video games and appliances. Research the brands, and where possible and model numbers.\nShop around and plan ahead Jordas Reyes, manager of a Best Buy store near Fort Myers, Fla., knows Black Friday is a big challenge (Photo: Casey Logan, The News-Press)\nIn today's world, shopping at multiple stores at the same time has never been easier. Before you buy that TV from Best Buy, check out Walmart, Target, Amazon or Costco. A quick glance at the screen on your smartphone could find better deals elsewhere.\nIt is also important to plan ahead. The touted \"doorbuster\" deals are often limited, so do your research before the sales start to make sure you know exactly when and where you need to be.\nHappy shopping.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n127 CONNECT TWEET 5 LINKEDIN 5 //usat.ly/2gjlxR1",

      "text": "\nControl your music and way more with Amazon's line of Echo smart speakers.\nThe world of the connected home is still very much a disconnected mess. As Apple and Google each compete with their own standards — and other companies doing the same with their own — Amazon has quietly snuck in the side door with its smart, attractive, and intelligent speaker. Or, rather, speakers. After more than a year with just the Amazon Echo to lead the way, Amazon's line of smart speakers embodies that future. The Echo , Tap, and Dot are very similar smart speakers, in that they perform nearly all the same functions, with some minor differences.\nIf you're in the market for a smart speaker but can't decide between these three, we'll outline the key differences and let you know which one is best for you.\nAmazon Echo Amazon Dot Amazon Tap \nAmazon Echo \nThe first of its kind, Amazon Echo is a 9-inch speaker that at first glance resembles a tube of Pringles. However, this unit is far more than just a speaker that can play all your favorite tunes from Pandora, Spotify, Prime Music, and more. (Tell it to \"Play the [Android Central Podcast,\" too!) It can easily become the smart controller for your entire home, connecting to smart lights (like Philips Hue ), Nest thermostats, Samsung SmartThings , and much more.\nIt's basically a smartphone search appliance without the screen. It can answer questions, read audiobooks, check traffic and weather updates, and essentially act as your voice-activated butler (aside from actually bringing you a snack, though you can use it to order pizza from Domino's…).\nIn a somewhat creepy display of semi-AI, the Echo is always connected to Amazon's Alexa network, which is in the cloud and always getting smarter. The more you use it, the more it learns your preferences, speech patterns, and vocabulary, to better deliver on what you're asking for. It's always learning .\nCheck out our review for more!\nIs it for me? You'll want the Echo if you want the total package. If you want a whole-home control center coupled with a decent speaker, then the Echo is your best choice. It's an especially prudent choice if you already have your home rigged with smart devices. This one is designed to truly integrate with your home and therefore become a relatively permanent fixture. It comes in white and black.\nSee at Amazon \n\n\nAmazon Echo Dot \nThe Dot is essentially the Echo's \"Mini-Me.\" It has a smaller, quieter speaker and, in size, is more akin to a hockey puck. It does everything the Echo does, but also has a 3.5mm output jack and Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to connect it to your current sound system. Truly, it's as though someone just decapitated the Echo and then scrunched up the full-size speaker and jammed it up into the neck, and boom, the Dot.\nConnect to and control all of your smart home devices, as well as your existing audio set-up, making the Dot perhaps the most desirable of the Echo family, especially since it's only $50 (and right now, if you buy a 6-pack, you'll only pay for 5!) .\nCheck out our review for more!\nIs it for me? It is if you have an existing audio setup and several smart devices around your home that you'd like to control with just your voice. Don't go looking for real sound quality from the Dot, though it will do in a pinch if nothing else is available. Like the Echo, the Dot is constantly learning and adapting to your voice and your preferences. Comes in white and black.\nSee at Amazon \n\nAmazon Tap \nThe Tap is the next in line and brings most of the same features that the Echo has, with the added benefit of portability. With up to nine hours of playback, the Tap is rechargeable and comes with a handy wireless charging cradle.\nSince it is battery-powered, the Tap isn't always listening, so — as the name would suggest — you have to tap it to activate Alexa, which only works over Wi-Fi. It's kind of a pain in the keister.\nLike the Echo and Dot, the Tap can control your smart home devices, but you'll have to get up and tap it to do so (at that point, you might as well pull out your phone). It can also act as you futuristic assistant, adding items to your calendar and helping with searches. It connects to your phone and other smart devices, like tablets, via Bluetooth, but just for playback.\nThe Tap is the only somewhat customizable Echo option, with the Tap Sling cover available in six colors.\nIs it for me? It is if you want a portable speaker that also lets you stream music from many of your favorite services. The Tap can still do all of the assistant-related things that the Echo and Dot do; you just have to get off your duff and tap it to get it to work. If you just want a Bluetooth speaker that doubles as a personal assistant (by using the Alexa app ), then the Tap is your best choice. Only available in black.\nSee at Amazon \n\n\nHow do you choose? If you want the total package — decent speaker, whole-home control, and a personal assistant, all controlled by your voice — then go with the Echo .\nIf you want the exact same thing, but smaller, since you already have a sweet home-audio setup, then go with the Dot . It's definitely the best value.\nIf you want a portable Bluetooth speaker that can also act as a personal assistant, and you don't mind getting up to tap it when you want to control your smart home devices, then the Tap is your bag, baby.\nAmazon Echo Read our updated review Get the latest news Join the discussion Download the Echo app Amazon \n",

      "text": "  4:14 PM \n(Getty Images) \nAmazon.com Inc is reportedly in talks to acquire Dubai-based online retailer Souq.com for about $1 billion, it was reported on Thursday. \nBloomberg reported that the deal will give the US-based e-commerce giant a footprint in the high-growth Middle East market, citing people familiar with the matter. \nIt said Amazon is considering a bid for all of the site, which had initially planned to sell a stake of at least 30 percent. \nNo final agreements have been reached and negotiations could still falter, Bloomberg added. \nA spokesman for Souq.com declined to comment while a representative for Amazon didn’t respond, Bloomberg reported. \nIn September, it was reported that Souq.com, the largest online retailer in the Middle East, was reportedly planning to sell a stake of 30 percent and had appointed advisers at Goldman Sachs Group to find buyers for the stake. \nIn February, Souq.com announced it had completed a funding round of more than AED1 billion ($275 million), the largest financing of an e-commerce business in the region. \nEstablished in 2005, Souq.com sells more than 400,000 products online to customers in the UAE, Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.",

      "text": "Amazon has long had a problem with fake reviews, but an even bigger problem might be reviews of products that were received either for free or at a large discount with the promise that a review would follow. Now, Amazon is finally cutting them out.\nEven if a positive review wasn't actually a condition of a complimentary product, the numbers suggest that reviews from customers who received these special deals were often significantly higher than the product's average. That bias, whether intended or not, is harmful to the entire review system, and following on Amazon's pledge to do something about it, the company has culled over 500,000 of these sketchy reviews from tens of thousands of its products. \nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nTarget’s Black Friday 2016 sale is now live All the best deals you’ll find in Walmart’s big Black Friday 2016 sale, which is now live Walmart is having trouble delivering all those NES Classic Editions ",

      "title": "Amazon has removed hundreds of thousand of incentivized reviews since it banned the practice",
      "text": "on Nov 24, 2016, 1:00 PM TechSpot \nBack in early October, it was reported that Amazon was banning incentivized reviews. It’s been nearly two months since the company brought in the new rule, and in that time it has deleted hundreds of thousands of these often untrustworthy opinions. \nBefore Amazon introduced the ban, research carried out by ReviewMeta showed that incentivized reviews are extremely biased in favor of the products, and that many people post positive comments in the hope of receiving more free or discounted goods in the future. \nReviewMeta has been monitoring Amazon’s progress, analyzing 65 million reviews across 32,060 products in all categories. It found that 71 percent of the 500,000+ reviews deleted by the retail giant were incentivized. \nNot every incentivized review is being caught by Amazon; some still appear on the site. To get an idea of how many remain, ReviewMeta analyzed over 10 million reviews from across the past two weeks. It found that only 1.5 percent of these were incentivized. \nIt seems the claim that these reviews artificially inflate ratings is true. Before the ban, the average rating for all reviews across the entire site was 4.73 out of 5, by November 1 it had fallen to 4.65. \nYou can use ReviewMeta’s tracking tool to see a report card for items sold on Amazon by simply copying and pasting its URL. This Coffee scrub , for example, has had 9010 reviews deleted. \nTommy Noonan, ReviewMeta’s CTO, told me that Amazon has done a good job of tackling the problem of incentivized reviews but there are still other ways of skewing ratings. One example is allowing people to leave a review without purchasing the product, as was the case when trolls attacked Megyn Kelly's new book. \n\"It does seem that what Amazon has done is sufficient to address their problem of incentivized reviews. Not only have they essentially stopped the influx of incentivized reviews, but they seem to be deleting the majority of them. That said, I still believe Amazon's review platform is far from perfect, and there are plenty of other ways for sellers to acquire dishonest reviews even though incentivized reviews are out of the equation,\" he wrote in an emailed statement.

If you'd like to learn more... X What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nPresident-elect Donald Trump is attempting to make Christmas “great again” by selling a “Red Cap Collectible Ornament” featuring his campaign slogan on it. \nThe painted brass bauble comes in the shape of the Trump campaign’s iconic red baseball caps and is on sale through Trump’s website for $149 . \n“Get in the Christmas spirit with your very own Make America Great Again Red Cap Collectible Ornament,” reads the product description on Trump’s website. “Made of brass and finished in 24 karat gold, this ornament is sure to make any tree stand out.” \nAccording to the Associated Press, Trump’s campaign announced the knickknack’s availability Wednesday in an email to supporters that said Trump “makes a point of proudly saying ‘Merry Christmas’ every chance he gets.” \nApparently, Trump’s ornament, or at least one very similar to it, was being sold on Amazon.com only the ornament is finished in 14 karat gold. \nThough, it’s unclear if the product posting is legitimate, (there’s no seller or warranty information listed) the ornament is getting atrocious reviews from supposed customers. \n“The angel on top of my tree just hired a lawyer,” reads one review. \n“Despite ordering a more reasonable ornament, this one arrived. It. Is. Yuge. It’s absolutely yuge. It’s the biggest ornament. Yuge,” Simon Webb wrote. “I hung it on my tree, but it is so yuge that it has totally unbalanced my whole tree. No matter where I hang it, the tree leans w y over to the far right.” \n“It called Mary a nasty woman, told Joseph to go back where he came from, built a wall around the manger, and then when you press it it sings “I’m Dreaming Of A Totally White Christmas,” reads another review. \nAccording to the posting, the product is “currently unavailable.” Amazon has yet to respond to Global News’ request for a comment regarding the Trump ornament. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

      "text": "Amazon Offering $1000 Deal on Oculus Rift, VR-Ready PC, EVE: Valkyrie & $100 Oculus Store Credit Grab a VR bargain this festive season.   \nFor those that have been eyeing up a new   headset current deals are offering some of the best prices yet. HTC Vive has its Black Friday deals , knocking $100 USD/£100 GBP off the head-mounted display (HMD) and the Vive Ready HP Computer Bundle . If you’re after the Oculus Rift on the other hand Amazon currently has a sub $1000 bundle with an additional bonus offer for a very limited time. \nAt the moment the online retailer is offering a CYBERPOWERPC Gamer Xtreme VR GXiVR8020A Gaming Desktop, which pack an Intel i5-6402P Quad Core 2.8GHz processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, and a AMD RX 480 4GB, along with the Oculus Rift for $999. On top of that customers will also get $100 of Oculus Store credit to fill their content libraries and a copy of CCP Games’ multiplayer shooter EVE: Valkyrie – one of the most expensive titles on the store – for free. \nThere is a catch of course, at time of writing the offer is only available for 11 more hours, so there’s no time to save up the cash. But if you’ve been holding off for a good deal this might be worth a look as the deal gives a combined saving of $300. \nGot more money to spend, you might want to take a look at Oculus Touch, the motion controllers set to launch next month. These come in at $199.99, and also come supplied with free software including The Unspoken and VR Sports Challenge . But there will be other free titles available including Medium and Dead and Buried . \nBuying the Touch and the bundle will set you back just under $1200, which is a little cheaper than rival HTC Vive and a compatible PC. \nIt seems as if both manufacturers are gearing up for some VR price wars this Christmas, and that can only be a good thing for growing the industry, attracting more people to VR which ever system they buy. \nFor all the latest VR news from around the world, keep reading VRFocus .

      "text": "AMZN Stock: Amazon Cyber Monday Crushes Thanksgiving Sales By Gaurav S. Iyer, IFC   Photo: Brian Ach / Stringer / GettyImages E-Commerce Spending Can Buoy AMZN Stock \nWith Thanksgiving just around the corner, analysts are eagerly awaiting holiday sales numbers from retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The good news is that recent history shows that “Amazon Cyber Monday” could be the biggest winner of all. \nWhile revenue from “Amazon Black Friday” sales usually double that of any normal day, it still falls short of e-commerce activity on Amazon Cyber Monday. Just look at the numbers from 2015 and where the trend is headed. (Source: “ The Black Friday shopping frenzy is moving further online ,” Business Insider , November 23, 2016.) \nInstead of the regular $702.0-million-worth of goods being sold, e-commerce retailers shipped out $2.28-billion-worth of goods on the last Cyber Monday. As the 800-pound gorilla of e-commerce, there’s a fair chance that AMZN stock gobbled up the lion’s share of these gains. \nHere’s what the long-term picture looks like: \n(Source: Ibid.) \nThere are two main takeaways here. One is that the growth in Black Friday sales is decelerating, and the other concerns the more obvious trade-off between physical and online retailing. \nThe fall of America’s biggest shopping day has been chronicled pretty extensively by Business Insider. \nFor instance, the publication showed that between 2012 and 2015, there were 42 million fewer people walking through brick-and-mortar stores on the shopping holiday. That foot traffic is expected to decline another 3.5% during this year’s Black Friday. (Source: “ Black Friday is dying a slow death ,” Business Insider , November 20, 2016.) \nHowever, analysts don’t think that shoppers are just pulling back on their materialism. They believe that consumers are instead saving that cash for better deals on the following Monday, which leads into the second interesting observation. \nShoppers are increasingly likely to spend their money online, as is obvious from the chart shown above. This trend may hurt traditional retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) , Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) , and Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) , but Amazon Cyber Monday sales are up considerably. \n“Overall spending during the holiday period is expected to increase 3.6% over last year to $655.8 billion,” read the Business Insider story. “Online sales are forecast to grow between 7% and 10% over last year to as much as $117 billion.” (Source: Ibid.)",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. The Grand Tour: Your Guide to Understanding the Brits on Amazon’s Hottest Show \nAmazon’s new show, The Grand Tour has landed—no stormed—into our lives. The first episode, which aired Nov. 17, was Amazon’s most watched premiere. \nBut some of the show’s millions of viewers out there might have been confused at times, even as they laughed at the one-liners and sat in suspense as the track battle between the Porsche 918, McLaren P1, and Ferrari LaFerrari played out. \nThe Grand Tour is a big budget reprisal of the BBC’s Top Gear with its longtime co-presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. \nClarkson, Hammond, and May are all, of course, from the UK. Which means they speak English. Not “American.” And that can be confusing to our unsophisticated ears. The presenters even touched on this, ever so briefly in the first episode. \nWe’ve put together a guide of sorts that provides a translation on car parts and terms, as well as a few other sayings that pop up in the episodes. Fortune will update it on occasion as necessary. You never know when a new car term or turn-of-phrase will end up in The Grand Tour . There are 11 episodes left. We’re here all season. The guide : \nA bonnet is a hood, not the headgear worn by babies and 17th century ladies. \nA boot is a trunk, not what cowboys wear. It’s also not a device slapped onto a vehicle’s tire by city law enforcement for failure to pay fines, that’s a clamp. \nA cubby box is a glovebox, not the space where kindergarteners place their backpacks and lunches. \nA dynamo is a generator, not an energetic person or professional sports star. \nA hood is a convertible top, not the hood of a car. That’s a bonnet. \nLorry is a semi truck, not a woman’s name. \nPetrol is fuel, not a—wait you should really know what petrol is even if you’ve never been out of the United States. Read a book. \nSaloon is a two- or four-door sedan, not a bar where boot-wearing cowboys and gamblers hang out. This is not Tombstone in the 1880s. \nSide curtains are removable windows, not a piece of cloth used to shield light and all those prying eyes trying to see inside your VW microbus. We all know what you’re smoking. \nA silencer is a muffler, not the firearm accessory used in movies. \nA torch is a flashlight, not a piece of wood wrapped in cloth that’s been soaked in tallow and lit on fire to provide light. Nobody does that anymore, except maybe on Survivor . \nA wing is a fender, not the spicy sauce-laden bar food made of chicken, but called buffalo. \nEpisode 2 of The Grand Tour is available on Amazon Video on November 25.",

      "title": "Amazon has dumped 'incentivized' reviews, but product ratings aren't changing much - Digital Trends",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nAmazon’s decision to clean out product reviews written by people who got stuff free in exchange for writing those reviews sounds like a good move to help consumers know what real buyers think. Amazon has been busy deleting incentivized review for a couple of months now. It turns out, however, according to a recent study by ReviewMeta , that product rating changes aren’t changing much, if at all, as reported by Tech Crunch . \nIncentivized reviews involved vendors either giving away or heavily discounting products in return for a promise to write an “unbiased review.” Incentivized reviews may have created more of a perception problem than actual rating rigging, but earlier ReviewMeta research did show a difference in the reviews that resulted. The study found that incentivized reviews rated products on average 4.74 stars (out of five) compared to 4.36-star average ratings for reviews that were not incentivized. \nMore: Amazon has finally banned those pesky ‘incentivized’ reviews Would a 4.74-star rating differ all that much from a 4.36-star review in your decision to buy a product? Maybe or maybe not, but the greater issue was that all those reviews, and some products, especially new ones, often had a high proportion of identified incentivized reviews. And so the appearance in those cases was that the reviews and ratings were essentially bought and paid for and therefore couldn’t be trusted. This in turn gave the overall impression that Amazon’s ratings themselves weren’t maybe all that trustworthy. \nSo Amazon cracked down. ReviewMeta analyzed roughly 65 million reviews of a bit more than 32,000 product categories. The researchers found that more than 500,000 reviews were deleted in the crackdown, of which 71 percent were incentivized. The average star rating for the deleted reviews was 4.75, higher than average. Just before the ban and mass deletion program began in early October the average daily product review was 4.73 stars, and on November 1, the overall average daily review dropped to 4.65 stars, \nYou’d think then that the product ratings would have changed and ended up significantly lower because of the dumped ‘seems-like-paid’ reviews and lower review star averages. But that didn’t happen. Why not? \nIt turns out Amazon wasn’t counting incentivized reviews in calculating overall product ratings, and instead utilized reviews and ratings from “Verified Purchasers” (except with brand new product where there weren’t yet many reviews that were not incentivized). So the overall ratings didn’t change much if at all. Shoppers could pretty much depend on the overall star ratings coming from people who actually paid for the products they reviewed. \nBut that still didn’t take care of the perception problem. Sweeping out the incentivized reviews now means that shoppers won’t see them at all, and won’t question either the product rating or ratings and reviews overall. \nThe sweep, which is ongoing, has also had the effect of putting a halt to companies that started incentivized review businesses. According to Tommy Noonan, ReviewMeta CTO, “It’s obviously not 100 percent perfect. It seems [Amazon has] removed a majority of the incentivized reviews and [has] pretty much put an end to more being created. They effectively killed this industry,”",

      "text": "Considering how deeply Amazon discounts products on a normal day, it was pretty obvious that the online retailer’s Black Friday deals week discounts were going to be among the best in the business. And they were. But now the “deals week” sales have led up to today, which marks the launch of Amazon’s official Black Friday sale.

      "text": "Amazon’s massive Black Friday 2016 sale is live, and these are the best deals so far Maren Estrada Pin it Share Considering how deeply Amazon discounts products on a normal day, it was pretty obvious that the online retailer’s Black Friday deals week discounts were going to be among the best in the business. And they were. But now the “deals week” sales have led up to today, which marks the launch of Amazon’s official Black Friday sale. The sale runs from today, Thanksgiving Day, through the end of the day on Sunday. At that point, the Black Friday sale becomes a Cyber Monday sale. You’re going to find insanely good Black Friday 2016 deals everywhere you look on the Amazon site right now, but that’s enough to overwhelm many shoppers. Don’t worry though, because we’ve dug through thousands of deals and hand-picked a batch of Black Friday bargains that are even more appealing than Amazon’s average sale. You can browse the full sale by visiting Amazon’s Black Friday 2016 deals page , but you’ll find some of the retailer’s best bargains right here.

      "text": "News \nOne of many notable sales this Black Friday is on Amazon's line of Fire TV devices. Although not compatible with Google services like YouTube or Google Play Movies, the devices themselves are still excellent for the most part. \nAmazon's Chromecast competitor, the Fire TV Stick, is already a good deal at the regular $39.99. As opposed to the Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra, everything runs locally on the device itself - much like an Android TV. Now the device is just $29.99. \nThe full-blown Fire TV is also $15 off, at just $74.99. The Fire TV is a major step up from the Fire TV Stick, with 4K video playback, 8GB of internal storage, and support for the full library of gamepad-compatible games on the Amazon App Store. There's also a 'Gaming Edition' for $114 ($15 off) with a Fire TV, game controller, two games, and a 32 GB microSD card. \nFinally, the Fire TV + HD Antenna Bundle is only $84.99 ($36 off). The bundle has a Fire TV, an AmazonBasics Ultra Thin Indoor HDTV Antenna, and an AmazonBasics HDMI cable. You can get all the details at the links below. Source:",

Analysts said losses in the quarter spiked due to preparations for festive sales that took place in October. \n\"By far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers,\" said Brian T Olsavsky, chief financial officer at Amazon, during a call with analysts last month. \nHowever, Amazon's huge investments didn't win it favour over customers during the festive season, with rival Flipkart selling more goods of higher average value. \nWhile both companies claim leadership, the local company continues to have a bigger user base, which hit 100 million earlier this year, and has a higher proportion of sales of fashion, that earns it better margins than electronic goods. \nHowever, in the last one year local rivals Flipkart and Snapdeal cut costs, shelved resources and focused on improving efficiency and eyeing profits. At the same time, they have been matching discounts and incentives of Amazon to retain their existing customers and grow their businesses. \nFor fiscal 2014-15, Indian e-commerce firms reported losses of over Rs 5,200 crore (Rs 52 billion), with Flipkart leading the pack with Rs 2000 crore (Rs 20 billion) loss as it expanded rapidly, hiring expensive resources from Silicon Valley, and making investments that it had to pull back eventually. Financial details for 2015-16 are not available yet. Alnoor Peermohamed",

      "text": "Share \nAmazon’s efforts to deliver its own packages this holiday season may face some hiccups now that pilots who were contracted to deliver for Amazon are picketing. \nAccording to a report by The Wall Street Journal , due to a long-running labor dispute, pilots of the Air Transport Services Group and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings are striking. Amazon hired them to deliver packages via air on 40 dedicated jets by the end of next year. Sixteen of the jets are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016. The new contracts with Amazon are putting an increased demand on pilots, which is making them angry as they try to reach new labor deals, reported WSJ . The paper pointed to a complaint filed in federal court earlier this week in which ABX Air, a unit of Air Transport Services Group, said holiday shopping and deliveries are being hurt by the dispute and could get worse. It filed a request for a restraining order. \nIn a statement to WSJ , Amazon said it had deals with different carriers and is “confident in [its] ability to serve customers.” ABX went on to say in the legal filing that the action on the part of pilots resulted in 26 flights being canceled and stranded 1.25 million pounds of cargo for another big customer DHL. If more flights have to be canceled, WSJ said, ABX said it “will result in millions of dollars of freight and packages not timely being delivered to retailers and homes.” \nIn addition to getting into delivering its own packages this holiday season , Amazon has been preparing for the holiday shopping rush since the summer. In August, Amazon said it was in the process of adding 18 warehouse facilities in preparation for the holiday crush. That triples up the warehouses slotted for the same quarter last year — when Amazon built only six.",

      "text": "Jeramey Lende/123RF\nAmazon’s decision to clean out product reviews written by people who got stuff free in exchange for writing those reviews sounds like a good move to help consumers know what real buyers think. Amazon has been busy deleting incentivized review for a couple of months now. It turns out, however, according to a recent study by ReviewMeta , that product rating changes aren’t changing much, if at all, as reported by Tech Crunch .\nIncentivized reviews involved vendors either giving away or heavily discounting products in return for a promise to write an “unbiased review.” Incentivized reviews may have created more of a perception problem than actual rating rigging, but earlier ReviewMeta research did show a difference in the reviews that resulted. The study found that incentivized reviews rated products on average 4.74 stars (out of five) compared to 4.36-star average ratings for reviews that were not incentivized.\nMore: Amazon has finally banned those pesky ‘incentivized’ reviews\nWould a 4.74-star rating differ all that much from a 4.36-star review in your decision to buy a product? Maybe or maybe not, but the greater issue was that all those reviews, and some products, especially new ones, often had a high proportion of identified incentivized reviews. And so the appearance in those cases was that the reviews and ratings were essentially bought and paid for and therefore couldn’t be trusted. This in turn gave the overall impression that Amazon’s ratings themselves weren’t maybe all that trustworthy.\nSo Amazon cracked down. ReviewMeta analyzed roughly 65 million reviews of a bit more than 32,000 product categories. The researchers found that more than 500,000 reviews were deleted in the crackdown, of which 71 percent were incentivized. The average star rating for the deleted reviews was 4.75, higher than average. Just before the ban and mass deletion program began in early October the average daily product review was 4.73 stars, and on November 1, the overall average daily review dropped to 4.65 stars,\nYou’d think then that the product ratings would have changed and ended up significantly lower because of the dumped ‘seems-like-paid’ reviews and lower review star averages. But that didn’t happen. Why not?\nIt turns out Amazon wasn’t counting incentivized reviews in calculating overall product ratings, and instead utilized reviews and ratings from “Verified Purchasers” (except with brand new product where there weren’t yet many reviews that were not incentivized). So the overall ratings didn’t change much if at all. Shoppers could pretty much depend on the overall star ratings coming from people who actually paid for the products they reviewed.\nBut that still didn’t take care of the perception problem. Sweeping out the incentivized reviews now means that shoppers won’t see them at all, and won’t question either the product rating or ratings and reviews overall.\nThe sweep, which is ongoing, has also had the effect of putting a halt to companies that started incentivized review businesses. According to Tommy Noonan, ReviewMeta CTO, “It’s obviously not 100 percent perfect. It seems [Amazon has] removed a majority of the incentivized reviews and [has] pretty much put an end to more being created. They effectively killed this industry,”\nHuami’s Amazfit PACE fitness tracker will launch in the U.S. at $129 Amazon has finally banned those pesky ‘incentivized’ reviews Withings’ Steel HR brings smartwatch brains to a gorgeous analog watch",

Over on Amazon, you can score an Xperia X for $299, saving a total of $100. That price feels about right for this phone (finally). So if you have been considering getting this little guy, now is a good time to pick one up. \nWith a Snapdragon 650, a 1080p display, 3GB of RAM, and a 2620mAh battery, the Xperia X is a pretty decent phone for $299. That MSRP goes any higher and it's just overpriced. So this deal could come across in two different ways, depending on your perspective. \nRegardless of how you look at it, this is still the best price we have seen yet on this phone. Take note that sale is only good on the black version — the other three colors are $338-$349 in price for now. Source:",
