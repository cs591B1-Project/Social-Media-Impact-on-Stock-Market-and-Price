      "title": "WTO calls US state's Boeing subsidies illegal in win for EU",
      "text": "More Subsidies given by the US state of Washington to Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) are illegal, the World Trade Organization said Monday, in a victory for rival aircraft maker Airbus and the European Union. The ruling from a WTO panel is the latest blow in a drawn out trans-Atlantic battle between the aviation industry's two titans, which has seen both Airbus and Boeing score points along the way. In Monday's decision, the WTO said that subsidies set up by Washington state to support production of Boeing's 777X commercial jet, were \"prohibited\" as they encouraged the use of domestic materials, fuelling unfair trade distortions. The panel called for the subsidies to be withdrawn within 90 days. Airbus was represented by the European Union in the case while the US federal government fought for Boeing and Washington state because companies and regional authorities are not represented at the Geneva-based WTO. Boeing said it expects the US to appeal the decision. According to Airbus's own estimates, Washington state has given Boeing tax breaks worth $8.7 billion (8.2 billion euros) in a scheme scheduled to run through 2040. Airbus further claims it has already lost $50 billion in sales as a result of the subsidy regime that gives its arch-rival unfair advantages. \"The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State's taxpayers,\" Airbus president Fabrice Bregier said in a statement. \"This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the US Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behaviour,\" he added. The WTO, which aims to create a level playing field in global trade, does not have the ability to force compliance with its rulings, but can approve retaliatory measures which in theory can pressure trade manipulators to fall into line. Calling Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU,\" the bloc's trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she expected the United States \"to respect the rules, uphold fair competition and withdraw these subsidies without any delay.\" - Tit-for-tat - The EU has meanwhile also been reprimanded by the WTO during the tit-for-tat conflict between Airbus and Boeing. In September, a WTO panel found that Brussels had not respected a 2011 ruling ordering it to take steps to withdraw several support and subsidy programmes for Airbus. The WTO did not put a value on those programmes but Boeing said they amounted to $22 billion worth of illegal support for Airbus development and sales, mostly in subsidised loans. The EU has appealed that decision, insisting that the subsidies in question had in fact been discontinued. Meanwhile, a separate 2012 WTO ruling on benefits Boeing received from federal, state and local governments in the US remains a source of dispute, with a report on the issue due out in the coming months.

      "text": "By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATEN\nGENEVA (AP) — A World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months.\nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition.\nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures.\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n___\nCasert reported from Brussels.\n ",

      "text": "  WTO calls US state's Boeing subsidies illegal in win for EU   \nWashington State's subsidies for the Boeing 777X fuelled unfair trade distortions, according to the WTO \nSubsidies given by the US state of Washington to Boeing are illegal, the World Trade Organization said Monday, in a victory for rival aircraft maker Airbus and the European Union. \nThe ruling from a WTO panel is the latest blow in a drawn out trans-Atlantic battle between the aviation industry's two titans, which has seen both Airbus and Boeing score points along the way. \nIn Monday's decision, the WTO said that subsidies set up by Washington state to support production of Boeing's 777X commercial jet, were \"prohibited\" as they encouraged the use of domestic materials, fuelling unfair trade distortions. \nThe panel called for the subsidies to be withdrawn within 90 days. \nAirbus was represented by the European Union in the case while the US federal government fought for Boeing and Washington state because companies and regional authorities are not represented at the Geneva-based WTO. \nBoeing said it expects the US to appeal the decision. \nAccording to Airbus's own estimates, Washington state has given Boeing tax breaks worth $8.7 billion (8.2 billion euros) in a scheme scheduled to run through 2040. \nAirbus further claims it has already lost $50 billion in sales as a result of the subsidy regime that gives its arch-rival unfair advantages. \n\"The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State's taxpayers,\" Airbus president Fabrice Bregier said in a statement. \n\"This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the US Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behaviour,\" he added. \nThe WTO, which aims to create a level playing field in global trade, does not have the ability to force compliance with its rulings, but can approve retaliatory measures which in theory can pressure trade manipulators to fall into line. \nCalling Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU,\" the bloc's trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she expected the United States \"to respect the rules, uphold fair competition and withdraw these subsidies without any delay.\" \n- Tit-for-tat - \nThe EU has meanwhile also been reprimanded by the WTO during the tit-for-tat conflict between Airbus and Boeing. \nIn September, a WTO panel found that Brussels had not respected a 2011 ruling ordering it to take steps to withdraw several support and subsidy programmes for Airbus. \nThe WTO did not put a value on those programmes but Boeing said they amounted to $22 billion worth of illegal support for Airbus development and sales, mostly in subsidised loans. \nThe EU has appealed that decision, insisting that the subsidies in question had in fact been discontinued. \nMeanwhile, a separate 2012 WTO ruling on benefits Boeing received from federal, state and local governments in the US remains a source of dispute, with a report on the issue due out in the coming months.

      "text": "Tweet Share Ray Conner (R), the CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, shows a memorandum of agreement document with Hideaki Omiya, Chairman of the Board of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Japan Aircraft Development Corporation Chairman, next to models of Boeing's 777X airplane, at their joint news conference in Tokyo June 12, 2014. REUTERS/Issei Kato More By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing (BA.N) develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. The WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. It rejected a complaint by the European Union against six further tax measures. It is the third swathe of public support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) criticised by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade dispute dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. The ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders potential sanctions against the EU over earlier rulings against Airbus. The WTO did not give a value for the banned aid, but the European Union estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion package of tax measures in Washington, where most of Boeing's factories are based. Airbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. Boeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. Reuters reported last week that the WTO was expected within days to find at least one strand of banned support for Boeing. On paper, the latest ruling is a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled a previous generation of tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly than \"prohibited\" aid. Under WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are prohibited and must be withdrawn \"without delay\". The two sides are certain to clash over whether that means actual repayment. European officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more rigidly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. In 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. Seizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies once deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be paid back to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. They also zeroed in on \"programme accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in future support for the 777X even before money had been received. Under the same system, Boeing would now have to adjust its accounts to reflect risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. Boeing officials and lawyers played down the prospect of having to repay money, however. They said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidised loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year.

      "text": "WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet Reuters ADVERTISEMENT \nBy Tim Hepher and Tom Miles \nGENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing <BA.N> develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. \nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. \nIt rejected a complaint by the European Union against six further tax measures. \nIt is the third swathe of public support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus <AIR.PA> criticized by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade dispute dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. \nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders potential sanctions against the EU over earlier rulings against Airbus. \nThe WTO did not give a value for the banned aid, but the European Union estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion package of tax measures in Washington, where most of Boeing's factories are based. \nAirbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. \nBoeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. \nReuters reported last week that the WTO was expected within days to find at least one strand of banned support for Boeing. \nOn paper, the latest ruling is a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled a previous generation of tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly than \"prohibited\" aid. \nUnder WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are prohibited and must be withdrawn \"without delay\". The two sides are certain to clash over whether that means actual repayment. \nEuropean officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more rigidly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. \nIn 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. \nSeizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies once deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be paid back to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. \nThey also zeroed in on \"program accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in future support for the 777X even before money had been received. \nUnder the same system, Boeing would now have to adjust its accounts to reflect risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. \nBoeing officials and lawyers played down the prospect of having to repay money, however. \nThey said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidized loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year. \n(Reporting by Tim Hepher and Tom Miles; Editing by Mark Potter)",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 10:37 AM Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATEN Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story GENEVA \nA World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.

      "text": "GENEVA, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday that a tax break from Washington state to help U.S. planemaker Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy.\nThe WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in the state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family.\nIt rejected a complaint by the European Union against six further tax measures.\nIt is the third swathe of public support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus criticised by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade dispute dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid.\nThe ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders potential sanctions against the EU over earlier WTO rulings against Airbus.

Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US Posted: By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - A World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

( BA ) determining a key tax benefit granted for production of its newest long-haul jetliner contravenes international trade rules. \nThe tax was a central part of a case the European Union in December 2014 filed with the WTO against the U.S. as part of a wider protracted dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers. \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström. \n-Write to Robart wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-28-161039ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - A World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \nCasert reported from Brussels.

More >> By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - A World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "text": "GENEVA Boeing Co ( BA.N ) claimed the upper hand on Monday after the World Trade Organization rejected all but one complaints by the European Union against tax breaks for its 777X jetliner, and predicted the WTO's ruling that the remaining measure was a \"prohibited subsidy\" would be reversed on appeal.\n\"In total, the EU claimed that Boeing had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. This claim was rejected by the WTO, which found future incentives totalling no more than $50 million a year to be impermissible,\" Boeing said in a statement.\n\"The WTO found that to date Boeing has received no benefit from the 777X (tax) rate incentive, and will not until 2020, because the first airplane will not be delivered until then.\"\nBoth sides have the right to appeal the ruling.\n\"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel, said in the statement.\nBoeing's external legal adviser, Robert Novick, co-managing partner of law firm WilmerHale, said the WTO appellate body frequently reverses prohibited subsidy findings.\n(Reporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Bate Felix)",

      "text": "View Photo \nWashington State's subsidies for the Boeing 777X fuelled unfair trade distortions, according to the WTO \nBoeing expects the US to appeal a World Trade Organization decision Monday that struck down a plane-building subsidy offered by Washington state, company representatives said. \nThe WTO decision was a win for the European Union on behalf of Airbus, which had argued that a Washington state tax benefit to Boeing to build the 777x jetliner was an unfair subsidy which violates global trade rules. \n\"I fully expect this case will be appealed,\" said Bob Novick, an outside counsel representing Boeing, adding that a final resolution of the case might not come until early 2019. \nNovick criticized the rationale behind the decision to strike down the Washington state Business and Occupancy (B&O) tax rate as wrongly concluding that the law favored the domestic manufacturing of goods because Boeing had not imported the wing for the 777x as it had for the 787 plane. \nThe WTO \"jumped to the conclusion that the somehow the law favored domestic over imported,\" he told reporters in a conference call. \nThe US Trade Representative has not yet commented on the case, but it commonly appeals negative rulings by the WTO. \nBoeing said the WTO rejected EU claims that the company had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. Boeing estimates the total benefit of the disputed Washington state provision at $50 million a year, or a maximum of $1 billion. \nBoeing has not received any of the benefits yet under the B&O tax break and does not expect to see any until 2020 at the soonest, Boeing officials said. \n\"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel.  ",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US Posted: By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - A World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "text": "View Comments Print By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATEN   \nGENEVA (AP) - A World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing’s EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday’s decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to “prohibited” subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the “prohibited subsidy” involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.” \n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would “almost certainly be condemned as illegal.” Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US Posted: By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - A World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "title": "Boeing expects US appeal of WTO pro-EU subsidy ruling",
      "text": "More Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) expects the US to appeal a World Trade Organization decision Monday that struck down a plane-building subsidy offered by Washington state, company representatives said. The WTO decision was a win for the European Union on behalf of Airbus, which had argued that a Washington state tax benefit to Boeing to build the 777x jetliner was an unfair subsidy which violates global trade rules. \"I fully expect this case will be appealed,\" said Bob Novick, an outside counsel representing Boeing, adding that a final resolution of the case might not come until early 2019. Novick criticized the rationale behind the decision to strike down the Washington state Business and Occupancy (B&O) tax rate as wrongly concluding that the law favored the domestic manufacturing of goods because Boeing had not imported the wing for the 777x as it had for the 787 plane. The WTO \"jumped to the conclusion that the somehow the law favored domestic over imported,\" he told reporters in a conference call. The US Trade Representative has not yet commented on the case, but it commonly appeals negative rulings by the WTO. Boeing said the WTO rejected EU claims that the company had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. Boeing estimates the total benefit of the disputed Washington state provision at $50 million a year, or a maximum of $1 billion. Boeing has not received any of the benefits yet under the B&O tax break and does not expect to see any until 2020 at the soonest, Boeing officials said. \"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel. Reblog",

      "text": "WTO Rules Against Boeing in U.S.-EU Trade Battle  25:  \nThe World Trade Organization on Monday struck a blow against Boeing Co., determining a key tax benefit granted for production of its newest long-haul jetliner contravenes international trade rules. \nThe tax was a central part of a case the European Union in December 2014 filed with the WTO against the U.S. as part of a wider protracted dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers. \nThe WTO said the U.S. should withdraw the subsidy within 90 days, though the U.S. can appeal the ruling. \nA Boeing official said the company expects an appeal will lead to the WTO's judgment being overturned. \nThe wider dispute dates back more than a decade over government handouts provided to Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE. The two sides settled a previous disagreement in 1992, but the U.S. walked away from that deal in 2004, arguing Airbus had an unfair advantage. \nSince then, the U.S. and EU have successfully challenged subsidies to the other's large commercial airplane maker. The case has seen repeated appeals. \nAt stake are potentially billions of dollars in tariffs the U.S. and EU could impose on each other unless the WTO's subsidy concerns are addressed. Those tariffs could be placed on goods and services unrelated to aircraft or aircraft parts. The winning side isn't obliged to impose tariffs, and the penalty stage could be delayed again if the EU and U.S. make changes to the way the benefits are provided. \nEach side has accused the other of providing billions of dollars in illegal government assistance, and the two have sparred repeatedly over the value of state aid. The EU said the latest prohibited subsidy that has to be withdrawn immediately amounts to $5.7 billion. The U.S. said the value is $50 million. \nThe tax benefit was conferred for production of the 777X widebody plane, an updated model Boeing is developing. The plane, which can seat more than 400 passengers, is due to enter service around the end of the decade. \nThe WTO in September determined the EU had failed to properly remove subsidies granted to Airbus in an earlier case. Next year it is expected to pass similar judgment on the U.S. \nAirbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders renewed his call or Boeing to return to the negotiating table: \"The only way out of the ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the U.S. is to agree on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic.\" \nHe said the financial backing being provided to other plane makers in Canada, Russia and Asia made it critical to establish a \"global framework.\" \nViktoria Dendrinou contributed to this article. \nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com  161125ET  ",

      "text": "In this 2011 file photo, the Boeing Co. logo is shown on the property in El Segundo, Calif. Boeing Co. (Reed Saxon / Associated Press)  48 A.M. Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in U.S. By Raf Casert and Jamey Keaten Associated Press Twitter \nGENEVA – A World Trade Organization panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. \nThe European Union, which backs Boeing’s EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday’s decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to “prohibited” subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the “prohibited subsidy” involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.” \n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would “almost certainly be condemned as illegal.” Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.  48 a.m.",

      "text": "Tweet Share GENEVA, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Boeing Co claimed the upper hand on Monday after the World Trade Organization rejected all but one complaints by the European Union against tax breaks for its 777X jetliner, and predicted the WTO's ruling that the remaining measure was a \"prohibited subsidy\" would be reversed on appeal. \"In total, the EU claimed that Boeing had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. This claim was rejected by the WTO, which found future incentives totalling no more than $50 million a year to be impermissible,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"The WTO found that to date Boeing has received no benefit from the 777X (tax) rate incentive, and will not until 2020, because the first airplane will not be delivered until then.\" Both sides have the right to appeal the ruling. \"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, said in the statement. Boeing's external legal adviser, Robert Novick, co-managing partner of law firm WilmerHale, said the WTO appellate body frequently reverses prohibited subsidy findings.

      "text": "Rendering of the Boeing 777X Source: Boeing Incentive that cuts a Washington state levy must be removed EU calls ruling ‘important victory’ for its aircraft industry Share on Facebook \nBoeing Co. received an illegal tax break from Washington state as part of $8.7 billion in aid to assemble the 777X and manufacture the jetliner’s carbon-fiber wing there, the World Trade Organization said. \nAn incentive cutting a state levy on gross receipts by 40 percent is a prohibited subsidy that must be removed, a three-judge panel found Monday. The tax break gave an unfair advantage to the U.S. planemaker to the detriment of overseas manufacturers, the WTO found. \nThe European Commission said Boeing received an illegal tax break of $5.7 billion, while the U.S. company put the value at $1 billion over 20 years. The decision marks the latest twist in a longstanding clash between the U.S. and European Union over government incentives to ease the heavy costs of developing new jetliners for Chicago-based Boeing and Europe’s Airbus Group SE. \nThe ruling is “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry,” EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in a statement. “We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay.” \nBoeing said the WTO rejected six of the seven incentives challenged by the European Union and said only that a tax break on future 777X revenue would violate global trade agreements. \n“In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies,” J. Michael Luttig, the planemaker’s general counsel, said in a statement. The company expects the 777X tax break to be upheld if appealed, he said. Long Process \nIf the U.S. appeals the decision, as expected, the case would follow the same circuitous legal process as 2011 WTO rulings that barred European aid for the Airbus A380 superjumbo and U.S. perks for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. \nThe Geneva-based trade body found in September that the European Union failed to adequately remedy incentives including launch aid for Airbus’s A380, deemed illegal in 2011, and compounded the issue with below-market loans for the planemaker’s A350. The U.S. would be allowed to pursue retaliatory sanctions if the finding stands. The European Union is appealing the ruling and disputing U.S. claims of $22 billion in damages. \nThe WTO also is expected to determine next year whether the U.S. and Boeing have adequately addressed $5.3 billion in illegal benefits that flowed to the planemaker from NASA and state aid. \nLawmakers in Washington, Boeing’s traditional manufacturing hub, approved the sweeping $8.7 billion in state aid in 2013 as the planemaker threatened to manufacture the redesigned 777 elsewhere. Washington landed the 777X work, as well as a composite wing factory, after pledging to extend through 2040 tax incentives for aerospace-related companies that were due to expire after 2024. \nThe measure has drawn fire locally because it didn’t require Boeing to maintain employment at a set level in order to maintain the benefits.

      "text": "Tweet Share OSLO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Norway plans to order five Boeing Co P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes to maintain its surveillance capacity and meet future security challenges, the NATO country's Defence Ministry said. Following an agreement in Norway's parliament to boost long-term military spending, the 9.83 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.15 billion) purchase will likely face only minor political opposition. Norway's long maritime border with neighbouring Russia has become a renewed focus for the country's military planners following the Russian annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Norway's territorial waters also stretch far into the Arctic. Neighbouring Sweden and Finland, which are not in the NATO alliance, have also expressed concerns about incursions by Russian submarines and other naval vessels. \"The new security situation increases our demand for situational awareness in our own vicinity. The ability to handle current and future challenges must therefore be strengthened,\" Defence Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said. \"The introduction of the Poseidon aircraft is crucial for Norway to maintain a leading position and expertise on strategic conditions in northern areas,\" she said in the statement released late on Friday. The statement did not specifically mention Russia. The submarine-hunting patrol planes will replace Norway's current fleet of six P-3 Orion and three DA-20 Jet Falcon aircraft and are expected to be delivered in 2021 and 2022. Norway will also buy related intelligence equipment, the ministry said. ($1 = 8.5270 Norwegian crowns) (Reporting by Joachim Dagenborg; Editing by Terje Solsvik and Alison Williams) Reblog",

(Lindsey Wasson/ for the Chicago Tribune) Tribune news services panel on Monday ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane-maker Boeing, and that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months.\nThe European Union , which backs Boeing's EU-based rival, Airbus, claimed it as a landmark victory in the longstanding battle between the two companies that dominate the global market for airplanes. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nMonday's decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nBoeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years.\nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,... \nBoeing's 747 jumbo jet may have won a reprieve from an uncertain future as United Parcel Service agreed to buy at least 14 freighters -- the biggest order in almost nine years. \nThe deal for 747-8 aircraft, valued at $5.3 billion based on list prices and fueled by UPS's international expansion,... (Julie Johnsson and Michael Sasso) \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane-maker. \nAssociated Press",

      "text": "Bloomberg News The nose of a 787 airplane is seen during the manufacturing process at the Boeing Co. facility in Everett, Washington, in June 2015. Boeing Co. suffered a regulatory defeat Monday when the World Trade Organization ruled that the airline manufacturer had received an illegal tax break from Washington state.\nBoeing BA, +0.00% received the tax break from Washington starting in 2013 to build its new 777X widebody plane in the state.\nThe European Union, which backs Boeing’s rival, Airbus AIR, -0.43% , filed a case with the World Trade Organization, claiming that seven tax incentives from Washington amounted to illegal state aid. The ruling from the WTO on Monday agreed, but said only one of the seven tax breaks was a prohibited subsidy.\nEven with Monday’s ruling , interpretation of the WTO’s position varied, with both sides claiming victory. In fact, the ruling did nothing to end the bitter dispute between the U.S. and EU over airline subsidies underway since 2004.\nIn a statement, Boeing said the ruling was narrow, covering only $50 million instead of a potential $8.7 billion in subsidies claimed by the EU.\nAnd in its own release, the European Commission described the WTO ruling as a “major win.”\n“The [WTO] panel has found that the additional massive subsidies of $5.7 billion provided by Washington State to Boeing are strictly illegal. We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom.\nMajor win for the EU in the WTO Dispute on Boeing https://t.co/yO2vvV1Q9U\n— Daniel Rosario (@danielrosarioEU) November 28, 2016 The U.S. can appeal the ruling. But Boeing said it expected the EU and Airbus to appeal.\n“After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives,” said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing’s general counsel.\nBoeing shares were down a modest 0.01% Monday, trading near $150 or just off a 52-week-high $150.81.\nMore from MarketWatch Toy Teslas, Trucks Sport Realistic Details Why the rally by U.S. stocks is ‘just getting started’ — in one chart Many U.S. Businesses Struggle to Find Mexican Workers",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By Raf Casert and Jamey Keaten , Associated Press | Posted Nov 28th, 2016 @ 9:51am 0  \nGENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels. \n  0 Pending",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 8:52 AM Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US FILE - In this Jan. 25, 2011 file photo, the Boeing Company logo on the property in El Segundo, Calif. Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. Reed Saxon, File AP Photo i   GENEVA \nU.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "text": "Boeing is the only company in the U.S. that builds jumbo jets, and soon, it will soar past a milestone. Boeing began with a canvas and wood airpl... \nMonday’s decision found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to “prohibited” subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings of the wide-bodied 777x plane in the state, excluding foreign competition. \nBoeing has extensive plants around Seattle and the EU says the subsidies would have amounted to $8.7 billion. EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the WTO ruled against $5.7 billion of the measures. \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the “prohibited subsidy” involved the reduction of business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nMalmstrom called Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.” \n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Malmstrom said in a statement. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would “almost certainly be condemned as illegal.” Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Photo by Bloomberg Boeing got illegal tax breaks, WTO says \n(AP)—Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled today, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nRelated:• A Boeing first: outsider to lead jet unit \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Chicago-based Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.",

Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATEN The Associated Press GENEVA — \nU.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump 's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___ \nCasert reported from Brussels.

But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\"\n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\"\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\"\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n___\nCasert reported from Brussels.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US   11:46 am 11/28/2016 11:46am Share FILE - In this Jan. 25, 2011 file photo, the Boeing Company logo on the property in El Segundo, Calif. Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \nGENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing’s key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to “prohibited” subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only “future incentives” of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.” \n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn’t until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n“Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,” Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. “In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.” \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state’s support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers’ costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, “and that’s only for the 777X.” \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the “prohibited subsidy” involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would “almost certainly be condemned as illegal.” Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

      "text": "International Business WTO calls US state's Boeing subsidies illegal in win for EU Subsidies given by the US state of Washington to Boeing are illegal, the World Trade Organisation said on Monday, in a victory for rival aircraft manufacturer Airbus and the European Union. Posted 29 Nov 2016 01:42 Washington State's subsidies for the Boeing 777X fuelled unfair trade distortions, according to the WTO. (AFP/Patrick Kovarik) A \nGENEVA: Subsidies given by the US state of Washington to Boeing are illegal, the World Trade Organisation said on Monday (Nov 28), in a victory for rival aircraft manufacturer Airbus and the European Union. \nThe ruling from a WTO panel is the latest blow in a drawn out trans-Atlantic battle between the aviation industry's two titans, which has seen both Airbus and Boeing score points along the way. \nThe WTO said that subsidies set up by Washington state to support production of Boeing's 777X jet were \"prohibited\" as they encouraged the use of domestic materials, fuelling trade distortions. \nThe panel called for the subsidies to be withdrawn within 90 days. \nAirbus was represented by the European Union in the case while the US federal government fought for Boeing and Washington state because companies and regional authorities do not have standing at the Geneva-based WTO. \nBoeing said it expects the US to appeal the decision. \nAccording to Airbus's own estimates, Washington state has given Boeing tax breaks worth US$8.7 billion (€8.2 billion) in a scheme scheduled to run through 2040. \nBoeing has dismissed those numbers, putting the benefits to date at a maximum of US$1 billion. \n\"The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State's taxpayers,\" Airbus president Fabrice Bregier said in a statement of the aircraft that is expected to be market ready by 2020. \n\"This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the US Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behaviour,\" he added. \nThe WTO, which aims to create a level playing field in global trade, does not have the ability to force compliance with its rulings, but can approve retaliatory measures which in theory can pressure trade manipulators to fall into line. \nCalling Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU,\" the bloc's trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she expected the United States \"to respect the rules, uphold fair competition and withdraw these subsidies without any delay.\" \nTIT-FOR-TAT \nThe EU has meanwhile also been reprimanded by the WTO during the tit-for-tat conflict between Airbus and Boeing. \nIn September, a WTO panel found that Brussels had not respected a 2011 ruling ordering it to take steps to withdraw several support and subsidy programmes for Airbus. \nThe WTO did not put a value on those programmes but Boeing said they amounted to US$22 billion worth of illegal support for Airbus development and sales. \nThe EU has appealed that decision, insisting that the subsidies in question had been discontinued. \nMeanwhile, a separate 2012 WTO ruling on benefits Boeing received from federal, state and local governments in the US remains a source of dispute, with a report on the issue due out in the coming months. \nA NEW INDUSTRY-WIDE PACT? \nAirbus Group chief executive Tom Enders described the seemingly never-ending spat with Boeing as \"a ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the US.\" \nIn seeking to move past drawn-out, costly and unforceable squabbles at the WTO, Enders called for an agreement \"on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic.\" \nHe noted that the battle for aviation contracts was no longer just Airbus versus Boeing. \nAircraft maker Bombardier has received massive support from the Canadian government, while Russian and Asian firms have increasingly become market players, Enders said. \n\"We need a global framework,\" he continued. \"This WTO battle is a battle of the past which benefits only the armies of lawyers both sides employ for more than a decade.\" - AFP/de",

      "title": "WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet",
      "text": "Tweet Share GENEVA, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday that a tax break from Washington state to help U.S. planemaker Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy. The WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in the state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. It rejected a complaint by the European Union against six further tax measures. It is the third swathe of public support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus criticised by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade dispute dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. The ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders potential sanctions against the EU over earlier WTO rulings against Airbus.

Reed Saxon, File AP Photo i   GENEVA \nU.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.

      "text": "View Photo \nWashington State's subsidies for the Boeing 777X fuelled unfair trade distortions, according to the WTO \nBoeing expects the US to appeal a World Trade Organization decision Monday that declared illegal a tax credit offered by Washington state, company representatives said. \nThe WTO decision was a win for the European Union on behalf of Airbus, which had argued that a Washington state tax benefit offered to Boeing to build the 777x jetliner was an unfair subsidy which violates global trade rules. \n\"I fully expect this case will be appealed,\" said Bob Novick, an outside counsel representing Boeing, adding that a final resolution of the case might not come until early 2019. \nThe US Trade Representative said it is reviewing the WTO decision with Washington state officials to decide how to respond. \nNovick criticized the rationale behind the decision to strike down the Washington state Business and Occupancy (B&O) tax rate as wrongly concluding that the law favored the domestic manufacturing of goods because Boeing had not imported the wing for the 777x as it had for the 787 plane. \nThe WTO \"jumped to the conclusion that the somehow the law favored domestic over imported,\" he told reporters in a conference call. \nBoeing said the WTO rejected the EU claim that the company had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. Boeing estimates the total benefit of the disputed Washington state provision at $50 million a year, or a maximum of $1 billion. \nBoeing has not received any of the benefits yet under the B&O tax break and does not expect to see any until 2020 at the soonest, Boeing officials said. \n\"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel. \nThe ruling from a WTO panel is the latest blow in a drawn out trans-Atlantic battle between the aviation industry's two titans, which has seen Airbus and Boeing each score points along the way. \nUS Trade Representative spokesman Matt McAlvanah said the agency was reviewing the ruling, but suggested it was ready to fight on behalf of the US aerospace giant. \n\"This case is a small fraction of the overall aerospace dispute, on which the WTO has found overwhelmingly in the United States' favor,\" McAlvanah said in a statement, noting the WTO has deemed illegal $22 billion in EU subsidies to Airbus. \n\"The US government will continue to hold the EU to account for illegal, market distorting subsidies that have put American workers and businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\"  ",

      "text": "WTO Rules Against Boeing in Trade Battle Between U.S. and EU -- 2nd Update November 28, 2016, 12:43:00 PM   By Robert Wall and Doug Cameron \nThe World Trade Organization on Monday struck a blow against Boeing Co., determining a key tax benefit granted for production of its newest long-haul jetliner contravenes international trade rules. \nThe tax was a central part of a case the European Union in December 2014 filed with the WTO against the U.S. as part of a wider protracted dispute over subsidies to aircraft makers. \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström. \nBoeing general counsel J. Michael Luttig said the company expected \"every aspect\" of the Washington state incentives to persevere after any appeal. \nThe wider dispute dates back more than a decade over government handouts provided to Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE. The two sides settled a previous disagreement in 1992, but the U.S. walked away from that deal in 2004, arguing Airbus had an unfair advantage. \nSince then, the U.S. and EU have successfully challenged subsidies to the other's large commercial airplane maker. The case has seen repeated appeals. \nAt stake are potentially billions of dollars in tariffs the U.S. and EU could impose on each other unless the WTO's subsidy concerns are addressed. Those tariffs could be placed on goods and services unrelated to aircraft or aircraft parts. The winning side isn't obliged to impose tariffs, and the penalty stage could be delayed again if the EU and U.S. make changes to the way the benefits are provided. \nEach side has accused the other of providing billions of dollars in illegal government assistance, and the two have sparred repeatedly over the value of state aid. The EU said the latest prohibited subsidy that has to be withdrawn immediately amounts to $5.7 billion. The U.S. said the value is $50 million. \n\"This case is a small fraction of the overall aerospace dispute, on which the WTO has found overwhelmingly in the United States' favor,\" Matt McAlvanah, a spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative said. \nThe government is consulting with Washington state representatives to decide how to respond, he said. \nThe tax benefit was conferred for production of the 777X widebody plane, an updated model Boeing is developing. The plane, which can seat more than 400 passengers, is due to enter service around the end of the decade. \nThe WTO in September determined the EU had failed to properly remove subsidies granted to Airbus in an earlier case. Next year it is expected to pass similar judgment on the U.S. \nAirbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders renewed his call or Boeing to return to the negotiating table: \"The only way out of the ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the U.S. is to agree on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic.\" \nHe said the financial backing being provided to other plane makers in Canada, Russia and Asia made it critical to establish a \"global framework.\" \nBoeing said its position hadn't changed and that it wouldn't engage in talks until the EU had come into compliance with WTO rules. \n--Viktoria Dendrinou contributed to this article. \nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com  161243ET   This article appears in:",

      "text": "Trade body says Boeing was offered illegal tax breaks in US By RAF CASERT and JAMEY KEATENAssociated Press \nGENEVA (AP) - U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \nCasert reported from Brussels.

      "text": "\n- From the December 2016 issue -It can be as loud as standing alongside a Boeing 767 at takeoff. And it’s about as irritating as having someone thumping on a bass drum in the back seat. Whether you call it wind throb or buffeting or just plain annoying, it happens when someone in the car opens a single window at speed and it stops when a second window rolls down. \n-The phenomenon that produces this noise is the Helmholtz Resonance, the same principle that makes a bottle hum when you blow over its open top. It’s the interaction of the gas in a container with a single orifice and the other gases that are, um, passing over that orifice. In this case, the container is the car. The interaction between the two masses of air produces vortexes that compress and decompress the air, producing the throbbing effect. Hermann von Helmholtz, the German physician and physicist who described this interaction, died in 1894 and was thus unavailable for comment.\n-How intrusive buffeting can get depends on the car’s shape and the size of its windows as well as the speed the vehicle is traveling. Modern cars and trucks are more subject to air thump because they’re so aerodynamically efficient and well sealed against wind intrusion. Jim Zunich, GM’s global vehicle performance chief engineer for wind noise, explains: “We want nice, smooth attached air for aerodynamics, but that’s worse for buffeting.”\n- \n- Gimme Buffet \n-See the top image for how the side-mirror shape can affect air movement around the front windows, and the middle image for how not much can influence flow around the rears. A pop-up deflector would shift airflow over the open sunroof rearward, mitigating those annoying vortexes. -When the car was designed with little concern for aero, the haphazard mass of air boiling around it only coincidentally adhered to the vehicle’s surface and only occasionally allowed the Helmholtz Resonance to generate its vortexes. And even when the problem did arise, the car’s other windows and doors were hardly airtight, so the air leakage around them relieved any pressure differences. But a modern cockpit is a well-sealed drum from which only minimal air pressure leaks. In this small, particular way, a modern vehicle is too good for its own good.\n-But why is buffeting so much worse when just a rear window is down? Two words: side mirrors. They’re one of the last things developed in a vehicle’s design, and they’re placed and shaped precisely to direct airflow in a way that minimizes buffeting at the front windows. But there are no easy tweaks to be made to tune the airflow around the rear windows.\n- - How Automakers Are Maximizing Vehicle Efficiency Virtually - The Art (and the Data) behind Launching a Car Quickly - Drag Queens: Aerodynamics Compared - -Buffeting is likely to get worse as vehicles get more aerodynamic. “Obviously, if we could resolve it free of charge, it’s something we would do,” concludes Zunich. “But because it comes with styling, aero, and noise penalties, it’s a trade-off engineers have to make.” Well, whether or not we understand how buffeting works, most of us have figured out a solution: Crack another window.\n- - Powering Up - - Software supplier Exa developed PowerFLOW, the simulation software that generated the images on this page. PowerFLOW is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program. CFD generates a detailed mathematical model of a fluid flow, in this case allowing engineers to observe and tweak how air flows over, around, and through a car on a molecular level. It’s just one of the tools that allows automakers to design a complete car before a single part is stamped or cast. Suck on that, Instagram. —Jared Gall - - ",

The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. \nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \n\"We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,\" said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a \"conservative estimate\" and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion. \nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

      "text": "GENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months.\nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing’s key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. The WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to “prohibited” subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle.\nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed.\nBut Boeing called that figure excessive and said only “future incentives” of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\n“We are really the only party that can credibly come up with a figure,” said Boeing spokesman Tim Neale, referring to the value of the tax breaks. He said the $50 million per year was a “conservative estimate” and even over a 20-year span would only total $1 billion.\nHe said the EU effort was aimed in part to distract attention from a far more costly WTO ruling against Airbus two months ago.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.”\n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn’t until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n“Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,” Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. “In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.”\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state’s support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers’ costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, “and that’s only for the 777X.”\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the “prohibited subsidy” involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would “almost certainly be condemned as illegal.” Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n___\nCasert reported from Brussels.\n",

      "text": "New York (AFP) - Boeing expects the US to appeal a World Trade Organization decision Monday that declared illegal a tax credit offered by Washington state, company representatives said. The WTO decision was a win for the European Union on behalf of Airbus, which had argued that a Washington state tax benefit offered to Boeing to build the 777x jetliner was an unfair subsidy which violates global trade rules.\n\"I fully expect this case will be appealed,\" said Bob Novick, an outside counsel representing Boeing, adding that a final resolution of the case might not come until early 2019.\nThe US Trade Representative said it is reviewing the WTO decision with Washington state officials to decide how to respond.\nNovick criticized the rationale behind the decision to strike down the Washington state Business and Occupancy (B&O) tax rate as wrongly concluding that the law favored the domestic manufacturing of goods because Boeing had not imported the wing for the 777x as it had for the 787 plane.\nThe WTO \"jumped to the conclusion that the somehow the law favored domestic over imported,\" he told reporters in a conference call.\nBoeing said the WTO rejected the EU claim that the company had received $8.7 billion in subsidies. Boeing estimates the total benefit of the disputed Washington state provision at $50 million a year, or a maximum of $1 billion.\nBoeing has not received any of the benefits yet under the B&O tax break and does not expect to see any until 2020 at the soonest, Boeing officials said.\n\"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate,\" said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel.\nThe ruling from a WTO panel is the latest blow in a drawn out trans-Atlantic battle between the aviation industry's two titans, which has seen Airbus and Boeing each score points along the way.\nUS Trade Representative spokesman Matt McAlvanah said the agency was reviewing the ruling, but suggested it was ready to fight on behalf of the US aerospace giant.\n\"This case is a small fraction of the overall aerospace dispute, on which the WTO has found overwhelmingly in the United States' favor,\" McAlvanah said in a statement, noting the WTO has deemed illegal $22 billion in EU subsidies to Airbus.\n\"The US government will continue to hold the EU to account for illegal, market distorting subsidies that have put American workers and businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\"",

Boeing Co. A World Trade Organization panel on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016 ruled that Washington state offered billions in illegal tax breaks to plane maker Boeing, saying that the U.S. government must take action to end the plans within months. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) \nGENEVA (AP) — U.S. plane maker Boeing received major illegal tax breaks from Washington state, a world trade body ruled Monday, adding that the federal government should now take action to end that support within months. \nThe Chicago-based company and the European Union, which backs Boeing's key European rival Airbus, both claimed the ruling by the World Trade Organization as a victory in a longstanding battle for contracts between the two aerospace giants. \nThe WTO found that the support Washington state promised to give Boeing from 2024 to 2040 amounted to \"prohibited\" subsidies. The support offered by Washington came on condition that Boeing keeps the production of the wings for the wide-bodied 777X plane in the state, effectively excluding foreign competition. Boeing has extensive plants around Seattle. \nThe 28-member bloc said the WTO had ruled that $5.7 billion in subsidies were illegal, out of a total $8.7 billion in measures that it reviewed. But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only \"future incentives\" of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision. \nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy. \nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday's ruling \"an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.\" \n\"We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,\" Malmstrom said in a statement. \nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn't until the plane is first delivered in 2020. \n\"Today's decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,\" Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. \"In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.\" \nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state's support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers' costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, \"and that's only for the 777X.\" \nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump's ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the \"prohibited subsidy\" involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States. \nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would \"almost certainly be condemned as illegal.\" Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker. \n___",

But Boeing called that figure excessive, and said only “future incentives” of $50 million a year were found impermissible in the WTO decision.\nAppearing to counter both, a Geneva-based trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the ruling addressed only the legality of the measures, and not the possible financial benefit that could be drawn from the subsidy.\nThe ruling is but a part of a wider squabble involving accusations between the U.S. government and the 28-nation EU over support for Boeing and Airbus dating back to 2004.\nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU and its aircraft industry.”\n“We expect the U.S. to respect the rules, uphold fair competition, and withdraw these subsidies without any delay,” Malmstrom said in a statement.\nFor its part, Boeing said it expected the European bloc and Airbus to appeal the ruling, saying the WTO had found that the U.S. company had not received any benefit yet from the 777X tax rate and wouldn’t until the plane is first delivered in 2020.\n“Today’s decision is a complete victory for the United States, Washington State and Boeing,” Boeing general council J. Michael Luttig said in a statement. “In rejecting virtually every claim made by the EU in this case, the WTO found today that Boeing has not received a penny of impermissible subsidies.”\nAirbus President Fabrice Bregier argued the state’s support in the United States would allow Boeing to develop the 777X for free on taxpayers’ costs. He estimated the damage to Airbus and the European aerospace industry to be around $50 billion so far, “and that’s only for the 777X.”\nThe case could have some implications for President-elect Donald Trump’s ambitions to support U.S. business first and foremost. Rejecting some of the EU claims, the WTO found that only one of seven tax incentives provided by Washington state amounted to illegal subsidies for wings for the wide-body jet. In essence, the “prohibited subsidy” involved the reduction of the business tax rate on the condition that the wings were produced domestically within the United States.\nAirbus had already confidently predicted victory at the WTO over the Washington state tax incentives, saying during the latest tit-for-tat showdown in September that the alleged subsidies would “almost certainly be condemned as illegal.” Airbus had made that assertion after the trade body had found that the EU had provided billions of dollars of improper subsidies to the European plane maker.\n# airplane manufacturing airbus",

      "text": "WTO rules Boeing subsidies from US state of Washington are illegal PUBLISHED : Tuesday, 29 November, 2016, 12:21am UPDATED : Tuesday, 29 November, 2016, 12:21am Canadian firm lands C$579 million Boeing contract 26 Sep 2016 \nSubsidies given by the US state of Washington to Boeing are illegal, the World Trade Organization said Monday, handing a victory for rival aircraft maker Airbus and the European Union. \nThe ruling from a WTO panel is the latest blow in a drawn out trans-Atlantic battle between the aviation industry’s two titans, which has seen both Airbus and Boeing score points along the way. \nIn Monday’s decision, the WTO said that subsidies set up by Washington state to support production of Boeing’s 777X commercial jet, were “prohibited” as they encouraged the use of domestic materials, fuelling unfair trade distortions. \nThe panel called for the subsidies to be withdrawn within 90 days. \nAirbus was represented by the European Union in the case while the US federal government fought for Boeing and Washington state because companies and regional authorities are not represented at the Geneva-based WTO. \nBoeing said it expects the US to appeal the decision. \nAccording to Airbus’s own estimates, Washington state has given Boeing tax breaks worth US$8.7 billion (8.2 billion euros) in a scheme scheduled to run through 2040. \nAirbus further claims it has already lost $50 billion in sales as a result of the subsidy regime that gives its arch-rival unfair advantages. \n“The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State’s taxpayers,” Airbus president Fabrice Bregier said in a statement. \n“This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the US Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behaviour,” he added. \nThe WTO, which aims to create a level playing field in global trade, does not have the ability to force compliance with its rulings, but can approve retaliatory measures which in theory can pressure trade manipulators to fall into line. \nCalling Monday’s ruling “an important victory for the EU,” the bloc’s trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she expected the United States “to respect the rules, uphold fair competition and withdraw these subsidies without any delay.” \nThe EU has meanwhile also been reprimanded by the WTO during the tit-for-tat conflict between Airbus and Boeing. \nIn September, a WTO panel found that Brussels had not respected a 2011 ruling ordering it to take steps to withdraw several support and subsidy programmes for Airbus. \nThe WTO did not put a value on those programmes but Boeing said they amounted to $22 billion worth of illegal support for Airbus development and sales, mostly in subsidised loans. \nThe EU has appealed that decision, insisting that the subsidies in question had in fact been discontinued. \nMeanwhile, a separate 2012 WTO ruling on benefits Boeing received from federal, state and local governments in the US remains a source of dispute, with a report on the issue is due out in the coming months.",

      "title": "WTO rules against tax break for Boeing 777X jet",
      "text": "Tweet Share Boeing's logo is seen during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files More By Tim Hepher and Tom Miles (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled on Monday a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing (BA.N) develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus. The WTO said the subsidy came in the form of a renewed cut in Washington state's main business tax for aerospace agreed in 2013, when Boeing was considering where to base assembly of the latest member of its long-haul jet family. It is the third swathe of taxpayer support for Boeing or its European rival Airbus (AIR.PA) faulted by the WTO in a record transatlantic trade spat dating back 12 years, and involving mutual accusations of tens of billions of dollars of aid. The ruling, which can be appealed by either side, comes as the United States ponders the first sanctions against the European Union in more than a decade over earlier subsidy rulings against Airbus. The WTO did not give a value for the banned aid in its latest ruling, but the EU estimated it at $5.7 billion out of an $8.7 billion tax package in Washington, where most Boeing factories are based. Airbus said the measures had cost it $50 billion in sales. Boeing said the aid in question would only kick in from 2020 and would be worth $50 million a year, a fraction of the total amount at stake in the world's largest trade dispute. The WTO backed EU claims that another six measures provided subsidies to Boeing, but rejected European arguments that these fell into the most toxic category being reviewed by its panel. It urged the United States to withdraw the prohibited subsidy in 90 days, but did not say how this should be done, prompting immediate discord between U.S. and European representatives about how much the planemaker would have to give up and when. Seizing on previous U.S. statements that Airbus subsidies originally deemed prohibited - but later watered down on appeal - should be repaid to taxpayers, European sources said Boeing would now have to forego billions of dollars in aid. They also zeroed in on \"programme accounting\" methods used by Boeing, which they said had already allowed it to factor in the future support for the 777X even before money had been received. Under the same system, Boeing would have to adjust its accounts sooner rather than later to reflect new risks resulting from the WTO finding, they argued, in what would be the first direct impact of the marathon case on investors. CONFIDENT ON APPEAL The European Commission urged the United States to remove the prohibited aid \"without delay\". Boeing officials and lawyers, however, played down the prospect of having to pay back any support, noting there was no money to discuss until deliveries of the new jet start in 2020. They said they were confident the ruling would be overturned on appeal and insisted the tax breaks were dwarfed by $22 billion in subsidised loans by European governments to Airbus, adding these could spark U.S. retaliation within a year. Investors, too, seemed sceptical about the prospect of any near-term financial hit, sending Boeing shares down just 0.3 percent, in line with the market. \"We expect little material impact on either Boeing or Airbus from WTO rulings,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note. On paper, the ruling is however seen as a step backwards for the United States because the WTO had earlier ruled that a previous version of the same tax breaks had fallen into a weaker category of subsidies, which the Geneva watchdog treats less harshly. Under WTO rules, subsidies that are explicitly tied to exports or, in this case, the use of local content are banned. European officials argue Boeing fell into a prohibited subsidy trap of its own making when state lawmakers insisted on locking Boeing into Washington more clearly than before, after Boeing accepted earlier tax breaks only to move work elsewhere. In 2013, Washington lawmakers extended the tax breaks from 2024 to 2040 but said they would end support for any new version of jet if its body or wings were assembled outside the state. Reblog",

      "text": "More American aircraft giant Boeing (NYSE: BA - news ) has been receiving subsidies from the US state of Washington that are illegal under competition law, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has ruled. The WTO panel said the subsidies, which rival company Airbus says are worth $8.7bn (£7bn) and due to continue until 2040, encouraged the use of domestic materials and therefore unfairly distorted trade. Boeing and Washington State have been told to end the subsidies within the next 90 days, but WTO decisions are not binding. The organisation can, however, approve retaliatory measures that would pressure the parties involved into complying with its rulings. Boeing has said it expects the United States to appeal the judgement. Today's decision marks the latest chapter in a long-running dispute between rivals Airbus and Boeing about the support each gets from various governments and agencies. The EU was also recently reprimanded by the World Trade Organisation for failing to abide by an earlier ruling instructing it to withdraw several subsidies it offers to Airbus, which is based in France. Boeing says the EU support in question in that case, which mainly took the form of subsidised loans, was worth about $22bn. But Airbus says it has already lost an estimated $50bn in sales thanks to the unfair advantages Boeing receives from the US. Yet another dispute over US support to Boeing is still being investigated, with the WTO expected to rule on that case in the coming months. Reblog",
