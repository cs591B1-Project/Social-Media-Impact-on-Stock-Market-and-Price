      "text": "Amazon Could Soon Start Streaming Live Sports On Prime: NFL, NBA And MLB Reportedly In Sight 23 November 2016, 9:45 am EST By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times Internet In A Minute Now Playing Amazon has reportedly been in talks with the NBA, NFL, MLB and various media networks over the rights to stream live sports online on Prime. The company is reportedly looking to bring Prime Tickets in the U.S. as well. ( Brian Ach | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nAmazon is reportedly looking to stream live sports through Prime, and it's already in talks to make it happen, according to the Wall Street Journal. \nAiming to be a one-stop shop for all you need, from shopping to getting information or performing tasks via Alexa , to watching live sports on Prime, Amazon is apparently pushing through with another ambitious endeavor. \nThe WSJ reports that Amazon has been in talks with several major sports organizations in the United States, including the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), and Major League Baseball (MLB). The company has also been in talks with a number of media networks broadcasting sports, trying to obtain the rights to livestream games online. Amazon Prime Premium Sports Package \nThe report reveals that Amazon has been negotiating some sort of premium sports package to offer with its Prime subscription service. Amazon Prime already offers on-demand movies and TV shows to its subscribers, but diving into live sports streaming would give it a significant edge over rival Netflix. \nIf Amazon does manage to score the rights to livestream games from various sports and leagues, especially high-profile ones, it could help it get ahead of the competition and establish itself as a force in the on-demand video streaming space. At the same time, it would also pose a serious threat to traditional TV and cable companies, especially with cord-cutting on the rise. Amazon Prime Tickets Hitting U.S. Too \nA separate report from Re/code, meanwhile, reveals that Amazon plans to expand its online ticketing business to the United States. The company launched Amazon Tickets last year in the UK and is reportedly looking to offer similar services across the pond as well, planning to integrate online ticket sales into its Amazon Prime service. \nThe company recently posted a number of job listings to bring Prime Tickets to the U.S. market, but no further details are available at this point. Moreover, Amazon doesn't have its eyes set just on the U.S. It's apparently looking to expand its online ticketing business globally, with Europe and Asia in the cards. \nAmazon is yet to make an official announcement regarding its plan to stream live sports or launch Prime Tickets stateside, but such moves would not be surprising. \nIf Amazon were to start streaming live sports from the NFL, NBA, MLB and more, would you find a Prime subscription more appealing?

SEATTLE — Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

(Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports ( http://lat.ms/2fop8fn ) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Tags",

Death captures the love of your life. If you are in a storm - you know what I am talking about. If you are not, this book is still for you. Events may be in your forecast and you can be prepared for the sting of the storm. The storm does pass and tomorrow can be a forecast full of sunshine, hope, faith, and promise. You can count on light to change your perspective, bring life into focus and help your goals come together just when you need it the most. \nIf this book leaves you equipped to capture some great images by utilizing lighting techniques - great.

Sandra is an amazing photographer but her ability to weave among her pictures an explanation of the use of light as a technique AND a personal story of pain, victory and hope is indeed a very special gift! Not only is this a must read because of the beauty captured by the author but because the story itself is so powerful! This work, portrayed through incredible photography, represents the beauty hope and LIGHT that God provides for each of us.” – Ruth Snyder \n“This book provides instruction for the reader regarding light within photography - showcasing how light is the most powerful tool to a photographer. The author/photographer also takes you on a very personal journey as she shares some of her struggles, influences and motivational stories in a very “real” way.

      "text": "Tweet \nAmazon has removed some negative reviews of Megyn Kelly’s new book, Settle For More , from their website. Kelly’s tell-all book was released on November 15th and details her experience with President-elect Trump throughout the campaign season, as well as her battle with former Fox News executive Roger Ailes. \nShortly after the book was released, Kelly received an onslaught of negative reviews that were traced back to users of the website Reddit, specifically the Trump supporter forum called “The_Donald.” At one point in time, up to 76% of the reviews were one-star reviews, USA Today reported . \nAs of early Wednesday, only 17% of the reviews written on the site were still one-star reviews, and some Amazon reviewers noticed the difference right away. USA Today detailed some of the negative responses after Amazon took down the blatantly negative reviews: \nSome commenters picked up on the removal of the negative reviews. “Tim from MD.,” for example, wrote a post titled “Over 120 1 star reviews have been deleted. Are we living in a free country anymore?” \n“Trump is president, but she wrote the book certain Clinton would win,” Tim from MD. wrote. “Now the book and her shows advertisers are getting boycotted. So apparently her attorneys have called to get negative reviews deleted. And they succeeded. I’m shocked.” \nBrianna wrote, “I have written many thoughtful reviews as to why this book is horrible! They have all been removed even though I am a reputable Amazon customer/reviewer which is why originally Megyn had the true rating of one and a half stars and now four and a half FIXED STARS!” \nAmazon did not remove all negative reviews, however, only focusing on ones that only mentioned Kelly’s “dislike” of Trump, or negative reviews with only a few words without elaboration. \nKelly’s publisher, Harper Collins told the L.A. Times that the negative reviews had “the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book and our author Megyn Kelly,” and added, “We have brought it to the attention of Amazon.”",

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)[/caption]In the past, Black Friday has been just that. A day. One day where you could hop online or run to your favorite store and score some serious deals. But if retailers like Amazon have anything to do about it, that way of operating could go the way of most commercial fruitcakes and get trashed. Amazon’s Push To Make Every Day Black Friday Amazon began 35 straight days of “Black Friday” bargains this week, meaning that shoppers can get some rock-bottom prices for a decent amount of time before and after Thanksgiving. The company claims it will offer a new deal up to every five minutes from now until Dec. 22, with some of the best opportunities delivered during “Turkey Five”, the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. Some of the best deals will be on toys, electronics and fashion items, and outlined here by BusinessWire . And Amazon isn’t alone in spreading out its bargains. Macy’s, for instance, started offering “ preview doorbusters ” on Nov. 17, as did eBay . Walmart reportedly has been offering deals since Nov. 4, and Target is offering various shipping, coupons, gift cards and Cartwheel savings through December. What’s Behind The Early Sales? Retailers have good reason to extend their sales and give into Christmas creep. ShippingEasy’s 2016 Holiday Shopping Guide asserts that, in 2015, 56.6% of consumers already had started their holiday buying by early November. The National Retail Federation puts that number lower at 41.5%, but it also reports that, for the 2015 season, about 40% of shoppers had started looking for gifts by Halloween. What’s more, the number of people shopping by Halloween has been stable for the past 14 years.What’s driving people to shop early isn’t completely clear, but a Time article by Kit Yarrow offers some possibilities. Some individuals admit they’re hitting stores early out of convenience, hoping to pick things up when they don’t have to make extra trips or fight crowds. The desire to spread out the expense of the holidays for budget reasons might also be a contributing factor. Some people might want more time to ensure that they’re not stuck giving poorer quality or less-than-meaningful items to those they care about. Lastly, shoppers might hit sales as soon as they can because they can spend more time during the holidays with their loved ones. Regardless of the psychological motivations, the ability to shop more retailers anytime, anywhere due to technology and e-commerce likely has changed the ball game, too, making more people less willing to wait.But not everybody’s on board with turning the final months of the year into one giant sale blob. Many consumers feel that the degree of Christmas creep has reached outrageous levels , and there are a fair share of retailers who agree. Stores like Nordstrom, Office Depot, REI, and TJ Maxx all are pushing back, committing to staying closed on Thanksgiving Day.Whether you opt to shop early for Black Friday is completely up to you. But as a consumer, you should know that many major retailers are responding to data that shows that a big percentage of buyers don’t want to—and simply won’t—wait to start purchasing holiday gifts. That means you have the option of getting out there and shelling out your cash if you like. And when you have a choice, you can feel much more in control and, subsequently, less stressed. That’s probably not a bad thing during a time when you are supposed to relax, connect with yourself and others and give thanks.",

      "text": "November 23, 2016 Amazon squashes Trump trolls’ attacks on Megyn Kelly book \nAmazon appeared to remove several politically motivated negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s memoir Settle for More after a flood of one-star ratings drew media attention. \nAs of early Wednesday, 17% of the reviewers on Amazon gave the book one star. At one point, as many as 76% of the reviews were one-star, Slate reported . \nThe Los Angeles Times reported that many of the reviews were linked to a pro-Trump Reddit forum called “The_Donald.” \nSome commenters picked up on the removal of the negative reviews. “Tim from MD.,” for example, wrote a post titled “Over 120 1 star reviews have been deleted. Are we living in a free country anymore?” \n“Trump is president, but she wrote the book certain Clinton would win,” Tim from MD. wrote. “Now the book and her shows advertisers are getting boycotted. So apparently her attorneys have called to get negative reviews deleted. And they succeeded. I’m shocked.” \nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/11/23/amazon-trump-trolls-megyn-kelly-book/94324354/ \nApp Store Users Torch CNN with One Star Reviews over Liberal Bias \nApple App Store and Google Play users are taking their displeasure out on CNN and other news sites by giving the companies’ mobile apps one star reviews, citing the outlets’ liberal bias. \nAccording to Digiday, in the last few weeks CNN has been hit by a wave of one star reviews, with over half of these reviews accusing the company of having a liberal bias. Fascinating: Conservatives are torching CNN's app-store ratings by trolling with 1-star reviews citing liberal bias https://t.co/UvMJkTK62p",

      "text": "Airline seeks court order to end cargo pilot strike Posted: Updated: Amazon packages / Courtesy of MGN Online \nNEW YORK (AP) - The airline that ships packages for Amazon and DHL says it is seeking a court order to get striking pilots back to work as the busy holiday shipping season kicks off. A decision by a judge is expected Wednesday. Pilots from ABX Air went on strike Tuesday, saying that the airline is short staffed and has been forcing them to work on their days off. ABX Air, which is owned by Wilmington, Ohio-based Air Transport Services Group Inc., says the work stoppage is \"illegal.\" The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents the pilots, says the strike caused about 75 flights to be canceled. The union says ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL. ABX says it's talking with customers to make changes.

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.",

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 November 23, 2016, 1:02 P.M. ET Amazon AWS Price Cuts to Reduce 2017 Revenue, Profit Slightly, Says Evercore ISI By Tiernan Ray \nIn case you missed it, Amazon.com ( AMZN ) yesterday announced another one of its cuts in price for its AWS cloud computing service, in this case, the price for its “ S3 ” storage offering. \nThe company cut prices in most regions it served, it said in a post on AWS , and also consolidated six “pricing tiers” into just three. \nEvercore ISI ’s Ken Sena , who rates the stock a Buy and has a $990 price target, notes that this latest cut comes just after the company “cut pricing on several EC2 instances by 5-25% in numerous regions last week.” \nThis is going to cut Amazon’s revenue growth rate, he thinks, but by how much is a tricky matter. Sena reasons it’s not as bad as might at first seem: At first blush, by applying the pricing cuts across our estimate for IaaS revenues (81% of total), it yields an 8.6% AWS revenue growth impact. But we think this is two aggressive as it essentially gives little credit to other AWS services, including Compute (besides EC2), Storage/CDN (besides S3), Database, Networking, Developer Tools, Management Tools, Security, Analytics, Application Services, and Mobile Services. Conversely, while optimistic, if we evenly distribute these services and apply the reduction to just one in ten, we arrive at a much more manageable 2.8% impact to AWS revenues. In reality, we believe the answer lies somewhere in the middle, leading us to estimate a ~6% impact at the midpoint. \nHe ends up cutting his Amazon AWS revenue outlook for 2017, and for profit, but bear in mind there’s still some “elasticity” in the business to account for: While we suspect that these price cuts may have been factored already in Amazon’s 4Q guidance (which was issued less than a month ago), we are electing to lower our 4Q AWS revenue 1% to $3.71bn (54% y/y), a 200bp impact to growth, since the pricing changes will be in effect for just one month. This leaves Amazon total revenues effectively unchanged, given that AWS only represents 8% of revenues, albeit ~50% of CSOI. In turn, we are reducing our CSOI 2% to $2.02bn (16% y/y, 4.5% of revenue), which moves us to $1.16bn in GAAP EBIT, now slightly below the high end of the company’s guidance range. As we look to the impact of these cuts on 2017, where a full-year of cuts get factored, we are lowering our 2017 AWS revenue 2% to $17.76bn (43% y/y), or a ~350 bp impact to growth as we contemplate some elasticity, which flows through to a 4% reduction to CSOI, assuming the lost revenue represented 100% margin. \nAmazon shares today are down $6.51, or 0.8%, at $778.82.

Share story Seattle Times staff \nPilots at the Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) unit that hauls packages for Amazon.com and DHL Worldwide Express will be ordered back to work by a federal judge, halting a strike that threatened to disrupt holiday deliveries. \nA federal judge in Cincinnati said he will grant ABX Air’s request for a temporary restraining order requiring the pilots to call off the strike, which began Tuesday morning and forced the cancellation of more than two dozen flights. \nJulie Ford, an attorney for the pilots union, said the judge told the parties in the case he intends to issue a written order terminating the strike. Ford said the union has withdrawn the picket lines to comply with the order, which is effective for five days under federal law. \n“The union is obviously disappointed,” Ford said in a phone interview. The union will make a decision on how to proceed next week, she said. Most Read Stories",

      "text": "26 shares \nSome analysts expect the Chinese smart home market to be a $22 billion a year business by as soon as 2018. With growth like that, it’d be a clear win for companies like Google and Amazon, who’d love to get their digital assistant-equipped smart speakers into the hands of (potentially) over a billion Chinese people.Unfortunately, the DingDong beat them to it. \nThe DingDong, made by LingLong (this is all very fun to say) costs just $118 and provides answers, plays music and audiobooks, and manages schedules much like Amazon’s Echo. It’s operated largely the same way, to boot. To wake the device, one of three commands will work: DingDong DingDong, Xiaowei Xiaowei, or BaiLing BaiLing. Once awake, it’s capable of doing much of what the Echo does, only it’s currently clearly lacking in developer support. So far, LingLong reports, customers are primarily using it to play music from a library of about three million songs.",

      "text": "Pilots at the Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) unit that hauls packages for Amazon.com and DHL Worldwide Express will be ordered back to work by a federal judge, halting a strike that threatened to disrupt holiday deliveries.\nA federal judge in Cincinnati said he will grant ABX Air’s request for a temporary restraining order requiring the pilots to call off the strike, which began Tuesday morning and forced the cancellation of more than two dozen flights.\nJulie Ford, an attorney for the pilots union, said the judge told the parties in the case he intends to issue a written order terminating the strike. Ford said the union has withdrawn the picket lines to comply with the order, which is effective for five days under federal law.\n“The union is obviously disappointed,” Ford said in a phone interview. The union will make a decision on how to proceed next week, she said.\nMost Read Stories UW cornerback Darren Gardenhire announces he's leaving team Thanksgiving, Apple Cup travel alert: ‘Parade of storms’ to bring rain, wind, mountain snow Cops, homelessness and goodbye to Pronto: Seattle’s new budget Quarter-mile walk from light rail to Sea-Tac could get a little cozier Boeing goes outside for new Commercial Airplanes CEO Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Amazon signed a deal in March with Air Transport Services Group (ATSG), to lease 20 airplanes, helping form a dedicated air-cargo network connecting the rapidly growing number of Amazon’s warehouses.\nATSG is already flying 14 of those planes, or 35 flights a day, for Amazon, according to the pilots. ABX also makes 45 flights a day for DHL.\nAmazon has downplayed the potential impact of the walkout. \n“We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,” spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said.\nThe leasing of the air-cargo fleets comes as Amazon attempts to cope with logistics challenges it has faced in past holiday seasons. Higher than anticipated demand last year forced the company to scramble to deliver packages to customers’ doorsteps.\nIn addition to expanding its delivery capabilities, Amazon has changed the fee structure for its fulfillment service for independent merchants to avoid similar troubles this time around.\nSeattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday  ",

      "text": "Some analysts expect the Chinese smart home market to be a $22 billion a year business by as soon as 2018. With growth like that, it’d be a clear win for companies like Google and Amazon, who’d love to get their digital assistant-equipped smart speakers into the hands of (potentially) over a billion Chinese people.Unfortunately, the DingDong beat them to it. The DingDong, made by LingLong (this is all very fun to say) costs just $118 and provides answers, plays music and audiobooks, and manages schedules much like Amazon’s Echo. It’s operated largely the same way, to boot. To wake the device,…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web",

      "text": "Initially, the announcement of the Dash push-button service by Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN - Free Report ) was taken by many to be an April Fool’s joke. But it has emerged as a way to keep users hooked on to its products. The company has been taking on its competitors with this concept, especially the brick-and-mortar stores, since Apr 2015.\nThe company announced yesterday that it has included four new device makers to the Amazon Dash Replenishment program  namely Honeywell, Nestle, GeniCan and WePlenish.\nThe company also announced two new dash-enabled devices, PUR Ultimate Faucet Filtration System and the Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher.\nThe Automatic Reordering Magic \nPeople are always looking for convenience these days and Amazon is there to take care of it when it comes to shopping.\nThis Prime-exclusive press-to-buy service currently offers more than 150 brands. There are small wireless devices each with a button and linked to a particular product. Users can keep them anywhere in their homes and press one to get automatically place orders. The product reaches the customer in time. All it needs is a Wi-Fi connection.\nComing to the newly announced Dash products, Genican installs easily in garbage cans or recycle bins and will allow customers to order household or office items through voice recognition or barcode scanning.  \nSimilarly, Honeywell’s connected devices will automatically reorder a new air filter when needed while Nestle’s Wi-Fi enabled BabyNes system and WePlenish’s Java stores will do that with formula capsules and coffee, respectively.\nAs far as the new Dash devices are concerned, PUR’s new Bluetooth enabled faucet filtration system automatically orders replacement filters when required. Starting December, the new Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher will do the same in case of dishwasher detergent.\nAMAZON.COM INC Price \nAMAZON.COM INC Price | AMAZON.COM INC Quote \nOur Take \nAmazon has been increasing its focus on the platform approach. The company has built its position as a top retailing platform where it acquires goods at a wholesale price and sells it in retail.\nIt has the resources to drive out middlemen, who would offer more to producers and also keep higher margins for themselves. Its push into groceries is intended to have a similar effect and programs like Dash will add more loyal customers to Amazon.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider \nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA - Free Report ) , Kimball Electronics, Inc. ( KE - Free Report ) and Control4 Corporation ( CTRL - Free Report ) , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \nFor the current year, the consensus estimate for NVIDIA has increased 33.3% in the past 30 days. Estimates for Kimball Electronics and Control4 have gone up by 8.1% and 10%, respectively, over the same time frame. \nZacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit \nHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today’s most promising long-term stocks?

Black Friday is around the corner and you know what that means - shopping season has begun! \nAs usual, the busiest places during this season will be the online shopping giant Amazon's sorting and fulfillment centers. These centers located worldwide are said to process more than a billion packages each year. \nHere's a sneak peek of these facilities leading to the hustle and bustle of Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping fever. Photo Credit: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg \nAccording to its 2015 annual report, in North America alone, Amazon leases or owns about 71,655 square feet of warehouse space. \nAlthough the company does not publish information about its fulfillment centers, research firm Piper Jaffray reports that they had 96 U.S. warehouses in 2015 and that number is expected to be bigger by now. Photo Credit: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg \nHow many orders are expected to pass through these centers? \nThis will give you a pretty good idea - on Cyber Monday in 2015 alone, according to a news release, Amazon sellers received orders for over 23 million items. In fact, according to its annual report, one-third of Amazon's annual revenue is recorded during its fourth quarter. Photo Credit: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg \nThe positions are available in Amazon's fulfillment centers, sorting centers, and work-from-home customer service.

      "text": "Live Sports May Be Next Big Thing For Amazon Prime Image courtesy of flaimo Looking for deals amazon streaming services tv sports Live Games Prime Services \nAmazon Prime members could soon be getting more bang for their buck when it comes to entertainment, as the e-commerce giant is rumored to be in talks with major sports leagues and television networks to offer live-streaming of sporting events. \nThe Wall Street Journal , citing people familiar with the matter, reports that Amazon has been in talks with the NBA, MLB, and NFL — as well as smaller leagues for soccer and lacrosse — to obtain rights to stream live games as part of its $99/year Prime subscription service or as an add-on service. \nOne of the major roadblocks is that many of the rights involved with carrying live sports are already locked up with broadcasters and the leagues each have their own lucrative out-of-market streaming services they sell through pay-TV providers. The biggest prize in streaming sports — NFL Sunday Ticket — is exclusive to AT&T/DirecTV well into the next decade . \nIn the meantime, sources say the company is also talking directly with traditional TV networks about game rights they have but aren’t actually using. For example, those in the know say Amazon has approached Univision Communication about producing and packaging Mexican soccer league games that don’t air. \nAnother route the company is taking reportedly involves approaching global leagues, such as Indian Premier League cricket or Russian hockey. This option, the sources say, could give Amazon a toe in the door when it comes to sports, and the ability to tailor service to customers, thus creating a better return on investment. \nThe WSJ reports that while Amazon isn’t the first company to pursue streaming live games, if it is successful in the venture it could be the first significant interruption of traditional pay TV’s bread-and-butter. \nA senior sports executive tells the WSJ that Amazon’s plan could work, as the company appears to be focused on the “long game, while near-term financial returns drive the agenda for most companies.” ",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Grab a Certified Refurbished 12.9-inch iPad Pro for $549 on Amazon What a Deal by Abdel Ibrahim November 24, 2016 \nAmazon is offering the 12.9 -inch Certified Refurbished 32GB iPad Pro for $549 with free two-day shipping for Prime Members. \nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro made its debut roughly a year ago and was aimed towards the creative crowd alongside the Apple Pencil. The price, which has not dropped at the Apple Store since was $799. \nA $250 price drop for a tablet that is not even a year old and is Certified Refurbished is a heck of a deal if you ask me. What’s crazier is that you can jump to the 128GB model for just $649, a full $300 less than what Apple is currently selling it for. \nCertified Refurbished Apple products tend to look like they’re brand new. In this case, Amazon says that it comes with a minimum 90-day warranty. \nThis Certified Refurbished product has been tested and certified to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear, by a specialized third-party seller approved by Amazon. The product is backed by a minimum 90-day warranty, and may arrive in a generic brown or white box. Accessories may be generic and not directly from the manufacturer. \nWhat a crazy deal. \nIf you’re interested, you can jump over to Amazon now and grab one while they’re still available. You can also grab an Apple Pencil for a few bucks less while you’re at it.",

Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. The Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More” appeared on the online retail giant’s site within hours of its release Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. Invision Photo by Victoria Will i SEATTLE \nAmazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": " Nuvem Networks, Inc.\nGUILFORD, Conn. , Nov. Nuvem Networks will attend Amazon Web Services' (AWS) upcoming conference, re:Invent 2016, to showcase its network as a service (NaaS) platform. Nuvem's software-defined network (SDN) technology enables secure on-demand cloud connectivity -from any device, network or cloud, -to any other device, network or cloud. Nuvem's patented, NaaS approach to cloud connectivity is available as a managed service and will be introduced to attendees in a frictionless self-service model.\n\"Organizations need a scalable yet simple way to connect and consume cloud services for their employees and operational needs. They also want secure cloud connectivity, delivered through simple tools that save them time and labor, and want it all delivered in a way that isn't cost prohibitive to scale and maintain as organizational needs change -- Nuvem aims to provide just that,\" said Michael Mascia , Nuvem Networks CEO.\nAWS re:Invent 2016 attendees who visit Nuvem Networks at Booth #127 will see a demonstration of the company's NaaS platform for deploying SDNs for cloud connectivity. Via a subscription model, the Nuvem NaaS enables organizations to design, deploy and control their SDNs via the Nuvem online portal for simple on-demand cloud connectivity.\nAccording to Lee Cardona , Nuvem's CTO, Nuvem's NaaS enables subscribers to deploy AWS Direct Connect to their existing virtual private clouds (VPC) in minutes by creating a \"full stack\" integration. \"We believe we've cracked the code to cloud connectivity and plan to introduce our platform to the largest cloud computing community on the planet - AWS customers and partners,\" said Cardona.\nNuvem Networks, Inc, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Technology Partner and Direct Connect Partner, is bringing an easy, fast way to deploy AWS Direct Connect for cloud connectivity to an organization's VPCs. Nuvem Networks will be demonstrating the NaaS Platform to AWS re:Invent 2016 attendees as a precursor to launching general availability in the first quarter of 2017.\nLaunched in 2014, Nuvem Networks developed their leading NaaS platform leveraging SDNs specifically designed to easily establish on-demand cloud connectivity to any cloud. The Nuvem NaaS platform brings to cloud connectivity the key benefits of the cloud: simplicity, security, scalability and savings.\nFor more information, contact Nuvem Business Development, at contact@nuvemnet.com or (510) 556-8836.\nThis content was issued through the press release distribution service at Newswire.com.

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.",

(AMZN) and other shippers.\nPilots at a unit of Air Transport Services Group Inc. (ATSG) struck Tuesday morning over longstanding contract grievances.\nIn a complaint filed in federal court Tuesday, ABX Air Inc., a subsidiary of ATSG, said Christmas shopping and deliveries have already been disrupted and could worsen if the industrial action continues.\nA lawyer representing ABX said the Ohio judge had granted a temporary restraining order late Wednesday requiring the pilots to return to work. One of the airline's largest customers also confirmed the court decision. ATSG and lawyers representing its pilot union had no immediate comment.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-grants-temporary-injunction-halting-abx-air-strike-1479942967).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump Jr. held talks on Syria with Russia supporters (http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-jr-held-talks-on-syria-with-russia-supporters-1479920753?mod=mktw).\nMitt Romney leads Donald Trump's picks for secretary of state (http://www.wsj.com/articles/mitt-romney-leads-donald-trumps-picks-for-secretary-of-state-1479846765?mod=mktw).\n-Doug Cameron ; 2000ET\n ",

      "text": "Fruit Ninja Tournament Edition to debut in Amazon’s Champions of Fire By 0 \nIf you’ve never thought about playing “competitive” Fruit Ninja, this might eventually change your mind. The simple but fun (and sometimes challenging) fruit slashing game will be introducing a new variant to its collection: the Tournament Edition. Halfbrick Studios will be unveiling this new game at Amazon’s Champions of Fire e-sports tournament next week, but you can also sign up to try out the closed beta mode, in case you’re hungering to show off your fruit slashing skills. \nThe Fruit Ninja Tournament Edition is actually Halfbrick Studio’s first entry into the burgeoning casual PvP / e-sport scene. At this point, not much has been revealed as to what will differentiate this game from the regular Fruit Ninja one, aside from the fact that you will be competing with other players to see who’s the best fruit slasher of all time. The game will be included in the upcoming Champions of Fire competition happening this December 2 in Las Vegas (of course, where else?) \nIf you don’t know what Champions of Fire is, it is actually the Amazon Appstore’s first mobile game eSports tournament. They have invited 16 of the biggest celebrity video game streamers (yes, they’re a thing if you didn’t know yet) and they will be playing some of the most popular casual mobile games, and doing it competitively. And yes, there is an actual cash prize of $100,000 for the one who will come out on top. \nBut if you’re not one of the 16 who will be playing Fruit Ninja Tournament for the first time, you can play the beta version of the game and give your feedback as well. You can sign up at the closed beta website, beta.fruitninja.com.",

      "text": "Blog This \nGUILFORD, Conn. , Nov. 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Nuvem Networks will attend Amazon Web Services' (AWS) upcoming conference, re:Invent 2016, to showcase its network as a service (NaaS) platform. Nuvem's software-defined network (SDN) technology enables secure on-demand cloud connectivity -from any device, network or cloud, -to any other device, network or cloud. Nuvem's patented, NaaS approach to cloud connectivity is available as a managed service and will be introduced to attendees in a frictionless self-service model. \n\"Organizations need a scalable yet simple way to connect and consume cloud services for their employees and operational needs. They also want secure cloud connectivity, delivered through simple tools that save them time and labor, and want it all delivered in a way that isn't cost prohibitive to scale and maintain as organizational needs change -- Nuvem aims to provide just that,\" said Michael Mascia , Nuvem Networks CEO. \nAWS re:Invent 2016 attendees who visit Nuvem Networks at Booth #127 will see a demonstration of the company's NaaS platform for deploying SDNs for cloud connectivity. Via a subscription model, the Nuvem NaaS enables organizations to design, deploy and control their SDNs via the Nuvem online portal for simple on-demand cloud connectivity. \nAccording to Lee Cardona , Nuvem's CTO, Nuvem's NaaS enables subscribers to deploy AWS Direct Connect to their existing virtual private clouds (VPC) in minutes by creating a \"full stack\" integration. \"We believe we've cracked the code to cloud connectivity and plan to introduce our platform to the largest cloud computing community on the planet - AWS customers and partners,\" said Cardona. \nNuvem Networks, Inc, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Technology Partner and Direct Connect Partner, is bringing an easy, fast way to deploy AWS Direct Connect for cloud connectivity to an organization's VPCs. Nuvem Networks will be demonstrating the NaaS Platform to AWS re:Invent 2016 attendees as a precursor to launching general availability in the first quarter of 2017. \nLaunched in 2014, Nuvem Networks developed their leading NaaS platform leveraging SDNs specifically designed to easily establish on-demand cloud connectivity to any cloud. The Nuvem NaaS platform brings to cloud connectivity the key benefits of the cloud: simplicity, security, scalability and savings. \nFor more information, contact Nuvem Business Development, at or (510) 556-8836. \nThis content was issued through the press release distribution service at Newswire.com.

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

The airliner has asked a federal judge to force the pilots to work so holiday deliveries won't be impacted.   \nAccording to a report from Bloomberg, Amazon says it is confident it will serve customers, because the company works with several carriers. \nA DHL spokesperson said they are monitoring the situation, and did say some of Tuesday's shipments would be delayed.

      "text": "Amazon flooded with negative reviews of Megyn Kelly's memoir \nNovember 23, 2016 12:59 PM \nSEATTLE (AP) - Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum.   \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" \n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Expands Dash Button to Include More Brands - November 23, 2016",
      "text": "Initially, the announcement of the Dash push-button service by Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN - Free Report ) was taken by many to be an April Fool’s joke. But it has emerged as a way to keep users hooked on to its products. The company has been taking on its competitors with this concept, especially the brick-and-mortar stores, since Apr 2015.\nThe company announced yesterday that it has included four new device makers to the Amazon Dash Replenishment program namely Honeywell, Nestle, GeniCan and WePlenish.\nThe company also announced two new dash-enabled devices, PUR Ultimate Faucet Filtration System and the Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher.\nThe Automatic Reordering Magic\nPeople are always looking for convenience these days and Amazon is there to take care of it when it comes to shopping.\nThis Prime-exclusive press-to-buy service currently offers more than 150 brands. There are small wireless devices each with a button and linked to a particular product. Users can keep them anywhere in their homes and press one to get automatically place orders. The product reaches the customer in time. All it needs is a Wi-Fi connection.\nComing to the newly announced Dash products, Genican installs easily in garbage cans or recycle bins and will allow customers to order household or office items through voice recognition or barcode scanning.\nSimilarly, Honeywell’s connected devices will automatically reorder a new air filter when needed while Nestle’s Wi-Fi enabled BabyNes system and WePlenish’s Java stores will do that with formula capsules and coffee, respectively.\nAs far as the new Dash devices are concerned, PUR’s new Bluetooth enabled faucet filtration system automatically orders replacement filters when required. Starting December, the new Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher will do the same in case of dishwasher detergent.\nAMAZON.COM INC Price\nAMAZON.COM INC Price | AMAZON.COM INC Quote:\nOur Take\nAmazon has been increasing its focus on the platform approach. The company has built its position as a top retailing platform where it acquires goods at a wholesale price and sells it in retail.\nIt has the resources to drive out middlemen, who would offer more to producers and also keep higher margins for themselves. Its push into groceries is intended to have a similar effect and programs like Dash will add more loyal customers to Amazon.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA - Free Report ) , Kimball Electronics, Inc. ( KE - Free Report ) and Control4 Corporation ( CTRL - Free Report ) , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nFor the current year, the consensus estimate for NVIDIA has increased 33.3% in the past 30 days. Estimates for Kimball Electronics and Control4 have gone up by 8.1% and 10%, respectively, over the same time frame.\nZacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit\nHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today’s most promising long-term stocks?

      "text": "Amazon avoided a holiday headache when a judge ordered striking cargo pilots back to work The pilots still aren’t happy. share Amazon Amazon averted a potential holiday nightmare when a judge ruled today that pilots who carry the online retailer’s cargo had to end a strike and return to work. Pilots at the cargo airline ABX Air, in whose parent company Amazon owns a stake, had been striking due to what they consider understaffing. The “staffing crisis,” they said, results in frequent “emergency” flight assignments to meet demand from customers like Amazon that pull them away from family. But a federal judge in Ohio ruled that the pilots, who are part of a union, have to settle the dispute with their employer through other means. \nCode Commerce Series is coming to SF on Dec. 6 \nDon't miss interviews with Jack Dorsey, Kate Hudson and Apple Pay Register Now An Amazon spokesperson said the online retailer had found workarounds during the strike. But a prolonged strike during Black Friday weekend could have caused further problems. Amazon has been taking more control over the movement of its packages once they leave its warehouses in an effort to cut costs over the long term and make sure it has the shipping capacity to meet demand when partners like UPS and FedEx don’t. In August, the company unveiled the first “Prime Air” Plane , one of 40 Amazon is leasing from ABX’s parent company and another cargo airliner over the next two years. recode_divider More From Recode",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nThe biggest shopping week of the year is here!\nAs usual, Amazon is leading the charge for the online e-commerce space with thousands of expected \"lightning\" deals. Not far behind are stores like Walmart and Target. They're ramping up their online deals in the hopes of giving The Everything Store a run for its money this holiday season.\nThat said, it's still difficult to compete with Amazon. The company has a seemingly endless stream of Black Friday deals being released on a staggered schedule from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, with new offers appearing as often as every five minutes.\nSince not all of these deals are created equal, the Insider Picks team is doing its best to separate the duds from the big-ticket items actually worth buying — so you don’t have to.\nIf you need some general holiday shopping help, we've put together a lot of holiday gift guides for specific products and categories. So if you're thinking about picking up a drone , a Bluetooth speaker ,  something for your favorite geek or iPhone lover,  or music lover , you're in luck. \nWe also have guides specifically to hit certain budgets, so if you're looking for a great tech gift for under $100,  or a great gift from  any  category for under $50, we have you covered.   \nOur guides even cover some good do's and don'ts for holiday shopping  and some good gift ideas for people who might be harder to shop for, like  your coworkers  or your father-in-law .  \nIf you're looking for the best deals right now , keep refreshing this page, we'll be making sure those deals are on this list. \nThis story is developing. Bookmark this page and stay tuned for Insider Pick's Black Friday coverage on November 25, 2016. \nAmazon Echo Amazon \nConsider Amazon’s Echo your smart personal assistant: It’s Alexa enabled, so it can do everything from relaying the weather forecast to playing your favorite tunes. Now, you can score $50 off this smart home essential.\n\n- List price: $179.99\n- Deal price:  $139.99 \n- You save: $40\n\nBUY IT HERE \n\n\nAmazon Echo Dot Amazon \nThe Echo Dot can be considered a miniature version of the Echo — capable of much of the same functionality that its big brother can handle at a significantly lower price point. The biggest difference is that you'll have to hook up your own speaker to it. That said, if you already have a solid speaker set up with Bluetooth connectivity, this is a no-brainer.\n\n- List price: $49.99\n- Deal price: $39.99 \n- You save: $10\n\nBUY IT HERE \n\n\nAmazon Tap Amazon \nThe Amazon Tap is a portable edition of the Alexa-enabled Amazon Echo. Similar capabilities, but more meant to act as a portable speaker than a living room centerpiece. No matter how you use it, it's a great value today.\n\n- List price: $129.99\n- Deal price: $89.99 \n- You save: $40\n\nBUY IT HERE \n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",
