      "text": "Twitter’s COO Adam Bain has resigned, reports New York Times . Bain’s responsibilities will be managed by the company’s CFO Anthony Noto who will also be the COO. According to the report, Twitter will be looking for a new CFO. The microblogging platform had also considered Bain for the CEO role, which ultimately Jack Dorsey, the company’s co-founder took up in October last year. Currently, it is unclear where Bain will join next.\nAfter 6 years and a once-in-a-lifetime run, I let Jack know that I am ready to change gears and do something new outside the company.\n— adam bain (@adambain) November 9, 2016 \n\nBain had joined Twitter in September 2010 as the president of global revenue and partnerships and was in the role for over 6 years. He was appointed as the chief operating officer in September last year and was given additional responsibilities including the revenue related products teams, the media team and the HR team on an interim basis in January this year when 5 of Twitter’s senior executives left the company . Prior to joining Twitter, Bain worked with Fox Interactive Media, Fox Sports, Los Angeles Times and Cleveland.com for a collective 15.5 years.\nTwitter India executive exits \nIn India, Parminder Singh , Twitter’s Managing Director for Southeast Asia, MENA and India, quit the company last week. Singh had joined Twitter in November 2013. In the same week, Rishi Jaitly, Twitter’s India head, quit the company. In July, Shailesh Rao, VP – Asia Pacific, Latin America & Emerging Markets at Twitter quit the company.\nLayoffs at Twitter \nLate last month, Twitter laid off 9% of its workforce mainly from sales, partnerships and marketing to de-prioritize certain initiatives. In September, Twitter also cut 20 jobs and shut down its Bangalore global engineering operations . The Bangalore engineering team was constituted following the company’s acquisition of ZipDial in February 2015. \n",

      "text": "By Greg Gutfeld \nPublished November 10, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com \nThis morning, two old rivals met. I heard it went well.\nBut you have to wonder: What did they really talk about? Did the president say, \"Dude, Obamacare: It's the only thing with my name on it. Please don't.\" And did President-elect Trump respond, \"Only if you show me your birth certificate.\"\nNow, yesterday Mr. Obama described the transition as a handoff in a relay race. So what's he really handing off? A country diminished abroad and divided within, plagued with internal tensions and anxiety about the future. He's handing President-elect Trump a 240-year-old fixer-upper.\nIt's OK, though. The good news: the new guy has help. The House. The Senate. Governors. Legislatures. And he has the American people, who elected him.\nYet last night we saw anti-Trump demonstrators protesting a fair election. Wouldn't it be nice if they protested the dozen countries that kill gays or beat women and not a democratically held election? Every immigrant in America who escaped real conflict laughs at these preening twerps. I'll bet my weight in Doritos that not one of these phonies protest places where people die trying to vote.\nYou're upset. Do you expect us to cancel the election because you're sad? OK, you win! Call up Hillary!\nSorry, it's too late.\nBottom line: President Obama and President-elect Trump got along. It might not have been easy, but it beats crying like a bunch of spoiled -- and soiled -- brats.\n\nGreg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET) .

      "text": "Tweet \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has been notably restrained since his general election victory, not making his presence known on social media with his usual signature lines and mostly dealing in platitudes. \nBut late Thursday, Trump couldn’t contain his feelings about the protesters who have taken to the streets objecting Trump’s presidency. He took to Twitter to vent about the situation. Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 \nTrump has been criticized in the past for allegedly priming his supporters for civil unrest by purporting that the system was “rigged.” The comment raises questions about how Trump will handle not being able to tweet as much personally if he is the president. \n[Mike Pence checks the 25th Amendment for how you take away the President’s Twitter] \n— Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) November 11, 2016",

According to The Local , the Popular Party want the measure included in its Citizens Security Law. The legislation, introduced last year, has been branded a 'gag law' amid claims it will mean curbs on public protests and online activism. Many of the memes were accompanied by the Twitter hashtag #SinMemesNoHayDemocracia meaning 'there is no democracy without memes' The legislation, introduced last year, has been branded a 'gag law' amid claims it will mean curbs on public protests and online activism Campaigners slammed the latest proposal calling it a threat to freedom of expression. Carlos Sánchez Almeida from the Platform in Defence of Freedom of Information is quoted by The Local as saying: 'If the intent is to pursue those who publish images without consent then an act as widespread as sharing political criticism in the form of memes becomes a risky activity.' However, there are already reports that the plan will fail to make it through Congress where the party does not have a majority. Spain took 10 months to establish a government after two inconclusive general elections and several unsuccessful attempts to form a coalition in a country where the traditional bi-party system was shattered by new political parties that rose to appeal to a recession-battered electorate. Rajoy (pictured) received parliamentary approval for a second term on October 29 thanks to the support of opposition newcomer Ciudadanos's 32 votes, but has the weakest mandate in Spain's modern history Rajoy received parliamentary approval for a second term on October 29 thanks to the support of opposition newcomer Ciudadanos's 32 votes, but has the weakest mandate in Spain's modern history. He is seven votes short of an absolute majority in the 350-strong Congress, meaning he must scrabble for approval from other opposition parties to push legislation through parliament. This is a far cry from Rajoy's previous term where he easily passed laws thanks to an absolute majority.",

      "text": "By Bill O'Reilly \nPublished November 11, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nAs we mentioned last night, the voters rebelled and Donald Trump won the presidency because of that rebellion. Just a few hours after the election was called though, some anti-Trump protesters took to the streets. Nothing major but the spectacle got intense in Oakland.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \n(CROWD SHOUTING) \n(INAUDIBLE) \n(BLEEP) \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What do we want?\n(INAUDIBLE) \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : When do we want it?\n(CROWD) : Now!\n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nO'REILLY : The main beef seems to be that left wing protesters don't respect an honest election. By the way, that's a hallmark around the world. Every communist and socialist takeover from Cuba to Venezuela to Soviet Russia back in the early 20th Century featured violence and assaults on freedom. Here in the U.S.A., we honor protests, but increasingly we are seeing people who want our system destroyed.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE : If we don't fight, who is going to fight for us? People had to die for the freedom we have today. We can't just do rallies. We have to fight back. There will be casualties on both sides. There will be because people have to die to make a change in this world. But Trump, enough with your racism. Stop splitting families. Don't split my family.\n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nO'REILLY : Now do I believe that woman wants to kill people? No, I don't. I think she is simply hysterical. But there are people, agitators who do want to hurt you. Who do not believe the way you do.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of us, especially, I think as young people, are really shocked and not okay with this decision, not okay with our system.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We're here to speak out. We're here to really create the revolution that we know is possible.\n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nO'REILLY: Now, that woman is a moron. The revolution is going the other way as we saw when almost 60 million Americans voted for Trump. A man with no political experience. That ballot box protest was peaceful. It's the way our republic works. No one was hurt. No one terrorized. No one killed. Unfortunately, our system is not being respected in many American public schools. More than 1,000 students walked out of Berkeley High School in California.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \n(PROTESTERS' CHANTING \"LOVE TRUMPS HATE!\", \"LOVE TRUMPS HATE!\", \"LOVE TRUMPS HATE!\", \"NOT OUR PRESIDENT!\", \"NOT OUR PRESIDENT!\", \"NOT OUR PRESIDENT!\") \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nO'REILLY: That's disgraceful. And in San Francisco, there is talk that the State of California should succeed from the union.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would love to see us become our own country in a wait a minute, you know, the republic of California because it's just -- it feels so surreal. It feels unreal.\n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nO'REILLY : That sounds like the south before the civil war, does it not? Finally, the race hustlers are very angry. Chief among them Al Sharpton who despises Donald Trump.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nAL SHARPTON, NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK : But he cannot say he did not run a campaign that has created a lot of racial fear and a lot of divisiveness. And he played to a crowd and he knew what he was playing for.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For sure.\nSHARPTON: I knew him. He knew exactly what he was doing, he was playing to the worse elements. We need to analyze, this man is going to be president. And all that many of us have fought for all our life is at stake. And we're not going down without a fight. Donald needs to know that.\n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nO'REILLY: So, what kind of fight, Al? Are you going to encourage violence like you've done in the past? Are you going to spout hatred, which is one of your trademarks? Are you going to divide Americans along racial lines, which has made you a fortune? I would like to see Al Sharpton run for office and we would find out what kind of constituency he really has not puppets at some cable network.\nAll right. On the racial front, talking points has analyzed the vote on Tuesday. We found that more than one million African-Americans stayed home as compared to 2012. The stats are these. There are about 15.6 million votes cast by blacks. In 2012, that number was 16.7 million. The effect was devastating on the Democrats as Trump won Wisconsin by just 27,000 votes. In Michigan he is ahead by only 12,000 votes and in Pennsylvania Trump won by 68,000 votes. Had Black Americans voted the same way they did in 2012, say hello to President Hillary Clinton.\nThe reason some African-Americans did not turn out is that a number of them simply don't trust Hillary Clinton. On the Donald Trump front, he got 13 percent of the Black male vote as opposed to Romney getting 11 percent in 2012. Black females supported Trump to the tune of four percent as opposed to three the last time around. So, Trump out performed Romney by three points among Black Americans.\nSumming up, Talking Points respects sincere protests. If you believe Donald Trump is not good for America, I have no problem with you displaying that opinion. However, if you hurt someone, destroy something, or promote anarchy, you then become a danger to the republic. That kind of stuff needs to be punished and quickly. Also, we are living in an amazingly destructive politically correct environment here in America. Just because something offends you doesn't mean you have the right to hurt or destroy.\nThe new president might want to make that very clear. And if you don't like it, Canada and Mexico are nearby. They might be happy to have you. Then again, they might not. And that's \"The Memo\".\n\nBill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET) , the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years.

      "text": "San Francisco-based Twitter declined to say how much it charged brands to be included in the livestream. Twitter Inc said it was able to deliver more viewers than promised to advertisers on a U.S. election night livestream, good news for the microblogging site as it tries to ward off growing competition for ad dollars from Snapchat and Instagram.\nTwitter partnered with BuzzFeed to host an election night broadcast on Tuesday and attracted major advertisers, including Paramount Pictures, Amazon.com Inc’s “Man in the High Castle,” Activision Blizzard Inc’s “Call of Duty,” Johnnie Walker and Izod.\nSan Francisco-based Twitter declined to say how much it charged brands to be included in the livestream, but said by email that it over delivered between two to three times on its live ad impressions that were guaranteed.\nVideo from advertisers fetches higher rates than text and photo-based ads and is seen as key revenue source for Twitter. Snapchat has been building up its ad sales team ahead of next year's IPO and Instagram will take a larger role in growing Facebook Inc's ad revenue.\nAt least one of the advertisers, PVH Corp’s Izod, is eager to work with Twitter more in the future. Izod ran a 60-second video featuring presidential debate sensation Ken Bone in his trademark red Izod sweater.\n“We’re going to look long and hard about increasing our presence there,” said Mike Kelly, executive vice president of the Marketing Group, PVH’s in-house agency. “We walked away a bit changed in our point of view.”\nTwitter handled the ad sales, and split half the revenue with BuzzFeed, according to a source familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe BuzzFeed broadcast began around 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) and ended sometime after midnight (0500 GMT), and was watched by a total of 6.8 million unique viewers. The average minute audience, the best metric to use when comparing to a TV audience, was 165,000 viewers globally. By comparison, Fox News drew an average minute audience of 12.2 million.\nThe over performance for advertisers came at a much-needed time for Twitter, which has staked its future on video. The company has made a point of getting advertisers to move toward video buys as a way of stemming its declining ad revenue growth.\nOn Wednesday, Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, a key figure in building Twitter's ad business, announced he was leaving the company in what was seen as a big blow. Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, who attended BuzzFeed's election night broadcast in New York, will replace Bain while still holding his current title until the company finds a new CFO.",

      "text": "People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo Thomson Reuters\n(Reuters) - Twitter, facing pressure for not doing enough to curb abusive behavior on its platform, said on Tuesday it would upgrade some features to better combat cyber-bullying.\nThe company said it would expand the \"mute\" option to allow users to block tweets based on keywords, phrases and the content of conversations from a user's notifications.\nThe \"mute\" option currently allows users to block tweets from accounts.\nThe change will be rolled out to all users in the coming days, Twitter said in a blog post. (http://bit.ly/2fVpQ6j)\nTwitter, which has struggled to strike a balance between free expression and blocking violent and hateful speech, has come under increasing criticism following complaints from users that they have been the target of abuse.\nIn July, Twitter permanently banned some user accounts for harassment after Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones left the site, saying she had faced severe harassment.\nTwitter said it would provide \"a more direct way\" for users to flag abusive content, but didn't give details.\nThe company also said it had improved internal controls to deal more effectively with abusive conduct reported by users.\n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar)\n Reuters .

      "text": "Twitter launches new tools to fight harassment By Selena Larson, CNN | Posted Nov 15th, 2016 @ 11:32am 0  \nSAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) — Harassment is the thorn in Twitter's side. It has stymied the platform's growth and continues to frustrate users. \nTo step up enforcement of hate speech, the company announced a new reporting tool and an improved mute feature on Tuesday. \nTwitter has played whack-a-mole with harassment for years, trying to balance free speech while determining exactly what line tweets shouldn't cross. Over the years, it's slowly improved reporting tools, and in February, the company established a council to advise Twitter on how to handle harassment. \nYet the company routinely fails to address ongoing harassment that very obviously threatens people. \nHate speech has always been against Twitter's rules, and people could report it for themselves or for other accounts. The new option will allow users to report hateful content separately and is meant to make it easier to report hate speech to Twitter. \nLast year, the company updated its policies to define hate speech, noting that language meant to \"harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence another user's voice\" is not allowed on the platform. \n\"Our hope is that by creating this option it will not only make it clearer to people that they can report this kind of content, but also make it clearer why they are reporting certain types of content,\" Del Harvey, Twitter's vice president of trust and safety, told CNNMoney. Want to stop getting notifications for Tweets that contain certain words, usernames, or hashtags? We're giving you that control. pic.twitter.com/awoNHUYbTG — Safety (@safety) November 15, 2016 \nThe new feature appears as a button in the reporting flow. Instead of saying something is \"abusive or harassing,\" it lets you mark tweets as hateful. Harvey said the new tool will improve how Twitter deals with reports from those who are not involved in the incident of harassment. \nBecause hate speech varies in language, culture and context, Twitter trained its global support teams about its historical and cultural implications of it. For instance, Twitter employees learned common tropes and phrases associated with anti-Semitism, and slang terms that are used to reference refugees or migrants, Harvey said. We're introducing a new way to mute notifications about conversations you want to step away from. Learn how. https://t.co/jhWKRu0cK1",

(AP) \nHAMBURG –   Several countries have placed import restrictions on German poultry following outbreaks of bird flu in the country, German authorities said on Wednesday.\nJapan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Bosnia and Herzegovina and South Africa have put import restrictions on German poultry and poultry products, the German state government of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said in a statement.\nEight European countries and Israel have found cases of the highly contagious H5N8 strain of bird flu in the past few weeks and some have ordered that poultry flocks be kept indoors to avoid the disease spreading.\nMost outbreaks have involved wild birds, but Germany, Hungary and Austria have also reported cases in domestic duck and turkey farms where all poultry had to be culled.\nMore outbreaks in Europe are likely in the next few weeks as wild birds believed to transmit the virus migrate south, the deputy head of the world animal health body said on Tuesday.\n\"An impact from the current bird flu incidents in Germany and other parts of Europe were to be expected,\" Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state agriculture minister Till Backhaus said in a statement.\nMore on this...

Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,\" the Republican real estate magnate wrote in a morning Twitter post, misspelling the word \"received.\" \n\"Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me,\" Trump continued. \nHe focused on the Times, a frequent Twitter target for Trump, because it said U.S. allies were \"scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump.\" \n\"The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition,\" he tweeted. \"It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.\" \nOn Tuesday night, Trump had defended his transition team amid reports the team is in disarray, behind schedule and marked by infighting. \n\"Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions,\" Trump said on Twitter. \"I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\" \nEntering Trump Tower in New York on Wednesday morning, Trump's son, Eric Trump, was asked by reporters if any positions would be named on Wednesday. He responded, \"Likely.\" \nTrump tweeting about contacts with foreign leaders on such a public forum drew immediate criticism, with conservative political commentator David Frum questioning the wisdom of such posts. \n\"Vladimir Putin reading Trump Twitter feed this AM. 'So Merkel has not yet called him? Hmm. That's useful to know,'\" Frum said on Twitter. \n\"When does President Trump compromise an important secret?\" \nLongtime Trump supporter U.S. Representative Chris Collins, the transition team's congressional liaison, brushed off the morning Twitter storm, saying Trump was under a lot of pressure and needed to blow off steam. \n\"If this is his way of relaxing, God bless him,\" Collins told CNN. \"You don't want this stuff all bottled up. \nDuring his campaign, Trump has attacked media reports he found unfavorable to him, often targeting the Times by referring to it as \"failing\" while regularly granting its reporters interviews. \nThe Times reported on Wednesday that the presidents of Egypt and Israel got through to Trump quickly but British Prime Minister Theresa May had to wait 24 hours before reaching him. \nSince his upset win over Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump also has talked with the leaders of other countries, including Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and Australia. \nHe spoke last week with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who on Thursday will be the first foreign leader Trump meets with as president-elect. \nTrump, whose aggressive use of Twitter reportedly led to calls for restraint from his inner circle, said in a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview broadcast on Sunday that he would be \"very restrained\" on Twitter as president, if he used it at all.

      "text": "Twitter is finally making good on its promise to bolster anti-harassment measures.\nOn Nov. 15, the site introduced improved tools for users to handle abuse, and also stepped up its against alt-right figureheads. The company temporarily banned several accounts associated with the alternative-right movement, comprised of those who believe “white identity” is under attack by multicultural forces , political correctness, and social-justice warriors. Such groups masterfully employ social media to spread their influence, and one of their poster children —Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News—has been named a senior adviser in Donald Trump’s administration.\nAmong the accounts shut down by Twitter are those run by Richard B. Spencer, Pax Dickinson, Paul Town , Ricky Vaughn , and the Radix Journal . Spencer is the president of white nationalist think tank the National Policy Institute , which is “dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of people of European descent in the United States.” He also runs “independent bookmaker” Washington Summit Publishers . Twitter accounts for both organizations were also suspended.\n“I am alive, physically, but digitally speaking, there has been execution squads across the alt-right,” Spencer said in a YouTube video published yesterday. “There is a great purge going on. They are purging people on the basis of their views.” The video is titled “A Knight of Long Knives,” the term used for Adolf Hitler’s 1934 killing of Nazi leaders.\n“ Twitter rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies,” a Twitter spokesperson said.\nThe platform’s hateful conduct policy bars users from attacking, threatening, or promoting violence against people on the basis of race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation; among other parameters. In July, the site “ permanently suspended ” Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos after he allegedly incited his followers to bombard Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones with racist and misogynistic tweets. Yiannopoulos had also used Twitter to call rape culture “a fantasy” and to mock students calling for safe spaces at universities, among other controversial statements .\nBut Twitter’s rules have made white nationalists a tricky group to handle: Discussions of “white genocide” (the notion that the white race is directly endangered by an increasingly diverse society) may border on bigotry and racism, but don’t always pose a threat or incite harm directly. Other extremist groups—black nationalist, antigovernment activists, anarchists, etc.—are likewise complicated to ban.\n“There is no one who will make the case for ISIS, but there are people who will make the case for various gradations of racist activity,” says J.M. Berger, an author and analyst studying extremism.\nThe latest measures come in the wake of an extreme uptick of people following nationalist and neo-Nazi accounts.\nOf course, combating sexist bullying , racism , and anti-semitism may not be Twitter’s only motive. Nothing wakes a tech startup up to its problems like losing potential bidders. ",

Jack Dorsey tweeted that a “mistake” had been made and blamed his company’s automated system for failing to flag the ad. “We did a retro and fixed!” he exclaimed.\nEarlier this week, Motherboard reported that white supremacists were using Promoted Tweets to further their message around hate. This certainly puts a bit of egg on Twitter’s face as it seeks to rebuilt confidence amongst users that it can properly defend them against harassment.\nWe made a mistake here and we apologize. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed! https://t.co/7gvycmzpsm \n— \nMusician and writer Ariana Lenarsky tweeted that she received an ad created from an account belonging to a neo-Nazi organization called New Order. Her discovery came hours after Twitter unveiled updates to its enforcement and privacy tools that it promised would come following the U.S. elections a week ago. Twitter has since removed and suspended the account and ad.\nHowever, it calls into question whether the company is up to the task of preventing future occurrences. Of course this could have been a one-off mistake, a glitch in the system if you will, but with a society filled with enormous hate right now, Twitter can’t afford to have these things take place. It has more to prove and should be doing better.\n",

By: Associated Press | New York | Published: November 17, 2016 4:15 AM The alt-right, short for ”alternative right,” is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It’s often associated with far right efforts to preserve ”white identity,” oppose multiculturalism and defend ”Western values.” (Reuters) \nTwitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called ”alt-right” in an apparent crack down on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. \nTwitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promise to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the internet. \nThe alt-right, short for ”alternative right,” is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It’s often associated with far right efforts to preserve ”white identity,” oppose multiculturalism and defend ”Western values.” \nThe movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right’s platform, joined Donald Trump’s campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. \nTHE ALT-RIGHT FEELS WRONGED \nRichard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. \nSpencer, who is credited with popularizing the term ”alt-right,” says he has never called for violence and hasn’t tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. \nWhile he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \n”This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,” he said. ”Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it’s also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber. \n”Twitter is not just some website. It’s a public space and we have to treat it that way.” \nPax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn’t given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur. \nDickinson says he’s appealed the suspension, but has yet to hear back from Twitter a day. Spencer says he doesn’t plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. \nThe Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Paul Town, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. \nBACKGROUND: ONLINE HARASSMENT \nOnline harassment has long been a problem for the internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it’s especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. \nActress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform. \nTwitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. \nPlease Wait while comments are loading...

Dave Wallis / The Forum 4 / 8 Kayla Delzer, a third-grade teacher in Mapleton, recently returned from San Francisco where she spoke at Twitter Headquarters about incorporating technology in the classroom. Dave Wallis / The Forum 5 / 8 Students write down what they saw when they used augmented and virtual reality software on their iPads. Dave Wallis / The Forum 6 / 8 Riley Miller moves his iPad in all directions as the Mapleton Elementary School third-grade class uses them to view different locations through augmented and virtual reality. In this class, the students could walk through a street scene in Paris or view the ocean floor as if they were scuba diving. Dave Wallis / The Forum 7 / 8 Third-grade students use iPads in their class Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, at Mapleton Elementary School. The students rotate to different stations several times during their class and work in a variety of settings in the classroom. Dave Wallis / The Forum 8 / 8 \nMAPLETON, N.D. — Students in Kayla Delzer's third-grade classroom here experienced a sunrise over Paris on Thursday, Nov. 10. The virtual field trip was possible thanks to an augmented-reality app they're beta-testing called Aug That. \nRyley Hanson sent Brad Waid, Aug That's augmented reality officer, a message about his experience. \n\"New AR, VR app @AUGTHAT ! Just trying it out. Awesome experience for me. Really Cool!!! @TechBradWaid by Ryley,\" he tweeted, along with a photo of Delzer and fellow students using the app. \nWaid later tweeted back a few words of appreciation and encouragement. \nThis was a pretty typical day for Delzer and her class. Students rotated between four work stations with their iPads. In addition to the Aug That creative writing assignment, they also wrote computer code, read books on Epic and provided constructive feedback on their classmate's digital portfolios through an app called Seesaw. \nDelzer is well-known for integrating technology and social media in the classroom. She writes about it in her blog, Top Dog Teaching, and is a frequent contributor at local and national professional development seminars. For a tech junkie, she hit the big time last month when she was asked to speak at a Digital Citizenship Summit at Twitter headquarters in San Francisco. \n\"Sixty-five percent of today's schoolchildren will be employed in jobs that have not yet been created,\" Delzer told the crowd of educators, administrators, industry professionals, parents and students. \"My job as a third-grade teacher now is completely different than what a third-grade teacher was doing 20 years ago. We're not now preparing students to be veterinarians or teachers or doctors. We are preparing kids for jobs that don't exist yet with technology that has not yet been created.\" \nAt the core of her speech was Delzer's belief in the importance of elevating her students' voices. \n\"My message was about how every student has a voice and it's our obligation or our job now to make sure that we're amplifying that voice and giving students a platform,\" she said. \"I always say students will do their worst work when it's only just for the teacher or an audience of one. So giving them that network of thousands of followers, they're going to do their best job.\" \nSummit organizer David Polgar said Delzer's speech resonated. \n\"Kayla's talk struck at the heart of the issue. We should be empowering students in order to maximize the benefits of social media and tech, not merely treat it as a danger. We have to be mindful of the risks while aiming to capture the rewards,\" he said. Digital citizenship \nDelzer takes digital citizenship very seriously. Her students are not allowed to use the class social media accounts until they have passed her Seven Levels of Digital Citizenship Bootcamp. \nOne of her lessons is about what private information is. Delzer said kids are rewarded for memorizing their address and telephone number and are often surprised those are the things they should never give out online. \n\"They don't know it's private information until you teach them that,\" Delzer said. \nDelzer also provides a social media bootcamp for parents. She shows them how to follow the class social media accounts in order to see what their children are learning. It's also a good way to open the dialogue between parents and students about the importance of good digital citizenship. \nDelzer tells parents, \"Ninety-three percent of employers are going to use social media to hire their employees, so if your student has a poor digital footprint or a neutral digital footprint, they're not going to be employed.\" The Essential 55 \nNot all of Delzer's lessons are technology-based. She also devotes a great deal of time to what is known as the Essential 55, based on a book written by education guru Ron Clark. \nStudent Ryley Goodman explained them as \"55 rules of how to be a better person.\" He said he demonstrated this week's lesson of Random Acts of Kindness by offering to loan his iPad to a fellow student while his was getting fixed. \n\"I tell kids I don't care how smart you are, if you're not a kind, good human, that doesn't matter,\" Delzer said. \"It's something we work and work and work so hard on.\" Online",

      "text": "By Chris Chase \nPublished November 21, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print East Rutherford, MA--11/22/2012 New England Patriots (l to r) Tom Brady, Steve Gregory, and Vince Wilfork join television broadcaster Michele Tafoya eating turkey legs after defeating the New York Jets 49-19 at Metlife Stadium on Thursday November 22 2012. (Matthew J. Lee/Globe staff) Topic: Jets-Patriots Reporter: Young \nThere's never been a more legitimate reason to ignore your in-laws.\nThanks to some keen scheduling and some fortuitous bounces of the ball through the first 11 weeks of the year, this Thanksgiving marks the first time since 1993 and only the second time in the past 39 seasons, that every team in action on turkey day enters the day with a record of .500 or better. It's all the more impressive when you consider that up until 2006 there were just two games played on Thanksgiving as opposed to the three we have now. (With a three-game slate, it's theoretically 50% harder to get such a great down-the-line schedule).\n12:30 p.m. ET (CBS): Minnesota Vikings (6-4) at Detroit Lions (6-4) \nMore from FoxSports Giants are on a roll, but still taking it one game at a time The Green Bay Packers are popular, but are they actually an elite NFL franchise? | THE HERD Dak Prescott impressed Colin Cowhed by picking up after himself - find out why | THE HERD Shannon Sharpe does not hold back talking about Packers QB Aaron Rodgers | UNDISPUTED This is usually the dreaded Lions time slot that involves a halfway-decent team looking like a Super Bowl favorite in routing a pathetic Detroit team, thus leading to conversations around your dinner table about the NFL should totally snatch the game from the Lions because they're so terrible. This year, though, Detroit and Minnesota are tied atop the NFC North and playing for sole possession of first place. A Lions win is like a win-and-a-half, as they'd sweep the season series against Minnesota and take any potential tiebreaker.\n4:30 p.m. ET (Fox): Washington Redskins (6-3-1) at Dallas Cowboys (9-1) \nThe game of the day (which after looking at decades of historical Thanksgiving duds isn't always a compliment). It's the classic \"show me what you've got game\" between a team moving the delicate balance between contender and pretender and the Washington Redskins. The Cowboys will be the considerable favorite, as they should be, but when these two teams met earlier this year in Week 2, the game was decided by a couple of ill-advised goal-line play calls by the Redskins (live by the fade, die a painful, painful death by the fade) and ended with a 27-23 Dallas win. (With their Week 1 loss to the Giants, the Cowboys were on the cusp of an 0-2 start.) Is Kirk Cousins legit? Is Dak Prescott? This the second big test of the year for the 'Boys. They won an instant classic against the Steelers last week to show they're for real. A Thursday win would show the Super Bowl buzz is right.\n8:30 p.m. ET (NBC): Pittsburgh Steelers (5-5) at Indianapolis Colts (5-5) \nThank goodness for the Browns and the Titans. A week ago, this primetime game was looking like a possible post-dinner dud. But after both the Steelers and Colts took fairly easy wins on Sunday (every Thanksgiving team won on the Sunday before the holiday games, the first time that's happened since 2011), this becomes a crucial game for both, with Pittsburgh looking to jump ahead of the Ravens for first place in the North while the Colts try to hang on in both the South and the wild-card race. Even if this game lays an egg, there's still reason to watch, just in case Mike Tomlin tries to play footsie with a Colts returner Jordan Todman.",

      "text": "By Dan Graf \nPublished November 21, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The last time Adrian Peterson suffered a major knee injury, he came back in record time and ended up leading the NFL in rushing and winning the league MVP award in 2012.\nNeither of those achievements is likely as Peterson recovers from surgery to repair torn meniscus following a Week 2 injury against the Packers, but the 31-year-old, seven-time Pro Bowl selection reportedly is on track to get back on the field in mid- to late December, according to ESPN .\nPeterson reportedly could start running this week, and if he keeps progressing possible return dates are Dec. 18 vs. Indianapolis and Dec. 24 at Green Bay. Peterson led the NFL with 1,485 rushing yards in 2015 but this season was off to the slowest start of his career before the injury. He had 31 carries for 50 yards and no touchdowns in 6 &frac12; quarters when he went down against the Packers.\nMore from FoxSports Jared Goff's first NFL start by the numbers Drew Bledsoe explains what Tony Romo is feeling as a backup to Dak Prescott in Dallas | THE HERD Herd Hierarchy: Colin's Top 10 NFL Teams after Week 11 | THE HERD Giants are on a roll, but still taking it one game at a time Still, he could be the offensive difference-maker the Vikings have been looking for as they've fallen from a 5-0 start to 6-4, and his teammates know better than to doubt him.\n\"He's a workaholic,\" cornerback Captain Munnerlyn said Monday, via ESPN. \"I definitely wouldn't put anything past this guy. He's a fast healer. His makeup is definitely a fighter. We'll see. I think [he'll be back], but at the same time, you never know. That's a tough injury to come back from. He's got to think about his career, but he's a guy that wants to come out there and help the team win. One thing is on his mind: He wants to win that Super Bowl. So he feels like if he can come back and definitely contribute to us winning, he definitely will do it.\"",

(REUTERS/Mike Blake) \nWhen Troy Aikman retired from the National Football League after 12 seasons as the Dallas Cowboys’ quarterback, he was determined to keep training as hard as ever, out of fear he’d become an “overweight retired guy,” he says.\nMr. Aikman, the NFL’s No. 1 overall draft pick in 1989 and a Pro Football Hall of Famer, led the Cowboys to three Super Bowl titles. Back pain eventually ended his career in 2001.\n“I’ve never not worked out,” says Mr. Aikman, now a television commentator and lead analyst for NFL on Fox. (Fox owner 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal owner News Corp share common ownership.)\nBecause his initial back injury occurred while he was doing squats, Mr. Aikman had always concentrated on running, lifting light weights twice a week and avoiding intense lower-body exercises. For the past decade, he has worked with Dallas-based personal trainer Jason Harnden.\nMore on this... Astronauts' back pain has surprising cause",

      "text": "Nov 22, 2016 Microblogging services such as Twitter have been widely adopted due to the highly social nature of interactions they have facilitated. With the rich information generated by users on these services, user modeling aims to acquire knowledge about a user's interests, which is a fundamental step towards personalization as well as recommendations. To this end, researchers have explored di erent dimensions such as (1) Interest Representation, (2) Content Enrichment, (3) Temporal Dynamics of user interests, and (4) Interest Propagation using semantic information from a knowledge base such as DBpedia. However, those dimensions of user modeling have largely been studied separately, and there is a lack of research on the synergetic e ect of those dimensions for user modeling. In this paper, we address this research gap by investigating 16 diff erent user modeling strategies produced by various combinations of those dimensions. Di erent user modeling strategies are evaluated in the context of a personalized link recommender system on Twitter. Results show that Interest Representation and Content Enrichment play crucial roles in user modeling, followed by Temporal Dynamics. The user mod- eling strategy considering Interest Representation, Content Enrichment and Temporal Dynamics provides the best performance among the 16 strategies. On the other hand, Interest Propagation has little e ect on user modeling in the case of leveraging a rich Interest Representation or considering Content Enrichment. ...",

      "text": "Twitter will expand and accelerate efforts to punish companies that employ its data for surveillance or other activities that violate its terms of service, the social network announced on Tuesday.\nThe announcement, which came in a blog post , comes at a time when Twitter has been facing major scrutiny over how third party data companies use its so-called “firehose,” the massive stream of real time data generated by its users.\nIn October, for instance, the ACLU and Bloomberg reported about how companies like Geofeedia and Snaptrends have marketed social media monitoring tools to police departments and to authoritarian regimes. Those tools can draw on location signals and other data, drawn from Twitter and other social networks like Facebook, to identify protestors and dissidents.\nTwitter responded to the recent controversy by cutting off firehose access to some of those companies, effectively killing a big part of their business model. (This week, Geofeedia reportedly laid off half its staff due to loss of access to Twitter and Facebook data).\nAnd in its Tuesday blog post, the company suggested it will do more to investigate and ensure compliance with its anti-surveillance policies. The post refers to use of APIs and Gnip, which are tools that companies can use to extract data from Twitter:\nUsing Twitter’s Public APIs or data products to track or profile protesters and activists is absolutely unacceptable and prohibited. […]\nWe have an internal process to review use cases for Gnip data products when new developers are onboarded and, where appropriate, we may reject all or part of a requested use case. Over the coming months, you’ll see us take on expanded enforcement and compliance efforts, including adding more resources for swiftly investigating and acting on complaints about the misuse of Twitter’s Public APIs and Gnip data products.\nThe blog post also stated that the recent stories about surveillance had caused the company “great concern,” and described social justice as a long-standing and core part of Twitter’s mission.\nThe post is likely to reassure Twitter users and civil liberties groups who are concerned about the use of social media as a surveillance tool. But the post also did not address recent news that the FBI has retained Dataminr, an analytics firm in which Twitter has a 5% stake, to monitor tweets and other social media data.\nIn response to a query from Fortune about the FBI-Datminr contract, a Twitter spokesperson offered the following explanation:\n“A narrowly tailored news alert product is available to some first responders, like the FBI. Our position on surveillance use cases is clear and those use cases are strictly prohibited.”\nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com . Copyright 2016 \n",

      "text": "Jack's back -- kind of.\nPhoto by Claire Reilly/CNET The Twitter account for Jack Dorsey, the social media company's co-founder and CEO, vanished briefly Wednesday night before reappearing with significantly fewer followers than before.\nAttempts to visit Dorsey's account around 6 p.m. yielded a standard message indicating his account had been suspended. About 15 minutes later, the account mysteriously reappeared, but instead of the more than 4 million followers Dorsey previously had, his number of followers was pared-down to a very modest 142.\nIt wasn't immediately clear what caused the vanishing act or the downsize in followers. Twitter representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIt's been a rough year for Twitter. Rumors swirled for weeks that Google, Salesforce, Disney and Apple were interested in buying the financially troubled social network, but nothing came of it.\nTwitter has struggled to expand its user base, even as it adds features such as livestreams of political debates and sports games . On top of that, the San Francisco-based company announced last month it would cut up to 9 percent of its work force.\nBut if Dorsey's followers thought things were over for the exec, they were quickly reassured.\n\"Just setting up my twttr...again (account suspension was an internal mistake),\" he wrote in a tweet, less than an hour after his account was suspended.\nThere's no indication what that internal mistake was, though no doubt Dorsey was eager to reassure his followers he hadn't been hacked.\nEither way, it's clear that when the boss of a social media company goes offline, things get sorted pretty darn quickly.\nUpdated at 9:10 p.m. PT to include tweet from Jack Dorsey.\n ",

      "text": "Also today: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey gets his Twitter account suspended, and the chaos of Black Friday approacheth so check out our tech buyer's guide. More Subscribe on YouTube\nTry quitting it and reopening it, Jack\nYou know that terrible feeling you get when you lock your keys in your car, or in your house? Yeah, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey knows that feeling, too. In what has to be one of the more ironic tech micro-tragedies, Dorsey’s Twitter account was suspended Tuesday .\nAfter what must have been some yelling down the halls at Twitter HQ, Dorsey was able to get the account back online, and posted up a copy of his very first tweet from 2006, albeit with a small edit saying the suspension was an “internal mistake.”\nWhat price access?\nFacebook is getting some heat after they apparently developed a censorship tool for use by governments that like to control what people might see… on Facebook.\nBut analysts –and critics – think CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has learned to speak Mandarin and is reportedly on good terms with Chinese president Xi JinPing, likely signed off on development of the content monitoring tool to help re-enter the Chinese social media market, where Facebook has been banned since 2009. The New York times says the tool is not operated by Facebook, but is instead wielded by whatever government it’s handed over to.\nBack in July, when Zuckerberg faced criticism over the possibility of creating just such a censorship tool, he said that while he didn’t want to do it, he did want Facebook to at least get a toehold in the 1.4 billion person Chinese market, even if that meant having to tolerate some form of censorship. Time will tell if it’s enough for the Chinese overlords to allow Facebook back inside the great firewall.\nShop ’til you drop? Just don’t drop that TV…\nLike we said at the top of the big show, it’s November 23 rd , which mean Black Friday is just two days away, and once again this year, tech toys from TVs to drones to adorable little robot frontloaders will be in high demand.

      "text": "Twitter \nNow that the dust has settled over Twitter’s decision to shutter Vine Twitter Is Killing Vine, Letting Instagram Win Twitter Is Killing Vine, Letting Instagram Win Twitter is killing Vine, with the social media company shuttering the short-form video-sharing service for unknown reasons. Rest in Peace. Read More , it’s time to start thinking about where Vine users are going to end up once the service shuts down. It’s still not clear when Vine is actually going to halt operations, and rumors of a potential buyer may save the service, but in the meantime, it would be wise to save all your videos, and think about where you want to go next. \nThe first thing you’re probably going to want to do is save your Vine videos How To Save Vine Videos For Offline Viewing How To Save Vine Videos For Offline Viewing Twitter set a six-second limit on videos uploaded to Vine. It won't even take you that long to download Vine videos. Read More . There are several ways to do this. How to Batch Save Your Vine Videos \nTo batch save your Vine videos, you’re likely going to have to import them into another online platform. That is unless Twitter decides to give users that option. Giphy — You can save your Vine videos by converting them to GIFs How to Back Up Your Vine Videos (By Converting Them to GIFs) How to Back Up Your Vine Videos (By Converting Them to GIFs) Vine is shutting down. If you have a bunch of videos that you want to save, you can do so by converting them to GIFs using this easy process. Read More using Giphy. This is by no means a perfect solution. The audio from your video is saved separately as your Vine video essentially becomes an audio-less GIF. The process is, however, a simple one where you can import all of your Vine videos at the click of a button. Coub — Coub is offering Vine users the ability to import not only all their videos, but their likes and followers as well. Essentially, Coub is attempting to snap up all of Vine’s users. As Coub points out, the more people who migrate from Vine to Coub, the more of the original community will be saved. Go to coub.com/vine to start the process. More information on how Coub compares to Vine can be found later in this article. How to Save Your Vines One at a Time \nWhile options for batch saving your Vines are few and far between, there are plenty of ways to save your videos one by one. Save to Your Computer — It’s old school and it’s slow, but one way you can selectively save the Vine videos of your choice is to open up your Vine account in a browser, right-click the video you want to save, and choose Save Video As . You can then choose where to save the video on your computer. (It will save the video to your computer as an mp4 file.) QQ — If you want more control over the quality of your video, add qq to the beginning of the url. For example, if your Vine video is at this address (https://vine.co/v/bv9dvKvDIBX) you would put (https://qqvine.co/v/bv9dvKvDIBX) in your browser. You can then choose from two high quality and one low quality files to download. VineDownloader — Sites like VineDownloader and Vine Video Download also make it easy (but tedious) to download your vines. Paste the URL of your vine into the service and they will generate a download button. Save to Your Phone — If you would prefer to save the Vines to your phone, iOS users can buy the $2.99 app Video Downloader for Vine for unlimited downloads, and Android users can opt for vGrab . \nNow that you know how you can save your Vine videos, here’s where you can go in the future instead.

Read More can be anywhere from 3 to 60 seconds long, so if you want to stay true to your original Vine style, you can always choose to limit yourself to the six seconds that you’re used to. On Instagram, however, you can take advantage of a feature that didn’t exist on Vine — adding filters to your videos. A video posted by Samuel Grubbs (@samuelgrubbs1) on Sep 29, 2016 at 3:13pm PDT \nInstagram is one of the most viable alternatives to Vine because of its already existing and active user base, and because, like Vine, it operates primarily as a social media network rather than just a vehicle to post video content. Vine users might also like Instagram’s app Boomerang (available for iOS and Android ) which you can use to create looping videos out of 10 photos.

You have to sign up for a Coub account first after which you can begin the process. The Coub interface looks a lot like an older version of Twitter. \nCoub users can upload looped videos that are up to 10 seconds long. The videos can be uploaded directly through your browser, can be filmed using a webcam, or you can even paste a link from online videos on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, and more. You can make edits to the video through the Coub interface, add music to your video, and add hashtags to your post so that other users can easily find your videos. \nTo find out more about how Coub works, check out the video below: \nCoub is as strong a contender as Instagram for Vine users looking for a new home.

      "text": "We have defended Twitter over the last year. \nWe have put up with the company not putting shareholders first. \nWith Anthony Noto's raise, a lack of sense of urgency from the company and increasing competitive pressure, we're starting to get frustrated. \nBy Scott Tzu \nIt wasn't just a couple of weeks ago that we wrote an article essentially defending Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) after Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain decided he was going to resign and move on. Twitter is almost already making us regret defending it because days later it has come out that the company issued a significant raise for Anthony Noto, who will be playing the role of both COO and CFO at the company. We're not amused, and in this article, we're going to talk about why. \nIt certainly is an interesting dynamic when you think of it, isn't it? Here is a company that has a CEO who is splitting his time between two companies. Then, You have a CFO who up until this point has done a pretty good job, who will now be splitting his time with taking on the role of COO as well. We don't think it is a bad idea for Noto to take on the role of COO in an interim fashion, but keeping him there with such permanence that would be a prompt to give him a substantial raise alarms us for a couple of reasons. \nBusiness Insider reported , \nTwitter's Anthony Noto is getting a hefty stock package worth up to $12 million per year to take on a larger role as Chief Operating Officer of the struggling internet company. The former Goldman Sachs investment banker and ex-Army Ranger is receiving a total of 940,000 restricted stock units and 325,000 performance-based restricted stock units as part of his new pay package. The package has a \"total compensation target\" of $12 million per year, Twitter said.\n\"Anthony's executive compensation package reflects his increased role and responsibilities as COO and was designed with the assistance of an independent outside consultant to align with the interests of our shareholders, incentivize growth and value creation, and be competitive with peer and industrywide practices,\" a Twitter spokeswoman said. \n\"His compensation includes a mixture of restricted and performance-based stock options, which only grant upon certain financial and operational performance metrics,\" she added. \"Approximately 96 percent of Anthony's compensation is in stock, which underscores Anthony's alignment with shareholders and commitment to generating enhanced value.\" \nOur first concern is that Noto really comes from an investment banking background and not a background in technology. The thought that he is going to be affecting change and vision for a social media company with his resume doesn't sit well with us. We certainly think that Noto is a pragmatic thinker and likely a very smart guy, but he wouldn't necessarily be our first choice for COO of a struggling social media company. \nThe second reason this is alarming is because Twitter is notorious for overdoing it with share-based compensation. We wrote an article about this weeks ago , where we stated, \nIn Twitter's case, it doesn't matter what stage of life the company is in, we can agree that spending 28% of revenue on stock-based compensation on a consistent basis is not a prudent strategy to bring a company to profitability, even if its non-cash. \nTwitter not only needs to lay off more of its staff but it needs to get this line item in check with the staff that remain on board. The company is no longer a brand-new start up that is trying to have a grassroots campaign where everybody in the world that works for them gets egregious amounts of stock. It is time to turn off the gravy train, as Twitter now owes it to its shareholders to try and get its financials in order post haste. \nThe fact that Noto is going to be compensated so handsomely through share issuance alarms us and should also create some downward pressure on the stock at points. \nIt shouldn't be about Noto getting a raise, it should be about instilling a sense of urgency to get a new, effective COO in place. \nWhy does it feel like the company is focusing on taking care of its insiders first and it shareholders last? We have felt this way since Jack Dorsey was appointed as CEO. What is the point of Dick Costolo stepping down if the company is going to go out and perform a CEO search that yields one result, and that result is a guy who is already the CEO of another public company? This is clearly putting the interests of the board and the interests of management ahead of the interests of shareholders. We can't help but feel like the raise that Mr. Noto is getting and the company's willingness to not really seem to care that they don't have a proper COO in place is just more of the same attitude. \nWe have been writing about Twitter and defending Twitter for the last year. We actually think that they are onto something with their new initiative in streaming content. We have seen it in the numbers, as declines in active users have plateaued. We have seen it throughout the course of the election and we have seen it play a role in the campaigns leading up to the election. \nSports and news are great value creators for this company going forward. Streaming content is going to be a great way for Twitter to help monetize. Creating a social dialogue around streaming video is going to be the next big thing. YouTube is already implementing these types of live chat features on streaming video and now Amazon wants to also get into the game of streaming sporting content, as it was reported last week. \nThe stakes have never been higher for Twitter, and by proxy, Twitter's shareholders. They are at a serious inflection point now that they absolutely need to capitalize on. It is at this point that we should be seeing laser focus from all executives at the company who should be committed to not only doing the right thing for shareholders but making sure that every action they take doesn't even give the suggestion of impropriety. What we believe we have seen is the exact opposite. More pay bonuses, more share-based compensation, no sense of urgency in filling the COO spot and more complacency is simply just more of the same that we have seen from this company over the last three years. \nWhile we believe that Twitter remains a valuable commodity and we do believe that they will eventually get an offer, this type of behavior has us the most critical of the company we have been in years. We remain cautiously optimistic about the company but we will continue to have a steady eye on the way this management team and this Board of Directors conduct themselves going forward. \nThese guys have a fantastic technology and an incredible opportunity to do something enormous not only for themselves, but for the shareholders. They just don't seem to have a sense of urgency or a sense of care for their shareholders. This is why people are frustrated with Twitter. \nWe currently have no position but may stake a new long position at any time. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TWTR over the next 72 hours.    ",

By choosing to master Twitter, she has burnished her star power, boosted her brand and touched lives. In short, she stayed relevant.\nIn an era of disruption, technological advances, new workplace trends and constantly emerging communication styles, everyone needs to follow Cher's example: Embrace change to stay relevant and effective.\nToday, \"relevant\" means current and connected with what's happening in your industry and the world. Doing so helps workers remain employable, relate to younger customers, influence the next generation and protect their careers. And it helps business leaders make better decisions.\nFail to stay relevant, and you become stale — as a person, leader, employee or organization.\nStaying relevant involves more than just keeping abreast of current events or being aware of the changes around you. \"Relevance is taking action to make sure you matter to your organization, your customers, your clients and your teams,\" according to California-based management consultant Ross Shafer.\nIn fact, most workers are probably aware they need to evolve. In an online survey of 1,600 adults released in October, Illinois-based Pearson Embanet, a global learning company, found 72 per cent of respondents said more education was needed to keep up with advances in their field and 69 per cent of respondents said technology would significantly transform their job within the next five years.\nSo in the quest to \"stay relevant\" on the job, how do you begin?\nThe first step: Assess whether you have the tech skills you'll need. And look at what colleagues and competitors are doing: What emerging technology are they adopting? Learn these tools, and become comfortable with them. There are efficiencies to be gained in the workplace by adopting new apps, software, platforms and devices. They can keep businesses and professional lives running more smoothly.\nPeople are embracing the process of ongoing learning by experimenting, watching online tutorials, subscribing to newsletters, participating in webinars and certification programs, going back to school and asking younger employees for help. As designer Tory Burch says, \"It's important to be intellectually curious and always learning. Look at what companies and leaders that you admire are doing. How can you learn from them?\"\nLiza Walton, 42, principal at Miami Social Marketing, says she often learns tech skills from her young staff. When she recently had a problem with the newest software update for her iPhone, she resisted giving into frustration and asked young staff members for a tech tutorial. \"People tend to lose out if they are not willing to ask someone to show them how.\"\nOf course, the constant emergence of new social media platforms can seem overwhelming, even scary for someone less adept at technology. But Walton says that's not an excuse for not trying to keep up: \"You should have an idea of what is part of the national 'conscious,' where people are getting information and how they are living their lives. If millions of people are using a platform, you should have some knowledge of it.\"\nMiami human resources consultant Sharlyn Lauby says it's easy to dismiss learning opportunities because of a lack of time or work-life balance. However, she has conquered new social media outlets such as LinkedIn by starting small and finding friends to help her along. She tries one new thing on the site every day and aims to become comfortable on it after 30 days. \"You don't have to be a super user in a week. We create opportunities to overwhelm ourselves and it doesn't need to be that way,\" says Lauby, founder of HR Bartender, an HR management and consulting firm.\nOnce comfortable, Lauby leverages the social media channel to discover trends, industry news and follow thought leaders in her industry. She also complements what she garners from social media with information from podcasts, blogs and email newsletters.\nAnother way to stay relevant: Improve your ability to listen.\nIn general, listening skills suffer as people get older, according to Ralph G. Nichols, a retired University of Minnesota professor and author of \"Are You Listening?\" But, of course, language and social trends change all the time. Today, it's not enough to simply rely on what you already know. Ask the young people in your life open-ended questions — and listen carefully to the answers.\nDave Armstrong, president of Broward College in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 60, says listening well keeps both him and his college relevant — in touch with students, faculty and the wider world. Instead of leading staff meetings, he lets others take over so he can listen to his diverse team. Instead of just posting on social media, he listens to what his students are saying. And when he is out in the community, he absorbs what employers are talking about. His ability to listen, he says, has led to new courses, degrees and programs such as EMT-paramedic certification to be offered at his college. \"I believe in challenging myself to be up on emerging trends and open to change,\" he says.\nWalton of Miami Social Marketing also says she has learned a lot from listening. By tuning into what her young employees are saying, she has learned the newest hashtags and useful apps, for instance, and how to better communicate through direct messages and texts. Walton says this skill has helped her stay relevant — which, in turn, has made her a better employer and more aware of how her employees want to work.\nPeople of all ages are realizing that staying current in communication style can make a difference in collaborating with team members, building relationships and reaching customers. Just as grandparents are learning their grandchildren respond best to text messages, for instance, business owners are finding that their customers communicate on social media channels. As a grad student, I recently completed a four-week project with a 22-year-old classmate. When she failed to answer my phone calls, I did it her way — through email, text messages and online collaboration tools.\nMiami-area financial adviser Karen Roberts of Emerald Financial Group recently converted her written newsletters to video newsletters after research showed her customers preferred it. \"We send out a two-minute video once a month about here's what is happening at our group.\" Roberts, 51, says she and her assistant tried various video-sharing tools until they found one they could manage: \"I'm not that old that I can't change with the times. My goal is to be relevant forever.\"\nKeeping your network active also helps with staying relevant and can be done by joining alumni groups on LinkedIn, attending professional conferences and participating in online discussions.\nCher might agree with what Armstrong says: \"The more you spend time with a diverse group of people, the more you are continually learning. And the more you force yourself outside your bubble, the more relevant you become.\"\nMiami Herald",

      "title": "How to use hashtags on different social media",
      "text": "Ever since Twitter's introduction of hashtags to the social media in 2007, the formerly-known-as-pound symbol has been the source of much confusion in the marketing world. For example, how many hashtags do you use? How long should your hashtags be?\nTo address this issue, a new study by TrackMaven recently analysed 65,000 posts across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, to find the optimal length and number of hashtags for each social media network to drive engagement, according to wersm. One of the important takeaways: not all hashtag strategies work the same on every social media network.\nFacebook: One hashtag works best Contrary to accounts on Twitter and Instagram which are mostly public, those on Facebook are private by default. This means Facebook's hashtag has more limitation on content discovery than the others. However, results indicated that the more hashtags were added to the post, the less engagements the post could give.\n\nAs for the length of the hashtag, 6 characters is seemingly the best hashtag length, but no pattern was found up to 20 characters. The study advised hashtags not to exceed 20 characters, as it takes too much effort for users to engage with.\n\nTwitter: Users start overlooking hashtags Same as Facebook, tweets with one hashtag work best, although using two hashtags per post does not affect engagement as much as on Facebook. The study did not recognise any patterns of the length of a hashtag.\n\n\nHowever, the study pointed out that users are increasingly overlooking hashtags in recent months, as there have been a number of spammers who take advantage of hashtags to share garbage content.\nInstagram: Nine hashtags provide the most engagement Hashtags on Instagram are powerful in boosting organic reach, because the vast majority of Instagram profiles are public. Nine hashtags on a post provide the most engagement on Instagram.\n\nAs for the length, hashtags between 21 and 24 characters averaged the best performance.\n",

      "text": "Buy a cartoon The pickets were met with an immediate backlash from the community, but Phelps was not deterred. He had been a committed civil-rights attorney in the nineteen-sixties and seventies, one of the few lawyers to represent black Kansans in discrimination suits, before the state disbarred him, in 1979, for harassing a court reporter who failed to have a transcript ready in time. Now Westboro targeted local churches, politicians, businesses, journalists, and anyone else who criticized Phelps’s crusade. Throughout the nineties, Westboro members crisscrossed the country, protesting the funerals of AIDS victims and gay-pride parades. They picketed the funeral of Matthew Shepard, the gay man whose murder, in what was widely believed to be a hate crime, became a rallying cry for gay-rights activists. They picketed high schools, concerts, conferences, and film festivals, no matter how tenuous the connection to homosexuality or other sins. “Eventually, the targets broadened such that everyone was a target,” Phelps-Roper said. Phelps-Roper enjoyed picketing. When the targets were within driving distance, the group packed into a minivan and her grandfather saw them off from his driveway. “At five in the morning, he’d come out and give us all hugs,” she said. When they flew, she and Libby recounted “Saturday Night Live” skits. Amazing things happened on the trips. In New Orleans, they ran into Ehud Barak, the former Israeli Prime Minister, and serenaded him with an anti-Semitic parody of Israel’s national anthem. Phelps-Roper learned to hold two signs in each hand, a technique that Westboro members called the Butterfly. Her favorite slogans were “ God is your enemy No Peace for the Wicked ,” “,” and “ Mourn for your sins .” She laughed and sang and smiled in the face of angry crowds. “If you were ever upset or even scared, you do not show it, because this is not the time or the place,” she said. Phelps-Roper believed that she was engaged in a profound act of love. Leviticus 19:17 commands, “Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.” “When you see someone is backing into traffic, you yell at them,” Phelps-Roper said. “You don’t mope around and say it’s such a good idea.” One of the most common questions she was asked on the picket line was why she hated gay people so much. She didn’t hate gay people, she would reply, God hated gay people. And the rest of the world hated them, too, by cheering them on as they doomed themselves to Hell. “We love these fags more than anyone,” she would say. In the summer of 2005, Westboro began protesting the funerals of soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, holding signs like “ Thank God for IEDs .” “They turned the country over to the fags—they’re coming home in body bags!” Fred Phelps would say. He believed that 9/11 was God’s punishment for America’s embrace of homosexuality, but that, instead of repenting, Americans had drowned this warning in a flood of patriotism. Phelps believed that God had killed the soldiers to warn a doomed America, and that it was the church’s job to make this fact explicit for the mourners. The scale of the picketing increased dramatically. One of Phelps-Roper’s aunts checked the Department of Defense Web site every day for notifications of casualties. The outrage sparked by the soldier-funeral protests dwarfed anything that Phelps-Roper had experienced previously. Crowds of rowdy, sometimes violent counterprotesters tried to block their signs with huge American flags. A group of motorcyclists called the Patriot Guard Riders eventually began to follow Westboro members around the country, revving their engines to drown out their singing. Phelps-Roper picketed her first military funeral in July, 2005, in Omaha. She was nineteen years old and a sophomore at Washburn University, a secular public college in Topeka, where many Westboro children went. The Westboro members stood across the street from the church, in a quiet neighborhood in South Omaha, as the mourners filed in. “Everybody’s in close quarters, and marines in dress blues are just staring at us with—the word that comes to mind is hateful ‘disgust.’ Like ‘How could you possibly do this?’ ” Phelps-Roper said. But, before the picket, she asked her mother to walk her through the Bible passages that justified their actions. “I’m, like, O.K., it’s there,” she said. “This is right.” She added, “This was the only hope for mankind, and I was so grateful to be part of this ministry.” In September, 2009, when Phelps-Roper began to use Twitter in earnest, Westboro was preparing for the end of the world. Fred Phelps had preached for years that the end was near, but his sermons grew more dire after Barack Obama’s election in 2008. Phelps believed that Obama was the Antichrist, and that his Presidency signalled the beginning of the Apocalypse. The sense of looming calamity was heightened by a multimillion-dollar judgment against the church that had been awarded, in 2007, to Albert Snyder, who sued Westboro after it picketed the funeral of his son Matt, a U.S. marine killed in Iraq. Westboro members drew prophecies from the Book of Revelation about how the end might unfold. First, the Supreme Court would overturn the Snyder verdict. The country would be so enraged by Westboro’s victory that its members would be forced to flee to Israel. Obama would be crowned king of the world, then lead every nation in war against Israel. Israel would be destroyed, and only a hundred and forty-four thousand Jews who repented for killing Jesus would be spared. (Revelation says that a hundred and forty-four thousand “children of Israel” are “redeemed from among men.”) Westboro members would lead these converted Jews through the wilderness until Christ returned and ushered them into Heaven. Phelps-Roper and her family members all got passports, so that they could travel to Israel. One day, she was in the grocery store and picked up a container of yogurt with Oreo pieces. She stared at it, thinking, We won’t have modern conveniences like this in the wilderness. Is it better to learn to live without them, or to enjoy them while we can? Still, she had a hard time believing in aspects of the future foretold by some church members, like the idea that they would soon be living in pink caves in Jordan. “We were making specific predictions about things without having, in my mind, sufficient scriptural support,” she said. Many other members shared her bewilderment, she found, and so she turned to Twitter for answers. Most of the prophecies centered on Jews, so she found a list, published by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, a syndicated news service, of the hundred most influential Jewish Twitter users. She created an account under the pseudonym Marissa Cohen and followed many of the people on the list, hoping to learn if Westboro’s prophecies were coming true. “I think whatever’s going to happen next has already happened.” Buy a cartoon As the prophecies were developed, Westboro expanded the focus of its preaching to include the Jewish community. Members hoped to find the hundred and forty-four thousand repentant Jews. They picketed synagogues and sent anti-Semitic DVDs to Jewish organizations. Westboro called the protests the Fateful Fig Find, after a parable in the Book of Jeremiah that compares Jews who had been captured by the Babylonians to two baskets of figs, one good and one “naughty.” Phelps-Roper thought that this initiative was more explicitly supported by the Bible than other parts of the prophecies were, so she threw herself into the effort. She wrote the church’s press release: “ WBC is looking for the good figs among the Christ-rejecting hypocrites !” She looked at the J.T.A. list of influential Jews and saw that No. 2 was David Abitbol, a Jerusalem-based Web developer and the founder of the Jewish-culture blog Jewlicious. With more than four thousand followers and a habit of engaging with those who tweeted at him, he would be a prime target for Westboro’s message of repentance, she figured. On September 9, 2009, Shirley gave an interview to an Atlanta radio station, and Phelps-Roper shared a quote on Twitter. Phelps-Roper tagged Abitbol in the post so that he would see it. She wrote, “Atlanta: radio guy says ‘Finish this sentence: the only good Jew is a . . .’ Ma says ‘ Repentant Jew!’ The only answer that suffices @jewlicious.” “Thanks Megan!” he responded. “That’s handy what with Yom Kippur coming up!” Phelps-Roper posted another tweet, spelling it out more clearly. “Oh & @jewlicious? Your dead rote rituals == true repentance. We know the diff. Rev. 3:9 You keep promoting sin, which belies the ugly truth.” “Dead rote rituals?” he responded. “U mean like holding up God Hates Shrimp, err I mean Fag signs up? Your ‘ministry’ is a joke.” “Anybody’s initial response to being confronted with the sort of stuff Westboro Baptist Church says is to tell them to fuck off,” Abitbol told me. Abitbol is a large man in his early fifties who often has a shaggy Mohawk, which he typically covers with a Montreal Expos baseball cap. He was familiar with Westboro from its godhatesfags.com Web site. He had lived in Montreal in the nineties, and had become fascinated with the explosion of hate sites on the early Internet. “Most people, when they first get access to the Internet, the first thing they wanted to see was naked ladies,” he told me. “The first thing I wanted to see was something I didn’t have access to in Montreal: neo-Nazis and hate groups.” There were few widely available search engines at the time, so he spent hours tracking down the Web sites of Holocaust deniers, anti-Semites, and racists of all types. He and a friend eventually created a directory called Net Hate, which listed the sites along with mocking descriptions. “We didn’t want to debate them, we just wanted to make fun of them,” he said. As for the Westboro members, “I just thought they were crazy.” Phelps-Roper got into an extended debate with Abitbol on Twitter. “Arguing is fun when you think you have all the answers,” she said. But he was harder to get a bead on than other critics she had encountered. He had read the Old Testament in its original Hebrew, and was conversant in the New Testament as well. She was taken aback to see that he signed all his blog posts on Jewlicious with the handle “ck”—for “christ killer”—as if it were a badge of honor. Yet she found him funny and engaging. “I knew he was evil, but he was friendly, so I was especially wary, because you don’t want to be seduced away from the truth by a crafty deceiver,” Phelps-Roper said. Abitbol had learned while running Net Hate that relating to hateful people on a human level was the best way to deal with them. He saw that Phelps-Roper had a lot of followers and was an influential person in the church, so he wanted to counter her message. And he wanted to humanize Jews to Westboro. “I wanted to be like really nice so that they would have a hard time hating me,” he said. One day, he tweeted about the television show “Gossip Girl,” and Phelps-Roper responded jocularly about one of its characters. “You know, for an evil something something, you sure do crack me up,” Abitbol responded. On December 20, 2009, Phelps-Roper was in the basement of her house, for a church function, when she checked Twitter on her phone and saw that Brittany Murphy, the thirty-two-year-old actress, had died. When she read the tweet aloud, other church members reacted with glee, celebrating another righteous judgment from God. “Lots of people were talking about going to picket her funeral,” Phelps-Roper said. When Phelps-Roper was younger, news of terrible events had given her a visceral thrill. On 9/11, she was in the crowded hallway of her high school when she overheard someone talking about how an airplane had hit the World Trade Center. “Awesome!” she exclaimed, to the horror of a student next to her. She couldn’t wait to picket Ground Zero. (The following March, she and other Westboro members travelled to New York City to protest what they described in a press release as “FDNY fags and terrorists.”) But Phelps-Roper had loved Murphy in “Clueless,” and she felt an unexpected pang—not quite sadness, but something close—over her death. As she continued scrolling through Twitter, she saw that it was full of people mourning Murphy. The contrast between the grief on Twitter and the buoyant mood in the basement unsettled her. She couldn’t bring herself to post a tweet thanking God for Murphy’s death. “I felt like I would be such a jackass to go on and post something like that,” she said. Her hesitance reflected a growing concern for the feelings of people outside Westboro. Church members disdained human feelings as something that people worshipped instead of the Bible. They even had a sign: “ God hates your feelings .” They disregarded people’s feelings in order to break their idols. Just a few months earlier, the Westboro Web site had received an e-mail arguing that the church’s constant use of the word “fag” was needlessly offensive. “Get a grip, you presumptuous toad,” Phelps-Roper had replied. She signed off, “Have a lovely day. You’re going to Hell.” But on Twitter Phelps-Roper found that it was better to take a gentler tone. For one thing, Twitter’s hundred-and-forty-character limit made it hard to fit both a florid insult and a scriptural point. And if she made things personal the conversation was inevitably derailed by a flood of angry tweets. She still preached God’s hate, and still liberally deployed the word “fag,” but she also sprinkled her tweets with cheerful exclamations and emoticons. She became adept at deflecting critics with a wry joke. “So, when do you drink the Kool-aid?” one user tweeted at her. “More of a Sunkist lemonade drinker, myself. =)” she replied. Phelps-Roper told me, “We weren’t supposed to care about what people thought about us, but I did.” As she developed her affable rhetorical style, she justified it with a proverb: “By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.” Buy a cartoon Other Twitter users were fascinated by the dissonance between Westboro’s loathsome reputation and the goofy, pop-culture-obsessed millennial who Phelps-Roper seemed to be on Twitter. “I remember just thinking, How can somebody who appreciates good music believe so many hateful things?” Graham Hughes said. In November, 2009, Hughes, then a college student in British Columbia, interviewed Phelps-Roper for a religious-studies class. Afterward, they corresponded frequently on Twitter. When Hughes was hospitalized with a brain infection, Phelps-Roper showed him more concern than many of his real-life friends. “I knew there was a genuine connection between us,” he said. As Phelps-Roper continued to tweet, she developed relationships with more people like Hughes. There was a Jewish marketing consultant in Brooklyn who abhorred Westboro’s tactics but supported the church’s right to express its views. There was a young Australian guy who tweeted political jokes that she and her younger sister Grace found hilarious. “It was like I was becoming part of a community,” Phelps-Roper said. By following her opponents’ feeds, she absorbed their thoughts on the world, learned what food they ate, and saw photographs of their babies. “I was beginning to see them as human,” she said. When she read about an earthquake that struck off Canada’s Pacific coast, she sent a concerned tweet to Graham Hughes: “Isn’t this close to you?” In February, 2010, Westboro protested a festival in Long Beach, California, that David Abitbol had organized through Jewlicious. Phelps-Roper’s conversations with Abitbol had continued through the winter, and she knew that debating him in person would be more challenging than on Twitter. The church set up its picket a block from the Jewish community center where the festival was taking place. Phelps-Roper held four signs, while an Israeli flag dragged on the ground from her leg. The church members were quickly mobbed by an angry crowd. “Each of us was really surrounded,” Phelps-Roper said. “Two really old women came up behind me and started whispering the filthiest stuff I’d ever heard.” She recognized Abitbol from his Twitter avatar. They made some small talk—Abitbol was amused by a sign, held by one of Phelps-Roper’s sisters, that said “ Your Rabbi Is a Whore ”—then began to debate her about Westboro’s doctrine. “Our in-person interaction resembled our Twitter interaction,” Phelps-Roper said. “Funny, friendly, but definitely on opposite sides and each sticking to our guns.” Abitbol asked why Westboro always denounced homosexuality but never mentioned the fact that Leviticus also forbade having sex with a woman who was menstruating. The question embarrassed Phelps-Roper—“I didn’t want to talk about it because, ugh”—but it did strike her as an interesting point. As far as she could remember, her grandfather had never addressed that issue from the pulpit. Still, Phelps-Roper enjoyed the exchange with Abitbol. Not long after, she told him that Westboro would be picketing the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations, in New Orleans, that year. Abitbol said that he’d be there, too, and when they met again they exchanged gifts. Phelps-Roper and Abitbol continued their conversations via e-mail and Twitter’s direct-message function. In Phelps-Roper’s effort to better understand Westboro’s new prophecies, she had bought a copy of “The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Understanding Judaism,” but she found it more profitable just to ask Abitbol her questions. Here was a real live Orthodox Jew who lived in Israel and was more than happy to enlighten her. During their debates over Scripture, Phelps-Roper sometimes quoted passages from the Old Testament; Abitbol often countered that their meaning differed in the original Hebrew, so Phelps-Roper bought some language-learning software. She figured that, since she would soon be living in Israel awaiting the end of the world, she should learn the language. Abitbol helped her with the vocabulary. Phelps-Roper still urged Abitbol to repent, but as someone who was concerned about a wayward friend. “I just wish you would obey God and use your considerable platform to warn your audience about the consequences of engaging in conduct that God calls abomination,” she e-mailed Abitbol in October, 2010. In response, Abitbol kept pressing Phelps-Roper on Westboro’s doctrine. One day, he asked about a Westboro sign that said “ Death Penalty for Fags ,” referring to a commandment from Leviticus. Abitbol pointed out that Jesus had said, “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone.” Abitbol knew that at least one member of Westboro had committed a sin that Leviticus also deems a capital crime. Phelps-Roper’s oldest brother, Sam, was the product of a relationship that Shirley had had with a man she met while she was in law school, before she married Megan’s father. Shirley’s sin of fornication was often thrown in the church members’ faces by counterprotesters. Westboro always argued that the difference between Shirley and gay people was that Shirley had repented of her sin, whereas gays marched in pride parades. But Abitbol wrote that if gay people were killed they wouldn’t have the opportunity to repent. Phelps-Roper was struck by the double standard, and, as she did whenever she had a question about doctrine, she brought up the issue with her mother. Shirley responded that Romans said gays were “worthy of death,” and that if it was good enough for God it was good enough for Westboro. “It was such a settled point that they’ve been preaching for so long it’s almost like it didn’t mean anything to her,” Phelps-Roper said. Still, she concluded that Westboro was in the wrong. “That was the first time I came to a place where I disagreed, I knew I disagreed, and I didn’t accept the answer that they gave,” she said. Phelps-Roper knew that to press the issue would create problems for her in the church, so she quietly stopped holding the “ Death Penalty for Fags ” sign. There were plenty of other signs whose message she still believed in wholeheartedly. She also put an end to the conversations with Abitbol. “Damn straight—if the food chain ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” December 13, 2004 Buy a cartoon Phelps-Roper found it easy to ignore her doubt amid the greater publicity that Westboro was receiving, much of it tied to her Twitter activity. In February, 2011, the hacker collective Anonymous declared war against Westboro. On Twitter, Phelps-Roper taunted the group’s members as “crybaby hackers.” Anonymous retaliated by hacking godhatesfags.com, and blogs seized on the drama. “Thanks, Anonymous! Your efforts to shut up God’s word only serve to publish it further,” Phelps-Roper tweeted. In March, Westboro members walked out of a screening of the film “Red State,” which spoofed the church. They had been invited by the director, Kevin Smith, with whom Phelps-Roper had kept up a running feud on Twitter since World AIDS Day. Ten days earlier, the Supreme Court had overturned the judgment against Westboro in the Albert Snyder case. Phelps-Roper was inundated with tweets and new followers. That month, she tweeted more than two thousand times; by the end of the month, she had more than seven thousand followers. “That explosion of activity, it was insane,” she said. But as other members of the church joined Twitter they began to question her friendly relations with outsiders. In April, 2011, the BBC aired one of Louis Theroux’s documentaries about Westboro. In one scene, Phelps-Roper explained how she used Twitter to keep up with a group of four Dutch filmmakers who had visited Westboro in 2010. She showed Theroux a picture of one of the filmmakers, Pepijn Borgwat, a smiling, handsome young man holding a package of chocolate truffles that she and her sister Grace had given to him. The day after the documentary aired, Sam Phelps-Roper sent an e-mail to church members urging more discretion in their tweets. “I understand the concept of showing the world our brotherly kindness, but we don’t have to let it all hang out,” he wrote. Megan’s father made her block the Dutch journalists from her private Twitter account. “It feels like we are opening ourselves up for entangling ourselves with the affairs or cares of this life,” he e-mailed Phelps-Roper and her siblings. Phelps-Roper said, “It made me scared for myself that I wanted that. And so I was, like, ‘O.K., you gotta step back.’ ” Another online relationship proved more threatening. In February, 2011, Phelps-Roper began to have conversations on Twitter with a user named @F_K_A. His avatar was Robert Redford in “The Great Gatsby.” He had learned of Westboro after reading an article about the Anonymous hack. “He sent me a tweet, and initially it was like this angry, nasty tweet,” Phelps-Roper said. But @F_K_A was disarmed by Phelps-Roper’s friendly demeanor. He began to ask her questions about life in Westboro, and, because he was curious instead of condemning, she kept answering them. One day, Phelps-Roper recalled, “I asked him some kind of pointed question about the Bible. He said something like, ‘I can’t answer that, but I have never been beaten in Words with Friends’ ”—the popular online Scrabble knockoff. Phelps-Roper replied, “I can’t boast the same. =)” She put her Words with Friends username at the end of the tweet. They began to talk about the church using the in-game chat function, free from Twitter’s character limit. @F_K_A told Phelps-Roper to call him C.G. But C.G. remained a mystery. She knew that he was an attorney, but she didn’t know where he lived or how old he was. “He was careful not to reveal anything about himself,” Phelps-Roper said. Like David Abitbol, C.G. argued against Westboro’s beliefs and practices, but while Abitbol’s arguments were doctrinal C.G. was most critical of Westboro’s cruelty. “We had the same discussion several times when someone would die,” Phelps-Roper said. C.G. urged Phelps-Roper to think of how much hurt it must cause the families of the deceased to see Phelps-Roper and her family rejoicing. Westboro divided people into good and evil, but, Phelps-Roper said, C.G. “always tried to advocate for a third group of people: people who were decent but not religious.” She had heard all these arguments before, but they had never affected her as they did when C.G. made them. “I just really liked him,” she said. “He seemed to genuinely like people and care about people, and that resonated with me.” Phelps-Roper increasingly found herself turning to Bible passages where tragedy is not met with joy. The Old Testament prophet Elisha, for example, weeps when he foresees disaster for Israel. One day in July, 2011, Phelps-Roper was on Twitter when she came across a link to a series of photographs about a famine in Somalia. The first image was of a tiny malnourished child. She burst into tears at her desk. Her mother asked what was wrong, and Phelps-Roper showed her the gallery. Her mother quickly composed a triumphant blog post about the famine. “Thank God for famine in East Africa!” she wrote. “God is longsuffering and patient, but he repays the wicked TO THEIR FACE !” When Brittany Murphy died, Phelps-Roper had seen the disparity between her reaction and that of the rest of the church as a sign that something was wrong with her. Now the contradiction of her mother’s glee and her own sadness made her wonder if something was wrong with the church. Phelps-Roper’s conversations with C.G. often drifted away from morality. C.G. liked indie rock and literary fiction. He introduced Phelps-Roper to bands like the Antlers, Blind Pilot, and Cults—“funnily enough,” she said—and to the novels of David Foster Wallace and Marilynne Robinson. “Hipster shit,” Phelps-Roper said. He turned her on to the Field Notes brand of notebooks. He poked fun at the inelegant fonts that Westboro used for its press releases. After C.G. complimented her on her grammar, she took pains to make sure that her tweets were free of clunky text-message abbreviations. As Phelps-Roper developed her relationship with C.G., her sister Grace grew suspicious. “Suddenly, her taste in music started changing,” Grace told me. “It annoyed me, because it wasn’t coming from Megan. It was coming from him, this question mark of a person that I don’t get to know about, but she has some kind of thing with.” As young children, Grace and Megan had squabbled constantly, but they had grown close. Grace was seven years younger than Megan, and still in high school at the time. Grace would scroll through Megan’s iPhone, asking about the various messages and e-mails. But soon after Megan started talking to C.G. she stopped letting Grace look at her phone. “I remember thinking, What the heck? What are you hiding?” Grace said. “It’s all marketing—no one actually wears that stuff.” March 20, 2006 Buy a cartoon For young women in Westboro, having romantic interactions with someone outside the church was forbidden. When Phelps-Roper was growing up, one of her cousins had been pushed out of the church for, among other things, getting entangled with boys; other young women had been harshly punished. Phelps-Roper had long assumed that she would likely never get married, since she was related to almost every male in the church. “I was terrified of even thinking about guys,” she said. “It’s not just the physical stuff that can get you in trouble.” She did her best to displace her feelings for C.G. onto the music and books he recommended, which she fervently consumed. “I was in denial,” she said. Then, on September 30, 2011, she had a dream: It was a beautiful summer day, and she was standing on the driveway of the church. A black car with tinted windows pulled up, and a tall, blond man got out. She couldn’t see his face, but she knew it was C.G. She walked up to him, and they embraced. She knew her family could see them on the surveillance cameras that line the Block, but she didn’t care. “It was so real, that feeling of wanting to be with him,” Phelps-Roper told me. She woke up fighting back tears. “He was not a good person, according to the church,” she said. “And the fact that I dreamed about him, and the strong feeling of wanting that relationship, represented huge danger to me.” That day, she told C.G. that they couldn’t talk anymore. She deleted her Words with Friends account. C.G. deleted his Twitter account. Phelps-Roper tried to throw herself back into the Westboro community, but the atmosphere had changed while she was distracted by her relationship with C.G. It had started in April, 2011. Her mother seemed mysteriously troubled. After Phelps-Roper pressed her parents, they showed her an e-mail they’d received from her oldest brother, Sam, and Steve Drain, another church member. It accused her mother of lacking humility, saying that she was too zealous in correcting other members’ behavior and had overreached her authority on a number of occasions, Phelps-Roper told me. Reading the e-mail made her sick with fear. When a Westboro member was singled out for bad behavior, it often triggered a harrowing period of discipline. The smallest transgression could spark another round of punishment, until the member either shaped up or was kicked out of the church. Shirley’s role in the church was reduced dramatically. “My mother was supposed to be primarily a mother and a caretaker,” Zach Phelps-Roper, Megan’s younger brother, told me. Megan took over picket planning, while Steve Drain became the church’s media manager. The Phelps-Roper house was now quiet, as the flow of church members and reporters stopped. “I watched her all my life work so hard and sacrifice so much, and just be so willing to do anything for anybody,” Phelps-Roper said. “She had to be put in her place, essentially, and that feeling—it just was really, really wrong to me.” (Drain insists that Megan’s description of the letter is inaccurate. He said that it was a “disciplinary message,” but wouldn’t reveal its contents. “We don’t air our dirty laundry,” he said.) An all-male group of nine elders took control of church affairs. Previously, decisions at Westboro had been hashed out in church meetings, where consensus was required before moving forward. But the elders met separately before bringing their decisions to the rest of the group. The church became more secretive, as members were reluctant to discuss important issues for fear of appearing to go behind the elders’ backs. Women like Shirley and her older sister Margie—an attorney who had argued the Snyder case in front of the Supreme Court—had always been among the most public and influential members of the church. Westboro members drew on stories of powerful women in the Bible, like Deborah, a prophet and judge of Israel. But now the emphasis shifted to passages about women submitting to their husbands. Fred Phelps encouraged church members to read the Evangelical writer John R. Rice’s book “Bobbed Hair, Bossy Wives, and Women Preachers,” from 1941, which offered a view of gender roles that was regressive even when it was published. “It suddenly sucked to be a woman,” Phelps-Roper said. “It was, like, I would need to get permission from Dad to talk to anybody else.” Westboro women had long been forbidden to cut their hair, and had restrictions on other aspects of their appearance. But now the elders required more severe standards of modesty. Phelps-Roper had to wear high-necked shirts and dresses or shorts that covered her knees. After one shopping trip with her mother and her sisters, Phelps-Roper had to show her clothes to her father and her brother Sam, to make sure that they were appropriate. She was barred from wearing colorful nail polish and her favorite gold sandals to church. Phelps-Roper was upset to learn that some of her cousins lived under more liberal standards. How could God’s judgment differ from house to house? Phelps-Roper’s confusion soon turned to outrage. In 2012, she was twenty-six years old, but she was still being treated like a child. Once-minor indignities, like being accompanied by an adult chaperone while eating lunch at a restaurant with other young church members, now seemed unbearable. In April, she was shocked when Westboro expelled a cousin of hers without adhering to the process that the church had always followed, which was derived from the Book of Matthew. Typically, expulsion resulted only after a unanimous decision, but in the cousin’s case she was excluded over other members’ objections. (Drain recalls no objections, and said, “Everything was done decently and in accordance with Scripture.”) “It stopped feeling like this larger-than-life divine institution ordained and led by God, and more like the sniping and sordid activity of men who wanted to be in control,” Phelps-Roper said. She resented the increasing authority wielded by Drain. One of the few Westboro members unrelated to Fred Phelps, Drain had visited Topeka in 2000 to film a skeptical documentary about the church, but he soon became convinced of its message. The next year, he and his family joined the church. He’d long pushed for a larger role in Westboro, and after the elders came to power his influence increased. In February, 2012, during the funeral of Whitney Houston, in New Jersey, Drain urged Phelps-Roper and other members to tweet poorly Photoshopped images that depicted them haranguing mourners. The media quickly unravelled the hoax. (Drain told me that the fake picket was never meant to be taken literally.) “Can Eddie come out and throw his goddam back out?” March 31, 2008 Buy a cartoon Phelps-Roper was embarrassed by the debacle. It undermined her own proud claims on Twitter to be spreading God’s truth—and lying violated Scripture. In addition, she now had to have all her media appearances approved by Drain. “It seems like he wants to be Pope Steve and for no one else to do anything without his permission,” she wrote in her journal. “I hate it so much.” Megan’s doubt engendered by the “ Death Penalty for Fags ” sign grew. She started to complain to her mother, saying that the elders were not obeying the Bible. They treated her mother and other members with cruelty when the Bible required brotherly love, she said. The elders acted arrogantly and tolerated no dissent, when God demanded meekness and humility. Phelps-Roper was struck by the similarities between her arguments and what C.G. and David Abitbol had always said about the church. “It was like we were finally doing to ourselves what we had done to everyone else,” she said. “Seeing those parallels was really disorienting.” Drain disputed many of Phelps-Roper’s characterizations of the changes in the church. He acknowledged that an all-male group of elders assumed preaching duties, but not that this led to a less open atmosphere in the church. “There’s definitely more participation than when I first got here, in 2001, when you had one person doing all the sermons,” he said, referring to Fred Phelps. He also denied that women in the church had been significantly marginalized. “Women do a lot at Westboro now, as they always have,” he said. Shirley’s role was not reduced as a punishment for overstepping her bounds, he said. Instead, after the Snyder decision, other members had volunteered to help her deal with an overwhelming torrent of media. “We lifted her burden,” he said. He pointed out that Shirley had recently spoken at a picket protesting Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who had refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples—the church took issue with Davis’s remarriages after divorce. (Through Drain, Megan’s parents declined to comment.) Phelps-Roper first considered leaving the church on July 4, 2012. She and Grace were in the basement of another Westboro family’s house, painting the walls. The song “Just One,” by the indie folk group Blind Pilot—a band that C.G. had recommended—played on the stereo. The lyrics seemed to reflect her dilemma perfectly: “And will I break and will I bow / if I cannot let it go?” Then came the chorus: “I can’t believe we get just one.” She suddenly thought, What if Westboro had been wrong about everything? What if she was spending her one life hurting people, picking fights with the entire world, for nothing? “It was, like, just the fact that I thought about it, I had to leave right then,” she said. “I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin.” The next day, she mentioned the possibility of leaving to Grace. Grace was horrified. “It just sounded ridiculous to even suggest it,” Grace told me. “These were the points I brought up: we’re never going to see our families again, we’re going to go to Hell for eternity, and our life will be meaningless.” Megan, still uncertain, agreed. But she plunged into a profound crisis of faith. “It was like flipping a switch,” she said. “So many other thoughts came in that I’d never pursued, and that’s every doubt that I’d ever had, everything that had ever seemed illogical or off.” When they were together, Megan engaged Grace in interminable theological conversations. When they were apart, Megan detailed her doubts in text messages. One day, she texted Grace, “What if the God of the Bible isn’t the God of creation? We don’t believe that the Koran has the truth about God. Is it just because we were told forever that this is How Things Are?” She added, “Does it really make you happy when you hear about people dying or starving or being maimed? Do you really want to ask God to hurt people? I ask myself these questions. I think the answer is no. When I’m not scared of the answer, I know the answer is no.” Two days later, she texted Grace about Hell: “Why do we think it’s real? It’s starting to seem made up to scare people into doing what they say.” Grace replied, “But what if?” That day, Grace wrote to Megan, “Our belief in God has always curbed everything. Like, pain & sorrow, I mean. Without that we’d only have our belief in each other. But we are human & humans die. What would we have if we didn’t have each other?” For Megan, the answer could be found in other people. “We know what it is to be kind & good to people,” she wrote. “We would just have to find somewhere else, other people to love and care about and help, too.” Grace wrote back, “I don’t want other people.” In truth, Megan didn’t want other people, either; she desperately wanted things in Westboro to go back to the way they had been. But the idea of living among outsiders was no longer unimaginable. Phelps-Roper spent the summer and the fall in an existential spiral. She would conclude that everything about Westboro’s doctrine was wrong, only to be seized with terror that these thoughts were a test from God, and she was failing. “You literally feel insane,” she said. Eventually, her doubts won out. “I just couldn’t keep up the charade,” she said. “I couldn’t bring myself to do the things we were doing and say the things we were saying.” She largely stopped tweeting and tried to avoid journalists on the picket line, for fear that she might say something that revealed her misgivings. At one protest, a journalism student cornered her and asked if she ever got tired of picketing. “I honestly replied no,” she wrote in her journal. “It’s not about being tired, it’s about not believing in it anymore. If I believed it, I could do it forever.” In October, Megan finally persuaded Grace to leave. At the end of October, the sisters started secretly moving their possessions to the house of one of their high-school teachers, who agreed to help them. Many of Megan and Grace’s young relatives who left the church had slipped away quietly, in order to avoid confronting their families. But the sisters wanted to explain to their parents the reasons behind their decision. “The guy that knows about the books isn’t here today. I’d be more than happy to suggest a bookmark.” November 20, 2000 Buy a cartoon As the sisters agonized over whether to leave, they befriended an older man in the church and his wife, eventually becoming allies in discontent. For a while, they all planned to leave together. Then the couple’s marriage began to deteriorate, and the husband told Megan and Grace that they were going to divorce. Grace became involved in a brief romantic relationship with the man. After the relationship ended, the wife learned about it, and sent a letter to Megan and Grace’s parents revealing both the relationship and the sisters’ plan to leave. On Sunday, November 11th, the family had just returned from church when Megan and Grace were called into their parents’ bedroom, where their father began to read the letter out loud. Megan told Grace quietly that they had to leave: “It was like the world was exploding and I didn’t want to be around to see it.” Their mother tried to calm things down. Their parents wanted to talk things over—they seemed to think that the sisters could be persuaded to stay—but Megan and Grace had made up their minds. As Grace packed, their father came into her room and asked what she wanted the church to do differently. “I want you and everyone else to leave with me,” Grace replied. Their parents were stunned, but they didn’t try to force the sisters to stay. As the sisters packed, their younger brother Zach sat at the piano downstairs, crying and playing hymns, which he hoped might change their mind. Other church members stopped by to say goodbye and to warn the sisters of the consequences of their decision. “The fact that I’m coming face to face with the damage that I was doing to them was even worse than anything else that was happening to me,” Phelps-Roper said. Her parents told her to say goodbye to her grandfather. She walked over to the residence where her grandparents lived, above the church sanctuary. When Megan told them she was leaving, her grandfather looked at her grandmother and said, “Well, I thought we had a jewel this time.” Megan and Grace’s father drove them to a hotel in Topeka, where he had paid for a room, but they were too scared to spend the night alone, so they called the teacher who had agreed to store their boxes. That night, they cried themselves to sleep on couches in his basement. Megan and Grace returned to their house the next day with a U-Haul truck to pick up their remaining possessions. As they walked away for the last time, Shirley called after them, “You know you can always come back.” For the next few months, the sisters drifted. They lived in Lawrence for a month with their cousin Libby, who had also left the church, while Grace finished the first semester of her sophomore year at Washburn. They travelled to Deadwood, South Dakota, because Megan wanted to see the Black Hills. As she drove there, she kept imagining her car careering off the highway—she was so afraid of God’s wrath. “We were a mess, crying all the time,” she said. Phelps-Roper was tempted to hide in the Black Hills forever, but soon decided that, after spending so many years as the public face of Westboro, she wanted to go public with how she’d left the church, and to start making amends for the hurt she had caused. In February, 2013, she wrote a statement on the blogging platform Medium. “Until now, our names have been synonymous with ‘God Hates Fags,’ ” she wrote. “What we can do is try to find a better way to live from here on.” She posted a link to the statement on Twitter. It was her first tweet in three months. “Hi,” she wrote. Tweets of encouragement and praise poured in. “I expected a lot more people to be unforgiving,” she said. When David Abitbol learned that the sisters had left Westboro, he invited them to speak at the next Jewlicious festival in Long Beach. They agreed, hoping that the experience might help them to find their way, and to finally understand a community that they had vilified for so long. “It was like we were just reaching out and grabbing on to whatever was around,” Megan said. Abitbol said, “People, before they met them, were, like, ‘So, now they’re not batshit-crazy gay haters and we’re supposed to love them? Fuck that.’ ” He added, “And then they heard them speak, and there wasn’t a dry eye in the house.” The sisters befriended their hosts, an Orthodox rabbi and his family. They went kosher-grocery shopping together, and Megan and Grace looked after the kids. Grace became especially close with the family, and ended up staying for more than a month. “They were amazing and super-kind,” Phelps-Roper said. Abitbol joked about the dramatic role reversal: “ ‘Your Rabbi Is a Whore’? Your rabbi is a host .” Megan tried to put herself in situations that challenged the intolerance she had been indoctrinated with. One evening, after speaking at a Jewish festival in Montreal, she and Grace passed a group of drag queens on the sidewalk outside a cabaret. She felt a surge of disgust, but when Grace asked if they could watch the show she agreed. “It felt illicit,” she said. “Like, oh, my gosh, I can’t believe I’m here.” She and Grace ended up dancing onstage during the intermission. Wherever Megan and Grace went, they met people who wanted to help them, despite all the hurt they had caused. The experience solidified Megan’s increasing conviction that no person or group could claim a monopoly on moral truth. Slowly, her fears about God’s judgment—the first terrifying understanding of her faith as a child, and its most stubborn remnant—faded. “As undeniable as they had seemed before, they seemed just as impossible now,” she said. “I’m just here for the dental.” August 29, 2011 Buy a cartoon One Sunday last February, I went with Megan and Grace to visit their old neighborhood. We parked a few blocks from the church and walked down a quiet street lined with ranch-style homes. It was sunny and warm for a winter day in Kansas. Phelps-Roper wore a green polka-dot dress and high leather boots, and her long curly hair—she still hadn’t cut it since leaving the church—fell down her back. Now twenty-nine, she lives in a small town in South Dakota, where she works at a title company. Six months after she left the church, she went on a date with C.G. They met in Omaha, in driving distance for both of them, and saw “The Great Gatsby,” the Baz Luhrmann movie. “It’s hard to even describe how weird it was,” she told me. It was her first date ever, and it was with someone who had become a symbol of the unattainable. “I was quite a bit like a teen-ager. He put his arm around my waist at one point, and I just stood up so straight.” She and C.G. connected as strongly in person as they had online, and they now live together. When we reached the Block, we walked along the privacy fence. In front of each house where Westboro members live, Megan pointed out colorful numbers on the curb; Grace had helped paint them when she was a teen-ager. We passed the Phelps-Roper house and came to an intersection. A group of men and boys came toward us. “I can’t tell yet, but it sure looks like a group of brothers and cousins,” Megan said. First came five of their young cousins, followed by two of their brothers, Sam and Noah. Steve Drain, a large bearded man, trailed behind. They carried tools. Megan later explained that they had probably just come from doing repairs on a Westboro member’s house. The group passed us without stopping. Grace called out, “Hi!” Sam nodded and gave a terse smile and a small wave. “Hi, how are you?” he said. Sam and Noah had recently had birthdays, and Megan wished them a belated happy birthday. The sisters said nothing to Drain. The crew quickly disappeared into a house. We reached the church, an unremarkable white and brown mock-Tudor building on the northeast corner of the Block. A banner advertised a Westboro Web site, godhatesamerica.com. Two American flags—one of them rainbow colored—flew upside down from a pole. The church sign read “ ST. VALENTINE IS A CATHOLIC IDOL AND AN EXCUSE TO FORNICATE! JUDE 7 .” Directly across the street stood a house painted in bright, horizontal rainbow stripes. The house had been bought, in 2012, by Planting Peace, a nonprofit group whose mission, according to its Web site, is “spreading peace in a hurting world.” The Equality House, as it’s known, is home to a group of young L.G.B.T. activists. Planting Peace has worked with former Westboro members to spread its message of tolerance. Megan first visited the house in 2013, after her cousin Libby encouraged her to visit. She sneaked in the back door, for fear of being spotted by her family. Today, Megan and Grace’s only connection to Westboro is virtual. Although Phelps-Roper no longer believes that the Bible is the word of God, she still reads it to try to find scriptural arguments that could encourage Westboro to take a more humane approach to the world. Sometimes she’ll tweet passages, knowing that church members will see them. After they left the church, Megan and Grace were blocked from Westboro’s Twitter accounts, but they created a secret account to follow them. Sometimes, when her mother appears in a video, Megan will loop it over and over, just to hear her voice. Fred Phelps died in March, 2014, at the age of eighty-four. Former members of the church told me that Fred had had a softening of heart at the end of his life and had been excommunicated. (The church denies these claims.) Zach Phelps-Roper, Megan’s younger brother, who left the church later that year, said that one of the precipitating events in Fred’s exclusion had been expressing kindness toward the Equality House. At a church meeting, Zach recalls, members discussed the episode: “He stepped out the front door of the church and looked at the Rainbow House, the Planting Peace organization, and looked over and said, ‘You’re good people.’ ” ♦ \nAdrian Chen joined The New Yorker as a staff writer in 2016.

      "text": "Twitter now ranks conversations in the replies view, to show more relevant or engaging content. The replies are sorted into groups or threads. These conversations do not always appear in chronological order. The most engaging content shows up on top, the tweet with the most replies, or a reply from the original poster is more likely to be prominently placed. Replies from people you know on Twitter, also receive a higher ranking .\nThe reply count view allows users to measure engagement in replies, similar to the numbers shown beneath the love button and the retweet button.\nHowever, the number of replies shown below the reply icon is not the total number of replies on the thread. Instead, the button only shows the tweets from users who have replied directly to the original tweet.\nTwitter has introduced yet another tweak in a spate of measures taken to stay relevant and increase users .\nRecent steps include expanding the functionality of mute, making reporting of malicious content easier, and sensitising staff to better take on abuse . Chatbots for businesses can now interact with consumers over the Direct Messaging feature .\nTwitter is looking at customer care as a potential source of revenue . Twitter is failing despite a number of bright minds , but the IoT can potentially rescue the struggling microblogging platform . \nThe post Twitter introduces conversation ranking for replies view appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "72 \nHere’s a Very Serious Journalism Dilemma in the age of Donald Trump, according to the New York Times : If Trump tweets it, is it news ? You might just want to bang your head down on the desk now, before you even read any further. \nHow to cover a president’s pronouncements when they are both provocative and maddeningly vague? Does an early-morning tweet amount to a planned shift in American policy? Should news outlets, as some readers argue, ignore clearly untrue tweets, rather than amplify falsehoods further? \nAnd those are the only two options, right? Ignore or amplify—rebutting is not on the table. \nIn interviews on Tuesday, political editors and reporters said that, for now, they planned to apply the same news judgment they would apply to any statement by a powerful leader, even as some acknowledged that social media allows Mr. Trump to reduce complicated subjects to snappy, and sometimes misleading, slogans and sound bites. \nAs opposed to his interviews, speeches, and press conferences (if he ever gave any press conferences), where Trump embraces complexity and never misleads. Give me a break here. \nThis really shouldn’t be this hard. Twitter is one of the main venues the president-elect uses to tell Americans and the world what he’s thinking. What he’s thinking has policy implications, and it’s news. What he’s thinking also often reveals how unstable he is and how little he knows or cares about the rule of law, which is in itself newsworthy. \nAt the same time, every single Trump tweet does not need to receive hours of breathless cable news coverage to the exclusion of stories about his massive conflicts of interest or the extremists he’s appointing to his administration. Covering a Trump tweet is rarely something that should take up a lot of time or resources. You don’t need a team of researchers with deep expertise in constitutional law to conclude that stripping someone’s citizenship for burning a flag is unconstitutional, for instance. You can say “the president-elect suggested something flatly unconstitutional on Twitter this morning. Now here’s our report on how his pick for education secretary has no education qualifications beyond having spent millions of dollars trying to harm public education. It will be followed by our report on how he’s shaking down other countries for personal profit.” \nBut the idea that we should ignore what Trump is saying because he’s saying it 140 characters at a time? That’s a big nope.",

      "text": "By Alan Dershowitz \nPublished December 05, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nWhat should a political party that has just lost its white working-­‐class blue-­‐ collar base to a “make America great again” nationalist do to try to regain these voters? Why not appoint as the new head of the party a radical left-­‐wing ideologue who has a long history of supporting an anti-­‐American, anti-­‐white, anti-­‐Semitic Nation of Islam racist?  \nSuch an appointment will surely bring back rust belt voters who have lost their jobs to globalization and free trade! Is this really the thinking of those Democratic leaders who are pushing for Keith Ellison to head the Democratic National Committee?   \nKeith Ellison is, by all accounts, a decent guy, who is well liked by his congressional colleagues. But it is hard to imagine a worse candidate to take over the DNC at this time. \nEllison represents the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party, just when the party – if it is to win again – must move to the center in order to bring back the voters it lost to Trump. \nThe Democrats didn’t lose because their candidates weren’t left enough. They won the votes of liberals. The radical voters they lost to Jill Stein were small in number and are not likely to be influenced by the appointment of Ellison. \nThe centrist voters they lost to Trump will only be further alienated by the appointment of a left-­wing ideologue, who seems to care more about global issues than jobs in Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan. Ellison’s selection certainly wouldn’t help among Jewish voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania or pro-­‐Israel Christian voters around the country.   \nEllison’s sordid past associations with Louis Farrakhan—the longtime leader of the Nation of Islam—will hurt him in Middle America, which has little appetite for Farrakhan’s anti-­‐American ravings. \nRecently, Farrakhan made headlines for visiting Iran on the 35th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution where he berated the United States, while refusing to criticize Iran’s human rights violations. \nFarrakhan also appeared as a special guest speaker of the Iranian president at a rally, which featured the unveiling of a float reenacting Iran’s detention of 10 U.S. Navy sailors in the Persian Gulf.\nIn addition to embracing American enemies abroad, Farrakhan has exhibited a penchant for lacing his sermons with anti-­‐Semitic hate speech. Around the time that Ellison was working with the Nation of Islam, for example, Farrakhan was delivering speeches attacking “the synagogue as Satan.” He described Jews as “wicked deceivers of the American people” that have “wrapped [their] tentacles around the U.S. government” and are “deceiving and sending this nation to hell.”\nLong after Jesse Jackson disavowed Farrakhan in 1984 as “reprehensible and morally indefensible” for describing Judaism as a “gutter religion,” Ellison was defending Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam in 1995 as a role model for African-­‐ Americans, calling him “a tireless public servant of Black people, who constantly teaches self-­‐reliance and self-­‐examination to the Black community.”\nEllison has struggled to explain his association with Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. He has acknowledged working with the Nation of Islam for about 18 months to organize the Minnesota delegation to Farrakhan's 1995 Million Man March in Washington. However, Ellison insists that he never joined the Nation of Islam and more recently, he has held himself out as a friend of the Jewish people and of Israel. \nThis late conversion coincided with Ellison’s decision to pursue elected office in Minnesota, and an apparent realization that his association with the Nation of Islam might hurt his political fortunes. \nIn 2006, he wrote a letter to the Jewish Community Relations Council in Minneapolis, in which he apologized for failing to \"adequately scrutinize the positions\" of Farrakhan and other Nation of Islam leaders. \"They were and are anti-­‐Semitic, and I should have come to that conclusion earlier than I did.\"  \nIn his recently released memoir “My Country, ’Tis of Thee: My Faith, My Family, Our Future,” Ellison writes of Farrakhan “He could only wax eloquent while scapegoating other groups” and of the Nation of Islam “if you’re not angry  in  opposition  to  some  group  of people (whites, Jews,  so-­‐called  ‘sellout’ blacks), you don’t have religion.”\nEllison’s voting record also does not support his claim that he has become a “friend” of Israel.  He was one of only 8 Congressmen who voted against funding the Iron Dome program, developed jointly by the U.S. and Israel, which helps protect Israeli civilians from Hamas rockets. \nIn 2009, Ellison was one of only two dozen Congressmen to vote “present” rather than vote for a non-­‐binding resolution “recognizing  Israel’s  right  to  defend  itself  against attacks  from,  reaffirming  the United States’ strong support for Israel, and supporting the Israeli-­‐Palestinian peace process.” And in 2010, Ellison co-­‐authored a letter to President Obama, calling on him to pressure Israel into opening the border with Gaza. The letter describes the blockade of the Hamas-­‐controlled Gaza strip as “de facto collective punishment of the Palestinian residents.”\nEven beyond Ellison’s past associations with anti-­‐American and anti-­‐Semitic bigotry and his troubling current voting record with regard to Israel, his appointment as head of the DNC would be a self-inflicted wound on the Democratic Party at this critical time in its history. It would move the party in the direction of left-­‐wing extremism at a time when centrist stability is required. \nThe world at large is experiencing a movement toward extremes, both right and left. \nThe Democratic Party must buck that dangerous trend and move back to the center where the votes are, and where America should be.\n\nAlan M.

      "text": "Published December 05, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print This is a RUSH transcript from \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" December 2, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\nWatch \"The O'Reilly Factor\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET! \nWALLACE: In the \"Impact\" segment tonight, how will congressional Democrats deal with President Trump? Congressman like Luis Gutierrez of Illinois maybe giving a hostile preview.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nREPRESENTATIVE LUIS GUTIERREZ (D), ILLINOIS : I'm not going to this inauguration. I can't go to this inauguration because he continues to spew hatred, bigotry and prejudice even after he said he was going to bring us all together. He was going to unify us, but he is not. He continues to spew this kind of just hatred.\n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nWALLACE: Joining us now with reaction, Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons. Let's start with those comments from Congressman Gutierrez. First of all, do you think that's appropriate? Do you think many Democrats will boycott Trump's inauguration and will you?\nCHRIS COONS (D), DELAWARE SENATOR: Chris, I'm planning to go to the inauguration. I think regardless of how you feel about the election or who won, we owe it to our nation and to the world to show that we're going to participate in the orderly peaceful regular transition of power that has happened every four years throughout the entire history of our republic.\nI think this is an important moment for us to show our country and the world that democracy works that we embrace the outcome of the election and the chance to work together across the aisle.\nI choose to follow what I think has been the example of both President- elect Trump in his victory speech on the night of the election and then President Obama and Secretary Clinton in saying we all look for President- elect Trump to be successful.\nWALLACE: I applaud you for your consistency, but not all of your fellow Democrats are being so consistent and, you know, I remember I was the moderator of the third debate and I asked Mr. Trump whether he would recognize the results of the election and he said I'm going to keep you in suspense.\nHillary Clinton said that was horrifying. People, Democrats, liberals, said they were horrified about citing the peaceful transfer of power. Now though that it is Trump who is the president, not all of them are sticking to that principle.\nCOONS : Well, I think what concerned folks in that debate with that I will keep you in suspense was the possibility that Trump if he were unsuccessful in the election would contest it not through legal orderly means but would refuse to accept it.\nWALLACE : But now you have got the Green Party calling for recounts in three states. The Clinton campaign saying they are going to participate. Isn't this hypocrisy?\nCOONS : I think what's different there what's distinguishable is that Jill Stein, who is the presidential candidate of the Green Party, let's be clear --\nWALLACE: Right.\nCOONS: -- is following a legal process to file contest against those three states, elections, and asking for a recount. That's quite different from saying you refuse to accept the outcome. Speaking from myself, I accept the outcome of the election. I think it's clear that Secretary Clinton won the popular vote and that Donald Trump won the Electoral College and he is going to be our next president. And I think we need to move forward past this election.\nWALLACE : What do you think of moving forward? What do you think of the Trump agenda as he has laid it out so far especially the Carrier event yesterday in Indiana on this issue of really being tough on companies leaving the United States?\nCOONS : Well, there has been some criticism of that. I think the editorial board of the \"Wall Street Journal\" said from a sort of conservative economic policy perspective that they don't want the president job owning specific companies.\nBut I will tell if I had family that were working at that Carrier plant I would be pleased that their jobs were for now saved. What I would like to see is us coming up with a concrete bipartisan agenda for strengthening manufacturing in the United States.\nAnd if we focus on improving infrastructure and improving the skills of our workforce and making our country more attractive place for investment, I think there is a place we can grow manufacturing employment.\nWALLACE: One more issue, what do you think of the choice of Retired General James Mattis for secretary of defense. Will you vote to give him the waiver because he has not been out of the military for seven years? Will you vote to confirm?\nCOONS : I was very encouraged by his nomination. I have talked to a number of friends Marine Corps veterans who know him from service and said very positive things about him someone who reads a great deal, who served more than four decades in the Marine Corps and has personal experience both as a combat commander in Afghanistan and in Iraq and is knowledgeable about the challenges that we face.\nWALLACE : Real quick, do you have a problem giving him the waiver?\nCOONS: I understand some of my colleagues are raising a question about civilian control of the military. It's been more than 50 years since we have given such a waiver. I'll consider it. But I think it's important that President-elect Trump surround himself with a national security team with the kind of experience and character and success in the battlefield that General Mattis has demonstrated.\nWALLACE : Senator Coons, thank you, always good to talk with you.\nCOONS: Good to be with you.\nContent and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

      "text": "Colts' Allen, Hilton enjoy a field day against Jets By Barry Wilner Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Indianapolis Colts tight end Dwayne Allen reacts after scoring on a pass from quarterback Andrew Luck, not pictured, during the first half of an NFL football game against the New York Jets, Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, in East Rutherford, N.J. (AP Photo/Bill Kostroun) \nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- With their star quarterback behind center again, Dwayne Allen and T.Y. Hilton had field days against the New York Jets. \nMake that a field night at the Meadowlands as they helped the Indianapolis Colts (6-6) move into a tie atop the AFC South with a 41-10 romp that looked easy from the outset. \nAllen caught a career-high three touchdown passes from Andrew Luck and hauled in all four throws on which he was targeted for 72 yards. The tight end couldn't have been more open on his first two TDs, and Luck sent a perfect pass his way on the third. More from FoxSports Khalil Mack makes Oakland Raiders better than New England Patriots | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF \nConsidering he had 24 receptions and two scores in 2016 before this prime-time rout, was Allen surprised by his production? \n\"No, not at all,\" he said. \"Woke up this morning prepared to execute the game plan and do whatever my team needed me to do to win. After the second one I said, 'It doesn't get much easier than that to just walk in.'\" \nWhich is precisely what Allen did. And he praised his offensive coordinator. \n\"Rob Chudzinski does a great job of spreading the ball around,\" Allen explained. \"At the beginning of the year he said, 'Guys, be patient. It can be anyone's night on any given night.' Tonight just happened to be mine.\" \nNot entirely. Hilton toyed with cornerback Darrelle Revis and other Jets defensive backs, making nine catches for 146 yards. Hilton went over 1,000 yards for the fourth time in his five pro seasons. \nHilton shook his head about how the Jets tried to cover him, particularly in the first half when the game was decided and Indy took a 24-3 lead. \n\"Man-to-man coverage,\" he said. \"You can't do that. You just can't do that. \n\"Just pitch and catch. For (Luck), I just wanted him to know I was going to be there for him. Guys stepped up, especially Dwayne Allen.\" \nNo one stepped up for the Jets (3-9, 1-5 at home). \n\"I thought they kicked our ass,\" coach Todd Bowles said. \"I don't think we had a lot of effort. I'm sure there are some people who showed up, but for the most part we got our ass kicked.\" \nOther observations from this Monday night massacre: \nMINI-PLAYOFF \nNow that the Colts have caught Houston, which has led the AFC South most of the year, it's created a three-way tie atop the division. Indy hosts the Texans on Sunday in what several players and coach Chuck Pagano dubbed \"a playoff game.\" \n\"It's all right there in front of us,\" Pagano said, \"and out there for us and the guys understand that, regardless of what's happened previously. We've been on a little roller-coaster ride, but our guys have stayed strong. They have great resolve and determination, and they're driven.\" \nHe's right about the up-and-down nature of the season. The Colts lost three of their first four, but now they've won three of four, the only defeat coming to Pittsburgh on Thanksgiving night with Luck sidelined by a concussion. \nThe schedule has a two-game trip to Minnesota and Oakland and a finale at home against Jacksonville. Houston must play the Jaguars and Bengals at home before finishing at the Titans. Tennessee has an imposing next two weeks, hosting Denver and visiting Kansas City. It then gets Jacksonville before the season ender at home vs. the Texans. \n\"We got our confidence going,\" Hilton said. \"It's December football. Every game is a must-win situation and the season's on the line. It sets us up big for next week.\" \nQB SHUFFLE \nAn ineffective Ryan Fitzpatrick was benched in the third quarter for Bryce Petty, who will start the final four games for the Jets. \n\"The plan was to start him the last four games anyway,\" Bowles said. \"So, we just started a half early.\" \nPetty, a fourth-round draft pick out of Baylor last year, finished 11 of 25 for 135 yards with a touchdown to Robby Anderson and two interceptions. \nFitzpatrick, in what could be his last appearance on the field in a Jets uniform, was 5 of 12 for 81 yards with a pick. He re-signed with New York on a one-year, $12 million deal after setting a franchise record with 31 touchdown passes last season. \n\"I just, I didn't get it done,\" Fitzpatrick said. \nFAST START \nLuck and his teammates couldn't wait to get going against the Jets, and it showed from the outset. They forced two three-and-outs and scored touchdowns after New York punted each time. \nThere was no looking back. \n\"It was good to get our rhythm going,\" said Luck, who went 22 of 28 for 278 yards, the three TD passes to Allen and one to Donte Moncrief. \"We did some really good things.\" \nStarting center Ryan Kelly, Indianapolis' first-round draft pick this year, saw things \"clicking\" from the first snap. \n\"In all phases, we were,\" he said. \"When that happens, it's easier to call plays and do different things. Every player stepped up. A lot of the guys came in with the mindset that we were not going to be denied in this game.\" \nINJURIES \nColts: LB D'Qwell Jackson left in the fourth quarter with a concussion. RG Denzelle Good also sustained a concussion. \nJets: LB Julian Stanford hurt his ankle in the third quarter and S Antonio Allen sustained a concussion in the final period. C Nick Mangold returned from a four-game hiatus because of a sprained ankle, but aggravated it. Advertisement",

But the Hawaiian Islands have many different climate zones.\nWhen you hear it’s snowing there, as was reported last weekend, it’s usually only on the tops of the state’s highest mountains: Mauna Kea (literally “white mountain” in Hawaiian) and Mauna Loa in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, both on the “Big Island” of Hawaii, and sometimes Mauna Haleakala on Maui.\nBut below 10,000 feet, most tourist attractions are open and vacation activities are not affected.\nHere is a rundown of the effect, if any, of the snow that began to fall last Thursday:\nOn the Big Island: \nThe free Star Gazing Program at the top of Mauna Kea is the main tourism attraction affected by snow, according to Joan Harvey, director of sales and marketing at the Fairmont Orchid, Hawaii .\nThe program, scheduled every night at the 9,200-foot level of Mauna Kea, features a PBS documentary called “First Light” that describes the astronomical and cultural history of the mountain. Staff and volunteers set up telescopes for visitors, who can expect near-freezing temperatures even when the program is in full swing. But when it snows, or when it’s foggy or cloudy, it’s no-go.\nHAWAII BRACES FOR ANOTHER FOOT OF SNOW \nThe Fairmont Orchid sets up movies and craft activities for children when it rains, and it provides rain jackets and umbrellas for guests who choose to go shopping in Kona.\n“Rain is very unusual for us,” Harvey said, adding that it usually lasts for an hour or two. But on Monday she said it had been raining for a couple of days, which she called “extraordinary.”\nAt Mauna Loa, the summit is closed above the Red Hill Cabin, which is a visitor destination only for back-country hikers, said Jessica Ferracane, a spokeswoman for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Otherwise, the park is open, but visitors are reminded to drive with caution, said Park Superintendent Cindy Orlando. “Roads are flooded in places, and visitors might encounter fog, additional rain and other inclement weather today and as the week progresses,” Orlando said on Monday.\nOn Oahu, home to Waikiki Beach: Most activities continue, even in the rain. Many water activities take place rain or shine, said Nina Ganal, director of guest services at Starwood Waikiki Complex. If you sign up for an interactive dolphin program, a snorkeling excursion, scuba diving, a fishing charter or the Wet and Wild Hawaii waterpark on Oahu, expect the activity to take place. Rain usually doesn’t mean thunder and lightning, said Jean Dickinson, a spokesperson for Starwood Hotels in the Hawaiian Islands.\nOn Kauai, the “Garden Island”: As of this writing, the skies were partly cloudy, and most scheduled activities were taking place. Horseback riding and the Wailua River cruise take place rain or shine, Dickinson said. If it rains, travelers are given rain gear. Swimming pools are generally open in the rain. Catamaran cruises are typically canceled when there are hazardous surf conditions or small craft warnings, but none had been canceled as of this writing.\nNEED A WARM WEATHER GETAWAY? HEAD TO THE MAYAN RIVIERA \nThe Star of Honolulu, a large vessel that features sightseeing, luncheons and dinners, sails every day, rain or shine. The Hawaii Live cam network shows beaches on Kauai, Oahu, Maui and the Big Island.\nOn Maui: The midday temperature on the summit of Haleakala, which barely reaches 10,000 feet, was 45 degrees on Monday, according to Pete Donaldson, a meteorologist/forecaster with the National Weather Service in Honolulu. It occasionally snows at the summit, but Donaldson said he saw no precipitation on the mountain.",

More gunfire was exchanged between the groups, killing three men and wounding 10 others. The investigation continues. Advertisement",

      "text": "How to rise above the Christmas controversies By Liz Eagle Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nBy now, none of us are strangers to the inevitable conflicts that seem to surround the Christmas season. Our digital environment and 24-7 news outlets make it hard to miss the fights and feuds that follow us from year to year, all involving what is called the \"most wonderful time of the year.\" \nHOW TO BE A 'BIG PICTURE' MOM \nEach December, we see the debates on our social media feeds over whether it's appropriate to say \"Happy Holidays\" or \"Merry Christmas \" -- or whether it's constitutional for a nativity scene to be funded and displayed by a government agency. \nThis year, we've watched as the Parks and Recreation Department of Phoenix, Arizona, implored a group of individuals to stop placing their 15-foot Christmas tree on the top of Camelback Mountain, a tradition the city has enjoyed for 15 years. Citing safety concerns and a desire to preserve the mountain's natural beauty and majesty, the department chose to cut down the tree and carry it back down -- a tree that took a Scottsdale Adventure Club four hours and about 16 people to carry up Camelback Mountain. More From LifeZette.com \nWHY KIDNAPPED MOM, FAMILY MAY NEED TIME AND SPACE TO RECOVER \nAfter pleading their case to city officials and starting a petition on Change.org, which has received over 1,200 signatures of support, the city of Phoenix retracted its previous dismissal of this ongoing tradition and allowed these residents to replace their tree atop the mountain once again. \nThen there is the ongoing Starbucks cup controversy. Each year, the coffee corporation teeters between red cups and green cups, Christmas imagery or a more minimalist design, typically following current design trends as opposed to declaring a war on Christmas. And each year, coffee lovers vow to support this chain regardless of their holiday leanings or, conversely, vow to boycott in the name of Christmas spirit. \nOver the years, I've lost track of which cup is being used, typically opting to support small local coffee shops over the corporate giant. Terry Prince, a North Carolina churchgoer, takes this approach to the Starbucks controversy: \n\"I, as a Christian, personally don't take offense to someone saying to me 'Happy Holidays.' They are happy for most! I always lead or reply back with 'Merry Christmas.' That's my choice. The reply back almost always is 'Merry Christmas.' I don't think I have ever had anyone snarl or get ugly back with me. And as far as the Starbucks red or green cups, who cares? I try my best to boycott those cups, not because they're red or green or don't say 'Merry Christmas,' but because the coffee's not that good. I say -- relax, share Christ when we can, and for goodness sake, buy some decent coffee.\" \nWhen will we as Christians stop buying into the war on Christmas and stop allowing these controversies to ruin a season that was intended to unify? In 2 Timothy, we are reminded time and again of the importance of avoiding arguing and controversy because it leads to -- you guessed it -- more arguing and controversy. \n\"Keep reminding God's people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly ... Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.\" (2 Timothy 2: 14-16, 22-24) \nWhen we look at the Christmas season, we must begin to see what it is truly about: Christ's birth. The reason Christmas as we know it now exists is to celebrate that birth and what it means for us -- a chance to truly live, a chance to overcome our hardships, a chance to freely approach God. \nSo why are we wasting it on such foolish things? As Romans 12:2 tells us, \"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is -- his good, pleasing and perfect will.\" \nWhen we look at the traumatic entry of Christ into our world -- unwed parents, a political leader inciting genocide, a climate of civil unrest -- and his subsequent 33 years on earth of healing the sick, feeding the hungry, teaching his followers, it seems awfully petty that we, God's people, could allow something as trivial as a Parks and Rec Department or a coffee corporation to impede on this most joyous season. \nChrist is the gift of God, given to a lost and dying world. When we take away from this by focusing on the negativity around us, we forget about the abundant life available in Christ. We forget the true meaning of Christmas. Advertisement",

      "text": "How a 7-year-old Aleppo girl on Twitter became our era’s Anne Frank The Washington Post 1 hr ago Caitlin Gibson © Thaer Mohammed/AFP/Getty Images Bana al-Abed’s heartrending tweets from besieged eastern Aleppo have brought her more than 200,000 followers. “We are today appealing to the world, to everyone to do something,” she wrote last week. The harrowing farewell message came Sunday, just three short sentences.\n“We are sure the army is capturing us now. We will see each other another day dear world. Bye.”\nIt was signed “Fatemah,” the mother of Bana al-Abed , a 7-year-old Syrian girl who amassed more than 200,000 Twitter followers as she and her family have documented their struggle to survive in war-ravaged Aleppo. Fatemah indicated that the Syrian army was closing in on the rebel-held neighborhood where her family had fled after their house was destroyed last week in a bombing.\nAnd then, Bana’s Twitter account was abruptly deleted.\nHer mother started the Twitter account in late September, and Bana — a petite child with long dark hair, big brown eyes and a lilting voice — quickly became the newest symbol for the horrors unfolding in Syria. She shared her fear of the nightly bombings, tweeted photos of obliterated buildings and chronicled the quiet moments spent with her little siblings. Social-media users and international media outlets quickly took notice.\nSeventy years after a Dutch teenager penned the diary chron­icling her family’s life hiding from the Nazis, Bana has become the Anne Frank of the Syrian civil war — except this time, the world is watching the story unfold in the present, moment to moment, with no sense of how it will end.\nOn Oct. 4, she stood beside a garden piled with rubble. “This is our bombed garden. I use to play on it, now nowhere to play,” she said.\nOn Oct. 14, she sat with one of her two little brothers on the floor of their home, scrawling words in blank notebooks. “We are writing to forget the war,” she tweeted.\nFour days later, she stood in the middle of a ruined street, holding her arms up to the sky, grinning in her white hooded sweatshirt. “I’m very happy because it’s raining,” she wrote.\nOn Nov. 30, it was her mother again signing the tweet, in a message addressed to President Obama: “We are a family suffering along with many others in East Aleppo. Any help to get us far away from the battlefield?”\nHere’s what we know about Bana:\nShe misses school. She dreams of being a teacher someday, like her mother, whose English-language skills helped make the family’s Twitter feed popular in the United States and other Western nations.\nShe would love to write a book.\nShe recently lost a baby tooth, which she held up to the camera, grinning. “The tooth fairy is afraid of the bombing here, it run away to its hole,” she wrote. “When the war finishes, it will come.”\nShe has also lost friends. “This is my friend house bombed, she’s killed,” she tweeted in late September, alongside a photo of a demolished home. “I miss her so much.”\nShe loves reading. Thanks to Twitter, she connected with blockbuster author J.K. Rowling, who sent the girl digital copies of her Harry Potter books.\nAnd she is, by all accounts, real.\nA decade into the social-media revolution, there’s a natural skepticism around personalities that seem perhaps too compelling online: How much have they curated their lives for us? Do they even exist at all? A handful of journalists have made contact with the family; in October, NBC filmed them in Aleppo, and Bana and her mother did a video chat with the BBC . Fatemah maintained that they were not part of a charity or political group’s media outreach, just a regular family trapped in a war zone.\nNot everyone is receptive to the message. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who previously denied the existence of Omran Daqneesh — the traumatized little boy filmed as he sat in an ambulance, caked in blood and dust after a bombing that killed his brother, an image that went viral — recently told a Danish journalist that Bana’s Twitter account is a similar media-fed lie. “It’s a game now,” Assad scoffed. “It’s a game of propaganda.”\n© Thaer Mohammed/AFP/Getty Images Bana, whose Twitter account briefly disappeared earlier this month, has communicated with the world thanks to a solar-powered charger and her mother’s facility with English. On Twitter and in interviews with journalists, Fatemah has explained that the family uses a cellphone and a solar-powered charger to send sporadic transmissions. The tweets are re-tweeted thousands of times, and responses pour in from across the world — France, Scotland, the United States, Australia, Peru.\nWe are praying for you.\nStay safe, little one.\nOh God!!! Save her and her family!\nSo when Bana’s online presence suddenly vanished Sunday, her followers tweeted anxious messages under the hashtag #WhereIsBana.\nWas this the end of her story? What could be done to help her? There was a sense of urgency and helplessness. Then, Monday afternoon, the account suddenly reappeared, posting another dire message: “Under attack. Nowhere to go, every minute feels like death,” Fatemah tweeted. “Pray for us.” They were alive; their story continued.\nIt wasn’t the first time the family had tweeted from the brink. “Dear world, we are dying,” Fatemah wrote Oct. 24, appended to a video of a black sky reverberating with explosions. “Last message — under heavy bombardments now, can’t be alive anymore,” she tweeted Nov. 27 . “When we die, keep talking for 200,000 still inside.”\nAnne Frank was already gone by the time she became famous, and she never dreamed that tens of millions would read her diary. But Bana, her mother has told journalists, always intended to be heard by strangers. Her messages aren’t private musings, but a public cry for help. We see her, right there, in real time, standing near a window in a seconds-long video posted to Twitter in October. She stares out over a dark city as bombs thunder in the distance.\n“Hello world, you hear that?” she chirps. Her shoulders are draped in a baggy green sweatshirt, her fingers plugging her ears. With every blast, her little body cringes.\nThat was before her home was destroyed, before she got sick, before her family was on the run, before her Twitter account was deleted for unknown reasons and then restored.\nOn Tuesday morning, another message arrived from Aleppo, more hopeful this time: “Hello my friends, how are you? I am fine,” Bana tweeted. “I am getting better without medicine with too much bombing. I miss you.”\nIt was a fleeting assurance. Then hours passed, and Bana’s account was silent as her followers tweeted pleas and prayers. The world watched on screens, waiting for her name to reappear.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "The Twitter account of a seven-year-old Syrian girl, who garnered followers worldwide with her updates from Aleppo, became inactive on the micro-blogging site as government forces advance into the city's rebel-controlled areas.\nBana Alabed, whose @AlabedBana  account was managed by her mother Fatemah, had close to 200,000 followers since joining the social media site in September. She posted pictures and videos of life during the nearly six-year conflict. The account garned international headlines, with the media calling Bana \" the Anne Frank of our era ,\" when it went dark over the weekend, but became active again Monday. Alabed's followers were relieved when the BBC reported she was safe.\nLast week, Fatemah posted tweets, including a picture of Bana covered in dust, describing the bombardment of their house as government forces advanced on the eastern rebel-held parts of the city. She later told Reuters the family were staying with neighbours while they looked for another house.\nskip - We are sure the army is capturing us now. We will see each other another day dear world. Bye.- Fatemah #Aleppo We are sure the army is capturing us now. We will see each other another day dear world. Bye.- Fatemah #Aleppo \n— Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) December 4, 2016 On Sunday, she told her followers in a tweet: \"We are sure the army is capturing us now. We will see each other another day dear world. Bye. -Fatemah #Aleppo\".\nReuters could not immediately independently verify what was described in the tweet. A search for the account on Monday revealed a message saying the page no longer existed, drawing concern from other Twitter users who began using the hashtag #WhereIsBana.\nResidents of eastern Aleppo say communicating with the outside world has grown more difficult as Internet services have been knocked out during government advances.\n\"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling, who together with her agent sent Bana eBooks about the boy wizard, also retweeted messages about Bana's account going silent.\nskip - J.K.

NeverTrumpers and Clinton supporters noted that Hitler and Putin had both received the award before and that this was no honor.\nAt a loss for words (or for words that constituted more than 140 characters), Twitter responded with jokes, GIFs and outrage.\nAmusing how conservatives in my timeline bash the mainstream media ... until Trump gets TIME's Person of the Year.

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print (Photo courtesy of The Walmart Museum) \nThe first store opened by Walmart's founder is getting the Julia Child kitchen treatment —at least a symbolic part of it. The iconic American brand has announced it will be donating the doors from Sam Walton’s first Arkansas outpost to Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. \nSam Walton opened his first Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Ark. in 1945. After being in business for five years, Walton had to relocate when his landlord refused to renew his lease. According to the Walmart Museum, Walton relocated the store to Bentonville, and within the first year he was commanding impressive six-figure sales.

(Photo courtesy of The Walmart Museum) \nAfter the Arkansas store proved successful, Bud Walton, Sam’s brother, opened a second outpost in Ruskin Heights, Mo., a Kansas City suburb. In 1962, Sam Walton opened his first eponymous Wal-Mart after successfully managing nine Ben Franklin stores. At the time, offering low priced goods in rural communities was the main company focus. \nToday, Walmart operates over 11,000 stores in 28 countries, under 60 different brands names. \nSURPRISING FACTS ABOUT WALMART FOOD \nYet despite its major global presence today , artificats from the early days of Walmart are few and far between, says Alan Dranow, the director of the Walmart Museum. \n“We had absolutely no artifacts, nothing from that store because nobody held onto them,” Dranow told FoxNews.com. “Nobody knew that Walmart was going to be what Walmart became or that Sam was going to become what he became.” \nEnter the doors from the very first Ben Franklin store. Related Image Expand / Contract Photo courtesy of The Walmart Museum (Visitors take in an exhibit at the Walmart Museum in Bentonville, Ark. ) \nAccording to Dranow, the doors were kept for decades in a warehouse by Gene Ivy, co-owner of the Arkansas-based contractor Ivy Brothers Construction. The company was charged with renovating Walton’s first store in Newport in the 1960s-- and the original doors have been kept in storage since then. \nIvy kept the doors in his garage after he retired. When he died in 2014, one of his grandchildren contacted a Walmart employee about what to do with salvaged store relics. The Walmart Museum, which first opened in 1990 as the Walmart Visitor Center, was more than happy to take in the prized store relics this summer. \nBut Dranow admits the doors have seen their share of wear and tear. \n\"Because Walton’s store was so popular he had more traffic than anybody. The door is worn on the side where you push to get in,” Dranow told FoxnNews.com. “They’re not really in great condition. Basically they were just stored and never touched.” \nOne door will live in Bentonville, and a second will soon be relocated to a place where millions of Americans can take in a bit of Walmart history every year-- the National Museum of American History in the nation’s capital. No specific date has been set for the door’s display—a representative from the Smithsonian would not confirm when the new exhibit will open-- but Dranow says the shipping process is now coming into place. \nWALMART \n“We’re preparing it [the door] for shipping because you can’t just ship it on one of our trucks,” says the museum director. “We’ve got thousands of trucks but this is not something you just put on a truck that’s shipping packaged product. It has to be shipped from an art shipper.” \nSam Walton died in 1992 shortly after receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H.W. Bush. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is now the largest retailer in the world with over two million employees and nearly $500 billion in revenue. \n\nWillie James Inman is a Fox News multimedia reporter based in Jackson, Mississippi.
