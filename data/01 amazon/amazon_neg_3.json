      "text": "MORE >> \nKourtney Kardashian is one busy lady. When she isn’t working on brands and campaigns, she’s on her family’s reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians , not to mention going to the gym and raising her three little ones. She recently joined Frankie Grande on Amazon’s Style Code Live to break down how she keeps up! \n“Like, I don’t stop,” Kourtney said. “If people are like, ‘What are you doing today?’ I can literally send them the longest list. Every minute of my day is filled.” \nThe oldest Kardashian sister explained that managing her hectic lifestyle is about more than lists, it’s about self-care and staying confident. \n“To me, beauty comes from within as well, so like, I have this avocado shake every morning,” she continued. “It has Manuka honey in it, which I feel like the honey and the avocado is so great for your hair. I do almond milk in mine or sometimes coconut milk.” 15 Photos » \nThe 37-year-old also shared her thoughts on curating her personal style, explaining that not every fashionable look that comes along works everyone’s bodies. \n“I think knowing your body is the biggest thing because I feel like every trend isn’t for everyone and I am really petite, so I feel like knowing like, cinching my waist, you know? … I don’t look good in anything long because I’m so small and so it’s like I need to wear shorter things, just looks better. Always a big heel. I love to just keep it simple.” \nKourtney also admitted she definitely cheats on her diet if the moment is right. She also shared who in the family is going to be stuffing the turkey this coming Thanksgiving! \n“For Thanksgiving I’m going to [say] F the diet,” she said. “ Kylie [ Jenner ]’s making Thanksgiving dinner this year, so I’m like I can’t really ask her to make gluten free and dairy free and I don’t really want to.” \nCheck out Kourtney’s visit in the gallery above and be sure to catch the interview in its entirety when it airs on Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016 at 9 p.m. EST on Amazon .",

      "text": "Posts: 1,739 Help the U.S. Int'l Team with Amazon Smile For those of you who do your shopping on Amazon.com, there's a way you can help the U.S. International Muzzle Loading Team at no cost. Amazon Smile (smile.amazon.com) is a setup that donates part of your purchase - it's a fraction of 1% - to a charity of your choice. And the USIMLT just got onboard with it. It takes a lot of money to send even a single competitor to the World Muzzle-Loading Championships. Registration fees for a single competitor ran over $100 at the 2016 Worlds...plus per-match fees. Powder was $40/lb...and you can't fly with gunpowder. So if you could see fit to sign up, we would greatly appreciate it.",

Russell's Mafia Drama Series with Robert De Niro, Julianne Moore Set to Star By Cameron Wade | November 8, 2016 | 4:18pm Share Tweet Text \nThe streaming giants continue to snatch up big stars for competing TV projects. According to THR , Amazon is the latest to nab some big-name talent, having acquired a mini-series from American Hustle writer-director David O. Russell that is set to star a pair of Oscar winners in Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore. \nAmazon spent $160 million to acquire the show, which will consist of two seasons of eight episodes each, to be written and directed by Russell. Scott Lambert, Alexandra Milchan and Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures ( American Hustle , Joy ) will produce. \nOther details are scarce—there’s not even a title yet—but the show will be a drama that revolves around the mafia. This will be Russell’s fourth project with De Niro and his first with Moore. Tags",

      "text": "Amazon scoops David O. Russell series with Robert De Niro & Julianne Moore 11 hours ago by: Comments \nDirector David O. Russell has a pretty stellar track record. His projects spanning from the 90's and into today, like FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, THE FIGHTER, THREE KINGS and SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK are all fantastic movies, while even his less-than-fantastic movies like AMERICAN HUSTLE, JOY and I HEART HUCKABEES have very bright spots. But what makes his recent films must-sees for me has been the casting of Robert De Niro . A great director mixed with the god of acting always makes for terrific work, and their next collaboration should be no different. \nWord around the campfire is that a series from Russell and starring actors De Niro and Julianne Moore has just been picked up by Amazon for a whopping $160 million dollars for two full-season orders of eight episodes a piece, outbidding studios like FX. Not much is known about the series itself, but more words around the campfire hint that it might be “a mafia crime series,” which will allow De Niro to finally achieve his lifelong dream of portraying someone in the mafia (*drum snares*). \nThis will mark yet another collaboration between De Niro and Russell, their previous efforts being SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK (earning De Niro another Oscar nomination), AMERICAN HUSTLE and JOY. This also marks a big get for Amazon, whose original series content still falls behind the likes of other streaming services like Netflix. This is probably why they paid more than Taylor Swift ’s net worth to get the show, which could be a potential Emmy behemoth, if it's as amazing as our all our hopes and dreams desire. \nI don't remember JOY too much, but I loved De Niro in PLAYBOOK and his small role in HUSTLE was a high-point in an otherwise so-so flick. Plus, anything with “De Niro” and “mafia” in the description is a definite must for anyone with a beating heart and other functioning organs. Overall I'm super pumped to see what the team comes up with, and although I’ve never used Amazon for its streaming (still feeling the crack-high from that free two-day shipping), if this show excites me with its first footage I can see myself moseying on over to the TV tab.

      "text": "source: youtube.com \nadded: Tue, Nov 8th '16 \nGael Garcia Bernal travels to Italy in the new Season 3 trailer for Amazon's critically acclaimed original series \"Mozart in the Jungle,\" which is created and executive produced by filmmakers Paul Weitz (About a Boy) and Roman Coppola (The Darjeeling Limited), and actor Jason Schwartzman. \nThe Emmy and Golden Globe-winning drama-comedy, loosely based on classical musician Blair Tindall's tell-all book of the same name, finds Garcia Bernal back as arrogant-genius composer and music director Rodrigo, who has just left his orchestral family in New York City to spend some alone time in Italy. There, Rodrigo finds himself forming a testy working relationship with a world-renowned opera singer, played by Italian superstar Monica Bellucci (Spectre). \nMeanwhile, young oboe musician Hailey (Gone Girl's Lola Kirke) has embarked on her own path to becoming a classical music conductor with the help of Malcolm McDowell's character, Thomas. \n\"Mozart in the Jungle: Season 3\" adds actor Dermot Mulroney to the cast as a cocky, pompous cello player (BTW, Mulroney is a classically trained cellist in real-life, and has actually performed on movie scores conducted by Michael Giacchino). The new season will start streaming on Friday, December 9. \nsynopsis: What happens behind the curtains at the symphony is just as captivating as what happens on stage. Created by Paul Weitz (About a Boy), Roman Coppola (The Darjeeling Limited), and Jason Schwartzman (Rushmore). Brash new maestro Rodrigo (Gael Garcia Bernal) is stirring things up, and young oboist Hailey (Lola Kirke) hopes for her big chance. \n\nstarring Gael Garcia Bernal, Lola Kirke, Monica Bellucci, Dermot Mulroney, Saffron Burrows, Malcolm McDowell, Bernadette Peters \nrelease date December 9, 2016 (on Amazon) View all trailers / clips for:",

      "title": "Amazon could add housekeeping services to Prime",
      "text": "Amazon could add housekeeping services to Prime By SEATTLE TIMES   SEATTLE – Is Amazon.com thinking of providing good housekeeping as its next Prime member perk? Two Seattle job postings for “home assistants” on Amazon’s website suggest so. They call for potential recruits to join “Amazon Assistants,” which the Seattle-based company describes as “experts in helping Amazon customers keep up their home.” That means helping customers with “tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away.” The goal is to provide, as part of a two-person team, “timesaving assistance to Amazon Prime members,” so they can run an “errand-free” home. Amazon didn’t respond to a request for comment. The apparent venture serves to underscore how creative Amazon is becoming when it comes to reasons to join the Prime membership program. Members pay $99 a year for guaranteed shipping, and also get perks that range from a Netflix-like streaming video service to photo storage and even free books.",

      "text": "November 8, 2016, 12:36 PM Exclusive Holiday Preview: Amazon, Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Etsy draw the biggest post-Halloween traffic gains By Stefany Zaroban Director of Research Internet Retailer editors will be following the web traffic, discounts, free shipping deals and marketing strategies of 100 of the largest holiday-oriented e-retailers on a regular basis throughout the holiday season. \nThe end of Halloween traditionally marks the beginning of the onslaught of holiday shopping. Right around now, e-retailers roll out so-called pre-Black Friday deals, free shipping promotions and other deals aimed at encouraging shoppers to get a jump on their holiday shopping on the web. \nSo far, four major players are in the lead when it comes to traffic gains in volume over last year. Amazon.com Inc., No. 1   500 Guide , Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (No. 4), Etsy Inc. (No. 23) and The Home Depot Inc. (No. 7) experienced the biggest jumps in worldwide desktop and mobile traffic to their sites in the first five days of November compared with the same days in 2015. \nWorldwide, consumers visited Amazon.com more than 384.3 million times Nov. 1-5, according to an Internet Retailer analysis of website traffic data from SimilarWeb, which includes mobile and desktop visits (mobile app visits are not included). Amazon’s site attracted 33 million more visits this year than last year, or a 9.5% jump compared with 351.1 million visits in 2015. \nDuring the same period, consumers visited Walmart.com more than 54.2 million times—6.6 million more visits than last year. HomeDepot.com received 20.1 million visits, up 3.0 million from last year, and Etsy.com experienced 30.3 million visits, a 2.5 million jump. \nAmazon rolled out its Black Friday deals on Nov. 1. Walmart.com already is blanketed with “Early Bird Online Specials,” and HomeDepot.com is touting “Black Friday Savings” and the “Lowest Prices of the Year.” Etsy.com has not rolled out any holiday-related promotions on its home page yet, though it highlighted holiday-related decorations like stockings and holiday decor in a recent email promotion. \nCollectively, those 100 online retail sites generated a total of 746.8 million visits to their sites in the first five days of November. That’s a 4.1% jump from the same period last year. \nThe biggest traffic declines so far in November in terms of volume are Best Buy Co. Inc. (No. 12), GameStop Corp. (No. 45), Victoria’s Secret (parent L Brands Inc. is No. 28) and Gap Inc. (No. 20). \nThe vast majority of the Top 100 retail sites analyzed are receiving more than half of their traffic from mobile devices—though mobile traffic has declined for most of them. \n76 of the 100 e-retailers experienced declines in mobile visits during first five days of November 2016 compared with 2015. Collectively, smartphones and tablets accounted for 52.4% of total visits for the first five days of November. That’s down more than four percentage points from 56.5% in 2015. \nThat could mean that more on-the-go consumers are browsing retail apps instead of mobile sites, as app usage is not factored into SimilarWeb traffic figures. The declines are not likely to be explained by a change in the calendar, as the first five days of November fell Tuesday through Saturday of this year versus Sunday through Thursday in 2015. Both time periods have one weekend day, when more consumers tend to shop on their mobile devices because they are away from their desktop work computers. \nBest Buy, Newegg Inc. (No. 17), Gap and GameStop experienced the largest declines in mobile traffic in the first five days of November, according to SimilarWeb data. Walmart.com had by far the largest increase, with 5.2 million more consumers visiting Walmart.com from their mobile device. The second biggest jump was HomeDepot.com, followed by Amazon.com and Zulily.com. \nMany experts expect mobile shoppers to drive more sales and traffic this holiday season. About two weeks ago, e-commerce technology company Adobe Inc. predicted that mobile shoppers will account for the majority of visits—53%—to retail websites throughout the holiday season. This would be the first time that mobile traffic will exceed desktop visits throughout the season. Mobile shoppers also will account for 34% of sales in November and December, Adobe predicts. \nHere’s a list of the top 10 most trafficked e-retail sites for the first five days of November among the 100 that Internet Retailer is tracking.

      "text": "This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997 newsfeedback@fool.com (Motley Fool Staff) 0 Image source: The Motley Fool. \nRenowned investor David Gardner (whose Stock Advisor newsletter was reported in The Wall Street Journal as one of the best performing in the world*) revealed his next great stock ideas. \nAnd something very particular about one of David's picks has some investors buzzing with excitement. \nDavid issued a rare \"buy\" alert on a stock that, at the time, had just recently held its IPO and went public . \nHere's why this is such an important (and rare) move: \nIn Stock Advisor 's 14 year history, there have been only 4 occasions David Gardner has recommended shares of company that held its IPO within 5 months of his \"buy\" alert. \nThat's incredible! Only 4 times has David looked at a brand new stock and IMMEDIATELY believed he found a winner. \nUsually, David likes to wait and see a company prove itself in the public markets for a few years before recommending investors buy shares, but sometimes , on rare occasions, he believes in a company so much, he pounds the table for investors to act fast and grab shares. \nPerhaps no example better highlights this rare conviction like David's September 1997 recommendation of Amazon.com . Amazon was a small-cap stock that had just gone public on May 15, 1997 when David Gardner first published his detailed, 4,250 word \"buy\" report on Amazon 's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock AND added shares to his portfolio. \nDavid predicted Jeff Bezos's vision for Amazon. David told investors \"Amazon is about more than just books.\" \nAmazon had been public for just 4 months when David issued this bold \"buy\" recommendation but boy, did it pay to listen . \nA mere two weeks after David recommended buying shares of Amazon, the stock had already surged more than 41%. \nMany investors would be elated with a 41% pop and sell out. Not David . \nDavid refused to sell -- fast-forward to today, Amazon's stock is up a mind-boggling 20,000% -- turning every $5,000 invested in Amazon into nearly $1 million today. \nWhile you can't go back in time and invest in Amazon alongside David Gardner, I believe I'm offering you the next best thing... \nWhich brings me back to the newly IPO'd company David recommended – a company with strikingly similar traits to what made David first issue his Amazon call. \nFirst, with a market cap of around $4 billion, this stock is essentially still a small-cap. \nAnd like Amazon, this company has been growing like gangbusters! \nThe company has grown the size of its user base by 63% annually for the past 4 years – giving it more than double the market share of its next closest competitor. \nEven more exciting, management still believes they've only captured 11% of the potential market for their product. \nThat's the type of growth and market opportunity that gets David Gardner's heart pumping. \nRemember the old saying, \"the early bird gets the worm\" – an ageless mantra reminding us early movers often have the best chance of success. \nThat's exactly why David recommended investors buy shares. \nBut please note : as of right now, you could miss out because you may not be eligible to access David's pick.

(And yes, that includes all his winners and losers!) \nDon't miss out. There's still plenty of time to get the full story on this remarkable company. \n10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Amazon.com wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of November 7 , 2016 \nthe_motley_fool has no position in any stocks mentioned.

      "text": "Amazon vs Sam's Club vs Costco: Who has the lowest prices? Don't Waste Your Money 10:20 AM, Nov 7, 2016 2:56 PM, Nov 7, 2016 \nIf you want to save money on household products, the best way to do that for years was to join a warehouse club like Sam's Club or Costco . \nBut is it still worth the membership fee? \nOr has Amazon Prime , with its free shipping, made warehouse clubs as quaint as your old landline phone? \nWe decided to put all three retailers to the test. \nShoppers have their favorites \nFrankie Brinkman, while loading her car outside Costco, said she won’t buy household items anywhere else. \n\"I am total Costco, love Costco,\" the mom said. \nBut Lauren Geers and her young children prefer Sam’s Club for its house brands, saying \"we buy the Member’s Mark paper towels, toilet paper, diapers and formula.\" \nThen there’s busy mom Ellen Glasgow, who gets everything she needs, with free shipping, from Amazon Prime . \n\"It’s been a blessing, there’s nothing you can’t order,\" Glasgow said. \nHer smartphone has replaced her car when it comes to shopping for detergent and diapers. \n\"A quick two minutes, I’m set and it’s going to be in my mailbox or at my door the next day,\" she said. \nWarehouse clubs fight back \nWarehouse stores know you can get crock pots, clothing and paper towels easily online these days. So they are fighting back with products that are not so easy to get with a click of the mouse, such as discount tires, installed while you wait. \nDon’t need tires? \nThen what about prescription drugs? Or hearing aids? Or eyeglasses? \nConsumer Reports Magazine says Sam’s Club and Costco's prices on those services are lower than most other chains. Their pharmacies have come in tops in several recent surveys by the magazine, with only online pharmacies offering lower prices. \nBut what if you just want household goods? \nWe turned to one of the top shopping bloggers in the country, the Krazy Coupon Lady, Joanie Demer. \nDemer, her partner Heather Wheeler and her team recently compared prices on 170 popular items at Costco, Sam's and Amazon. They used Amazon's \"Subscribe and Save\" program, that gives an additional 5 percent discount on products you order every month. \nSo the survey's winners? \nCostco came in first place, with the lowest prices overall. \n\"We found much to our surprise that Costco is still 12 percent less in the cost of the items than Amazon Subscribe and Save,\" Demer said. \nSam's Club was in second place, with prices 5 percent higher than Costco in their 170 item comparison. \nBut Demer warns that Costco’s relatively high $55 membership fee (compared with Sam's) means you need to shop more to see those savings. \n\"To make the Costco membership worthwhile you need to spend $600 or more per year to break even,\" she said. \nAmazon Prime was the most expensive in her test (12 percent higher than Sam's and 7 percent higher than Costco) even with free shipping, and the extra discount offered by Subscribe and Save . Plus, it has a $99 annual fee, higher than either warehouse store. \nHowever, with the extra discount provided by Amazon's \" Subscribe and Save \" program, Demer says diapers can actually be cheape r than the warehouse clubs. So she says new moms should consider it. \nPrice isn't everything \nDemer says there's no single winner. Each store has its strengths, and one may be better for you, even if it costs a couple of dollars more. \nShe says: \nCostco is best if you buy a lot, and don't mind the $55 membership fee and like to buy organic produce, which it has a great selection of on its shelves. \nSam’s Club is best for all those extra services, and membership fees as low as $5 to $10, if you grab one of their many promotions. \nAmazon Prime is best for convenience. Plus with Amazon, you don't have the risk of buying stuff you don't need, simply because it is staring at you from an end cap or they have a free tasty sample in the store. \n\"The biggest danger with warehouse stores are impulse buys,\" Demer said, explaining that it is easy to spend another $20 per visit on stuff you never intended to buy. \nAmazon Prime: Worth the convenience? \nEllen Glasgow knows she’s paying a bit more with Amazon Prime than with a warehouse membership, but is fine with that. \nShe said, \"it’s worth the extra money. If you think about it, you’ve got to consider the gas, your car, your time. I can now budget a lot more time for my family and my husband.\" \nSo which of the two warehouse clubs is best? When it comes to Costco versus Sam's Club, where you live may make the decision for you. \nIf one warehouse club is 10 minutes away and the other is 45 minutes....the closer club will almost always make sense, even if it has higher membership fees or does not have all the items you want. That way you don't waste your money. \n\n“Don't Waste Your Money” is a registered trademark of Scripps Media, Inc. (“Scripps”).

      "text": "Joy Bryant, Anna Camp, and Genevieve Angelson on Good Girls Revolt . Amazon ID: 9943926 It’s hard not to cringe watching Angie (Danya LaBelle) on Good Girls Revolt , Amazon’s new series, get an illegal abortion during a time when the Republican presidential candidate has said there should be consequences for the now legal act. Or to wince seeing Jane Hollander (Anna Camp) endure sexual harassment from her boss when a 2005 tape of Donald Trump talking about “grabbing [women] by the pussy” is one of the biggest stories of the year.\nThe eerie parallels between a show set in 1969 (on the cusp of 1970) and the 2016 presidential election are impossible to ignore.\n“There’s still a very long way to go, and you really only have to listen to Trump speak for 30 seconds to realize that,” Erin Darke, one of Good Girls Revolt ’s breakout stars, told BuzzFeed News during a press day for the show in October.\nThe United States of America in Good Girls Revolt was a very different place for women than it is today. Women were prevented from obtaining the same education, jobs, and opportunities as men; not to mention, the age-old stereotypes that kept women confined to very specific roles in society . All the while, activists took to the streets, participated in consciousness-raising meetings, and shook up their places of work to protest the status quo.\nThat’s exactly what happened in March of 1970 at Newsweek when a group of 49 women who worked on staff filed a lawsuit against the magazine for preventing them from being reporters. It was no longer legal for a publication to tell women they could only be relegated to researcher positions, thanks to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and a little something called sex discrimination. For months, the women organized in secret before holding a press conference about their lawsuit on the same day that Newsweek published a cover story titled, “Women in Revolt.”\nView this image ›\nThe cover of Newsweek magazine on March 23, 1970. Newsweek\nID: 9943912 These events are the basis for the similarly titled Good Girls Revolt , which is based on the original book by Lynn Povich, The Good Girls Revolt: How the Women of Newsweek Sued Their Bosses and Changed the Workplace . The recently released series centers on mostly fictional characters who struggle to find their places as researchers, reporters, editors-at-large, girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, wives, mothers, daughters, and activists at the fictional News of the Week magazine. (Only two characters on the show are, in fact, embodiments of real players in the Newsweek uprising: Nora Ephron, played by Grace Gummer, and Eleanor Norton, played by Joy Bryant.)\nThe core group of researchers — Patti Robinson (Genevieve Angelson), Cindy Reston (Darke), and Jane Hollander (Anna Camp) — do all but beg and plead with the magazine’s editors to simply write news stories with their own bylines, eventually leading them to initiate the lawsuit. While more than 45 years have passed since the legendary uprising at Newsweek , the cast of Good Girls Revolt notes that not all that much has changed.\n“Almost all of [the show] is still relevant. The improvement is that it’s relevant on a much smaller scale,” Darke told BuzzFeed News. “And now, when that shit happens you can stand up and say no or sue them.”\nDarke’s character Cindy Reston is no stranger to standing up and saying no, even though it wasn’t necessarily a common response at the time. When viewers first meet Cindy, she tells Nora that she has one year to work at News of the Week before her husband wants her to settle down and start a family. But over the course of the series’ 10 episodes, Cindy’s transformation surprises everyone, including herself: She becomes one of the head organizers of the lawsuit, has her own sexual awakening, and (spoiler alert) even leaves her husband.\nFor Darke, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is just as dangerous as the men who oppressed women during the time Good Girls Revolt is set.\nView this image ›\nDonald Trump at the first presidential debate of 2016. Win Mcnamee / Getty Images\nID: 9943943 “He doesn’t want change, he wants a reversal in history, and after living in the skin of that history for four months, I really think we should not do that,” she said. “I think a lot of the men in that period didn’t know better; what’s hard now is when you see men behave like that now, they know better.”\nJoy Bryant’s character Eleanor Norton is the real-life lawyer who represented the women at Newsweek who wanted the opportunity to be reporters. Norton served as the assistant legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union and had a strong background in advocating for freedom of speech, making her the ideal person for the job. Not only did she lead the first female-driven class action lawsuit by women journalists, but Norton also catapulted their story into the mainstream, inspiring other women in the media to fight for equality as well.\n“We’re still feeling repercussions of growing up in a society where we’re all programmed and conditioned to believe certain things about ourselves and other people — to hate ourselves, to hate the other person, or to believe that you’re entitled to certain things,” Bryant told BuzzFeed News. “All of us have to get woke at some point in order for things to really change.”\nView this image ›\nErin Darke as Cindy on Good Girls Revolt . Amazon\nID: 9944003 The male actors on the series were also quick to acknowledge the challenges women still face when it comes to inequality, particularly in the workplace.\n“We’re still, half a century later, talking about the gender gap. And we’re not just talking about it because it happened. It’s happening,” said Chris Diamantopoulos, who plays Finn Woodhouse, News of the Week ’s editor-at-large.\n“The prolific thing about the show is also the sad thing about the show: What the show was dealing with is what we’re dealing with,” he continued. “It’s a call to arms to young people to recognize that now is the time to be decisive, and we are here because we’re standing on the shoulders of these fearless people, these women, who sacrificed their safety and their comfort to give us an opportunity to recognize that we can be better but we can only be better if we keep striving to be better.”\nWith America on the heels of a groundbreaking presidential election that could mean the first female president or electing a man who Darke called a “misogynist from 1969 who would be very happy to go back to that time period,” it’s clear there’s been change, but it’s far from finished.\n“The sooner we realize the inherent privileges that many of us have and not think that it makes you a racist to acknowledge that racism exists, and know that it doesn’t make you a misogynist to realize that sexism exists, things will get better,” Bryant said. “We have to have honest conversations about these differences or else we’re going be right back here 50 years from now.”",

They can use the baby sling carrier wrap for newborns to babies weighing up to 15kgs. The key to it is in the comfort. This soft cotton/spandex blend is gentle to the touch, yet firm enough to keep your baby in place. Works with infants all the way to toddler age.” commented the co-founder of the company when asked about their new launch.\nWith the intension to make the black colour wrap popular the company has decided to offer a 75% Discount on Baby Carrier Slings to all customers buying from Amazon.\nThere is no coupon code needed and Amazon Prime members get free delivery as well.

      "title": "The “Good Girls Revolt” Cast On What’s Changed (And What Hasn’t) For Women Since 1970",
      "text": "Joy Bryant, Anna Camp, and Genevieve Angelson on Good Girls Revolt . Amazon ID: 9943926 \nIt’s hard not to cringe watching Angie (Danya LaBelle) on Good Girls Revolt , Amazon’s new series, get an illegal abortion during a time when the Republican presidential candidate has said there should be consequences for the now legal act. Or to wince seeing Jane Hollander (Anna Camp) endure sexual harassment from her boss when a 2005 tape of Donald Trump talking about “grabbing [women] by the pussy” is one of the biggest stories of the year. \nThe eerie parallels between a show set in 1969 (on the cusp of 1970) and the 2016 presidential election are impossible to ignore. \n“There’s still a very long way to go, and you really only have to listen to Trump speak for 30 seconds to realize that,” Erin Darke, one of Good Girls Revolt ’s breakout stars, told BuzzFeed News during a press day for the show in October. \nThe United States of America in Good Girls Revolt was a very different place for women than it is today. Women were prevented from obtaining the same education, jobs, and opportunities as men; not to mention, the age-old stereotypes that kept women confined to very specific roles in society . All the while, activists took to the streets, participated in consciousness-raising meetings, and shook up their places of work to protest the status quo. \nThat’s exactly what happened in March of 1970 at Newsweek when a group of 49 women who worked on staff filed a lawsuit against the magazine for preventing them from being reporters. It was no longer legal for a publication to tell women they could only be relegated to researcher positions, thanks to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and a little something called sex discrimination. For months, the women organized in secret before holding a press conference about their lawsuit on the same day that Newsweek published a cover story titled, “Women in Revolt.” The cover of Newsweek magazine on March 23, 1970. Newsweek ID: 9943912 \nThese events are the basis for the similarly titled Good Girls Revolt , which is based on the original book by Lynn Povich, The Good Girls Revolt: How the Women of Newsweek Sued Their Bosses and Changed the Workplace . The recently released series centers on mostly fictional characters who struggle to find their places as researchers, reporters, editors-at-large, girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, wives, mothers, daughters, and activists at the fictional News of the Week magazine. (Only two characters on the show are, in fact, embodiments of real players in the Newsweek uprising: Nora Ephron, played by Grace Gummer, and Eleanor Norton, played by Joy Bryant.) \nThe core group of researchers — Patti Robinson (Genevieve Angelson), Cindy Reston (Darke), and Jane Hollander (Anna Camp) — do all but beg and plead with the magazine’s editors to simply write news stories with their own bylines, eventually leading them to initiate the lawsuit. While more than 45 years have passed since the legendary uprising at Newsweek , the cast of Good Girls Revolt notes that not all that much has changed. \n“Almost all of [the show] is still relevant. The improvement is that it’s relevant on a much smaller scale,” Darke told BuzzFeed News. “And now, when that shit happens you can stand up and say no or sue them.” \nDarke’s character Cindy Reston is no stranger to standing up and saying no, even though it wasn’t necessarily a common response at the time. When viewers first meet Cindy, she tells Nora that she has one year to work at News of the Week before her husband wants her to settle down and start a family. But over the course of the series’ 10 episodes, Cindy’s transformation surprises everyone, including herself: She becomes one of the head organizers of the lawsuit, has her own sexual awakening, and (spoiler alert) even leaves her husband. \nFor Darke, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is just as dangerous as the men who oppressed women during the time Good Girls Revolt is set.

Norton served as the assistant legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union and had a strong background in advocating for freedom of speech, making her the ideal person for the job. Not only did she lead the first female-driven class action lawsuit by women journalists, but Norton also catapulted their story into the mainstream, inspiring other women in the media to fight for equality as well. \n“We’re still feeling repercussions of growing up in a society where we’re all programmed and conditioned to believe certain things about ourselves and other people — to hate ourselves, to hate the other person, or to believe that you’re entitled to certain things,” Bryant told BuzzFeed News. “All of us have to get woke at some point in order for things to really change.” Erin Darke as Cindy on Good Girls Revolt . Amazon ID: 9944003 \nThe male actors on the series were also quick to acknowledge the challenges women still face when it comes to inequality, particularly in the workplace. \n“We’re still, half a century later, talking about the gender gap. And we’re not just talking about it because it happened. It’s happening,” said Chris Diamantopoulos, who plays Finn Woodhouse, News of the Week ’s editor-at-large. \n“The prolific thing about the show is also the sad thing about the show: What the show was dealing with is what we’re dealing with,” he continued. “It’s a call to arms to young people to recognize that now is the time to be decisive, and we are here because we’re standing on the shoulders of these fearless people, these women, who sacrificed their safety and their comfort to give us an opportunity to recognize that we can be better but we can only be better if we keep striving to be better.” \nWith America on the heels of a groundbreaking presidential election that could mean the first female president or electing a man who Darke called a “misogynist from 1969 who would be very happy to go back to that time period,” it’s clear there’s been change, but it’s far from finished. \n“The sooner we realize the inherent privileges that many of us have and not think that it makes you a racist to acknowledge that racism exists, and know that it doesn’t make you a misogynist to realize that sexism exists, things will get better,” Bryant said. “We have to have honest conversations about these differences or else we’re going be right back here 50 years from now.”",

      "text": "Get Amazon's Dash Buttons for 99 Cents 5 hrs ago 0 \nUPDATE NOVEMBER 9: If you've been eyeing Amazon's unique Dash buttons, which let you order specific products with the press of a button, Amazon is offering a $4 discount, starting today. \nUse the code ZIFFBUTTONS at checkout and get a Dash button for $0.99 rather than $4.99. The offer is good from 12:01 a.m. ET on Nov. 10 until 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 11, and buyers are limited to three buttons per customer. \nAmazon now has a Dash button for over 200 brands, from Tide and Cheez-its to Clorox and Meow Mix. Link them up to your home's Wi-Fi network and press when you need more. To guard against multiple orders (or curious toddlers), you'll get an alert on your phone to confirm before shipment. \nAmazon will also credit you the price of your Dash button after you use it the first time, so they effectively pay for themselves. \nUPDATE NOVEMBER 7: In celebration of Alexa's second birthday, Amazon has dropped the price of the Amazon Echo from $179.99 to $140.39 for a limited time. Pick one up now through 2:59 a.m. ET on Nov. 8. If you're on the fence, check out PCMag's review of the Amazon Echo, as well as its smaller siblings, the Echo Dot and Tap. \nNOVEMBER 1: While the nation cleans up Halloween tricks and binges on sweet treats, Amazon is getting a jumpstart on the holiday shopping season. \nThe e-commerce giant today launched its Black Friday Deals Store and over a dozen curated gift guides. \nMore than three weeks ahead of the annual busiest shopping day of the year, Amazon is inviting customers to find \"tens of thousands\" of festive bargains. Accessible through Dec. 22, the Deals Store features discounts on electronics, toys, clothing, jewelry, kitchen items, and more. Among those deals to watch out for: \n$20 off the Kindle Paperwhite Savings on an LG 55-inch 1080p Curved Smart OLED TV Up to 40 percent off select Magformers toys. \n\"This holiday season, we're offering more deals than ever before and—for the first time ever—giving Prime members an opportunity to use Alexa voice shopping for purchasing their holiday gifts hands-free,\" Doug Herrington, senior vice president of North American Retail at Amazon, said in a statement. \nSimply ask your Echo, Echo Dot, Tap, Fire TV, or Fire tablet to buy the gadget of your choice. \nTo encourage voice ordering, Amazon has incentives like a $5 gift card for those who order an Alexa-exclusive deal or 25 percent off a Tide laundry bundle when you order with Alexa. \nPrime members receive an additional 20 percent discount on pre-order and new release video games, and can shop thousands of Lightning Deals with 30-minute early access, as well as free shipping options. \nFinding the perfect present for friends and family, however, can be stressful. So Amazon also released more than 20 gift guides to help steer you in the right direction. They include luxury beauty, sports, musical instruments, handmade, grocery, fashion, home, toys, and electronics, among others. Click through to narrow your shopping parameters, or just scroll through pages of ideas. \nThe guides are accessible on mobile, too, with new functions like Package X-Ray, which allows iPhone owners to see what's in a box without opening it. Beginning Nov. 15, scan the barcode with your phone and the contents will appear on the screen. Customers can also use the camera icon to search and add items to a Wish List. \nFor deals every day, see Offers.com and TechBargains.com . \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com . Tags",

      "text": "Mall anchors Nordstrom ( JWN ) and Macy's ( M ) report quarterly earnings on Thursday. J.C. Penney ( JCP ) reports on Friday, and Dillard's ( DDS ) is scheduled to report on Nov. 21.\nAll four are in bear market territory compared with all-time or multiyear highs set between March 2015 and March 2016. Meanwhile, Amazon ( AMZN ) recently slipped into correction territory after setting an all-time intraday high on Oct. 6.\nAmazon reported earnings on Oct. 27. It missed analysts' earnings-per-share estimates for the quarter that ended in September. Amazon ended last week with a negative weekly chart. One reason for the Amazon loss is the company's continued growth plan, both online and in building new fulfillment centers.\nDillard's reports earnings on Nov. 21. Analysts expect the mall anchor to earn 79 cents a share. If Dillard's holds its gains through Friday, the weekly chart will shift to positive.\nMacy's reports earnings before the opening bell on Nov. 10. Analysts expect this iconic retailer to earn 41 cents a share. Macy's will likely have a neutral weekly chart at the end of this week.\nNordstrom reports earnings after the closing bell on Nov. 10. Analysts expect it to earn 53 cents a share. The weekly chart will end the week negative unless there's a positive reaction to earnings.\nJ.C. Penney reports earnings before the opening bell on Nov. 11. Analysts expect this retail turnaround story to report a loss of 20 cents a share. The weekly chart is negative but oversold.\nHere's the scorecard for the mall anchors and Amazon.",

      "text": "Amazon ( AMZN ) is looking to become a bigger player in original content with a new television show starring Robert DeNiro and Julianne Moore, and written and directed by David O. Russell, sources told Variety.\nThe star-studded show will be part of the Seattle-based e-commerce company's ambitions to nearly double its spending on video content and marketing in the second half of this year, and triple its number of original TV shows and movies. Amazon's video content helps to attract extremely valuable Prime subscribers, who pay $99 per year or $10.99 a month for expedited shipping, and who spend significantly more than non-Prime customers.\nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky didn't give an exact figure for content spending projections this year in the company's 2016 second quarter conference call in August. However, the company spent about $1.3 billion in 2014, with 20% to 25% allocated to original programming, and is estimated to have spent around $3 billion on music and video content last year.\nMore spending is paying off, at least in terms of awards: its programs were nominated for 16 Emmy awards this year and took home 5 wins.\nThe new show starring Moore and DeNiro could bring in even more accolades and viewers, as more and more A-list stars such as Matthew McConaughey, Halle Berry and Emma Stone bring their talents to television.\nLittle information has been revealed about the new show's plot or storyline, save for the fact that Academy-Award nominated director David O. Russell will write and direct all the episodes. Amazon has reportedly ordered two seasons of eight episodes each, according to the Hollywood Reporter.",

      "text": "VisualVault , a SaaS-based (BPA)/ Enterprise Content Management (ECM) software company has moved all VisualVault clients into Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) leveraging multiple AWS services as part of their global strategy . A long time SaaS provider, VisualVault’s AWS investment is part of a strategy to offer global clients a geographical disbursement of content and data that is well-suited to meet today’s demanding security, compliance and governance requirements. “AWS has continually met and exceeded our performance expectations for our enterprise clients with demanding Service Level Agreements,” stated Tod Olsen, CTO of VisualVault. “We have very large clients managing mission critical business processes so reliability, scalability and security are critical for us to service their requirements.”\nThe move from a private cloud to AWS has been met with positive feedback from existing as well as prospective clients. By virtue of extensive planning and diligent execution, the transition has been seamless and has met all timetables. The upside for current as well as prospective VisualVault clients includes scalability, increased performance levels that are capable of accommodating the input of large repositories of content and data with demanding Service Level requirements and providing better geographic coverage of data centers; effectively eliminating potential global data residency issues.\n“With very demanding timelines, we have already successfully executed the migration from legacy ECM and EMR systems to AWS for several enterprise level clients and have met or exceeded their requirements,” stated Olsen. “The ability to immediately add processing capacity is critical; as most of the migrations have been larger than forecasted. This flexibility is mandatory in those circumstances.”\nAbout VisualVault\nFounded in 2009, VisualVault is a private, Arizona-based, Business Process Automation (BPA)/Enterprise Content Management (ECM) company specializing in the automation of data and document intensive processes at an enterprise level. The VisualVault® platform is a cloud-based application that includes Intelligent Forms (i-Forms) which automate and validate both structured and unstructured data. These i-Forms streamline manual data entry and routing processes to boost overall productivity and accelerate business results.\nVisualVault enables its clients to search and present content in a contextual manner configured for their specific business requirements, improving adoption through flexibility and ease of use. VisualVault's integrated platform standardizes user data so it may be accessed, viewed and used across an enterprise providing users with live dashboards for end-to-end reporting, analysis and decision making. VisualVault’s mission is transforming our client’s processes quickly and cost-effectively, without replacing expensive core legacy systems, by streamlining their data and document intensive processes with our uniquely configured software that is delivered as a service.",

      "text": "Markets Today Amazon Ramps Up Original Content Efforts With New Show Starring Robert DeNiro The e-commerce giant is adding more bite to its original content with a new series starring Julianne Moore and Robert DeNiro, and directed by David O. Russell. Rachel Aldrich Nov8,20164:38PMEST \nAmazon ( AMZN ) is looking to become a bigger player in original content with a new television show starring Robert DeNiro and Julianne Moore, and written and directed by David O. Russell, sources told Variety. \nThe star-studded show will be part of the Seattle-based e-commerce company's ambitions to nearly double its spending on video content and marketing in the second half of this year, and triple its number of original TV shows and movies. Amazon's video content helps to attract extremely valuable Prime subscribers, who pay $99 per year or $10.99 a month for expedited shipping, and who spend significantly more than non-Prime customers. \nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky didn't give an exact figure for content spending projections this year in the company's 2016 second quarter conference call in August. However, the company spent about $1.3 billion in 2014, with 20% to 25% allocated to original programming, and is estimated to have spent around $3 billion on music and video content last year. \nMore spending is paying off, at least in terms of awards: its programs were nominated for 16 Emmy awards this year and took home 5 wins. \nThe new show starring Moore and DeNiro could bring in even more accolades and viewers, as more and more A-list stars such as Matthew McConaughey, Halle Berry and Emma Stone bring their talents to television. \nLittle information has been revealed about the new show's plot or storyline, save for the fact that Academy-Award nominated director David O. Russell will write and direct all the episodes. Amazon has reportedly ordered two seasons of eight episodes each, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

      "text": "PM Narendra Modi‘s bold move to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has not only taken citizens by surprise, but also created a sense of uncertainty in the e-commerce industry. Most e-commerce sites have a large proportion of buyers opting for Cash on Delivery (CoD) as the preferred payment option. With the notes suddenly going out of circulation, the major e-commerce players have stopped the CoD option, while other services are encouraging their customers to choose the online payment option. The likes of Amazon India and Flipkart have halted the option of paying for a product using the cash on delivery option. If you are to choose the CoD option on Amazon India, you will get a popup message",

      "text": "Amazon may launch a Prime housekeeping service 8:18 am By Conner Flynn \nNot content with just selling the products you need to keep your home tidy, Amazon may soon actually help you clean it. \nThis news comes from two job postings that show that the company is looking for “Home Assistants,” who work with customers to tidy people’s homes, do laundry, put groceries away and “assure that customers return to an errand-free home.” It is an interesting service by Amazon for sure. It would exapnd them into a whole new area. The ads originally said that Amazon’s goal was to offer “timesaving assistance to Amazon Prime members,” suggesting that this new cleaning service would be offered as a Prime perk. The company has since updated its listings though, to remove any link to the subscription service. \nIt looks like right now, the positions are open to people living in or around Seattle, but Amazon is looking for dedicated employees, not independent contractors who will just want a quick job for some cash. It will offer applicants on-site training, Amazon stock, health insurance and flexible working hours. Sounds pretty sweet! \nAmazon isn’t commenting on this just yet. Apparently it is looking to trial the service to see if there’s demand for it. It will likely be some time before we see anything come of this.",

      "text": "BS-Mall Premium Synthetic Kabuki Makeup Brush Set (£18) \nThis 10-piece brush set has over 3000 positive customer reviews—and at just £18 for the bunch, they’re quite the steal. User Willy Swift says they’re “absolutely the best brushes I have ever used,” while others rave about how soft the bristles are. Some people say there is a chemical smell from the paint on the handles, but overall, the quality of them is surprisingly high, given the low price point. 5 / 10 \nArt Naturals Jojoba Oil (£11) \nJojoba oil—like its superstar sister argan—is a true beauty do-it-all: Add a few drops to your moisturiser for added hydration, use alone to seal your other products in, or smooth it through your strands to add shine and softness. This version from Art Naturals has over 3300 reviews, with users raving about the quality and versatility. Scroll through the comments for a multitude of creative uses—from after-shave balm to a DIY shea butter recipe. 6 / 10 \nAztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing (£9) \nWe first heard about this much-loved, under-the-radar skin product when putting together our top-selling acne products guide (it ranks at #5). With over 5000 positive reviews, this mask—which you mix with equal parts apple cider vinegar—is a life-saver for those with oily or acne-ridden skin. User Van says she has “never used a product like this” (and posted some pretty compelling photos of her pre and post-clay skin), while Veggie Head Cat Lady says the mask “decreased the amount of oil my face produces and significantly made my pores smaller, all while cleaning all the gunk out of them.” One note: if you have sensitive skin, you may want to leave the mask on for a shorter period of time to prevent redness and irritation. 7 / 10 \nItalia Deluxe Eyeliners Set of 8 (£11) \nItalia Deluxe Eyeliners (£11 for set of 8) \nIf variety is the spice of your life, you’ll love these eyeliners—over 1000 women give them their seal of approval. User Sheillagh said the colors are “very creamy and glide on easily,” while Joanna says they “have great staying power” and will order them again, despite her initial skepticism. Be warned, however: The colors your receive may differ from the ones shown in the photo, so if you have your heart set on a certain shade, it’s a bit of a gamble. 8 / 10 \nElizabeth Mott It's So BIG Volumizing Mascara (£24) \nThe name says it all—if major volume is your goal, you might want to try this under-the-radar mascara from Elizabeth Mott. User Ttrus11 says, “I’ve tried about 300 different mascaras. This is the best I’ve used.” The brush’s hourglass shape makes it perfect for thickening thin lashes, and the formula is “so smooth,” according to user HRMAlaska, who said the mascara even withstood her weightlifting session. 9 / 10 HairAnew Unique Hair Growth Vitamins (£23) Made with vitamin C, vitamin E, niacinamide, vitamin B6, biotin, and more, this supplement promises to “nourish your hair follicles from the inside out.” User Momma Jen said that along with making her hair look “better” and “shinier,” it also helped her fingernails grow stronger. Other users say it strengthens their strands and also makes their eyelashes grow.",

      "text": "News \nIt seems like ever since the Google Home launched, we can't have enough of these Amazon Echo deals. Maybe it's related, but maybe it's just the fact that the Echo is about 2 years old now, or that the new Echo Dot is super cheap and causing internal competition in the line-up. Regardless of the reason, we love it when prices drop so we can get the same gadgets for less — or more gadgets for the same budget, because let's face it, the bucks we save here will be spent on other gear. \nThe Amazon Echo normally costs $180, but recently we've seen its price drop to $140 new and $260 with a Philips Hue A19 Starter Kit . Refurbished units aren't usually heavily discounted (the best we've seen is $135 on Woot ), but today, there's a good deal on the certified refurb Amazon Echo. At $119.99, you'll be saving $51 off the listed price of refurbs, or $60 off the price of a new Echo. That's more than 33% off. \nThe refurbished units are tested and certified to be in working condition, and they look almost like new. They might ship in a white label box, but all the accessories will be included, original or generic. There's a 90-day warranty to make sure things are working well so you can return the unit if it doesn't function like it should. \nShipping is free in the US and there's no word on how long this discount will last, so you may want to decide fast if you want Alexa and all her skills in your life. You'll find the link in the source below. Source:",

      "text": "Open PHP tool to display all Amazon reviews for specified product This project is ending in 6 days and has an average bid price of $186 USD . 5 Project Description \nLooking for a PHP developer to build a simple interal tool to scrape reviews from [url removed, login to view] and present them to the user. The following brief is for the first version of the tool, with the scope expanding over time: \n\nThe user will first be asked to input the product code, known as the ASIN (example: B003BEDQL2). \nThe tool will then scrape, and store (MYSQL), all the reviews for that product. This could be the entry point: \n[url removed, login to view] \nData points to record: \n- Title (and link to review page) \n- Body copy \n- Author name (and link to profile page) \n- Number of comments (with link to comment page) \n- If photos/video content (yes/no) \n- If verified (yes/no) \n- \"Child\" product being reviewed, also called \"format\" \nThe tool will need to scrape all the review pages until the very first review. This process make take some time to process. Therefore, I recommend it is completed asynchronously. Upon submission, the request could be entered into a queue. The user is returned to a page with a random value appended into the URL string. The user can bookmark and return to that page later (similar concept used here: [url removed, login to view]). On the server, we can create a cronjob to execute every 5 minutes to process new requests. \nWhen complete, the user can see the data in a list format. Can copy similar Amazon format: [url removed, login to view] \nReviews are sorted by date, with most recent at the top. \nThere should be some input options at the top (with a Submit button to refresh) to filter results: \n- Hide/Show Verified reviews (toggle) \n- Hide/show each star (checkbox for each) \n- Filter to select from specific child variation (or \"All\") \nThere should also be a summary at the top of the page: \n- Total number of review (together with total verified and total unverified) \n- Total number of votes per star rating (again with same breakdown of verified and unverified). Mockup: [url removed, login to view]",

Heres His New Pick \nA secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here . \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nThis podcast was recorded on Nov. 1, 2016. \nVincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market each day. It is Tuesday, Nov. 1, and I'm your host, Vincent Shen. With me is Asit Sharma, who isjoining us viaSkype. How are you, sir? \nAsit Sharma: I'm doing well,Vince! Thank you very much for asking. \nShen: Did youdress up for Halloween? \nSharma: I have to mention really quick for our listeners, Halloween was just OK. I dressed upas awerewolf, but a retired werewolf. I had to give the kids in the neighborhoodsome life advice, but they didn't respondthat well. They were like, \"Justgive me the candy.\" \nShen: Howabout your two boys, did they dress up? \nSharma: Three boys! This was the first year -- they're 17, 15 and 13. This was the first year theydidn't really dress up,but they orchestrated hiding in the bushesand scaring some other teens that came by, and handing out candy to the smaller kids. That was good to see. \nShen: OK, sothey're at that age, and I'm sure the youngest is influenced by his older brothers, where it's not cool to get dressed up anymore. \nSharma: Yeah. He's onthe fence, maybe next year. How about you? Did youhave a good Halloween? \nShen: Yeah,pretty uneventful, quiet.At least the day of. Then, over the weekend, I was just home with family, which was nice. So,not as much dressing up for me, either, actually. \nSo, Asit,you brought up to me some of thesupertrends that we talked about in previous episodes. There wascustomization,then there was,on the flip side of that, simplification, SKUrationalization, last time I had you on the show. For our third supertrend, you hadidentified, in the consumer retail world, loyalty programs and theirvery rapid proliferation in the past20 or 30 years. Think credit cards, supermarkets, airlines,restaurants, online retailers. Everyone has jumped on this bandwagon. ButI was actually very surprised to learn that these programs have beenaround for way longer than most people realize,I think. And they did not start, definitely, with airlines and credit cards. \nSharma: I was surprised, too, doing a little bit of research. Loyalty programs date back,apparently, to the Revolutionary War periodin the United States. Both before and after the war, coins often came into acute shortages, so folksproduced these copper tokens,and you would use the tokens to buymerchandise, the goods thatyou needed to get through the week. Afterthe coins would resume in circulation, some savvy merchants startedhanding out tokens with purchases. After you had amassed a certain amount oftokens, you could trade those in for goods. Does that sound familiar? \nShen: Thatsounds pretty familiar to me. The coins that you mention,I couldn't believe it dates all the way back to the Revolutionary War period, buteventually the coins gave way to other forms of tokens, like stamps, box tops, which were stillaround when I was a kid, paper coupons and more. I think, the more modern age of theloyalty program movementdefinitely was ushered in with the airline industry. American Airlines introduced itsfrequent flyer program in 1981.United Airlinesvery quickly followed suit. Whenwe look at these loyalty programs, the core idea behind such an offering is that they getcustomers to come back over and overagaintypically with the allure ofsome type of award or benefit. \nOn the flip side, I think it's really important as investors to look at what thesecompanies get out of offering such programs. Airline industries are a really goodexample of that, especially in early years. They had an issue,especially if you think back to flying 30 to 40 years ago, wheretravel agents dominated the industry. They were the ones that you contacted as a traveler,as a consumer, if you needed a flight for a vacation or a business trip. The airlines feltvery far removed from their own customers,and the loyalty programs, the frequent flyer programs that theycreated in the early eighties were a way ofre-establishing that connection. And, to get a much better view oftravel patterns, price points, things along those lines. I think that expansion, that data element of itand the insights that it offers intocustomer behavior is super important, and is the main driver behind whyloyalty programs in general have become this huge trend across consumer retail and other industries. What do you think? \nSharma: Man,you brought up so many great points there, where do I start? Let me start with the main takeaway from what you just said. There'sanother term that we use, which is more in vogue with the industry,rather than loyalty programs we call theseaffinity programs. If you were to look these two wordsup in the dictionary,loyalty meansstanding by somebody, being there for them. Affinityis a little bit more subtle of a concept. It means that you have a sympathetic view of something, or you havesomething that you like, you share with somebody. Whatyou're talking about isreciprocity betweenbrands and consumersthat happens when you havesomething the consumer can get out of the equation, and on the flip side,something that the manufacturer/retailer can get out of it. That'swhat we saw out of the airlines. They increased frequency flights, made more money, and consumers,with those miles, were able to travelto see things they hadn't seen before. That's a really powerful reason to show up with an affinity program for your customers. \nDiving into your second point, we like to look at why things are super trends. Loyalty hascome up very strongly in the last couple years due to the availability of big data to retailers. Retailers nowcan create customized dashboards. These dashboards don'tjust give aggregate statistics. They can drill down to the personal level. So, they can look at Asit Sharma, and have a profile of his sex, his age, their best guesses at his income, andon that same dashboard, combine that with statistics of how much he purchasesevery week or every month. Most of the companies that areout there offering affinity programsdon't do this themselves, they hirethird-party software companies which specialize in CRM -- customer relationship management -- software to do this. This is why the trend hasexploded and become a supertrend, because you can really operate on a much more precise levelas a retailer,and you can then drive thebehaviors you wantusing the data you collect. \nShen: Yeah,I think the benefits of that big dataand the insight thatthe companies get on the customers andhow to basically push them to come back, and when they're there, to buy more, or to make that purchase in the first place, is very powerful. Just to give listeners some context into how much this super trend has grown,at this point, there are over 3 billion loyalty memberships in theUnited States. The average Americanis a member of 13 of these different programs, and isusually active on about half of those. If you just look at your keys or in your wallet, I'm sure you can see,between your supermarket, your credit cards,and maybe some other membership cards you have hanging from your keys, there are a lot of these programs,all across every facet of your life. \nThe twocompanies that we wanted to focus ontoday, and what they're doing in terms of --in one case, catching up with the competition;in the second case, using the data and this loyalty program to recover their business. The first isDunkin' Donuts. I think when it comes to aquick breakfast, coffee, theirbigger competitor being Starbucks has really set a very, very high bar forwhat a loyalty program can look like, and also howincredibly successful it can be. So, what has Dunkin' Donuts beendoing in its approach to this supertrend? \nSharma: Dunkin' Donuts is probably,for a long time, going to be the red-headed stepchild compared toStarbucks. Starbucks hasover 12 million customers in its own rewards program. But Dunkin' Brands has over 5 million,and that's actually pretty robust when you look at itssmaller footprint globallycompared to Starbucks. The program itselfis pretty simple. It's called DD Perks. It combinesphysical cards with a mobile app,which also has an order aheadfeature. You get 5 pointsfor every dollar you spend. Once you accumulate 200 points,you get a free beverage. We want to break down todaywith that type of mathematical interchangeof reciprocitythat I talked about on both sides. This is a great example. If it takes you about $40 to get that first reward, and you choose areward of a medium latte, that's going to run you $3 to $4based on the options. So, about 10% of the purchase that you made leading up to that reward can be seen as a discount. So,Dunkin Donuts is offering about a 10% discount on itsproducts by having you come back. But,what they've gotten out of you, the customer is ninerepeat visits after that first one. \nVince,this goes back to a larger stat thatI also found doing research. On average, retailers,if they have a loyalty program, will get,over the lifetime of a customer, about 10 times theinitial purchase. So,some customers aren't going to use their loyalty cards. As you pointed out,they just stay in the wallet and are never used. But some of us arereally loyal to the brands we love. So, theeconomics work out on both sides of that equation. \nShen: Yeah. I think that the 10% youmentioned is probably something that a lot of people are used to. I think back to a lot of the bodegas,when I was living in New York, a lot of these sandwich shops, you go there,you go for lunch, you spenda certain amount, call it $10, and theystamp a very simple card for you that I kept in my wallet. After 10 of those, I would get a free$10 meal. It comes out to around 10% off.I know that Starbucks recently, for example, changed the way that their program works. You built up andaccumulated rewards. And there were some complaints from that, but overall, basing itin terms of dollars spent instead of visits issomething that allows the company tocontrol that a little bit more carefully. \nSharma: Right. There's a stepbeyond the basic economics. Once you get your program rolling and have anappreciable membership, which is, how does it relate to the overall strategy for your company? Dunkin' Brands has beenexcellent in the way they have implemented their DD Perks program. They now see it aspart of their overall strategy. In fact, I think it's one of the four pillars,digital strategy. I want to quotefrom CEO Nigel Travis from earlier this year, he said, \"Our goal is toprovide our guestswith targeted offers through our perksloyalty program that arerelevant to them to drive visits and tickets.\" This is step No. 2: Once youincentivize the visits, then you want to drive the trafficfurther, and you want to target the customer. I talked earlier about the customer relationship management dashboard that a company like Dunkin' Brands can use. They want to extend this concept a little further. They have a concept they call one-to-one marketing, which you'll come across if you're into the retail business. This means they want to have that personal relationship with you, and be able to activate you when sales, let's say in the morning rush hour, are lagging during the quarter. They want to activate an army of loyal customers to bring those numbers up. So, you can imagine, thousands of points of one-to-one marketing is how they achieve this. \nNow,some of our listeners, readers of Wired and other information magazines,remember that a couple years ago, it was in vogue to say thatemail was going away. But anyone who participates in a loyaltyprogram knows that email is going to be here for a long time,because you get a ton of emailsfrom these companies. It's a very effective way for them to, through text messaging, through emails,to activate you toward a certain behavior. So, strategically,again, get the program rolling,and then see how you can architectmass behavioralmost at will. That's the end goal for DD Perks, and that's whyI think Dunkin' Donuts has one of the best programs out there in the marketplace,because they really think of it,they have this overarching view of mass customer behavior,and how that can affect their revenue and profits. \nShen: OK.I want to take our conversation now to our second company. Whereas Dunkin' Brands has,I think, instituted a very competitive programeven against a very well-establishedincumbent with its ownvery competitive and successfuloffering, we haveChipotle. Chipotle obviously hasexperienced a ton of challenges, we've talked about them on the show previously together,in the past year, with food safety scandals. Over the summer,July, August, and September, they had their temporaryChiptopia program. During those three months,essentially, based on the frequency with which you visited their locations, you could reachone of three tiers: mild, medium, or hot. Each one came with its own benefits. Going four times in a month,you would reach mild status. Another four times on top of that, medium. Another four times on top of that, you'd reach hot. \nThe big carrot that they offered to members of Chiptopia were the catered meal for 20. Basically,if you can reach hot status with 12 visits each month for each month of the program,at the end of the program, they will give you acatered meal for 20,which is about a $240 value. I think this was obviously reservedfor the real die-hard fans. With this show, today, I was with my brother over the weekend,he mentioned that he had just recently eatenhis last free mealthat he got from Chiptopia. I thinkhe was a regular medium level member over the three months. But, 75,000people actually managed to reach that hot status, and to get that catered meal for 20. 75,000 people, a $240 value.I think the company said that over the next six months, they'regoing to have to give out about $18 million in free food,on top of the approximately $2 million infree burritos those customers were already getting,assuming you're paying about $9 per meal. \nTheprogram overall attracted about 6 million people, with2.5 million actually earningrewards through the program. What were your thoughts on Chiptopia? The company recently released earnings -- the stock took quite a hit,I think they're down about 11% since theyrelease earnings last week. What do youthink about the program? Anddo you think this will be a preview of somethingthey establishon a more permanent basis in terms of a loyalty program? \nSharma: First, on a personal level, I reached medium status in our household. Myyoungest is a Chipotle freak. We didn't obtain the highestreward simply because I had to say no after a while. But this,I think if you extrapolate this,I think it's very indicative of Chipotle's approach and how it's very different from Dunkin's.Chipotle started with the premise thatwe do have this core of really loyal customers. So,they weren't trying to build loyalty. They hit a rough patchwith theirnorovirus and E. coli scare, and they're stillmodeling in the revenue trough,honestly. So their proposition was, why don't we --I'm going to use this key word today -- activatesome of these loyal customers. If you are a casual eater of Chipotleand happened to look at the rewards chart that Vince was talking about, it reallyrewarded very frequent visits. It wasn't really just a dollar spend. You had to show up at Chipotle. What they were trying to do wasrekindle the fire and enthusiasm of their peak visitors. This is one of the reasons, in the first place, to institute a loyalty program. It's much cheaper to get acurrent customer to spend again than it is togo out and acquire a new customer. So,for Chipotle, this made all the more sense. AndI think this was a tremendous cost they undertook. I, too, was really surprised by those statistics, hearing them on the conference call. Yet,it's exactly what Chipotle needed to do, which was to solidify --if I can use this phrase in the political season --they needed to solidify their base.This cost they're incurring now is really an investment instabilizing of revenue. As they additems to their menu, they'll be able to have newer customers come on. \nBut,my personal take is,it was a very appropriate action for Chipotle. I'm going to make a prediction that we'll see a revival of Chiptopia. It may not be called that. But you'll see a program leaning towardrewarding frequency. Chipotle wants you back in the stores. It's a little less concerned in the near-term with how much you spend. They want you to have thatexperience so that you begin to build a deeper innate trust in their product once again,just like they enjoyed before all this food scare came and walloped the company. \nShen: Yeah. There's some good points there that I want to touch on,especially with the idea ofsolidifying their base. I really likethat because, in the end, abehavior they saw in some of their customer base was,they had some really die-hard fans. As a result of the food safety scares, some of those die-hard fans stopped coming. The idea was, \"Let's offer this veryattractive program in Chiptopia, and bring these people back,hopefully reestablishing what was a habit for some of ourbiggest and most loyal customers.\"I have a quote here from chief marketing and development officer Mark Crumpacker. In terms of the loyalty benefit that Chiptopia offered, he said, \"Throughout the course of the promotion,we saw increased transaction and frequency levels. But most important, we'venewly returned to pre-crisis levelsamong our most loyalcustomers. After the completion of the program, we anticipated traffic to fall slightly, but we've instead seen ourimproved sales levelsgenerally continue to hold, which is very encouraging.\" \nOn that loyalty side, obviously,these affinity programs or loyalty programskeep the customers coming back. In this case,with the rewards of free food. But on the flip side of that, too, Mark Crumpacker goes on to speak to the data benefit as well forhow the company is leveragingsome of the transactional data that it was able to accumulate. He said, \"Bycombining transactional information with other customer data,we are now able to identifymore than half of our customers and reach them withspecific offers and tailored messages. This important breakthrough not only allows us to target messages andoffers to current and lapsed customers, but it also allows us to accurately measure the effectiveness of those efforts by tracking return visits.\" So,just like you had mentioned with Dunkin' Brands,here's a case where that one-to-one marketing, being able to cater your marketing, your promotions, to each customer,you're much better able to do thatthe more you know about them, the more you knowabout their buying behavior at your business. \nSharma: I totally agree, Vince. I want to add to that that the food scare took away one ofChipotle's greatest weapons. It enjoyedextremely elastic pricingbefore all this happened. Customers loved the productso much, they could consistently raise, in smallincrements, prices,let's say the beef burrito, et cetera. That has really been impactedby a decrease in trust and a real reservation of customers to come back. So, fighting in the trenches with their mostloyal customers, is a way,if you look at a P&L [profit and loss] statement, it's one way tocompensate for margins that might be a little squeezed. Especially, we know Chipotlehas a higher labor costs, a higher food wastecomponent now,as it's trying to ensure that they are a place that you canreturn to with a 100% degree of confidence. Theyhave to find another way to be able to nudge margin up. This is the beginning of a long process which will enable them to get there, this data mining. It really,in the future, becomes about volumeand margin. At the point where they can combineboth of those,in other words, let's say they have some new menu introductions which, there's an uptakeof their most loyal customers. Maybe the chorizo continues to become a popular burrito filling,or they introduced yet anotherfilling. That'sgoing to be for them the samedegree of margin leveragethat they had when it was easy for themto raise prices. So, I think there's a lot going onin what you just mentionedand the quote you gave to us. Long-term holders of Chipotleshould watch for this,watch these frequency numbers. I think they'll be talking aboutthem on conference callsfor many quarters to come. \nShen: Yes. Finaltakeaways before we wrap uphere. In terms of the most recentearnings that came out last week,with the stock trading downdouble-digits since then,some of you were probably very disappointed in thecontinued double-digit declines foroverall revenue, comparable sales, foottraffic, operating margins are at half the prior-year levels. Asit, you had touched on those. I think, the95% decline in incomewas probably particularly painful fora lot of shareholders. But, there's a lot of potential here as well in what Chipotle is adopting, what they'repursuing. You mentionedsome of the rising costs with labor, food,food disposal and waste. But I think they announced about $100million in cost-cutting measures. Also, something else that had investors concerned was, they'reending their ShopHouse Kitchen concept.I think there's 15 locations in three markets. Theyfailed to gain traction. A bigproponent of growththat investors believed Chipotle offered was the fact that they could take thesuccess of the flagship chain and apply it tonew concepts. Still, the company still has their pizza and their new burger concepts to pursue. I think, for 2017in general, the company has a much morepositive outlook in terms of comparable sales, the restaurant-level operating marginsshould recover quite well,and they'll just have better comparisons overallas the company laps some of its lows from early 2016. \nOne more thing touching on the data -- one more quote from Mr. Crumpacker. He said, \"Forexample, using the data, we now know thatduring the last six months, we saw nearly 30 millionnew customers at Chipotle. These new customers arecustomers we have not seen since the food safety events of last year. In fact, transactionsfrom these customers account for nearly halfof all transactions over the last six months. Additionally,we know how many of these customers returned to Chipotle foradditional visits, and how many of them became regular customers.\"I think that kind of information -- and, that 30 millionnumber is very encouraging. Overall, despite some of the negativereception from the earnings,Chipotle is in an improving position, absolutely, following their troubles in this year. \nSharma: Yeah,I am of the same mind. Really briefly, you know how you look at a stock chart that's spread out five years, and you kick yourself for selling a stock when it was down, or maybe you bought it when it was low priced and nowit has gone up a lot and you've sold it, the same phenomenon is occurring here with Chipotle. It's very hard to see, with the trees right in front of us,how many good things are going on in terms ofbetter operations, in terms of the datathat we've been talking about in this episode that they are definitely mining, the new customers. Butall these factorswill combine over the longer term, and they will come out of this withstronger revenue. And I believe that margins will recover. \nI want to make one lastpoint, too, about the ShopHouse concept. I was sort of disappointed, too. Butlook at it from management's perspective. I remember management said, a couple years ago in a conference call, that for them, when a fieldmanager walks into a ShopHouse kitchen,he or she does not see the ShopHouse. He or she sees a Chipotle. So,it's a matter of finding the right concept, and then expanding that one. Investors don't wantChipotle to throwgood money after bad. If they find a concept isn't getting traction, as you said, shelve it. There are a number of other concepts in the fast-casual space thatthey can put their operational model to. AndI believe they're going to do that. I'm not really that fazed about it long term. I did like the ShopHouse concept,and I enjoyed eating there.So, again, on a personal level, that was sort of bad. \nShen: That's all the time we have for today. Thank you, Asit, for joining me!

      "text": "Who would have thought just a few short years ago that Amazon would be blazing all sorts of new trails in the consumer electronics hardware business? The company started with tablets, a safe bet, and then it released the biggest bomb that the smartphone market has ever seen. Amazon's recovery was quick though, and now the biggest electronics companies on the planet are chasing its newer products such as the Amazon Echo speaker and the Echo Dot.\nAlexa isn't the only thing cooking at Amazon, though. The company's $5 Dash buttons have been a huge hit with consumers. They let users place a physical button anywhere they like, and a single tap will order a specific product tied to each button. So, for example, tapping your \"Tide\" Dash button will instantly order more laundry detergent. But wait, did we say $5? For two days only, Amazon is offering each and every one of its 200+ Dash buttons for just $0.99 each with our special promo code BGRBUTTONS .\n(more…) \nTrending right now: \nWatch President-elect Donald Trump’s full victory speech Here is every single one of the 100 Pokemon Niantic just added to Pokemon Go Evidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone ",

      "text": "Powered by Alexa, Amazon's personal digital assistant, the Echo Wireless Speaker is one of Amazon's most ambitious devices. To celebrate its 2-year anniversary, Amazon and select retailers are offering the rarely-discounted Echo speaker for just $180. More Amazon’s Echo Speaker is a cross between Siri and a jukebox with the brainpower to pay your mortgage , read the latest news headlines, and naturally, order items directly from Amazon . Behind the Echo is Alexa, Amazon’s Siri-like digital assistant, which just celebrated her second birthday. As part of the celebration, Amazon and Best Buy are taking $40 off the $180 device — a deal rarely seen — for one day only.\nIn its simplest form, the Echo is a cylindrical, wireless speaker that stands about 9 inches tall. Using the Alexa app, users connect the Echo to their Wi-Fi network and their Amazon account. Within seconds, Echo is up and running. The speaker’s built-in microphone connects you to Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service, a versatile AI capable of controlling nearly your entire home through the power of voice commands.\nFor instance, Echo has access to Amazon’s Prime music service and any music stored in your Amazon account, including digital copies of any CDs you may have ordered from Amazon in the past. That means you can instantly start streaming music directly from the Echo.\nThe Echo can also stream from other popular services like iHeartRadio, Spotify, or Pandora — you’ll have to set them up via the Alexa app for Alexa to access your account.\nTo get Alexa’s attention, you need to call out “Alexa” followed by a command. For instance, “Alexa, play Bloc Party,” will have Alexa stream all songs by the band Bloc Party. While music is streaming, you can give Alexa further commands to raise/lower volume (i.e. “Alexa, volume 5”), skip a song, repeat, pause, and so forth. A few weeks ago, Amazon announced that Echo owners — who are also Prime members — will be able to subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited for just $4 per month, instead of the $8 per month price for non-Echo owners. The catch is you’ll only be able to stream from the Echo device.\nPerformance-wise, we found the speaker’s sound quality is good enough . Bass response isn’t as deep or prominent as other standalone speakers, but other devices don’t speak back to you. It’s good enough for a small room, like a bedroom, or a small living room.\nWhile music is a huge part of the Echo device, Alexa can also answer other questions. You can ask her random fact-based questions (“how fast can a cheetah run”) or measurement conversions. Alexa can also tell you the weather, set up multiple alarms/reminders, and create to-do lists. Alexa also has ambitions of becoming your smart home’s control center . Google-owned Nest announced it’s collaborating with Amazon to give Alexa control of its devices, as is Nest’s rival Vivint. Since its launch in June 2015, Alexa has been supplied with over 300 skills by third party developers . There are even rumors Alexa may receive an update this fall that gives it push notifications .\nMore: Learn how to build your own Amazon Echo\nNo matter how you use it, the Echo is a fun device that quickly becomes like an extended member of the family. For today only, Amazon and Best Buy are offering the rarely-discounted device for just $140.\n$140 on Amazon\nSave as much as $50 on two Amazon Echo Dot bundles you’ll actually want Amazon will offer an Echo-exclusive music streaming plan for $4 or $5 a month Amazon’s music streaming service may be a lot cheaper than Spotify",
