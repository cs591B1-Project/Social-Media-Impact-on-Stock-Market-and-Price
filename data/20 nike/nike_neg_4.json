      "text": "On Feet Recap: The Best of The Nike Air Force 1 on IG November 11, 2016 Posted by: Rob Tags: Nike , Air Force 1 \nIt would be a disservice to Nike ‘s Air Force 1 to say that it’s experiencing a comeback – because it never really left us. The model might have skirted the spotlight at times, but it’s so deeply couched in popular culture that it’s always managed to find favour somewhere. \nIt’s a talent that can be attributed to how versatile the shoe is. We’ve seen the shoe incorporate zips, Air units, Flyknit and Lunarlon. It’s morphed with Jordan DNA, come with vastly exaggerated collar height and, recently, turned utilitarian with the SF Air Force 1. \nThe newest release has edged the Uptown into the spotlight once more. And, since we’re always looking for any excuse to perve on sneakers, we’ve decided to collate some of the best on-foot shots of the AF1 on IG. Think of the following as a how-to guide on how to wear this court classic in modern times. ",

      "text": "Tweet 0 shares / likes \nNike Brazil is planning a major restock for November 26th, the day after Black Friday, so does this mean that we’re in for another surprise from Nike.com and Nike SNKRS here in the states? All signs are pointing to the affirmative as Nike Brazil is restocking a random assortment of the year’s past releases highlighted by the Air Jordan 11 Low “Metallic Gold”. The eclectic release slate also features the HTM collaborative efforts of the Air Max LD-Zero, The Air Max 90 Superfly, and Air Max Ultra. The real story here is that rumors are swirling about the availability of the Acronym Nike Presto trio and the Supreme Air Max 98 , each slated to arrive on the same day. \nIt’s still unknown what exactly Nike is planning for their November 26th release slate here in the states – it would make sense for NSW to bring back two of their most sought after collaborations of 2016 right before the year’s end for a nice holiday surprise – but only time will tell. You can check out the Swoosh’s Holiday 2016 plans in full by heading over to our always-updated release dates page .

      "text": "Nike's new store in New York City is loaded with tech Think: a Kinect-powered basketball court. Share Save \nSoHo is one of the trendiest neighborhoods in New York City. It's home to hundreds of shops from some of the most popular brands, including Apple, Adidas and, as of last month , Google. Now you can add Nike to this list. The sportswear giant will soon open a five-story, 55,000-square-foot space loaded with technology, from 3D-printed decorations (pictured above) to a Kinect-powered basketball court. There are also other simple, yet useful, things such as Apple Pay support and large touchscreens on walls that help you call an associate or buy products on the spot. \nSean Madden, senior director of service and experiences for Nike's direct-to-consumer division, says the tech inside the store isn't meant to be the main attraction. Instead, he says these features are designed to make the shopping experience more personal. With the hoop, for example, the Kinect sensors are there to capture movements from your body and display those on a massive screen in front of you. That being said, the idea is obviously that you'll use that area to try on shoes you may be interested in buying. \nI went inside the store, which happens to be near Engadget's NYC office. Here's what else I came across during my tour. Gallery: Inside Nike's new SoHo store in New York City | 7 Photos 7",

      "text": "News Community members protest Nike’s new Soho superstore The popular athletic brand was forced to rescheduled their planned Veteran’s Day grand opening due to permit issues Rec Courtesy of Bowery Boogie After years of speculation and wondering whether Nike was indeed the future tenant of 529 Broadway’s retail space, the popular brand confirmed all doubts with their plans for a grand opening at the new Nike Soho superstore on Veteran’s Day. However, protest from community members on Thursday and a rescinded Department of Buildings (D.O.B) permit resulted in the store rescheduling its debut, leaving hundreds of anxious shoppers upset, reports the Villager . In 2013, the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave the proposed reconstruction of the building that once housed the historic Prescott House hotel within the landmarked Cast Iron district the thumbs up . However, protesters rallied outside of the D.O.B’s headquarters at 280 Broadway claiming, among other things, that the site’s M1-5 zoning did not allow for Nike’s 55,000-square-foot space and that the behemoth store jeopardizes the neighborhood’s historic character. We’ll bring the best of Nike to NYC at our Soho store but have pushed the open out b/c of permitting issues. We’ll share the new date soon. — Nike NYC (@NikeNYC) November 11, 2016 The rally drew support from local elected officials that included Councilmember Margaret Chin, Assemblymember Deborah Glick, state Senator Daniel Squadron and Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer. The D.O.B. snatched away Nike’s permit to open, but not because of the protests. Apparently, the agency wanted to certify the five-story building’s electrical and plumbing. Nike apologized to the eager shoppers that lined up for hours to experience opening day and to get their hands on the company’s latest exclusive sneaker. The brand will also issue $200 gift certificates for the inconvenience. No word yet on when the grand opening will be rescheduled.",

      "text": "Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter Sign-Up \nGoodbye, “Someday.” \nMoments after the drought-stricken Chicago Cubs clinched their first World Series championship in over a century, Nike aired an ad titled “Someday,” destined to become iconic. \n“Pitcher takes the mound,” says a 12-year-old boy in Cubs uniform, feverishly playing solo baseball as a softly crooned Willie Nelson classic, “Funny How Time Slips Away,” plays in the background. \n“Well, hello there,” sings Nelson. “It’s been a long, long time.” \nAs in 108 years since the last series win for Wrigley’s boys in blue. \nThe boy in the commercial bats, feigns catches, attempts to steal base. He’s the pitcher, now the umpire, calling his game in a sandlot in West Town’s Eckhart Park, Chicago’s skyline as backdrop. \nIt’s gone viral — 1,554,611 views on YouTube so far — and garnered accolades ad infinitum from news outlets and the blogosphere. It is, says Adweek, “a lovely, quiet salute to the positive spirit of the team during its 2016 playoff run.” \nBut who’s the handsome star, with twinkling eyes and dazzling smile, authentic baseball moves drawing on childhood memories, heartstrings? \nBrandon Rogers, a Chicago Public Schools seventh-grader from Wrightwood on the South Side, has dreamed of acting since he was 6, according to his stay-at-home mom, Lisa Rogers, and his dad, Michael Rogers, a Chicago firefighter of 22 years. \nBut Brandon had no acting classes or training nor any previous gigs before knocking this role out of the park. \n“I’ve been acting my whole life,” says a cool and collected Brandon. \nPolite and polished, he looks you in the eye, offers a firm handshake. \n“It was probably about the age of 5, when I began to understand television, that I started dancing and entertaining my family and friends,” he says. “I realized, ‘Oh, my gosh, I think I got something here.’ So I asked my mom, ‘How do you get on television?’” \n“I said, ‘Well, you have to go to acting school,’” his mom says. “He said, ‘Couldn’t you just post my picture or videos?’ He had a great Michael Jackson routine people loved, but I was dead set against social media. Didn’t matter, though. People who saw him perform posted it.” \nIt’s why a friend called her about Nike’s October 2015 casting call, saying Brandon would be perfect for the ad. She took him to audition. \n“There were hundreds of boys, close to 1,000,” she says. “When he came out of the audition, he told me, ‘Mom, I killed it.’ I reminded him there were a lot of boys there. They called him back the next day.” \nAt the second audition, child after child entered a room with producers and director, exiting after few minutes. At Brandon’s turn, he seemed to be in there forever. \n“The director was, like, ‘Can you hold this bat for me? Can you act out pitching? Show me how you dive,’” Brandon says. “They were getting excited. He said, ‘Brandon, you were spectacular. You’re perfect for this role.’ It was almost the best moment of my life.” \nHis parents got the news from the Gill Hayes Talent Agency the next day. \nProduced by Somesuch/Anonymous Content for Portland-based ad agency Wieden & Kennedy, the commercial, after filming that week, sat, waiting, a whole year. It aired minutes after Kris Bryant fielded the final out for the historic, 10-inning 8-7 win over the Cleveland Indians. \n“He’s taking a big leap. He’s playing with the pitcher,” Brandon says, narrating his imaginary game. “He’s going for it. He’s going for it. Whoo! Come on. Right down the middle. Come on. We got this!” \nA home run triggers a celebratory dance. He whirs like a plane. Cubs cap goes in the air. Hands up. Fingers signal his Cubs are No. 1. \n“That’s not acting. In the final cut, they dropped all the scripted material. Anyone who knows my son knows that’s Brandon all day long,” says his dad. Brandon Rogers in the Cubs cap with, from left, his dad Michael, sister Morgan and mom Lisa Rogers at Cinespace Film Studios. | Santiago Covarrubias / Sun-Times \nMichael Rogers proudly shares phone video of Brandon in mad dashes as quarterback of his Chicago Blitz youth football team, at bat for the Cangelosi Black Sox traveling baseball league or sprinting for the University of Chicago track club. \nFor Brandon, the best part of the Nike gig was repping his favorite team and leaving with a haul of Nike gear. He took his 11-year-old sister Morgan on a shopping spree with his earnings. \nIs acting now his thing? \n“I’m just hoping for the best,” he says. “I hope other companies will see me as someone they can put in any role. But I’m still into sports. I want to play professional baseball or football.” ",

      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 3 images from this gallery. \nAfter blacking out the ACG silhouette , Nike’s Lupinek Flyknit is back in a new “Cargo” colorway just in time for the colder days ahead.\nFeaturing a form-fitting Flyknit upper, the shoe’s protective finish and outdoor traction offer copious amounts of warmth and weather resistance. This particular iteration arrives in a cargo, khaki and sequoia color scheme, with leather reinforcing the toebox, mudguard, tongue, sockliner and heel.\nAs always, woven Flyknit yarns integrate areas of high breathability, stretch and support, and a DWR (durable, water-repellent) finish helps keep your feet dry in rainy weather. Additionally, the premium leather mid-cut collar provides extra warmth and supportive comfort.\nThe Nike Lupinek Flyknit is now available in “Cargo” at select retailers like Afew for approximately $270 USD.\n",

      "text": "Nike continues to push the Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 as LeBron James has been wearing the sneaker ever since last season’s playoffs.\nWe’re expected to see more colorways drop this month with one of them being the pair you see above. This colorway of the LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 features a White mesh on the majority of the upper with Hyper Cobalt detailing on the ankle strap, Swoosh branding on the medial and lateral ankles, the LeBron logo on the midfoot strap, and the speckling that is seen on the bottom two straps. We can see definitely see the Kentucky Wildcats rocking these on court.\nLook for this Hyper Cobalt colorway of the Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 at select Nike retailers beginning on November 15th for a box price of $140. Do you plan on copping?\nh/t: SBD\nAuthor’s Take It’s surprising to see how Nike continues to push the LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 instead of the LeBron 13. I’m sure none of us could have even imagined this would happen.\n\nThe post Release Date: Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 Hyper Cobalt appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Just because the Nike Kobe AD is right around the corner doesn’t mean that Nike is done with the Kobe 11. Not just yet. What you see above are the official images of an brand new colorway of the Kobe 11, the Nike Kobe 11 EM Phillipines.\nSpotted at Foot Locker Europe, the Nike Kobe 11 EM Phillipines is done in a clean Deep Royal Blue Engineered Mesh upper nicely offset by the Metallic Gold hits noted on the tongue and panel branding. Even more of the same Gold is spotted via the speckling on the midsole. Inside you will find a tonal Red insole to complete the Phillipines inspiration. No word yet on when these drop stateside but just know that the shoe is now available internationally. Hot or not? Let us know in the comments below.\n \nvia: Nike\nh/t: SC \nAuthor’s Take Very nice. I love Blue sneakers and adding some Gold to it makes them even better. By far my favorite Engineered Mesh constructed Kobe 11 of the year.\n\nThe post Official Images Of The Nike Kobe 11 EM Phillipines appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

The Swoosh logos on the ankle and the LeBron logo on the midfoot strap have both also been done in Midnight Navy. Subtle hits of Game Royal complete this colorway along with an icy blue translucent outsole.\nYou’ll be able to get your hands on the Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 Midnight Navy at select Nike retailers beginning on November 15th for $140.\nh/t: SBD\nAuthor’s Take Make the branding on the upper a different color like white or gold and these would have looked much better. There’s just too much blue.\n\nThe post The Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 Surfaces In Midnight Navy appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Literature / Characters & Settings / Sci-Fi & Fantasy / Profiles New OC: Nike(Here is my newest OC Nike. If you want to rp with her just leave a comment below.)Name: Nike Kolanski Age: 18Nickname/ Alias: MechPersonality: shy and stays out of peoples way. She can however be ruthless and pretty brutal to those she sees as an enemy.Gender: FemaleNationality: EnglishAlignment: Neutral (she is a mercenary.) Powers and abilities: she has a genius level intellect, darkvision, superior senses, strength and speed as well as some mechanical enhancements, she also possesses a brilliant reaction time and a nice healing and protective boost thanks to the nanites in her system. Also thanks to her hyper brain she actually possesses a small psychic ability not that she uses it or has even been trained in it. Skills: she is a brilliant mechanic and can build practically everything and anything she can think of. She is trained in various martial arts and weapon combat techniques to such an extent that she can “read” a person’s move before they make it. She’s also a brilliant hacker. Appearance: she is roughly 6’0ft in height and is relatively slim but in turn is considered quite sexy by others although she doesn’t think so. She has long black hair and brown eyes, she also wears a pair of glasses. Her standard clothing is generally a skirt and some sort of t shirt. Appearance as Alias: she wears a red hooded robe with yellow trim. A suit of armour that simply protects her and provides her with little power advantages. She wears a mask which looks similar to a futuristic gas mask. She also wears a pack and belt with tools and her pack has a pair of mechanical arms that she uses to help her work and to fight with if need be. Weapons: A series of different rifles and pistols she has created over the years which annoys her no end as she can never seem to find the right weapon. She also carries a pair of what are essentially lightsabers and also a stun baton. She generally carries a lot of non-lethal armament as killing is only a final resort for her. Jobs: She is a mercenary who builds robots and commits crimes for the highest bidder however she in turn also stops plans to literally end the world as she actually likes the world in all its broken ways. In civilian life she is currently a university student who works a part time job in an office building as tech support.Backstory: Very little is known about Nike’s real life beyond that she went to school and has always kept in the shadows. Almost all of the records about her have been either deleted or corrupted so nothing can be inferred from them about her. It’s even harder to contact her most of the time. The few times people ever hear of her are normally when her robots are used by another villain or even by governments. Steampunk version(she’s such a suitable character I feel as though she should be in a steampunk rp. If people know of them could you let me know please because I’ve never done it before.)Name: Nike Kolanski Age: 18Nickname/ Alias: MechPersonality: shy and stays out of peoples way. She can however be ruthless and pretty brutal to those she sees as an enemy.Gender: FemaleSexuality: Bi-sexualNationality: EnglishAlignment: Neutral (she doesn’t like to fight too much and as a general rule avoids most people. Powers and abilities: she has a genius level intellect, superior senses, some mechanical enhancements, she also possesses a brilliant reaction time.Skills: she is a brilliant mechanic and can build practically everything and anything she can think of. She is trained in various martial arts and weapon combat techniques.

Weapons: A series of different rifles and pistols she has created over the years which annoys her no end as she can never seem to find the right weapon. She generally carries a lot of non-lethal armament as killing is only a final resort for her. Jobs: She is predominately a freelance engineer and junkyard dealer as she routinely buys scrap from other people to convert into machines. Backstory: Born to a family that lived in the countryside she began to design and build robots as a hobby to keep herself amused most days as both of her parents were out at work during the day and even when she came back from school. She moved away when she was sixteen and began to search for places to live and still travels around now.",

      "text": "Alongside the Spirit of Protection Collection , Nike N7 continues to celebrate Native American Heritage Month by partnering with nine colleges (across men’s and women’s programs).\nDuring select men and women’s basketball games throughout November and December, Florida State, Gonzaga, Haskell Indian Nations University (the only all-native school in the country), Nevada, New Mexico, Marquette, Oklahoma State, San Diego State and Stanford will each wear N7-inspired turquoise uniforms. \nIn case you were not aware, the color turquoise represents harmony, friendship and fellowship in Native American culture.\nEach school will also initiate its own outreach to local Native communities, including basketball camps at Gonzaga, Marquette and Nevada; a Native youth spring field day at Oklahoma State; and Seminole Tribe of Florida youth programs with Florida State.\nSan Diego State works with N7 Fund grantee Inter Tribal Sports to highlight its Native youth sports program, hosting an a basketball camp in the spring. Additionally, the New Mexico men’s and women’s teams auction their uniforms and donation proceeds to local Native American youth organizations.\nThe Nike N7 initiative essentially inspires fellow Native American and Aboriginal youth in North America to participate in sport and physical activity, raises awareness and demystifies stereotypes about Native American culture, as well as to encourage resilience against adversity.\nh/t: Nike \n\nThe post Nike N7 Honors Native American Heritage Month On The Hardwood appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "With the harsh season of winter soon approaching, Nike preps us with an array of fall/winter-appropriate footwear such as this new sneakerboot hybrid — Nike Lunar Force 1 Flyknit Workboot.\nThe iconic Air Force 1 silhouette is essentially revamped with a knitted build that offers more comfort, while weather resistant leather overlays reinforce the modernized upper. Draped in a perfect autumnal deep burgundy finish, black leather swooshes and a full-length Lunar midsole unit with a ground-gripping tread outsole finishes off the sleek, yet rugged profile. \nRetailing for $200, you can purchase this pair at select Nike retailers nationwide now. \nImages: Packer Shoes \nAuthor’s Take I like the hybrid design. This pair is more functional but still stylish. The colorway is pretty appealing in general as well. \n\nThe post Weatherproofing On The Nike Lunar Force 1 Flyknit Workboot appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "The next sneaker in the Nike SB Dunk shoebox series has been unveiled with the Nike SB Dunk Low Pink Box.\nWith the SB Dunk High Silver Box having released last month, Nike now focuses their attention on the SB Dunk Low as this pair draws inspiration from the classic pink Nike SB box that was used back in 2005. This colorway of the popular SB Dunk Low features a pink upper that has reflective 3M qualities all throughout with White accents on the laces, inner liner, and midsole. The Swoosh logos and outsole have then been done in Black to complete the look. The debossed shoe box logo has also been placed by the ankle to denote this shoe as part of the collection.\nThe Nike SB Dunk Low Pink Box is scheduled to release on November 25th 2016 for $100. Will you cop? Stay tuned to Kicks On Fire for official images.\nvia: everysolehassoul \nAuthor’s Take Lots of great SB Dunk released when this pink box was around so I expect hardcore SB fans to pick up this pair. I’m not a hue fanof pink sneakers so I’ll pass on these and wait to see what the next pair looks like.\n\nThe post Release Date: Nike SB Dunk Low Pink Box appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

The moniker that has stuck though, is ‘Sacramento Kings’, referencing the black and purple of the NBA team. In this iteration the three-strap bearing basketball silhouette sits high atop a thick white midsole capped by a translucent outsole. The sneaker is finished with LeBron branding, dual heel Swooshes and a hint of purple peeping out from the lining. \nNo official word on a release date for the Nike LeBron Soldier 10 ‘Sacramento Kings’ as yet.

The moniker that has stuck though, is ‘Sacramento Kings’, referencing the black and purple of the NBA team. In this iteration the three-strap bearing basketball silhouette sits high atop a thick white midsole capped by a translucent outsole. The sneaker is finished with LeBron branding, dual heel Swooshes and a hint of purple peeping out from the lining. \nNo official word on a release date for the Nike LeBron Soldier 10 ‘Sacramento Kings’ as yet.

      "text": "On Feet Recap: The Best of The Nike Air Force 1 on IG November 12, 2016 Posted by: Rob Tags: Nike , Air Force 1 \nIt would be a disservice to Nike ‘s Air Force 1 to say that it’s experiencing a comeback – because it never really left us. The model might have skirted the spotlight at times, but it’s so deeply couched in popular culture that it’s always managed to find favour somewhere. \nIt’s a talent that can be attributed to how versatile the shoe is. We’ve seen the shoe incorporate zips, Air units, Flyknit and Lunarlon. It’s morphed with Jordan DNA, come with vastly exaggerated collar height and, recently, turned utilitarian with the SF Air Force 1. \nThe newest release has edged the Uptown into the spotlight once more. And, since we’re always looking for any excuse to perve on sneakers, we’ve decided to collate some of the best on-foot shots of the AF1 on IG. Think of the following as a how-to guide on how to wear this court classic in modern times.",

This weekend, the eBay fashion team joined thousands of shoppers that attended Sneaker Con NYC as influential collectors and shoppers looked for that perfect sneaker to add to their collections. \n“eBay hosts one of the largest resale markets for sneakers in the world, allowing our buyers to find the perfect pair of sneakers that helps them express their individual style and passion,” said Victoria Perry, eBay’s DMM of Fashion. “At Sneaker Con, we were able to connect with the sneakerhead community, helping them to better understand the value of their shoes through our ‘ What’s It Worth Tool .’ And, we also enabled shoppers to browse from the millions of sneakers that are for sale at any given moment.” \nWith a pair of sneakers sold every five seconds on eBay, the eBay DataLabs team took a look at the past year to see what shoes are the most popular and valuable. \nTop 10 Most Valuable Sneakers: (the most scarce styles)*",

      "text": "To those who remember Nike’s pink box packaging of 2005, widely considered one of the Swoosh’s most stylish shoeboxes ever, this new Dunk Low is going to look very familiar.\nComing as the latest drop in Nike Skateboarding’s shoebox-inspired series, the sneaker pays tribute to the pink box with a reflective pink upper, a shiny black Swoosh and shoebox logo debossed at the heel. It also comes with clean white laces, a black outsole, and a perforated toe box.\nNike SB has yet to release an official release date, but the sneaker is rumored to be releasing on November 25, Black Friday. Check out the pic above, and stay tuned for more information.\nIn other sneaker news, Nike gives the winter-ready Lupinek Flyknit a “Cargo” makeover .\n",

Fox Gala. The first live auction in Shanghai ended at $105,000, while the second auction in London brought in roughly half that amount at $56,000. We expected this auction to sell for high amounts given the fact that this was the last of three live auctions of the self-lacing shoes. Some of the 89 winners who won pairs through the Nike Drawing have sold their pairs on eBay, with some units going for as high as $52,000. \"Air Jordan 11 Premium Grey Suede\" \"Nike Mag\" ",

      "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo to break records with Nike deal and Real Madrid contract Published 24/7 \nCristiano Ronaldo makes a pretty neat profit from the beautiful game. \nNot only has the Portuguese racked up the goals over his 14-year career, but his fair share of hearty wages too. After all, this is a man with almost 500 career strikes to his name and three Ballon d’Ors no less. \nHowever, CR7’s finances appear set for an even bigger boost and one that looks set to shatter numerous records. Forget millions, we’re talking billions. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer? Sign up now and submit a 250-word test article: http://gms.to/haveyoursay Article continues below Unprecedented earnings \nAccording to the Sunday Times , Ronaldo is poised to become the first footballer to earn €100 million, or £86 million, in just one year. \nThis unrivalled cash flow has rooted from the contracts he has signed with Real Madrid and Nike respectively. Consequently, not only have his wages shot up, but his sponsorship deal has received an equally generous boost. Article continues below Gareth Southgate reveals the England player who must cut out the 'stupidity' \nLast week saw the 31-year-old extend his stay at the Santiago Bernabeu for a further five years. The deal saw Ronaldo become Los Blancos’ highest paid player, usurping the record set by Gareth Bale just a week before hand. \nSources close to the Times believe the basic salary entailed sees the Portuguese amass an eye-watering £41.4 million annually. Throw in Nike and you have a nine-figure sum on your hands. \nIn addition, such an economically lucrative combination will see Ronaldo become football’s first ever billionaire. It’s incredible stuff. \nIt’s the latest reminder yet that the money involved in football is getting more and more out of hand. What Ronaldo himself labeled as a ‘penultimate contract’ contains wages that trump most national lotteries after all. Future \nNevertheless, it sets up CR7 for whatever he has planned after football. \nEven if he honours his promise of playing until he’s 41, the day Ronaldo hangs up his boots will eventually arrive. Moreover, while not impossible, it’s hard to imagine him becoming something as mild as a coach or pundit. \nAfter all, with the astonishing currency he possesses and is continuing to reap, the sky is the limit. \nDo you think Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world?

      "text": "No Nike in The End - Puma Signs New Uruguay Kit Deal   Update #4: Puma has extended its Uruguay kit deal to make the jerseys of the South American country until at least 2023. The new deal, which is three times higher than that what Puma paid previously (24 million USD for seven years), also includes bonuses for good results in the World Cup and the Copa America. Puma Extends Uruguay Kit Deal Until 2023 Uruguay x Nike. Update #3 Uruguayan newspaper Ovación this week reported that Tenfield, who holds the rights to market Uruguay's shirt until December 31, informed the Uruguayan football federation that Puma will match the offer by Nike in order to continue to make the jerseys of the South American country. Puma Equals Nike Offer, But It's Still Likely That Nike Will Make Uruguay's Kits from 2017 However, as there was already a vote that decided that Nike would become Uruguay's jersey supplier, Ignacio Alonso from Uruguay's football federation said that \"we (the Executive Council) will pass this to the area of legal advisers and they will tell us what we must demand to ratify the intention of the note presented by Tenfield to match the offer Nike.\" More is expected to follow in the coming days. Update #2: Uruguayan media is reporting that Nike won the vote to become the national team's new kit supplier, by 10 votes to 9. #AUF | ¡Ganó el sí por Nike! Rampla Juniors definió por el sí, por lo que ganó por 10 a 9. — Ovación (@Ovaciondigital) 23. August 2016 Update: Uruguay's football federation has postponed the vote to decide if Nike becomes become the new kit supplier of the Albiceste until Tuesday. Juventud de Las Piedras, a team who have a contract with current rights holder Tenfield, left the room and declined to participate in the vote. Uruguay's Football Federation will decide this night if they will go apart with long-term shirt supplier Puma and accept the offer from US-giant Nike, which is 5 times higher than Puma's offer according to Uruguayan newspaper Ovación . Nike to Become Uruguay's kit supplier from 2017 Uruguay x Nike. The German company Puma will be the supplier of Uruguay's shirt until 31 December 2016, while on the first day of 2017 the situation will change as the Uruguayan Football Federation will get the right back to look for a new shirt supplier. This right currently belongs to Tenfield, who granted the concession to Puma. Nike offers the Uruguayan football federation 24 million USD for seven years, while it's reported that Puma just offers 5 million USD for seven years. To decide whether Nike or Puma will become Uruguay's new jersey supplier, there will be a vote tonight with 19 votes, from which 16 belong to the first division clubs who will also get a share from the money received from the deal. Would you like to see Nike making Uruguay's jerseys from 2017 onwards? Let us know in the comments below and find out more here .",

      "text": "Due to certain permitting issues, the grand opening of Nike SoHo — a new five-story, multi-sport, 55,000-square-foot retail experience — located at 529 Broadway at Spring Street in Manhattan, has been delayed until further notice . It was originally scheduled for this past Friday (Veteran’s Day).\nOne of the store’s key destinations consists of the fifth floor, which features a Nike+ Basketball Trial Zone that spans nearly an entire half court, with an adjustable hoop, 23-foot ceilings and a multifunctional digital video screen — projecting hallowed NYC courts like those at Dyckman Park in Washington Heights and Brooklyn Bridge Park.\nThe immersive experience provides one-of-a-kind opportunities to showcase product benefits that answer each consumer’s individual sport needs, with the help of in-store certified athletes. The trial zone is available with or without an appointment, and visits are tracked through scanning each guest’s Nike+ app pass — displaying his or her name while in action, and documenting the results of the experience for future visits.\nNike plans to open another store similar to Nike SoHo in Miami in mid-December.\nStay tuned. \nh/t: Nike \n\nThe post Nike SoHo Offers An Innovative Basketball Trial Zone appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "The dogs of Adidas and Under Armour are nipping at Nike's heels. Facebook/Nike \nThe sportswear melee has only just begun. \nNike's spot at the top of the sportswear pyramid seems more perilous that ever before, with a weak indicators of future sales including less orders from retails and piling up inventory in their latest quarterly report \nAdidas and Under Armour are making significant gains on Nike, each launching new products and new categories to carve their own pieces of the growing sportswear pie. \nMeanwhile, Nike's market share in both shoes and apparel seems to be declining . \nWhich of the brands has the best chance of challenging Nike's dominance? Let's take a look at the top two competitors. The case for Under Armour \nUnder Armour's footwear business is poised to be a major player in the future if current growth is maintained. Facebook/Under Armour \nUnder Armour has been a hot company with growth in the past two years in the 30% range year over year. In the most recent earnings call, the company beat profit expectations, but warned the pace of growth will slow through 2017 and 2o18 when considering the explosive growth the company experienced since 2009. \nThat considered, the company is a huge presence on the market and is on track to be a sportswear giant in its own right. Though its its 2015 worldwide net revenue was a mere $3.96 billion compared to Adidas' $18 billion (and both trailing Nike's gigantic $30 billion), its business is mostly in the US where its simple and technological approach to sportswear has resonated with consumers. It's 2016 net revenue is still projected to be nearly $5 billion \nOriginally not a footwear powerhouse, its new basketball shoe line has gained some notoriety, while being attached to one of the youngest and most well-known players of the sport, Steph Curry. As a result, net revenue from footwear grew 58% year-over-year as reported in the company's latest earnings report. \nUnder Armour, which usually sells its products under Nike's, has also made an effort to move its products upmarket with a new fashion-oriented sportswear line designed with Tim Coppens. The case for Adidas \nAdidas has had a strong and aggressive resurgence on the American market. Facebook/Adidas \nLast week, Adidas passed Under Armour to retake the spot of the second biggest sportswear company in the US. This is a huge milestone for the company, which was previously struggling to maintain market share in the country after previously losing touch with American tastes, losing sponsorship deals to Nike, and failing to make much of its $3.8 billion acquisition of Reebok in 2005. \nLosing market share was a wake-up call for the German giant, as it is further entrenched than its American competitor, has been around for a lot longer than UA's young 20 years of life, and has nearly quadruple its revenue worldwide. \nAdidas has been looking to turn that around in recent years with a refocusing on the American market started by Adidas President of North America Mark King started in 2014, and a renewed call to take on Nike by its new CEO, Kasper Rorsted. \nAdidas has opened a new design lab in Nike's hometown of Portland, Oregon, launched new high-priced models that gets sneakerheads talking like the UltraBoost with celebrity spokespeople, and repositioned heritage models as fashion icons — the most famous and successful being the Stan Smith. \nIt also signed high profile partnerships like Kanye West's Yeezy line, and have been aggressive in pursuing endorsement deals for other teams. For apparel, Adidas has refreshed its offerings and leaned into athleisure with an upmarket line called Zne . \nUS sales were up 26% for Adidas according to the second quarter earnings report, with no signs of slowing down soon. Does any of this matter? \nNike still has a lot of room to run before either Adidas or Under Armour get anywhere close to catching it. The company has an ambitious plan to reach $50 billion in worldwide revenue by 2020, powered largely by a rapidly expanding direct to consumer business. To achieve this, it will expand its store base in new ways, focused on attentiveness to making the customer experience more personal, buoyed by a more robust digital pr essence in the form of its personalized digital platform, Nike+. \nHowever, if any company is shrink that gap by a meaningful amount, it would be the aggressive Adidas with its triple threat of diversity of well-received product, high-profile endorsements, and celebrity hype. Adidas is on track to continue its growth streak in the US market. Under Armour will expand sales and marginally market share, while still being meaningful threat to both of the bigger companies. \nBut if we're talking about who has a bigger shot at taking more market share from the Oregonian giant, Adidas has all the momentum right now.",

      "text": "(The dogs of Adidas and Under Armour are nipping at Nike's heels.Facebook/Nike) \nThe sportswear melee has only just begun. \nNike's spot at the top of the sportswear pyramid seems more perilous that ever before, with a weak indicators of future sales including less orders from retails and piling up inventory in their latest quarterly report\nAdidas and Under Armour are making significant gains on Nike, each launching new products and new categories to carve their own pieces of the growing sportswear pie.\nMeanwhile, Nike's market share in both shoes and apparel seems to be declining .\nWhich of the brands has the best chance of challenging Nike's dominance? Let's take a look at the top two competitors.\nThe case for Under Armour (Under Armour's footwear business is poised to be a major player in the future if current growth is maintained.Facebook/Under Armour) \n\nUnder Armour has been a hot company with growth in the past two years in the 30% range year over year. In the most recent earnings call, the company beat profit expectations, but warned the pace of growth will slow through 2017 and 2o18 when considering the explosive growth the company experienced since 2009.\nThat considered, the company is a huge presence on the market and is on track to be a sportswear giant in its own right. Though its its 2015 worldwide net revenue was a mere $3.96 billion compared to Adidas' $18 billion (and both trailing Nike's gigantic $30 billion), its business is mostly in the US where its simple and technological approach to sportswear has resonated with consumers. It's 2016 net revenue is still projected to be nearly $5 billion\nOriginally not a footwear powerhouse, its new basketball shoe line has gained some notoriety, while being attached to one of the youngest and most well-known players of the sport, Steph Curry. As a result, net revenue from footwear grew 58% year-over-year as reported in the company's latest earnings report.\nUnder Armour, which usually sells its products under Nike's, has also made an effort to move its products upmarket with a new fashion-oriented sportswear line designed with Tim Coppens.\nThe case for Adidas (Adidas has had a strong and aggressive resurgence on the American market.Facebook/Adidas) \n\nLast week, Adidas passed Under Armour to retake the spot of the second biggest sportswear company in the US. This is a huge milestone for the company, which was previously struggling to maintain market share in the country after previously losing touch with American tastes, losing sponsorship deals to Nike, and failing to make much of its $3.8 billion acquisition of Reebok in 2005.\nLosing market share was a wake-up call for the German giant, as it is further entrenched than its American competitor, has been around for a lot longer than UA's young 20 years of life, and has nearly quadruple its revenue worldwide.\nAdidas has been looking to turn that around in recent years with a refocusing on the American market started by Adidas President of North America Mark King started in 2014, and a renewed call to take on Nike by its new CEO, Kasper Rorsted. \nAdidas has opened a new design lab in Nike's hometown of Portland, Oregon, launched new high-priced models that gets sneakerheads talking like the UltraBoost with celebrity spokespeople, and repositioned heritage models as fashion icons — the most famous and successful being the Stan Smith.\nIt also signed high profile partnerships like Kanye West's Yeezy line, and have been aggressive in pursuing endorsement deals for other teams. For apparel, Adidas has refreshed its offerings and leaned into athleisure with an upmarket line called Zne .\nUS sales were up 26% for Adidas according to the second quarter earnings report, with no signs of slowing down soon.\nDoes any of this matter? Nike still has a lot of room to run before either Adidas or Under Armour get anywhere close to catching it. The company has an ambitious plan to reach $50 billion in worldwide revenue by 2020, powered largely by a rapidly expanding direct to consumer business. To achieve this, it will expand its store base in new ways, focused on attentiveness to making the customer experience more personal, buoyed by a more robust digital pr essence in the form of its personalized digital platform, Nike+.\nHowever, if any company is shrink that gap by a meaningful amount, it would be the aggressive Adidas with its triple threat of diversity of well-received product, high-profile endorsements, and celebrity hype. Adidas is on track to continue its growth streak in the US market. Under Armour will expand sales and marginally market share, while still being meaningful threat to both of the bigger companies.\nBut if we're talking about who has a bigger shot at taking more market share from the Oregonian giant, Adidas has all the momentum right now.\nNOW WATCH: These are the best watches at every price point \n\nMore From Business Insider \nPeople are setting their New Balance sneakers on fire because they think the company endorsed Trump \nKohl's is going after a forgotten customer to defy the curse plaguing Macy's and Sears \nIf you're new to coding, this is the programming language you should learn first",

      "text": "Are any of you familiar with the Nike Air Max Uptempo 97 ? Unless you were born in the 80s or early 90s then you probably aren’t too familiar with the shoe.\nToday we take a look at a new colorway that has surfaced which is a collaboration with none other than Ronnie Fieg . The Ronnie Fieg x Nike Air Max Uptempo 97 that we see above features an olive suede upper with a white midsole for some contrast. Fieg gave us a preview of the sneaker via his Instagram which also comes with Ronnie Fieg branding on the insoles. As you can see in one of the pictures above, this is only a sample which means that they won’t be releasing to the public.\nWhat are your thoughts on Ronnie Fieg’s special colorway of the Air Max Uptempo 97? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\nvia: Ronnie Fieg \n\nThe post Nike Made Ronnie Fieg His Own Pair Of The Air Max Uptempo 97 appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nNike has come a long way from its humble beginnings, when founder Phil Knight sold early shoe models from his station wagon, to its present status as the most powerful sports brand in the world. The footwear conglomerate is flexing its creative and technological muscles with its new five-story, 55,000-square-foot store in the SoHo section of New York City . According to Engadget , it will have everything from 3D-printed decorations to a Kinect-powered basketball court. \nThe store will also provide Apple Pay support and wall-mounted touchscreens where you can hail a helpful associate, or buy Swoosh gear on the spot. It was scheduled to be open on Friday November 11, but Sneakerwatch reports that the opening date is still TBD due to permit issues . \nMore: These smart customizable e-sneakers have real sole \nSean Madden, senior director of service and experiences for Nike’s direct-to-consumer division, mentions that the tech inside store isn’t the main event. These are enhanced features designed to augment the shopping experience and make it more distinctive and unique for each customer. The Kinect sensors capture body movements and display that data on the screen in front of you. Of course, if you’re impressed and feel a little giddy at this 21st century sales pitch, you might just be more inclined to buy some merch, which is the whole point of any retail store \n“We’re leading the transformation of sport retail — offering the best of Nike products, services and experiences under one roof,” Heidi O’Neill, Nike’s President of Global Direct to Consumer told Modern Notoriety . “With Nike Soho we can realize the promise of personalized performance. Powered by immersive digital trials and in-store experts, this store is about elevating every athlete’s potential.” \nMore: Nike rolls out the first post-career Kobe Bryant sneaker \nThe sneaker fans at Kicks On Fire noted some other features of the massive store. The Nike+ Basketball Trial Zone is nearly half a court on the 5th floor with 23-foot ceilings. The first floor Nike+ Running Trial Zone lets consumers test shoes on a treadmill. The third floor Nike+ Soccer Trial Zone is a 400-square-foot space with a synthetic turf field floor for testing soccer shoes. Nike By NYC is a studio where you can laser engrave and print unique NYC symbols on Nike gear. And The Lounge is a women’s boutique within the store meant for services like bra fittings and pant hemming. \nOh, and there’s a water bottle station.",

      "text": "Adidas and Under Armour are locked in a bitter battle to be Nike's top US competitor — here's who's likely to win Dennis Green (The dogs of Adidas and Under Armour are nipping at Nike's heels.Facebook/Nike) The sportswear melee has only just begun. Nike's spot at the top of the sportswear pyramid seems more perilous that ever before, with a weak indicators of future sales including less orders from retails and piling up inventory in their latest quarterly report Adidas and Under Armour are making significant gains on Nike, each launching new products and new categories to carve their own pieces of the growing sportswear pie. Meanwhile, Nike's market share in both shoes and apparel seems to be declining . Which of the brands has the best chance of challenging Nike's dominance? Let's take a look at the top two competitors. The case for Under Armour Under Armour More (Under Armour's footwear business is poised to be a major player in the future if current growth is maintained.Facebook/Under Armour) Under Armour has been a hot company with growth in the past two years in the 30% range year over year. In the most recent earnings call, the company beat profit expectations, but warned the pace of growth will slow through 2017 and 2o18 when considering the explosive growth the company experienced since 2009. That considered, the company is a huge presence on the market and is on track to be a sportswear giant in its own right. Though its its 2015 worldwide net revenue was a mere $3.96 billion compared to Adidas' $18 billion (and both trailing Nike's gigantic $30 billion), its business is mostly in the US where its simple and technological approach to sportswear has resonated with consumers. It's 2016 net revenue is still projected to be nearly $5 billion Originally not a footwear powerhouse, its new basketball shoe line has gained some notoriety, while being attached to one of the youngest and most well-known players of the sport, Steph Curry. As a result, net revenue from footwear grew 58% year-over-year as reported in the company's latest earnings report. Under Armour, which usually sells its products under Nike's, has also made an effort to move its products upmarket with a new fashion-oriented sportswear line designed with Tim Coppens. The case for Adidas More (Adidas has had a strong and aggressive resurgence on the American market.Facebook/Adidas) Last week, Adidas passed Under Armour to retake the spot of the second biggest sportswear company in the US. This is a huge milestone for the company, which was previously struggling to maintain market share in the country after previously losing touch with American tastes, losing sponsorship deals to Nike, and failing to make much of its $3.8 billion acquisition of Reebok in 2005. Losing market share was a wake-up call for the German giant, as it is further entrenched than its American competitor, has been around for a lot longer than UA's young 20 years of life, and has nearly quadruple its revenue worldwide. Adidas has been looking to turn that around in recent years with a refocusing on the American market started by Adidas President of North America Mark King started in 2014, and a renewed call to take on Nike by its new CEO, Kasper Rorsted. Adidas has opened a new design lab in Nike's hometown of Portland, Oregon, launched new high-priced models that gets sneakerheads talking like the UltraBoost with celebrity spokespeople, and repositioned heritage models as fashion icons — the most famous and successful being the Stan Smith. Read More It also signed high profile partnerships like Kanye West's Yeezy line, and have been aggressive in pursuing endorsement deals for other teams. For apparel, Adidas has refreshed its offerings and leaned into athleisure with an upmarket line called Zne . US sales were up 26% for Adidas according to the second quarter earnings report, with no signs of slowing down soon. Does any of this matter? Nike still has a lot of room to run before either Adidas or Under Armour get anywhere close to catching it. The company has an ambitious plan to reach $50 billion in worldwide revenue by 2020, powered largely by a rapidly expanding direct to consumer business. To achieve this, it will expand its store base in new ways, focused on attentiveness to making the customer experience more personal, buoyed by a more robust digital pr essence in the form of its personalized digital platform, Nike+. However, if any company is shrink that gap by a meaningful amount, it would be the aggressive Adidas with its triple threat of diversity of well-received product, high-profile endorsements, and celebrity hype. Adidas is on track to continue its growth streak in the US market. Under Armour will expand sales and marginally market share, while still being meaningful threat to both of the bigger companies. But if we're talking about who has a bigger shot at taking more market share from the Oregonian giant, Adidas has all the momentum right now.",

They flew of the shelves and sold out online within minutes. Many sneaker lovers were frustrated, including myself. They retailed for $160 while prices on secondary markets like ebay sell for over $300. \nGood news! Word has it that they will restock on Tuesday November 15th via Footlocker. This restock will be an online exclusive. Visit my site for reminders and more restocks.",

The KITH founder teased a tonal dark green colorway of the '90s silhouette via his Instagram Stories, featuring his logo along the insole and a contrasting white midsole. 2016 has been without a doubt Fieg's most successful year to-date. From the jaw-dropping \" KITHLAND \" presentation to the many notable collaborations, this forthcoming release would be an ideal way to cap off a stunning calendar year in a Christmas-appropriate style.

We’ve just received our first look at the sneaker on-foot from Titolo and it looks every bit as good as you’d expect. The Nike LunarCharge drops worldwide at select Nike retailers on November 18. Previous Next \nUPDATE: Nike’s new kid on the block, the LunarCharge, has been turning heads all over cyberspace – and now it’s time to take a closer look. The mashup is looking just as good from every angle, we can’t wait to see how they go on foot. Previous Next \nIt’s not every day that the folks at Beaverton announce they’ve got a new creation coming to stores. What you’re looking at is the newest Swoosh silhouette: the LunarCharge. \nJust like a good DJ – Nike have presented a mix that’s familiar enough, but foreign enough to be intriguing. They’ve done so by building a shoe from a medley of greatest hits. The LunarCharge boasts Neoprene from the Air Flow , eyelets from the Air Max 90 , an internal bootie from the Air Presto and a laser-siped sole from the LunarEpic . Everything is then bundled up into a package informed by the Air Current to produce a banger that’ll make you want to get up and move. \nThe Nike LunarCharge is set to release from select Nike stockists on November 18. \nMore Nike ",

White accents show on the midsole and laces, and the shoe’s leather has also been treated with 3M to come to life under light. \nAnyone wanting to grab the ‘Pink Box’ Nike SB Dunk Lows will need to keep an eye on NDC when they release on November 25.

Neymar to Completely Ditch Nike Hypervenom Boots Neymar has been having problems with Nike's agility boot since the launch of the second-gen Hypervenom. Embed from Getty Images However, while it is almost certain that Neymar, who received camouflaged Mercurial-esque Nike Hypervenom soccer cleats from the Swoosh, will say goodbye to the Hypervenom, it is not known if he will already switch to the speed silo (Nike Mercurial) with the launch of the third-gen Nike Hypervenom football boot or not before the begin of the 2017-18 season. Nike released two Jordan x Neymar Hypervenom signature boots this year, but Neymar already trained in blackout Nike Mercurial Vapor 11 boots. Hypervenom or Mercurial? Which one fits Neymar better? Do you think there will be Nike Mercurial Neymar signature editions? Let us know what you think in the comments below.",

The soles are in 90% condition meaning only 10% has been used. No rips or stains or discoloring. I lost 70lbs and had no clue my feet would shrink also so they are a bit to big for me. All cleaned sanitized and new laces. You can still see the Nike Swoosh on the inside soles which proves minimal wear. MY PRICE IS FIRM NON NEGOTIABLE! CASH ONLY NO TRADES, WILL NOT DELIVER!
