      "text": "A group of students in one of the Microsoft Innovation Centers’ pilot workshops work to develop their startup idea. (Microsoft Photo) “Entrepreneurship. What does that mean? And can you teach it?” asks Darek Mazzone, a creative consultant at Microsoft Innovation Centers .\nWe often see skills like entrepreneurship or creativity as innate, unteachable traits. But there are concrete skills and steps that can help someone start a company, and a new program from the Microsoft Innovation Centers (MIC) hopes to teach those skills to aspiring entrepreneurs across the globe, through the more than 100 existing MIC locations .\nThe program consists of a four-day workshop designed to provide a scaffold for aspiring entrepreneurs to develop an idea, conduct customer research, and leave with a roadmap to turn their idea into a startup.\nMicrosoft Innovation Centers’ Global Program Manager Ed Steidl outside an MIC in Bangkok, Thailand. (Microsoft Photo) The project is led by Ed Steidl, who joined Microsoft Innovation Centers as global program manager in 2014. For the past year, he has been working with a variety of collaborators to develop a curriculum and teaching tools for the program, and said he anticipates the program will launch early next year. \nWhen Steidl first arrived at the MIC, its programs were largely focused on teaching technology skills so that students could get positions in the tech sector. But he quickly realized something was lacking. As he traveled the world, speaking to students in the program, Steidl saw the same pattern reappearing.\nOne instance took place at a conference in Nepal.\n“A student came up to me at the end and he said, “Hey, I don’t want to go and get a job, I want to create jobs. Is there anything you can do to help me do that?'” Steidl said.\n“I reflected on that, and a month-and-a-half later I was in China giving a talk to a group of university students, and somebody raised their hand and through the translator he asked, ‘Is there anything you can do to help me become like Steve Jobs?'” Steidl said.\nHe realized the students in the program didn’t just want to know how to code. They wanted to know how to use those skills to build companies that addressed local challenges, ones that Western startups would never think to take on.\nDarek Mazzone, who collaborated with Steidl on the program, during a recent trip to train workshop leaders in China. (Microsoft Photo) “We live in this world where I go to an ATM, I have no problem. Stuff is working. The power is on all the time,” said Darek Mazzone, a creative consultant who has been collaborating with Steidl to build the entrepreneurship program.\nBut in many of the countries where MIC locations operate, like Pakistan, China or Botswana, there are completely unique political and infrastructure challenges that entrepreneurs want to tackle, he said.\n“We need solutions that solve for bovine mortality in Botswana, or increasing rice production in Thailand, or teaching people how to code using their phone in Armenia,” Steidl said, all real examples from the program’s pilot workshops.\n“Some of the solutions that are coming from this mix are really interesting, and they could scale globally, but they would never come from the West because the West doesn’t think like that,” Mazzone said.\nThe workshops themselves consist of two parts: a one-day Invention Cycle Workshop developed with Stanford professor Tina Seelig , which helps students come up with an idea; then an adaptation of the three-day Lean Startup Workshop that helps them develop the idea into an actionable plan. \nAs part of the Lean Startup Workshop, entrepreneurs must go into their community and talk to real customers, trying to understand what needs they have and how they can best be filled. \nAspiring entrepreneurs work out their idea during an MIC workshop in Hyderabad, India. (Microsoft Innovation Centers Photo) Over the three days, the entrepreneurs pivot, Steidl said. Their first idea doesn’t often survive, but their interactions with customers help them arrive at an idea that fills a real need. \nMuch of the benefit of the workshop is giving aspiring entrepreneurs a roadmap on how to get started, which Mazzone said can help entrepreneurs overcome cultural forces that may prevent them from attempting to start a company. In some cultures, just being an entrepreneur is a foreign concept, he said.\n“With startups you fail, and some cultures have a real hard time with failure,” he said. \nSo far, Steidl and Mazzone have piloted the workshops in 34 countries, and have also held several sessions to train employees at MIC locations to lead the workshops themselves. When the program launches in about two months, Steidl said, these trainers will go on to host workshops in their own communities, and start a groundswell of local entrepreneurship around the world.\n“I think people can learn how to do it,” Steidl said. “Not everybody’s going to do it, and that’s OK. But if you can move the needle just a little bit and give people a set of tools and frameworks that they can follow, they have the ability to be more creative and entrepreneurial.” \nAnd, as Mazzone pointed out, strong startup ecosystems won’t just help entrepreneurs in rural Botswana or Urban China. When entrepreneurs are able to succeed, they accelerate innovation across the world.\n“Anything that helps international cultures evolve is a plus for all of humanity,” he said. ",

      "title": "How to Block Users from Accessing the “about:flags” Page in Microsoft Edge",
      "text": "Tweet \nIn Windows 10 Microsoft dumped Internet Explorer in favor of the brand new web browser Edge. The good thing about the new browser is that it is simple, modern, very similar to Firefox and Chrome and even has support for extensions. Moreover, just like Chrome and Firefox, Edge has the “about:flags” settings page. \nThe “about:flags” page allows advanced users to enable and disable the experimental settings and features. Since most of the settings and features in this page can cause instability issues, the page is typically hidden from plain sight. However, it can be easily accessed by simply typing “about:flags” in the address bar. \nIf you are an admin and would like to restrict users from messing with the flags page, here’s how to do so. Disable about:flags in Edge Using Group Policy Editor \nIf you are using the Pro version of Windows 10, you can use the Group Policy Editor to disable the “about:flags” page in the Edge browser. Search for gpedit.msc in the Start menu and open it. \nHere, navigate to the policy folder “Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Microsoft Edge.” \nOn the right panel, find and double-click on the policy “Prevent access to the about:flags page in Microsoft Edge.” This policy is what allows you to manage the flags page in the Edge browser. \nOnce the policy settings window has been opened, select the radio button “Enabled,” and then click on the “OK” button to save the changes. \nTo apply the changes, restart the system. Alternatively, use the follow command as an administrator. The below command will force the changes. gpupdate.exe / force \nAfter applying the changes, whenever a user tries to access the flags page they will receive an error message something like this. Disable about:flags in Edge Using Registry \nAlternatively, you can use also the Windows Registry editor to do that same. To start, search for regedit in the Start menu and open it. \nAfter opening the Registry Editor, navigate to the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft \nHere we need to create two sub-keys. Right-click on the “Microsoft” key, and select the option “New -> Key.” Name the new key “MicrosoftEdge.” \nNow, right-click on the newly-created key, and then select the option “New -> Key.” Name the new sub-key “Main.” \nOnce you are done creating the keys, this is how the key structure looks. \nNow, select the “Main” key, right-click on the right panel and then select the option “DWORD (32-bit) Value.” \nThe above action will create a blank value. Name the value “PreventAccessToAboutFlagsInMicrosoftEdge” and press the Enter button. \nBy default, the new value will be set to “0.” To change that, double-click on the value, enter the value data as “1” and click on the “OK” button to save the changes. \nThis is how it looks when you are done setting up the value. \nRestart your system to make sure that the changes take effect, and you are good to go. If you ever want to revert back, simply change the Value Data back to “0” or just delete the value completely. However, if you chose to delete the value, make sure that you have a good backup of the registry just in case of any mishaps. \nDo comment below sharing your thoughts and experiences about using the above methods to disable the about:flags page in Microsoft Edge browser.

      "text": "Microsoft Says It’s Not Sharing Windows 10 Telemetry Data with Anyone GO We’ll just keep this data for ourselves, the company claims Nov 26, 2016 15:59 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft and security company FireEye recently signed a partnership on improving Windows Defender with more advanced capabilities, but according to one report, the deal included more than that. As we reported earlier this week, it was believed that one of the terms of the deal had Microsoft sharing telemetry data collected from Windows 10 computers . Although it was unclear why exactly FireEye would need Windows 10 telemetry, such an agreement was certainly worrying for users of Redmond’s latest operating system, especially given the fact that their own data was at stake. But according to a company spokesperson, this is not at all accurate, and the deal only involves the improved security features for Windows Defender. No telemetry sharing A company spokesperson explains that sharing telemetry data is not a term of the partnership, so information collected from Windows 10 computers remains exclusively available to Microsoft. “The nature of the deal between Microsoft and FireEye is to license threat intelligence content from FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence. This additional layer of intelligence includes indicators and reports of past attacks collected and edited by FireEye and enhances detection capabilities of Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP). The deal does not include the sharing of Microsoft telemetry,” the spokesperson told us. On a side note, it’s important to know that telemetry info collected from Windows 10 systems is not in any way linked to user accounts, so even if your system sends some data to Microsoft, everything’s anonymous and encrypted. The software giant says it needs to collect some information from Windows 10 computers in order to improve performance of the operating system and to address crashes happening on our machines. Without them, it would be way more difficult for Microsoft to improve the reliability and stability of Windows 10. The company thus guarantees that nothing is shared and Microsoft engineers are the only ones who have access to Windows 10 telemetry, which is securely transmitted to the company and then stored on encrypted servers.",

      "title": "Microsoft: \"Strong Demand\" for Xbox Over Black Friday Weekend - Thurrott.com",
      "text": "Tweet 0 Share \nThe Black Friday holiday shopping weekend isn’t over yet, but Microsoft has already hailed the “strong demand” it has seen for Xbox. \nThe software giant prepared a lengthy momentum statement from Mike Nichols, the Corporate Vice President of Xbox Marketing. Rather than just copy and paste it, let’s look at it line by line and see what we can make of the start of a crucial holiday season for Xbox One in particular. \nThere was strong demand for Xbox hardware, accessories, games and Xbox Live engagement on Black Friday, based on initial results, with a strong start to the holiday season. \nCuriously, this is all that Microsoft actually says about the Black Friday weekend. From there, it moves on to what I think of as “momentum”. So it’s not clear if this weekend was good, bad or indifferent for Microsoft. It’s pretty clear that it wasn’t record-breaking in any way, however. \nIn October, Xbox One was the best-selling console in the U.S., U.K. and Australia according to NPD Group and GfK Entertainment. Xbox One has been the best-selling console in the U.S. for the past four months, and in the U.K. and Australia in each of the last two months. \nAfter two years of coming in second place to Sony’s PlayStation 4 almost every single month, Microsoft seen great success in recent months. The most interesting thing to me, so far, is that the first month in which Xbox console sales beat those of PS4 was in July, which was one month before the Xbox One S shipped. Looking forward, the most crucial two months—November and December—are upon us. Imagine Microsoft winning these months. \nXbox One S is the only console available this year with built-in UHD 4K Blu-ray, 4K video streaming and HDR for video and gaming and it’s available in a variety of bundles for the best value with 500GB, 1TB and 2TB consoles to choose from. \nI recently described the Xbox One S as “the perfect thing.” But be sure to check out my full review as well. \nA huge variety of blockbuster games from this year’s greatest games lineup are now available for Xbox One or Windows 10 PC such as “Gears of War 4,” “Forza Horizon 3,” “ReCore,” “Titanfall 2,” “Battlefield 1” and “Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,” with even more on the way in the coming days like “Dead Rising 4” and “Final Fantasy XV.” \nI’ve spent time with most of those already-available games, but I can’t say I’m particularly interested in Dead Rising 4 or Final Fantasy XV . I feel like I should be giving Titanfall 2 a shot though. \nMoreover, with the recent release of our Xbox Holiday Update, there are more ways for gamers to connect with one another across devices through Clubs and Looking for Group on Xbox Live – the fastest, most reliable gaming network. \nI wrote about the Xbox Holiday Update a few weeks back , though I can’t say it has impacted my day-to-day experience on Xbox One per se. I’d love to see some more performance improvements to the Dashboard for starters. \nIn addition, Xbox Design Lab brings more than 8 million ways to customize the new Xbox Wireless Controller, featuring enhanced comfort and feel with textured grip, improved wireless range and Bluetooth technology. \nWe are grateful to our community for their continued dedication and passion toward Xbox, and are committed to making Xbox the best place to game this year and beyond. \nYeah you are. \nSo, not much of substance. And I’m a bit curious why Microsoft chose to issue such a non-statement. We may find out next week when NPD and other market analysts release their findings from the Black Friday weekend. \nPremium Comments (0) Comments (0) Join the discussion! ",

      "title": "Could Resident Evil 7 Be A Play Anywhere Title On Xbox One? Here's What We Know",
      "text": "By William Usher 7 minutes ago \nMicrosoft's new Play Anywhere feature allows gamers to access certain titles through cross-platform compatibility. This means being able to play across Xbox One and PC, as well as sharing saves. Well, new info points to Resident Evil 7 possibly having Play Anywhere features. \nAccording to IGN , Resident Evil 7 appeared in a recent article on Dengeki where they discuss each format's features, one of which includes a translation for the game's appearance on the Windows Store, where they revealed that there will be cross-platform compatibility between PC and Xbox One for saved games. \nIGN points out that cross-platform saves are one of the key features for the Play Anywhere concept being pushed by Microsoft. It allows gamers to purchase a title digitally on PC or Xbox One and then play it on either platform, with the saved game sharing across both systems. The Play Anywhere also ties into cross-platform multiplayer as well, allowing for some games to enable PC players to play alongside Xbox One gamers. \nAccording to the article, they did receive confirmation that Capcom's Resident Evil 7 would be one of the first third-party titles to make full use of cross-saves from PC to Xbox One or Xbox One to PC. However, what they could not confirm was whether or not cross-buying was an option. \nUsually a game that makes use of the Play Anywhere feature also allows for cross-buys, which means that you could buy a Windows Store copy of Resident Evil 7 for PC and then attach it to your GamerTag account and then play it on the Xbox One. It's a feature that Sony has been capitalizing on to great lengths with the PS4 and PS3, as well as the PS3 and PS Vita, and PS4 and PS Vita. The ability to buy a game on one platform and then have access to it on another platform is a huge way to get gamers with multiple platforms to consider buying the game because it's almost considered getting a two-for-one deal. \nThe thing is, Capcom wouldn't confirm to IGN whether or not cross-buys would be available for Resident Evil 7 . So while we know that cross-saves are going to be present, cross-buys may or may not be. \nIt would be a really odd move to allow Xbox One and PC gamers to share saves between platforms, but then force them to have to buy two different copies of the game to make use of the feature. Most people would likely ignore the game on either platform if the Play Anywhere feature wasn't really going to be utilized to its fullest. \nBut then again, Capcom may be weighing the options and seeing it as a potential risk to their bottom line if PC gamers just had to purchase one copy of Resident Evil 7 to play it on the Xbox One (or vice versa), as opposed to getting people to buy individual copies for each system. At the end of the day, a customer who pays twice for the game is more important than one who pays once for it. \nOf course, Capcom may actually bite the bullet and allow for cross-buys between PC and Xbox One... but they certainly aren't going say so right now. We'll have to wait to find out what deal is with Resident Evil 7 and the Play Anywhere feature.  ",

      "text": "Earlier this week, Microsoft made a statement alluding to helping create “the ultimate mobile device” . This was seized upon by hopeful pundits and Windows phone fans to indicate that Microsoft was planning something big. They were planning the ultimate mobile phone, a Windows phone to rival others. This isn’t so self-evident. While Microsoft has expressed its intent to keep developing Windows on phone due to sheer inertia, the firm has also adopted a secondary method of building up its mobile arsenal – so to speak. These two paths are illustrated well enough with Microsoft’s phone companion app. With that app on your PC, Microsoft lets you pick one of two pathways. Adopt Microsoft’s vision of Mobile, choose a Windows phone and gain access to using all the same apps on your PC and phone. If that’s not your style, you can choose an iOS or Android phone while embracing Microsoft apps and services to sync. The crucial factor here to note is that while these two choices contradict each other by necessity, as long as you are using Microsoft apps and services on your phone of choice, you get the same “mobility of experience” that Microsoft believes in a necessity for the future of mobile.\n\nInherent in Plan A is Microsoft’s vision for the future of computing whereby you make use of one “brain” to control your laptop, tablet and Desktop. Microsoft’s PC Partners like Dell , HP and Acer have been building experiences around this concept. As you all know, Continuum for phone with Windows 10 Mobile is a feature where mobile phones by being docked and running Windows 10 Mobile can project their apps and UI to another screen giving the appearance of being a real desktop. It hopes to overcome the decisive app disadvantage of Windows phones whereby the apps which are available on Microsoft’s Windows phone are much less than those a user on iOS or Android can get by changing the definition of mobile phone from independent mobile computer to the brain of a multitude of devices.\nThis week, we got a glimpse at projects Microsoft is working on – a project to enable x86 virtualisation on phones. This feature would allow Windows 10 Mobile users to run real Windows apps on their phone and allow them to be productive once they are docked. Much like the HP Elite x3, while you’re on the go you can use the few apps there ae in the Windows Store, but when you get to your desk, you place your phone in a dock and then you can use your desktop\n\nYet – without getting bogged down by details of how it would work and perform – the main issue of Continuum still fails to be addressed. It isn’t practical. Let’s be real, have you seen a Microsoft office stacked with a HP Elite x3 or Lumia 950 XL and Continuum set up? If Continuum was so good, so life changing that it could really replace your PC as Microsoft pitches it- who else would have adopted it if not for Microsoft. Microsoft makes Office, the premier productivity platform, surely, they can get their productivity apps and services optimized for mobile in such a way that they can duplicate desktop services? When you’re peddling a business solution as superior to other solutions, it would add some legitimacy to your solution if you partially made use of it as well.\nUnfortunately for Continuum fans, it isn’t hard to acknowledge that it would be much simpler to have a dedicated PC alongside a dedicated mobile device because those do two diametrically opposed things. As big of a fan as I am of newer style universal apps, because they have to be tailored for drastically different scenarios, their user interfaces just don’t work efficiently for all scenarios.\n\nIn my opinion, the second path alluded to in the first point represents a much more modern way of moving between devices. Rather than move screens – plugging and reconnecting cables and fiddling with this, that and the other. Even without a Windows phone, one can remain linked into Microsoft’s ecosystem without much trouble.\nWith Microsoft Groove, you can keep your music collection in sync. By setting up iCloud Photos and OneDrive on your devices, you can keep your photos in sync. Want to Skype across devices? You can do that too, in fact Microsoft plans to bring your Android texts to your Windows PC soon. Microsoft is even investing deeper into Android devices by allowing Android users to be able to replace their launcher and lock screen with Microsoft alternatives, swap out Google Now for Cortana and even sync across notifications from your phone to your PC.\nFor people interested in saying in the Microsoft ecosystem, this seems to be the smartest approach.\nWithout being restricted in terms of apps, you can access Microsoft core services on all your devices. If one were to determine the “Ultimate Mobile Experience”, then I think the experience which allows you to carry out the most tasks and move data across devices with the least hassle is by far the most efficient one.\nDespite all that, we must remember that Henry Ford once said “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said, faster horses”. While Microsoft’s Continuum based phones seem poised to fail, an iOS and Android approach must seem (to those users who invested in Microsoft’s mobile ecosystem in the past), as a faster horse approach. It leans on old paradigms and doesn’t even attempt to be different. Despite being a Microsoft sanctioned experience, it reeks of defeat.\nOn the other hand, Microsoft has had “Let’s make your phone a PC” as their mobility goal and failed to implement successfully in more than a decade. With that in mind, hearing Satya Nadella talk about building the “ultimate device” right now does not inspire much confidence – regardless of whether Microsoft implements cool and futuristic elements into their mobile division. In the long run, though, it doesn’t matter much. Microsoft may not be able to build the best mobile horse right now, but tomorrow? The day after? That may be a different story altogether.",

An exclusive on Windows for the past 25 years, Solitaire and its companion card-playing games Spider, Freecell, Tripeaks, \nAn exclusive on Windows for the past 25 years, Solitaire and its companion card-playing games Spider, Freecell, Tripeaks, Pyramid, and Klondike are classic time killers at home (and let’s be real, in the office, too). The original Solitaire has remained virtually unchanged since its first release in Windows 3.0 in 1990. Since Windows 8, Microsoft has moved Solitaire in a new direction, focusing on daily challenges through XBOX Live integration. Users can sign in with a Microsoft Account, compete with friends and earn achievements. Your achievements will also be available across devices. Now, Solitaire is making it’s biggest leap yet: beyond the Windows operating system. Microsoft Solitaire Now Available for iOS and Android \nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection now works on iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad. The games are a free download but are ad-based. Users can purchase a monthly $2 subscription to get rid of the ads. \nThe World’s #1 Solitaire game is now on iPhone and iPad! For over 25 years, Microsoft Solitaire Collection remains one of the most played games of all time and is now available FREE for your iPhone or iPad! The Microsoft Solitaire Collection offers FIVE of the best Solitaire card games in one app! Source \nYou can also get Solitaire for Android devices from the Google Play Store. \nAlthough the Microsoft Solitaire Collection has seen significant improvements, many users still prefer the old classic style games. The integration of XBOX Live and ads has become more of a deterrent for some users who prefer the simplicity of the older games. There are third party hacks available to get classic games on newer versions of Windows . The previous classic versions of Solitaire were last revised with high-resolution graphics when Windows Vista was released ten years ago . As expected, Microsoft frowns upon these hacks because they aren’t official releases. \nThat said, I personally prefer the older games. Users have reported issues such as the games refusing to launch or being unable to update or reinstall from the Store. Many have joked over the years that Solitaire was the one dealbreaker that kept them on Windows. \nCould support for alternative platforms make you finally ditch Windows for another OS?

The Holiday Bundle at the Microsoft Store gives you the complete 'x3 experience' with the Elite x3, Desk Dock, Lap Dock, Elite Case, and even a screen protector.\n\nFor some reason Microsoft had the price for the Holiday Bundle set for $1149, but it has now dropped even lower to $999 for a total savings of $462 . Considering the Elite x3 sets you back $799 for the phone and Desk Dock that means you can get the Lap Dock for just $200 extra (plus a case and screen protector). ",

      "text": "Startup Eve Tech's tablet, Eve V, includes top-end specs at an affordable price, which makes the tablet a worthy competitor of the Surface Pro and iPad Pro. The tablet will come running on Intel's Kaby Lake processor. ( Eve Tech | Indiegogo   Microsoft Surface Pro and Apple iPads are some of the most popular tablets available in the market. It seems that these two tablets will soon see a new competition called Eve V, which will feature top-end specs and a reasonable price tag. \nHelsinki-based startup Eve Tech had aimed to raise $75,000 in its Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign for the Eve V. However, the company has already raised more than $1 million with a month left in its campaign. \nKonstantinos Karatsevidis, the cofounder and CEO of Eve, says that the startup has financial backing from the Finnish government, Microsoft and Intel. Karatsevidis says that about 30 percent of people who backed the project are existing Mac users. \n\"Unsatisfied with most devices out there our team decided to surprise the market by changing the way products are developed. In our open online community, under code name: Project Pyramid Flipper, more than 1,000 hardware enthusiasts collaborated globally and created the Eve V,\" says Eve Tech. Eve V Specs \nThe Surface Pro runs on Intel's Skylake processor and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on Apple's A10X processor. The Windows 10-running Eve V will include Intel's 7th-generation Kaby Lake chips (Core m3, Core i5 and Core i7 options). \nCustomers will have the option to purchase the Eve tablet in either 8 GB or 16 GB RAM configurations. The Eve V will be available in 128 GB / 256 GB / 512 GB storage capacities. \nAll models of the Eve V will feature a 12.3-inch IGZO LCD screen with a display resolution of 2,736 x 1,824 pixels. \nThe tablet will include a couple of USB-C ports (one with Thunderbolt 3 compatibility) and two USB-A ports. The startup claims that the 48 Whr battery of the Eve V will ensure usage time of 10 to 12 hours. For comparison, the Surface Pro 4 includes a 39 Whr battery that provides usage time of about five to six hours. \nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro comes with a 38.5 Whr battery that Apple claims offers usage time of up to 10 hours. \nIt is also worth noting that the Surface Pro 4 was plagued with power management issues that took Microsoft a good few months to fix. Price \nThe base model of the Surface Pro 4 is priced at $999 (currently discounted at $799) while the top variant has a price tag of $1,799. The starting price of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is $799 and it can go up to $999. \nThe preorders for the base model Eve V started at $699 and for the top model it was $1,399. All Eve V models are sold out, which highlights the popularity of the tablet. \nYou can also check out Amazon offers on iPad Pro here and Surface Pro 4 here . Availability \nThe iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 4 are available in the market. Customers who have preordered the Eve V will have to wait until February 2017 for the delivery of their tablet. \nThe price of the Eve V along with top-end specs are some of the selling points of the new tablet, especially given that its competitors have priced similar products at higher price points.

      "text": "And in the UK, Microsoft launched its best deal so far on the Pro 4, offering 30% off its entry-level model, and throwing in a free Type Cover worth £109.99 . \nThose who pre-ordered Microsoft's stunning new Surface Studio all-in-one desktop PC, priced from $2,999, were told to expect delivery from December 15 - but shipments began earlier than expected this week . \nFinnish company Eve launched the Indiegogo campaign to crowdfund its 'Surface-killer' Windows 10 device on Monday - and it smashed through its funding goal in less than an hour. \nIt looks like Lenovo is planning to take on the Surface Pro 4 with a new premium Windows 10 tablet of its own. The Miix 520 will reportedly feature up to 16GB RAM, 1TB of storage and Intel's newest 7th-gen processors . \nThere were no new Windows 10 Insider Preview builds this week due to the Thanksgiving break, but Microsoft did release Windows 10 SDK Preview build 14965 on Monday. \nThe latest data from AdDuplex indicates that just 15% of Windows phones in the US are running Windows 10 Mobile, which is hardly surprising, given that Microsoft has inexplicably made almost no effort to encourage users to upgrade. You can check out further insights about Windows 10 usage on phones and PCs here . \nWith Microsoft's share of the global smartphone market dropping to just 0.6% this summer, and its current Windows 10 Mobile devices approaching the end of their retail lives, you might well be wondering if the company plans to give up on phones. But its CEO, Satya Nadella, reaffirmed its commitment to the phone market this week, saying that the company is focused on creating \"the most ultimate mobile device\" . \nNo prizes for elegant phrasing there... \nIndeed, it seems Microsoft is in it for the long haul, and fresh details were revealed on Monday about plans to boost its mobile OS in late 2017 with a major new feature. The company is expected to bring integrated x86 app emulation to Windows 10 Mobile devices with its Redstone 3 update next year. \nMicrosoft is reportedly planning substantial user interface changes to Windows 10 as part of the Redstone 3 update too. These UI improvements, developed under the codename 'Project NEON', are expected to focus primarily on adapting Windows 10 for use on mixed reality (AR and VR) headsets, but some of the changes are likely to have an impact on UI design across other Windows 10 devices too. \nMixed reality is going to become a much bigger part of Windows 10 next year when Microsoft brings the Windows Holographic shell to the OS with its Creators Update. Microsoft said recently that it's been working with major manufacturers to bring more affordable virtual reality headsets to Windows 10, priced as low as $299 - and this week, we learned about some of the minimum PC specs required to power the Windows Holographic VR experience for those headsets. \nMicrosoft Research has been looking at ways to bring high-quality VR to mobile devices too; indeed, as we recently discussed in a feature article , the company's Research division has a broad remit to explore and develop new technologies. Microsoft has been investing in research into quantum computing for years now - and this week, it said it's now applying that knowledge to build a quantum computing device . \nMicrosoft's productivity suite got a big boost on Wednesday, when it announced that Office 365 has launched in ten more markets around the world - and it's coming to 97 more markets over the next twelve months . \nAnd it looks like Microsoft's proposed acquisition of professional networking platform LinkedIn will soon get regulatory approval in the European Union , after the company agreed to various 'concessions' to allay concerns from antitrust regulators.",

      "text": "\nInterested in picking up HP’s high-flying Elite x3 this holiday? Microsoft has the HP Elite x3 bundle on sale in the Windows Store for only $999. For that price you can pick up the HP Elite x3 itself, HP’s LapDock accessory which allows you to use the device like a laptop, the Desk Dock accessory which converts the device into a desktop,and a free case and screen protector.\nThe conceit of the Elite x3 is that it is a do it all device. It is built off of Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile ecosystem and uses the power of continuum to be able to be a phablet, a laptop and a desktop device. As a standalone device, it features a large 5.9 inch WQHD AMOLED display with a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, a generous 64 GB of storage.\nThe HP Elite x3 is one of the most powerful Windows phones right now, and for Windows mobile aficionados who you want to use Continuum primarily, it is your best bet for a productive do it all device. While it doesn’t have the consumer attractiveness a device like the iPhone or idol Pro 4S for Windows does, it still is a really nifty device.\nYou can check out our hands-on and full review here for more.\nIf you’re interested, pick it up from the source link below.\n",

      "text": "Microsoft Denies Rumors of Sharing Windows 10 Telemetry Data with FireEye Microsoft Denies Rumors of Sharing Windows 10 Telemetry Data with FireEye By 0 \nMicrosoft shot down rumors it was sharing personal user data acquired from Windows 10 telemetry with US security vendor FireEye. \nThe rumors took off after a report from Australian tech news site ARN , which announced a recent partnership between Microsoft and FireEye that would embed FireEye's security product in the commercial version of Windows Defender. \nThe report incorrectly stated that as part of the deal, FireEye would also be getting access to Windows 10 telemetry data, so the security vendor could improve their service, and indirectly Microsoft's subscription-based Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP). \nIn a statement Microsoft passed around to news agencies, the company denied the presence of any clause that would send telemetry data to FireEye. \nThe nature of the deal between Microsoft and FireEye is to license threat intelligence content from FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence. This additional layer of intelligence includes indicators and reports of past attacks collected and edited by FireEye and enhances detection capabilities of Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP). The deal does not include the sharing of Microsoft telemetry. Microsoft - FireEye deal will improve Windows Defender ATP \nThe press release put out by FireEye on November 3 also did not mention anything about getting access to telemetry data. \nAccording to the deal, FireEye will provide details about cyber-attacks to Windows Defender ATP users. This includes helpful information on the attacker's motivation, history, tools, targeted sectors, and geographies. This information will be provided via the Windows Defender ATP portal. \nOnly Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, Education, and Pro Education can subscribe to Windows Defender ATP . \nUsers can control the amount of telemetry data they share with Microsoft from Settings > Privacy > Feedback & Diagnostics. The lowest telemetry levels are Security or Basic, depending on the Windows 10 version you're using. \nAdditionally, there are also dedicated apps such as Disable Windows 10 Tracking and others that can block your PC from sending telemetry data altogether.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s Windows 10 comes with a mode called battery saver mode which allows users to enter a low-power mode whereby brightness is reduced and notifications from universal Windows apps are effectively neutered. However,this battery saver mode isn’t sufficient in all cases. If you don’t use Universal Apps, for instance, it will b=merely amount to reducing your brightness, and it doesn’t do much for ferreting out issues which may result in higher than normal battery drain,\nTo check why your PC or tablet may be losing its charge faster than normal, you can make use of the following steps:\nOpen Control Panel either by pressing Win + X and selecting Control Panel from the options, o typing in “Control Panel” into the search box. Under System and security navigate to “Find and Fix Problems” In the sub-menu pane, there is a further “System and Security” Menu, click on “Improve Power Usage” The system will now run a checker which finds and fixes issues with your configuration that would drain your battery faster. If that isn’t enough, Windows also allows you to pick a “power plan” that allows you to prioritise fast performance over long battery life or vice versa.\nHere’s how to take advantage of that.\nOpen the Control Panel Navigate along the following path “Hardware and Sound > Power Options > Choose a power plan Typically some PC manufacturers include a “Power Saver Plan”, a “Hugh Performance Plan” and/or a “Balanced Power Plan”. Some like Microsoft’s Surface devices, only include a “Balanced Power Plan”. You can select a plan of your choice here. [Optional] You can also create your own power plan in this menu. Bu choosing “Create a power plan”, you can create a custom power plan that manages how long your device’s screen stays on while plugged in or on battery, what percent brightness the screen uses either plugged in or charging and when our PC goes to sleep. Do you have any other power management questions with Windows 10? Let us know in the comments below.",

      "text": "\nDescription: Windows 10 is a personal computer operating system developed by Microsoft as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems. Officially unveiled in September 2014 following a brief demo at Build 2014, the operating system reached general availability beginning on July 29, 2015.[2] The main goal of Windows 10 is to unify the Windows operating system across multiple Microsoft product families—including PCs, tablets, smartphones, embedded systems, and Xbox One, as well as new products such as Surface Hub and HoloLens—allowing these products to share what Microsoft described as a “universal” application architecture and Windows Store ecosystem. Expanding upon the Windows Runtime platform introduced by Windows 8, this architecture allows applications to be adapted for use between these platforms while sharing common code. Windows 10 introduced revisions to the operating system’s user interface, including the addition of a Start menu similar to Windows 7 but incorporating Windows 8?s live tiles, a virtual desktop system, a notifications sidebar (replacing the charms bar on Windows 8/8.1), and the ability to adjust user interface behaviors based on available input devices—particularly on laplets. Windows 10 provides integration with additional Microsoft services, including the intelligent personal assistant Cortana, and Xbox Live. Windows 10 also introduced a new default web browser, Microsoft Edge, as well as integrated support for fingerprint and face recognition login, and new versions of DirectX and WDDM to improve the operating system’s graphics capabilities for games.\n\nFeatures: \nWindows 10 is familiar and easy to use, with lots of similarities to Windows 7 including the Start menu. It starts up and resumes fast, has more built-in security to help keep you safe, and is designed to work with software and hardware you already have. The Windows Insider Program is a global community of fans who love Windows and want to help make it better. Insiders see the operating system in its earliest stages, and play a role in shaping it. Their feedback has contributed to the best Windows ever. Microsoft Edge lets you move quickly from browsing to doing. Write1 or type notes directly on webpages and share them with others, read online articles free of distraction, and save your favorite reads for convenient access later. Get to done faster by better managing your desktop.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft earlier this year rolled out an updated Wallet app for many Windows Phone users, but Microsoft’s app still doesn’t support Passbook files, the format for many online vouchers, tickets and the like. While you can use .mswallet files for your Windows phone, the number of retailers who support and issue those is small and dwindling.\nWallet Pass for Windows is a Windows 10 app that aims to solve those issues for casual users. It supports Apple’s passbook files perfectly out of the box and can convert them to .mswallet files and sync them to the wallet app if you need it. This means you can store your tickets and vouchers in your wallet app – or in the Wallet Pass app without having to worry about whether it is supported or not.\nThe app also allows you to sync your passbook files between your devices, so you can download a file on your PC and have it show up on your phone. Naturally, it supports Windows 10’s dark and light themes as well.\nHere’s the full list of features below.\nImport .pkpass files from browser or email or via the file explorer app. Show locations included in passbooks and use it in Nokia Here Maps. Automatic saves to Microsoft Wallet app Manage every passbook in the app. Pin live tiles in start screen for every passbook. Save calendar events from passbooks data. Show notifications in the Action Centre from passbooks. Automatic updates. Backup and synchronise your passes between devices. Barcode scan PIN-lock Gallery You can download the app from the store link here:\nWP-Appbox: Wallet Pass ($0.99, Windows Store) → ",

      "text": "\nFor those of us interested in getting pretty much the best virtual reality experience available, Microsoft has a pretty sweet deal for you. And no it’s not the highly reviewed Alcatel Idol 4S Windows 10 handset (which in it’s own right provides a rather decent experience for an unsupported platform), Microsoft is offering some extras this Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend when you grab either the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift.\nThough only the HTC Vive is actually discounted, providing you a $100 savings off of its normal price of $799 to $699; the Oculus Rift is still retailing for its full price of $599, the Redmond Giant is offering some spending money with your purchase of either headset. Until November 28, the HTC Vive will come bundled with a free $100 Microsoft Store gift code , whereas the Oculus Rift comes with a free $100 Oculus Store credit .\nBoth headsets are reviewed pretty well, with the Vive typically coming ahead in terms of likability. Both headsets also come with their own free game as well, the Vive being bundled with ‘The Gallery – Episode 1: Call of the Starseed and Zombie Training Simulator’, and the Oculus Rift coming with ‘Lucky’s Tale’.\nOn top of all of that, both headsets have been in the news lately, with Xbox reportedly bringing game streaming to the Oculus Rift soon, and Google having just released ‘Google Earth VR’ to the HTC Vive . So either way you go, your looking at a pretty great deal.\nYou can pick up the HTC Vive deal here , and the Oculus Rift deal here . But act soon, because stock is likely to run out before the actual deadline arrives.\n",

      "text": "spicelicka 2h ago That's easy to say in retrospect but it was 10 years ago. I'm sure at the conceptual stage it did resemble halo, with halo being the most popular sci-fi space franchise at the time, and also MS's biggest franchise. There weren't a lot of sci-fi franchises with the depth of Halo's story, and you have to admit there were similarities between the reapers and the flood. Remember the original Mass effect was a MS exclusive game, so I can definitely see the conflict. But boy am I glad they let it happen.",

      "text": "Microsoft Working On New Design Language For Windows 10 Codenamed Project Neon \nIn what is being dubbed by some as \"Metro 2.0,\" Microsoft is working on a new design language that will reportedly turn Windows 10’s currently static UI into something much more lively. There are also reports that suggest this to be an effort toward bridging the desktop environment with holographic and augmented reality. \n…Project NEON has been in the works for over a year internally at Microsoft. It builds upon the design language introduced with Windows 10, with its simple and clean interfaces, but adds some much-needed flair to the UI that the current design language just lacks. Details are still scarce, but we hear some of the new designs in the plans include adding more animations and transitions, with the overall goal of making the UI very fluid and \"beautiful\" compared to the current, almost static UI that is MDL2. One source familiar with Microsoft's plans described NEON as \"Very fluid, lots of motion and nice transitions.\" Other things we've heard include app-elements being able to \"escape\" the borders of a window making for a much more unique experience.",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Phone With Snapdragon For Windows 10 Mobile",
      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone With Snapdragon For Windows 10 Mobile Microsoft Surface Phone With Snapdragon For Windows 10 Mobile 1 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

Fargo officials are studying how much incentivized properties have increased in value, for instance. \nAnd Fargo officials are still reviewing an update of their own policies on certain types of incentives, work that began early this year. An explainer on Fargo's many types of tax breaks \nCity commissioner Tony Gehrig, who votes against many tax-incentive deals deals, has questioned why Fargo should give companies exemptions at all, but especially when firms concede they're not a make-or-break matter. Just last week, he opposed a $1.7 million tax break for Border States Electric on its new corporate headquarters. \nBut at the core of the scrutiny over tax incentives is a question that's not easy to answer: Do they work? \n\"That's been the age-long debate of exemptions is what would be here or wouldn't be here if not for the exemption,\" City Assessor Ben Hushka said. \"I read all the appraisal journals and all the assessment journals and all the stories about exemptions and the debates that go on about it, and I've never read one that has given a definitive statistical answer to that question.\" \nTo explore the effectiveness of tax incentives, The Forum reviewed five major tax incentive projects in Fargo to see what was promised and what was delivered. Radisson Hotel and parking ramp (1984) \nIncentive: 24-year tax-increment financing and federal funds to pay for $4.9 million (inflation adjusted) to buy land, prepare it for construction and help pay for the ramp and a skywalk. Developers also received a $13 million (inflation adjusted) low-interest loan. \nProperty value before incentive: $149,000 in 1983. Projected value after incentive: $7.5 million in 1984. \nYear projected value reached: Early to mid-1990s. \nCurrent value: $16.4 million, excluding city-owned properties. \nIn the mid-1970s, downtown Fargo was in decline and competition with the new West Acres mall didn't help. To save the city's central business district, investors proposed various new hotels connected to a shopping complex or convention center. The concept evolved into a hotel connected to the Civic Center and other businesses by a skywalk. \nThe city agreed in 1982 to use future property taxes generated by the new hotel to buy land and prepare it for construction, called tax-increment financing, according to city records and reporting by The Forum. The bulk of the funding, however, would come from federal grants and subsidized low-interest loans. \nWhen city leaders discussed tax incentives to help build it, there were many detractors. Civic groups objected to the use of Community Development Block Grants, which could otherwise be used on low-income neighborhoods. Others complained about highway funds used on the skywalk. Former Mayor Herschel Lashkowitz complained that private investors were putting little into the project compared to subsidized loans. \nToday, the Radisson Hotel anchors the downtown skyline and, acre-for-acre, is among the most valuable buildings in town. \nThe hotel and ramp are on land that had been a series of parking lots with a Firestone service shop, valued together at about $149,000. Adjusted for inflation, that's about $336,000 in today's money. The city believed valuations would go up to $7.5 million after the hotel is built, or about $16.9 million in today's money. \nHowever, $7.5 million was the cost of construction, and valuations must be based on market values of similar buildings. The city appears to have continued this practice of use construction value instead of expected market value until recently. \nThe assessor's actual value after construction in 1985 was $3.5 million, less than half of what was projected. That's about $7.3 million in today's money. \nComplete city records were not immediately available, but what information was available suggests the hotel wasn't worth $7.5 million until sometime in the early to mid-1990s without adjusting for inflation. \nIn some ways, the building still has not reached what city leaders had hoped for, using the inflation-adjusted target value of $16.9 million. Today, the valuation of the hotel is $16.5 million. PRACS (1998) \nIncentive: 10-year payment in lieu of taxes originally valued at $1.1 million (inflation adjusted). \nProperty value before incentive: $700,000 in 2000. \nProjected value after incentive: $7.7 million in 2001. \nYear projected value reached: 2003 \nCurrent value: $12.4 million \nProjected job creation: 192 by 2004 including in East Grand Forks facility \nYear projected jobs reached: 2005 \nIn 1998, the PRACS Institute was going through a growth spurt. Having moved into a new building in the Northport neighborhood only three years prior using a five-year tax exemption, the firm was already looking to move out into new and bigger space. \nPRACS proposed to build a new facility on vacant land in the Amber Valley neighborhood and asked the city to reduce taxes on the facility for 10 years, paying no taxes for five years and only half the taxes in the remaining five years in an arrangement called payment in lieu of taxes or PILOT. \nThe expansion didn't get off the ground until 2000 and, at the time, the parcel was worth about $700,000. PRACS projected its new facility would add $7.7 million to the tax rolls by 2001. That happened in 2003. \nWhile the aim of tax-increment financing is to increase property value, the aim of PILOTs is to encourage job creation as well as increase property values. PRACS told the city it would have 192 full-time and part-time workers, including some in a new facility in East Grand Forks, with a total payroll of $5.6 million by 2004. \nWhile the city has not tracked employment by firms that receive incentives, PRACS reported in 2005 that it employed 400 when it applied for another PILOT to expand the Amber Valley facility. \nPRACS' success did not last, however. \nIn 2006, the firm was sold to a North Carolina firm called Cetero Research, which later filed for bankruptcy because of a scandal over falsified records at its Houston facility. A group of investors who bought out Cetero couldn't keep the ship afloat and PRACS closed in 2013, the same year it began paying full property taxes on the original Amber Valley facility. \nIn the aftermath, Novum Pharmaceutical Research Services, a firm doing similar work to PRACS bought the building at auction. A biotech firm Aldevron agreed to lease a part of the building from Novum. Both sought and received five-year exemptions from the city, beginning the cycle all over again. North Dakota Horse Park (2002) \nIncentive: 33-year tax-increment financing to pay for $1.8 million (inflation adjusted) in infrastructure. The state granted $3.2 million (inflation adjusted) for construction of race track facilities. Property value before incentive: $23,000 in 2002 \nProjected value after incentive: $6.5 million in 2008 \nYear projected value reached: Not yet \nCurrent value: $1.2 million, excluding nonprofit and state-owned properties It took a devoted group of horse enthusiasts and lots of public funding to build Fargo's horse racing track. \nAfter winning a $2.5 million grant from the North Dakota Racing Commission, the group looked at several sites before getting effectively free land from Northern Sheyenne Development. \nThe group then worked out a deal with the city in 2002 to use future property taxes generated by new buildings in the area to pay for $1.4 million in streets and sewers. The deal was somewhat unusual because most of the race track complex would pay no taxes, as it is owned by nonprofit racing groups or North Dakota State University, which has an equine center there. Those taxes would, instead, come from Northern Sheyenne land to the east, where the city hoped commercial development would be spurred by the track. \nIf that failed to happen and there wasn't enough taxes to pay for infrastructure, the city would special assess all landowners, including the nonprofit groups and NDSU. \nIn 2002, the property value of all parcels in the tax-increment district was valued by the city at $23,000. City staff believed commercial development would increase the value to $6.5 million in 2008. \nDevelopment has turned out to be much slower than projected, and the city had to levy the special assessments. Due to that debt, state racing officials canceled Fargo's races in 2010, 2011 and 2015. \nRather than force the horse racing groups into default, which would make the city the owner of the race track, the city deferred payment for several years with interest increasing repayment to $2.3 million. \nWith the return of racing to the park in 2016, the city reports that specials are now being paid by all. Fayland Industrial Park (2006) \nIncentive: 25-year tax-increment financing to pay for $4.4 million (inflation adjusted) in infrastructure. \nProperty value before incentive: $169,000 in 2005. \nProjected value after incentive: $44 million in 2013. \nYear proj. Value reached: 2016. \nCurrent value: $56.5 million. \nFayland Industrial Park is home today to several warehouses and a FedEx facility. But back in 2004, it was vacant land that developers at Fay Land Partners told the city was \"not likely to develop\" because it was directly north of the landfill. The exception was the FedEx facility, which was already planned at the time. \nFay Land proposed the city use tax-increment financing to pay for streets and sewers. This means instead of making them pay millions in special assessments, the city would use additional property-tax revenue generated by new buildings in the industrial park. \nThe city agreed in 2005 but required Fay Land to pay specials on parcels that were not developed or underdeveloped if tax increments were not enough to pay for the infrastructure. \nCity staff at the time said parcels in the industrial park were valued at a total of $169,000, paying $4,000 a year in taxes. They projected a little more than $6 million in development a year for seven years for a total of $44 million by 2013. That threshold was actually crossed this year. thanks to three buildings that went up in 2015. \nStill, the $565,000 in additional revenue, known as tax increments, generated each year far exceeds what's needed to make annual payments for the infrastructure, which means the city could end the incentives early, Finance Director Kent Costin said. Microsoft (2007) \nIncentive: 10-year payment in lieu of taxes originally valued at $7 million (inflation adjusted) \nProperty value before incentive: $2 million in 2007 \nProjected value after incentive: $37 million in 2010 \nYear proj. value reached: Not yet \nCurrent value: $30.7 million \nProjected job creation: 509 by 2013 \nYear projected jobs reached: Not available. \nGreat Plains Software, one of Fargo's most successful homegrown firms, got the city to reduce its taxes for 20 years in 1997 when it built the first of several buildings on its new campus in a sparsely developed part of the city's south end. A decade later, after being purchased by Microsoft, the firm was ready to add several more buildings to its campus. \nMicrosoft asked the city to reduce its property taxes for 10 years, paying no taxes for five years and only half the taxes in the remaining five years. \nThe aim of PILOT deals such as this one is to encourage job creation as well as increase property values. To that end, Microsoft said in 2007 it would add 509 jobs with total payroll of $120 million over the next six years. The city cannot say if the firm hit that target, however, because it does not keep track of that. \nWhat is clear is that Microsoft was much more optimistic about the value of its new buildings. In its PILOT application, it projected the value of the construction site, a vacant piece of land west of the main building, would increase from $2 million in 2007 to $37 million by 2010. Currently, the value is $30.7 million. \nSurprisingly, this is not a detriment to the city. According to City Assessor Ben Hushka, PILOTs are based not on actual taxes but taxes estimated at the time the tax reduction was granted. \nBecause the city's tax rate and the value of Microsoft's new buildings are lower than projected, the company pays more to the city in lieu of taxes than its actual taxes would be. It pays 54 percent more, Hushka said. Of course, it didn't pay any taxes on those buildings for five years. Tu-Uyen Tran Tran is an enterprise reporter with the Forum of Fargo-Moorhead.

      "title": "Microsoft Project NEON To Bring New Design Language To Windows 10 Apps In Redstone 3",
      "text": "by Rob Williams   Microsoft Project NEON To Bring New Design Language To Windows 10 Apps In Redstone 3 \nSince the launch of Metro in Windows 8, Microsoft has iterated on its \"Microsoft Design Language\" a few times, with MDL2 being the most recent version to grace Windows 10 . According to fresh rumor, it looks like a third iteration is en route for Windows 10, and it's called \"Project NEON\". \nWhat NEON ultimately is likely to become is \"Metro 2\", the overarching design of Windows and its apps (and the Windows Phone UI) that adheres to very strict guidelines. It's modern, clean and attractive. Microsoft's Metro design language was first introduced with Windows 8 \nWhile we're still a ways out from \"Metro 2\" making its debut, it's rumored to iterate on Metro rather than dramatically overhaul it. Some sources say that new transitions and animations could be introduced. Basically, it should become even more beautiful and eye-catching. While aesthetics are not the only important aspect of computing, having a fluid and slick interface can add significantly to overall experience and feel. \nFor developers, one important aspect of Project NEON is that it won't require much of a learning curve - what you already know isn't going to go change much or go to waste. Furthermore, Microsoft is apparently trying to get rid of a lot of inconsistencies between developers in MDL2, offering more definitive guidelines on app design, which should improve the experience across multiple device types. Windows Store in Windows 10 \nProject NEON is estimated to arrive next fall with the Redstone 3 launch. However, initial preview builds of Redstone 3 could appear much earlier than that. Even at its launch, Project NEON might not be fully realized, so Microsoft could continue iterating leading right up to Redstone 4. \nOne thing that might not stand out too much is the fact that this is all based around Windows 10. These kinds of changes themselves could help warrant a major OS upgrade, but Microsoft is continuing to focus entirely on its latest OS. This approach so far lives up to the idea that Windows 10 will be the \"last monolithic\" Windows release.",

      "text": "Bryson DeChambeau, Microsoft develop pressure-sensing grip Bryson DeChambeau, Microsoft develop pressure-sensing grip E-mail \nBryson DeChambeau, in a very Bryson DeChambeau move, joined forces with Microsoft and Seattle-startup Sensoria to work on a prototype “smart grip.” The grip is designed to analyze pressure applied throughout the swing. \nThe grip’s eight embedded sensors return real-time pressure data. It’s funneled through the cloud via Microsoft Azure, which ”graphically renders pressure of the hands in relation to the golf grip,” Microsoft noted in a blog post. \n“The data collected from Bryson over time will be analyzed during future phases of the project in a machine-learning environment to build new intelligent golf-data streams, helping him determine the right grip and club usage, swing speed, rhythm, plane, and other performance and swing-mechanics variables,” Microsoft added in the post. Credit: Microsoft Technical Case Studies \nAnd it seems Bryson DeChambeau wasn’t just some sort of guinea pig for Microsoft. Rather, Mike Downey, Principal Evangelist for Microsoft Sports Partnerships, discussed Bryson’s golf-related needs with the SMU alum. DeChambeau indicated that maintaining consistent grip pressure was important, and that there were no devices to measure the consistency of his pressure. The smart grip Microsoft and Sensoria developed detects grip position and pressure levels throughout the swing, relaying data Microsoft Azure’s systems. That data was then rendered on a Microsoft Surface using XAMIL and Microsoft Visual Studio. \nFor the less technical among us, here’s what the rendering looked like. Credit: Microsoft Technical Case Studies \nCredit: Microsoft Technical Case Studies \nAnd yes, the Smart Grips were built into DeChambeau’s existing JumboMax grips using a one inch square of embeddable microelectronics known as Sensoria Core. \nMicrosoft and the PGA Tour partnered in 2015 for a three-year deal, which saw Microsoft become the official operating system of the PGA Tour and its Surface tablets worked into the ShotLink shot tracking process. \nSensoria was founded in 2011 by former Microsoft employees. The Seattle-based company develops smart garments and IoE (Internet of Everything) wearable solutions. Your Reaction?",

      "text": "By Steven Johns News Reporter Neowin LLC @stevenjohns · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft has released a new version of the Skype for Linux Alpha every second week ever since the app was first launched back in July . Every single release has introduced more and more features into the app and, while it's still not anywhere near as feature-complete as what you'd find on Windows or macOS, it's actually getting progressively more usable with every release. \nMany of the key features have been completed, such as video calling and support for group chats. Various minor things are now being caught up on - for example, they recently introduced the ability to set avatars for group chats and enabling hostless group calling (the ability for calls to persist after the host leaves). It also has a night-mode version which looks quite nice. \nThe latest release, v1.13, has improved the authentication process of signing into Skype and has introduced the ability to send SMS messages directly from Skype for Linux. Every single release has also come with a swathe of different bug fixes and performance improvements to the Skype for Linux experience and the Microsoft team have been extremely attentive and responsive to issues raised and features requested in the Skype for Linux forum . \nIf Skype is one of the things that have held you back from switching to GNU/Linux, or if you're already using GNU/Linux and have avoided Skype because it was pretty terrible, it might be worth taking another look at it now. \nIf you want to try out the latest version, it is available as a DEB package and as an RPM package.",

Occasionally (10% - 49%) Steps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Play GM mode and try turning off boarding penalties then check players into the boards. Boarding penalties is set to 0/100 What happens when the bug occurs? I get a 5 minute penalty and the player receives a game misconduct. What do you expect to see? I'd expect not to get boarding penalties if I turned them off, especially not one every hit. \n‌",

Early on there were good reasons like Microsoft Word and Cortana to point at when Android and iPhone users would laugh at my Lumia 635. As the months passed it became painfully clear that Microsoft was obviously abandoning the Windows Phone platform for the greener pastures offered by Android and iPhone. Now, we have Microsoft Solitaire Collection hitting Android recently. Another Windows Phone/Windows computer hold out is now available for the competition. The question now is, do Android and iPhone users care? This is a solitaire collection after all.\"",

If you have opened the Store recently on a device with Windows 10 Pro installed on it, you may have noticed that you can install the majority of apps and games just fine without an account.\nWindows 10 Pro: Store apps installation without account \nThe screenshot above highlights this. As you can see on it, no user is logged in the Store app as indicated by the people icon next to search in the top row.\nA click on the \"get\" button on the page starts the download and installation of the selected application or game. This was restricted to Microsoft accounts previously but is no longer on Windows 10 Pro devices.\nNote : I had no chance to test this on Enterprise or Education versions of Windows 10. I'd guess that this is the case for those editions of Windows as well.\nThere are two major restrictions in regards to the new behavior:\nOnly apps or games that are free can be installed without account. This is likely done to avoid situations where apps or games would not be available anymore if the system is installed again. This new option applies only to Windows 10 Pro versions. Windows 10 Home editions still require a Microsoft Account sign in before any apps or games can be downloaded. The downside to this is that you need to download all apps again when you install Windows 10 anew. Some applications may also require a Microsoft account or another account to work properly or at all.\nClosing Words Good news is that you don't need a Microsoft account anymore to install free apps or games on Windows 10 Pro devices. This is especially useful for privacy conscious users who prefer to reveal as little as possible to companies.\nThis is also useful if a computer is used by a community and not by individuals.

      "text": "\nAt its Windows 10 event back in October, Microsoft showed off a number of upcoming changes for Windows 10 which will arrive with the Creators Update in early 2017. Along with all the new features, Microsoft showed off a new Share UI in Windows 10 for a small period in the event which you can see above. And now, it seems like Windows Insiders will be getting the revamped Share UI pretty soon. Peter Skillman, the General Manager of Core UX in Windows recently tweeted:\n@BucksterMcgee @bjorndori @DennisBednarz @NotCassim @zacbowden On it! Share improvements coming to WIP builds soon.\n— peter skillman (@peterskillman) November 25, 2016 \n\nAs Skillman tweeted, the Share improvements will be able to Windows Insider Preview builds soon. However, the tweet is a reply to another tweet which talks about the share feature in Skype UWP — which could suggest that Skillman is talking about the upcoming improvements coming to the Share feature in the Skype UWP app. Even then, as Microsoft already showed off a new Share UI in the Windows 10 Creators Update, it is possible for a new Share UI to show up in the Insider Preview builds pretty soon.\nIt seems like the new Share UI will be much better than the current Share feature in Windows 10. Microsoft hasn’t upgraded the Share feature in Windows since Windows 8/8.1, so the current UI for the Share feature looks out of place in Windows 10. Thankfully with the upcoming upgrade, the Share feature will possibly look a lot better and similar to all the other parts of Windows 10.",

      "text": "Microsoft Solitaire Collection Review by Gravis Ludus   \nCarl Williams writes, “Microsoft is slowly but surely removing any reason to own a Windows Phone. Early on there were good reasons like Microsoft Word and Cortana to point at when Android and iPhone users would laugh at my Lumia 635. As the months passed it became painfully clear that Microsoft was obviously abandoning the Windows Phone platform for the greener pastures offered by Android and iPhone. Now, we have Microsoft Solitaire Collection hitting Android recently. Another Windows Phone/Windows computer hold out is now available for the competition. The question now is, do Android and iPhone users care? This is a solitaire collection after all.”…",

      "text": "Seattle Times staff The Seattle Times \nTUESDAY: Amazon Web Services’ mammoth annual conference, re: Invent, begins in Las Vegas. At the three-day event, AWS CEO Andy Jassy and others will lay out plans for growing the $12 billion unit that generates much of Amazon’s profit. Several of the key presentations will be streamed. \nS&P/Case-Shiller will release its monthly index comparing home-price increases in cities across the country for September. Seattle has been closing in on Portland for the city with the fastest-rising prices. \nWEDNESDAY: Microsoft holds its annual shareholders meeting at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue. The company is likely to tout the success of its move toward selling web-based business software services, which recently has pushed its shares to record highs. Scheduled votes include a shareholder proposal to broaden the ability of shareholders to nominate and vote for directors, and a largely symbolic vote on executive compensation. \nThe Federal Reserve releases its monthly ‘Beige Book’ survey of economic conditions across the nation. Its October report found economic growth had picked up a bit as fall began, supported by modest hiring, an uptick in consumer spending and steady homebuilding. Further evidence of improvement could encourage the Fed to lift interest rates in December. Most Read Stories",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Phone Rumors: 6 GB of RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU, Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3 And More  21 am EST By Anu Passary Tech Times Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The World Now Playing The impending Surface Phone from Microsoft will allegedly come in two memory options — 6 GB of RAM and 4 GB of RAM — as well as house the latest Snapdragon 835 CPU from Qualcomm. The Surface Phone will also run on Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3 and not Redstone 2. Shown here is a concept of the Surface Phone. ( Nadir Aslam ) Advertisement \nThe rumor mill is buzzing again and its blue-eyed boy seems to be none other than the purported Surface Phone from Microsoft. \nRumors pertaining to the Windows 10 Mobile-powered Surface Phone have been creating quite a bit of stir online in the past few months. Microsoft has allegedly codenamed the impending handset the Panos Phone and the device could possibly replace the company's Lumia lineup, which reports suggest may be phased out. \nNow according to a report from Nokia Power User, which is quite reliable when it comes to Windows-powered device news, the upcoming Surface Phone will support Quick Charge 4.0 and house Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 835 processor, which is also said to be powering the impending Samsung Galaxy S8. \nThe publication cites \"trusted sources\" who have offered information on the prototypes of the Surface Phone. Surface Phone Rumors: What's New? \nApart from the news of the Surface Phone housing the powerful Snapdragon 835 CPU and Quick Charge 4.0, the upcoming Microsoft smartphone will allegedly come in two memory options. The company reportedly has two prototypes in the works — one which houses 4 GB of RAM and the other 6 GB of RAM. This contradicts older rumors of the handset touting 8 GB of RAM. \nThe report reveals that the 6 GB variant will supposedly be able to run X86 apps through Continuum . \n\"What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can't run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,\" notes the publication. \nThe 4 GB variant of the Surface Phone, however, will not be able to support this functionality. \nThe display of the Surface Phone prototype is said to be a 5.5-inch Quad HD one. The handset could also have a 3-in-1 form factor and come with laptop accessories in tow as hinted by previous reports. The Surface Phone could potentially have a stylus pen and a keyboard cover like the Surface Pro tablet. Release? \nThe Surface Phone's arrival has been delayed to late 2017 per latest rumors. The handset will come with Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3 out of the box and not Redstone 2. \nOlder rumors have also hinted at the Surface Phone packing in support for a fingerprint scanner, a 21 MP primary camera, an 8 MP selfie snapper and have multiple variants. The Surface Phone will allegedly come in a consumer variant (the 5.5-inch screen version) and a business version (6-inch screen option). \nIt remains to be seen if the much-awaited Microsoft handset will live up to expectations and be a game changer for the company.

In recent years, Apple has been the company most admired for its ability to keep out in front and repeatedly renew itself. \nMicrosoft, in contrast, is a company that had seen its one-time dominance of the enterprise market eroded. It missed out entirely on the launch of key categories — smartphones and tablets — and was generally considered to be an ocean-going liner of a business: lumbering, corporate and nigh-on impossible to turn around once set on a course. \nYet Apple’s crown is under assault, and perhaps from an unexpected place. Microsoft is back, after years in the wilderness, and is reversing received wisdom on these old rivals. \nOne has trendy industrial design,… Want to read more? ",

      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Sunday, November 27, 2016 Microsoft Boasts Strong Xbox One Black Friday Demand, Envisions November And December Sales Victories The Xbox One has been on a sales tear lately with Microsoft bragging earlier this month that its game console had outsold the PlayStation 4 for the fourth consecutive month in the United States, based on tracking data by The NPD Group. Things are not slowing down, either. As Black Friday sales morph into Cyber Monday, Microsoft noted \"strong demand\" for its console. \"There was strong demand for Xbox hardware, accessories, games, and Xbox Live engagement on Black Friday, based on initial results, with a strong start to the holiday season,\" said Mike Nichols, Corporate Vice President of Xbox Marketing. Nichols went on to reiterate the Xbox One's performance in the U.S. over the past four months. He also pointed out that no other console notched more sales in the U.S., U.K., and Australia in the month of October. Those are notable victories considering the Xbox One has, for the most part, trailed the PS4 in sales over the past couple of years. Why the sudden surge in sales? Nichols points to aggressive pricing on console bundles and the ability of the Xbox One to play 4K Blu-ray media.\"Xbox One S is the only console available this year with built-in UHD 4K Blu-ray, 4K video streaming and HDR for video and gaming and it’s available in a variety of bundles for the best value with 500GB, 1TB and 2TB consoles to choose from,\" Nichols added.There may be more interest in 4K Blu-ray media that many people realize, especially as sales on 4K TVs bring an increasing number of capable TVs into homes. Interestingly enough, even Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro doesn't support 4K Blu-ray discs.Whether the Xbox One can maintain this sudden sales momentum throughout the course of the holiday shopping season remains to be seen.",

      "text": "Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Rumoured Microsoft Surface Phone could have 6GB RAM Rumoured Microsoft Surface Phone could have 6GB RAM \n  \nMicrosoft's yet-to-be-confirmed Surface Phone could arrive packing some serious specs if online leaks are accurate, including a whopping 6GB of RAM and detachable keyboard. \nThe latest information comes courtesy of Nokia Power User , and follows a week in which Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, all-but confirmed the company is working on a mobile device in an interview with the Australian Financial Review. \nAccording to NPU, the Surface Phone is currently being developed in a number of different configurations (as is standard practice in smartphone development), so it's possible that either the 4GB or 6GB variant won't make it to market. Or perhaps Microsoft will offer different levels of RAM and other varying specs, similar to Windows computing hardware. \nThe prototypes do have the Snapdragon 835 processor in common, and the higher-spec model can reportedly already run X86 apps in Microsoft's Continuum mode. The 4GB version can't yet do this, however. \nPerhaps more concerningly, the unnamed sources also say that the Surface Phone launch won't happen until towards the end of next year, which could mean another whole year without any significant Windows 10 presence on mobile. \nGiven that Microsoft currently has somewhere around 1 percent of the mobile market, it's probably worth taking as long as it needs and getting it right this time. That's probably cold comfort to Windows fans that wanted a Surface Phone in Q1 of 2017 though. \nRelated: Microsoft Surface Phone: News, rumours, release date, concept, specs and price \nWatch: 5 things you need to know about Windows 10 Mobile \nDo you think a Surface Phone could help Microsoft revive its mobile ambitions?

      "title": "Microsoft Solitaire Collection is now available for iOS and Android",
      "text": "0 0 \nSolitaire is a game that has come pre-loaded with Windows operating system since way back in the Windows 95 days. In a time and place where computers were becoming the new thing to have but weren’t that many things to do with them, a lot of people would play Solitaire for ridiculous amounts of time. \nThe game garnered incredible popularity among people of all ages. Of course, everyone can remember a time when they tried to win at Solitaire. \nSimilar to how the popular mobile game for old Nokia devices Snake is getting an homage with fresh releases that mimic the concept, it’s time to incorporate another piece of computing history in today’s technology with the addition of Microsoft Solitaire Collection to iOS and Android devices. \nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection will be coming to the two most popular mobile platforms soon, as Microsoft claims the game has registered activity from over 119 million distinct users in the last four years. This means that the game maintains a potent fan base despite the number of potential entertainment options available for consumers today. \nAccording to Microsoft, there will also be Xbox integration with Solitaire , meaning users will have the option of logging into the game with their Xbox credentials and earn achievement points. Also, they’ll be able to save their progress so when they switch devices, they can pick up right where they left off. \nThis integration of Solitaire on mobile devices is probably the result of Microsoft’s acknowledgment of the ever growing smartphone and tablet markets, trying thus to help both users that have embraced change and users that still cling on to those old days . Thanks to mobile integration, you will be able to take Solitaire on the road with you and in case you’ve never beaten it, to redeem yourself once and for all. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Microsoft brings updates to Arrow Launcher, OneDrive By 0 \nAnd the updates just keep on rolling from Microsoft and its various digital properties. Just a few days ago, we saw new features and changes added to Bing, Cortana, and the Next Lock Screen. Now it’s the turn of Android device launcher Arrow and cloud-storage service OneDrive. You get memory efficiency and customization options for the former and sorting and parsing improvements and new visuals for productivity for the latter. The updates may not be that major, but we’ll take improvements any day of course. \nFor version 2.7 of Arrow Launcher, you will now be able to search easier and all you have to do is to swipe down. You will also now be able to customize the grid layout of your app page. You can choose from 4×5 to 4×6 and other options so you can arrange your apps the way you like it. You will also be able to customize the content you want displayed in the recent page. You of course get bug fixes and improvements, including a 10% more memory efficient performance. \nIf you store a lot of files on your OneDrive, sorting through all of them can sometimes be a pain. The update to the cloud-storage app says that it will make it easier for users to sort and parse through all the tangled files that you saved there. What it doesn’t tell us exactly is what those changes are. They have also added more paintbrushes and pencils to help you be more productive, again without getting into specifics. \nBoth updates are already rolling out, so if you use either the Arrow Launcher or OneDrive , head on over to their respective Google Play pages and update the apps. If it’s not there yet, just be patient and it will probably reach you sooner or later. TAGS",

      "text": "Cortana For Android Updated With Several New Improvements  33 PST \nMicrosoft has released a new update for its Cortana digital personal assistant on Android. It has been a month since Cortana for Android was last updated. The latest update doesn’t bring any major new features to the mix but it does bring some new improvements that will further enhance the experience for Cortana users on Android. One of the improvements includes the ability to remind users about upcoming birthdays. \nThe birthday reminder feature enables users to easily track the special day of their friends and family so that they never forget, after all, it’s not a pleasant feeling when you forget a loved one’s birthday. \nCortana is now capable of connecting to multiple calendars as well which makes it very useful on Android as there are many calendar apps available for the platform and most users are bound to use at least a couple of them to track their personal and work calendars. \nThis latest update makes Cortana better at retrieving meeting as well and improves accuracy for location-based reminders. The usual slew of bug fixes is included in this update as well. \nThose who are using Cortana on their Android smartphone should go ahead and update the app right now to get this enhanced experience on their device. \nFiled in Cellphones .

      "text": "By Debbie Lord Cox Media Group National Content Desk It started out in 2005 as a day of online shopping – from your desk at work – on the Monday following the Thanksgiving weekend. From then, it has grown from a day of hoping the boss doesn’t catch you as you sneak a bargain, to a full week or more of deals on TVs, computers, toys and tech. Here are a few of the most popular deals from online and brick-and-mortar stores. Overall discounts • Kohls is offering a 20 percent discount on in-store and online purchases from Nov. 26-30. Click here for the coupon you must use for the discount. • Target is offering a 15 percent discount store-wide (and online), with some exceptions. • If you are an Amazon Prime member, you get free two-day shipping on purchases.

      "text": "And the updates just keep on rolling from Microsoft and its various digital properties. Just a few days ago, we saw new features and changes added to Bing, Cortana, and the Next Lock Screen. Now it’s the turn of Android device launcher Arrow and cloud-storage service OneDrive. You get memory efficiency and customization options for the former and sorting and parsing improvements and new visuals for productivity for the latter. The updates may not be that major, but we’ll take improvements any day of course.\nFor version 2.7 of Arrow Launcher, you will now be able to search easier and all you have to do is to swipe down. You will also now be able to customize the grid layout of your app page. You can choose from 4×5 to 4×6 and other options so you can arrange your apps the way you like it. You will also be able to customize the content you want displayed in the recent page. You of course get bug fixes and improvements, including a 10% more memory efficient performance.\nIf you store a lot of files on your OneDrive, sorting through all of them can sometimes be a pain. The update to the cloud-storage app says that it will make it easier for users to sort and parse through all the tangled files that you saved there. What it doesn’t tell us exactly is what those changes are. They have also added more paintbrushes and pencils to help you be more productive, again without getting into specifics.\nBoth updates are already rolling out, so if you use either the Arrow Launcher or OneDrive , head on over to their respective Google Play pages and update the apps. If it’s not there yet, just be patient and it will probably reach you sooner or later.",

      "text": "Home Technology HP Elite X3 Review For Third-Party Smart Phones, Microsoft Reviews HP Elite X3 Review For Third-Party Smart Phones, Microsoft Reviews 1 \nIn our HP Elite X3 review, we take a look at a third-party surface phone while Microsoft stays committed to Windows 10 Mobile. But the company hasn’t released any new device in the last 6 months or so, making everyone believe that it’s ready to give up at least on the hardware side of its mobile push. \nWith rumors that Microsoft is also aiming to abandon the Lumia lineup, every new phone coming from a different company is catching everyone’s attention, and this is exactly what happened with the HP Elite X3. \nAnnounced with much fanfare earlier this year, the HP Elite X3 comes with specs that Windows Phone fans have until now only dreamed about, despite the Lumia 950 series, which also brought specs that were compelling to say the least. \nBut the HP Elite X3 arrives at a time when only few people still believe in Windows phones, so there’s no doubt that hardcore fans really need to give it a shot. \nThat’s exactly what we did, as we took the HP Elite X3 for a spin and used it for several weeks, including with Continuum, to see what this is all about. This time, we’re going to split the review into two parts, namely hardware and software, so read on to find more about this super-powerful Windows phone. \nHardware \nIn terms of hardware, there’s no way you’re not going to be pleased with the HP Elite X3, although there still are things that would need more improvements. But let’s take them one at a time and see what this is all about. \n#Display \nThe HP Elite X3 comes with a 5.96-inch display that you’ll absolutely love. It has a resolution of 1440×2560 pixels, with a pixel density of 494 ppi, and although it looks huge at first, it has major advantages. \nWith a screen-to-body ratio of 72.2 percent, the phone has plenty of screen space to work with, so it’s absolutely a pleasure to browse the web or watch movies. \n“BRILLIANT DISPLAY!” \nIt’s so awesome! Colors are vivid, and the contrast is excellent, much better than on the other Windows phones on the market. The phone also comes with features such as double tap to wake, which is kind of handy given its size, but it lacks Glance screen, and this is one very important setback. \nIt does have a LED notification light to compensate for the lack of Glance, but Windows 10 Mobile does not have advanced support for this feature, so you can’t configure it to blink when you have missed third-party notifications just yet. \nThe response time of the display is impressive to say the least and readability in direct sunlight is a bit above the average. \n#CPU, RAM, and storage \nThis phone comes with the most powerful Snapdragon processor at the moment, namely the 820, which is quad-core in the following configuration: 2 cores running at 2.15 GHz and 2 running at 1.6 GHz. Depending on the power you need, the more powerful cores kick in, giving the phone impressive performance figures. \nThe Elite X3 features 4 GB of RAM, which is pretty much the biggest amount of memory that you can find right now in the Windows phone world, and 64 GB of storage, obviously with microSD card support. \nThe aforementioned configuration makes the HP Elite X3 blazing fast 90 percent of the time, and the remaining 10 percent is lost only because of Windows 10 Mobile. \nThe phone barely gets hot when performing more demanding tasks, such as when watching videos, but even when it does, the cooling system is super-efficient. \nThe amount of storage that the device offers is not overwhelming, but it’s a good thing that it comes with microSD card support. This is something that Apple should borrow as well, although we all know that’s not going to happen.",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Phone Latest News: What Microsoft Has Planned For Surface Windows Phone Latest News: What Microsoft Has Planned For Surface Like \nThe latest Windows Phone news points to rumors that claim Microsoft itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup, which isn’t all that surprising. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Prototype For Surface Phone Revealed with Bigger Display, Processor, RAM Microsoft Prototype For Surface Phone Revealed with Bigger Display, Processor, RAM \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone With Speedy Snapdragon Technologies For Windows 10 Mobile Microsoft Surface Phone With Speedy Snapdragon Technologies For Windows 10 Mobile 1 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "  Prototype For Phone Revealed with Bigger Display, Processor Microsoft Surface Prototype For Phone Revealed with Bigger Display, Processor \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

      "text": "  Phone With Snapdragon Technologies For Windows 10 Microsoft Surface Phone With Snapdragon Technologies For Windows 10 1 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "  Studio Shipment Begins, Support Line Available Microsoft Surface Studio Shipment Begins, Support Line Available Michael Stevens Nov 27, 2016 Technology Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Studio Shipment Begins, Support Line Available Like \nMicrosoft said it is shipping Surface Studio orders earlier than expected, as the company originally planned to ship units in mid-December. But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio , but new devices won’t ship until “early 2017.” \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

From then, it has grown from a day of hoping the boss doesn’t catch you as you sneak a bargain, to a full week or more of deals on TVs, computers, toys and tech. Here are a few of the most popular deals from online and brick-and-mortar stores. Overall discounts • Kohls is offering a 20 percent discount on in-store and online purchases from Nov. 26-30. Click here for the coupon you must use for the discount. • Target is offering a 15 percent discount store-wide (and online), with some exceptions. • If you are an Amazon Prime member, you get free two-day shipping on purchases.
