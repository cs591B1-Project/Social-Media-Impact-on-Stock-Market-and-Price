      "text": "McDonald’s uses a vintage doll for its Christmas ad \nThe fast food giant is placing its bets on a vintage wooden doll this Christmas. By Rachel Gee   \nMcDonald’s headline Christmas TV ad, created by Leo Burnett, features a vintage doll called Juilette, who comes to life after being left on a shelf and missing out on becoming a kid’s festive toy. \nThe red-haired doll – who Marketing Week is told is no relation to Chucky – glances at a McDonald’s restaurant opposite her toy shop window. \nOn Christmas Eve, just as the toy shop is closing, Juliette escapes and meets fellow toy ‘Meteor Mike’ at the McDonald’s before leaving together in an emotional ending. \nThe Juliette doll will be featured throughout the campaign’s social activity and will feature in a separate 20 second ad highlighting this year’s Christmas menu. It will also be pictured on McDonald’s festive coffee cup collection, and other in-store activity will allow customers to potentially win £10 Amazon gift cards through McDonald’s first ever augmented reality-enabled tray mat. \n“The Juliette tray mat is our first step into augmented reality and we’re excited to see our customers using it,” said Emily Somers, vice president of food and marketing at McDonald’s UK. \nThe emotional ad follows a puppet-based campaign from Sainsbury’s, with McDonald’s using similar CGI effects and puppeteering. The ad will run over an eight week period through a range of channels including TV, radio, out of home, digital and in-store advertising. \nMcDonald’s, partly boosted by positive UK trading, saw like-for-like revenue increase by 3.5% in the three months to September.",

      "text": "  \nWell, we knew this was coming. \nIt only makes sense. \nWhy pay an uneducated person with limited skills $15 per hour when you can spend a few bucks on a couple machines to do the exact same job? \nMachines don’t complain. \nThe Left, as usual, remains clueless to the fact that raising the minimum wage will harm more than it will help. \nNow, McDonald’s will be installing automated ordering stations at ALL U.S. locations. \nALL! \nFrom Daily Caller : \nMcDonald’s has announced plans to roll out automated kiosks and mobile pay options at all of its U.S. locations, raising questions about the future of its 1.5 million employees in the country and around the globe. \nRoughly 500 restaurants in Florida, New York and California now have the automated ordering stations, and restaurant in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., will be outfitted in 2017, according to CNNMoney . \nThe locations that are seeing the first automated kiosks closely correlate with the fight for a $15 minimum wage. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law a new $15 minimum wage for New York state in 2016, and the University of California has proposed to pay its low-wage employees $15. Florida’s minimum wage will rise Jan. 1, 2017 . Seattle raised its minimum wage to $15 in 2014, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. \nCustomers place their order at touch screens, and then receive a number with a “digital locator,” which then notifies staff to where the customer is sitting. Once the order is ready to serve, a McDonald’s employee delivers the food to the customers table. \nNews of McDonald’s plans to expand its digital self-serve ordering stations and table service to all of its 14,000 American restaurants backs up concerns that the fight for $15 will expedite the growth of automation and robots. Aparna Mathur , Resident Scholar for Economic Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that a push for a $15 minimum wage might just be enough for companies to expedite plans to automate industries such as fast food. \nRonald, you’re fired! \nWhen liberals finally awake from their toddler-like slumber, it will be too late. Their policies do nothing but oppress those they aim to help. \nBut who are we kidding? The Left doesn’t want to help. They want socialism. \nDemocrats want every American on the same playing field regardless of education level, hours worked, and so on. As long as a CEO is making x amount, the fast food worker should take home the same salary. \nIt’s ridiculous, and we’re losing the American Dream because of these simpletons. Home ownership is at its lowest in decades. \nAnyone demanding more money while performing the most basic job on the planet needs help. Anyone who supports this act is similarly deranged.

This was used in countries outside the United States in any year until 1984. The line was now removed from the Golden Arches. And the font was changed for the McDonald's text, and is shown on the Golden Arches. 1969–2006 A version of this logo without the word \"McDonald's\" was used at a restaurant in New York City, NY from the 1980s until that restaurant retired this variant for good in 2012 or 2013.

Spanish version. 2006–present \nAs part of the first restaurant redesign in decades, called 'Forever Young', in 2006, the logo was redesigned and repainted and this logo became the company's official logo. The red background is special occasionally used and the lettering is sometimes used separately to the 'Golden Arches'.

      "text": "Antonio J. Newell \nThe following article is entirely the opinion of Antonio J. Newell and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr. \nThis Facebook live video is spreading through the Internet like wildfire. However, it’s all at the request of the heroin addict’s family. \nFacebook live has become a useful tool for capturing emergency situations. Generally, each video will have at least one witness. Plus — if Facebook doesn’t disrupt the live video or “mistakenly delete” it — the footage is great evidence which can be used later. Facebook Live Video Awakens Heroin Addict To Harsh Reality \nIn this particular instance, live video footage captured a man in distress, within a Sandusky, Ohio McDonald’s parking lot. While streaming in real-time, Facebook users were able to bear witness to the heroin epidemic which is plaguing the city. \nThe man in the Facebook video is named Michael Williams . And, he said the experience captured live was one that shook him. \nAccording to a video interview with WKYC-3 News, Williams explained that he never thought such a thing could happen to him. \nIsn’t that how it usually happens? Warnings and cautions — no matter how dangerous — rarely ever stick until it hits home. A man driving by a McDonald's Thursday afternoon used Facebook Live to stream two victims overdosing on heroin. https://t.co/rRQLfNb0oc \n— ABC13News (@ABC13News) November 18, 2016 \nKHOU-11 News notes that the overdosing man in the Facebook live video is actually new to heroin. The source says he only started using it four months ago. \nPrior to his heroin usage, he drank a lot and took pain pills. As he mentioned, those particular substances didn’t take him to the breaking point. \nSadly, it’s the near-death experience (NDE) which really locks it into understanding and regret. \nIf you’re interested in the full Facebook live video, it’s located below. \nWarning: The following video contains graphic footage. Viewer discretion is advised. <noscript><iframe src=\"http://interactive.tegna-media.com/video/embed/embed.html?id=2428075&type=video&title=Sandusky%20OD&site=285&playerid=6918249996581&dfpid=32805352&dfpposition=Video_prestream_external§ion=home\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></noscript> \nAt the time of this Facebook video, it was a live representation of Northeast Ohio’s issue with heroin and opium. According to WKYC-3, within the last 30 days, there have been 30 similar overdose cases like Michael Williams’. \nDuring the video interview with the news station, Williams honestly admitted he needs help with this substance abuse situation. \nWhen Michael got a chance to watch himself in the live video, he fought back tears as the Facebook playback rolled. \nSurely, it had to be a different feeling watching himself, “live,” gasping for air and barely clinging to life. Facebook Live: Family Wants Everyone To Spread This Video \nDuring the live interview with WKYC, Williams’ sister, Amber, advocated for her brother’s help. One method of help was the collective spread of the Facebook live video across the Internet. \nAccording to Amber, she not only wants her brother to be helped but also everyone suffering from this epidemic. \nThe source notes that this heroin addict needs a particular type of help. However, he doesn’t have insurance and is currently unemployed. \nWKYC-3 mentions the addict’s need to be admitted into a specific program. Yet, unfortunately, this rehabilitation treatment comes with an out-of-pocket cost exceeding $800 per day, without insurance. And, according to the source, Medicaid doesn’t cover it either. \nNevertheless, Michael Williams says he’s grateful that his overdose was recorded on Facebook live. The video serves as an eye-opener, as well as a reminder. \nAlthough Facebook has a policy against graphic material on its website, sometimes live video such as Williams’ skates by undetected. \nSpeaking of the footage, the Facebook live video was recorded by Eddie Wimbley. Facebook live video shows heroin overdose https://t.co/NxvydsPsjw \n— WWLP-22News (@WWLP22News) November 19, 2016 \nIn a post-interview with Alyssa Raymond of WKYC-3, Facebook user Wimbley noted that he doesn’t understand how people can abuse themselves in such a way — putting something possibly lethal into their bodies. \nLike Williams’ sister, Facebook live video cameraman Wimbley hopes the footage will spread to all of those who need this wake up call-to-action. \nIf you’re interested in Wimbley’s entire interview, you can watch the Facebook video located below. \nAll in all, what are your thoughts about this Facebook live video? Do you know of anyone dealing with something similar? Feel free to share your comments in the section below. \n[Feature Image by Facebook Live Video]",

      "title": "Why is McDonald’s suing Florence, Italy? - CSMonitor.com",
      "text": "McDonald’s is filing a lawsuit against the city of Florence after the historic Italian city rejected an application for a restaurant in its historic Piazza del Duomo, home to Brunelleschi's Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral and one of the most visited destinations in Italy.\nClaiming discrimination, the fast food mega-chain is suing the city for 18 million euros (about $10 million) – the revenue the company estimates will be lost over the next 18 years. Meanwhile, the mayor of Florence, the center-left Dario Nardella, is maintaining his position that the city was within its rights to reject the proposal in the name of historic preservation.\n\"McDonald's has the right to submit an application, because this is permitted under the law, but we also have the right to say no,\" Mayor Nardella told the city council . Another council in charge of maintaining the city’s ancient center also rejected the proposal a month later.\nRecommended: 10 weirdest global fast foods Italy’s first McDonald’s opened near Rome’s famous Spanish Steps in 1986 and since then dozens have sprung up along the peninsula.\n10 weirdest global fast foods Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend But recently, the American restaurant chain has experienced more pushback from the Mediterranean nation. Earlier this year, cardinals fought efforts to open a restaurant in Rome near the Vatican’s Saint Peter’s Square. A McDonald’s in the area would be \"by no means respectful of the architectural tradition of one of the most characteristic squares which look onto the colonnade of Saint Peter’s,\" said Cardinal Elio Sgreccia in a statement .\nThe fast food chain has faced many challenges integrating its brand into historic and sacred corners of the world. In China, there was outrage when the chain opened outside a historic villa in the city of Hangzhou that once housed prominent leaders. Similarly, Paris pushed back when a trade deal threatened to bring McDonald's to the Rue Montorgueil , which for more than 800 years was a covered food market that carries a significant culinary legacy.\nHowever, the disputes often do not end in a hard \"No,\" but with a compromise worked out between the company and city regarding menu items, cleanliness, litter control, and architectural continuity.\nAfraid of an onslaught of fast food chains catering to the city’s increasing number of backpacking travelers, Florence introduce a rule that restaurants along the historic Piazza del Duomo must use “typical products” – traditional Tuscan ingredients – in order to keep a certain level of authenticity in the city’s central square.\nIn the lawsuit, McDonald’s argues that it fit its business model to these requirements, including plans \"to introduce typical local products in our offer, as requested from the local commerce regulation.\"\nWhen its application was still rejected, the company sued in Italy's administrative court, which moderates government disputes.\n\"We completely agree that the cultural and artistic heritage and the Italian historical town centers have to be protected and guaranteed, as well as the traditions and the historical small shops, but we cannot accept discriminatory regulations that damage the freedom of private initiative without being advantageous to anyone,\" McDonald's told the BBC .\nMeanwhile, Florence has held its stance that it has the right to decline such applications and that doing so was not done as an act of discrimination.\n\"We don't have any prejudice\" against McDonald's, Nardella told the city council .\nThe mayor added that the chain has other locations elsewhere in the city, including locations near the Santa Maria Novella transportation hub and another near the Galleria dell' Accademia, where tourists flock to see Michelangelo’s famous David statue.",

      "text": "McDonald's Is Testing a Sriracha Big Mac 11/20/2016 11:09 pm ET BurgerBusiness BurgerBusiness.com \nMcDonald's has begun testing a Sriracha Big Mac burger in the Columbus, Ohio, market, the same location for the earlier test of the Mac Jr. And Grand Mac that it will introduce nationally in early 2017. \nIn addition to having exclusive access to a Sriracha Big Mac, Columbus diners can order Sriracha Mac Sauce on any item on McDonald's menu and/or get the spicy sauce in a mini tub for dipping fries or Chicken McNuggets. \n\"We're always trying new creations and we wanted to innovate with an on-trend flavor like Sriracha to give our customers in Columbus a new and exciting taste,\" McDonald's Chef Mike Haracz said in a statement announcing the test. \nThis is the first time McDonald's has tried Sriracha Mac Sauce on the Big Mac itself, but it continues a love-affair with sriracha that began in early summer, as BurgerBusiness.com has documented: \nJune 2016: McDonald's offers a \"Signature Sriracha\" toppings combination (Sriracha Big Mac sauce, white Cheddar cheese, crispy onions, a new spinach/kale blend and tomato) in San Diego as part of its test of the Signature Crafted Recipes platform in San Diego. \nJuly 2016: McDonald's expands the Signature Sriracha test to Washington State. \nAugust 2016: McDonald's introduces two LTO sriracha burgers in Canada . The Spicy Sriracha Mighty Angus burger was a100% Canadian Angus beef patty topped with hickory-smoked bacon pieces, lettuce, processed Cheddar cheese, sliced jalapeňos, sriracha sauce and an applewood-smoke seasoned sauce on a sesame-and-poppy-seed bun. The Spicy Sriracha Country Chicken sandwich had a seasoned Canadian chicken breast topped with lettuce and white processed Cheddar cheese, sliced jalapenos, sriracha sauce and applewood-smoke seasoned sauce served on the same sesame-and-poppy-seed-glazed bun. \nSeptember 2016: BurgerBusiness.com reported exclusively that on Sept. 23, 2016, McDonald's Corp. filed a federal trademark registration for \"Mac Sauce.\" Not Big Mac Sauce, just Mac Sauce. And that's the term being used now for the Columbus Sriracha Big Mac test. \nI speculated then that McDonald's might be eying taking bottled Mac Sauce to supermarket shelves--as it did with McCafé coffee--and I still think that's a reasonable possibility.

      "title": "McDonald's New Initiative Should Deliver Good Returns In 2017",
      "text": "McDonald's New Initiative Should Deliver Good Returns In 2017 Nov.21.16 Send Message Summary \nMcDonald’s is looking to reshape the dining experience of its customers by adding table service, mobile payments and self-serve kiosks in all of its over 14,000 U.S. restaurants. \nThe company has lately seen lower comp sales growth in its domestic restaurants and also year-on-year fall in customer count. \nThis new upgrade will be completed in 2017 and should provide a boost to average check size. \nMcDonald’s is trading at lower valuation in comparison to competitors and should provide good returns in next 12 to 18 months as new initiatives provide better comp growth. McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) is going for a makeover to attract more customers and use technology to provide better dining experience for customers. McDonald's has experimented with table service at over 500 restaurants in New York, Florida and Southern California. After seeing positive results it is now planning to roll out this initiative in all of the more than 14,000 restaurants in U.S. It is also planning to add self-serve kiosk ordering and mobile payments to make the ordering process seamless. Click to enlarge McDonald's has tried to fight back the challenges from other competitors like Panera Bread by adding more customization within its menu. However, an expanded menu inevitably brings a number of issues. The biggest problem is slower food delivery and longer ordering lines. Self-serve kiosks are a perfect solution for this problem as they allow customers to order after looking at all the customizations possible. They are also more relaxed while ordering which should provide an increase in check size. Waiting at the counter is also a bottleneck in the number of customizable options which the company can provide to customers. Greater options would lead to more time for preparing which is an inconvenience for customers waiting at the counter. However, if they are waiting at their table for the food to be served, most of the customers would be willing to wait longer allowing the company to provide a more diverse menu. Challenges with this move These changes will require additional investment between $28,000 and $56,000 per restaurant. For higher volume restaurants like the one at TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan, the investment would be closer to upper estimates. Older ordering option will also be continued. This initiative has been rolled out in other markets like Canada, Britain and Australia, where they have seen almost a quarter of transactions been done at the in-store screens. Nevertheless, franchisees who have to foot the additional investment would face higher costs on the back of other changes made within McDonald's. A bigger issue is the brand perception. This initiative would be taken positively by younger millennial generation who are more tech-centric. However, older generations who see the restaurants as a place to quickly get food within a budget might be put-off by these changes. During the announcement CEO Steve Easterbrook stressed that this was not a move for a different McDonald's but to have a better McDonald's. The management would need to make the current changes without alienating the core customers. High time for these changes The company has seen falling customer count for the past four year in U.S. The decline in traffic reflects the decrease in popularity for the brand as other alternatives gain traction. Click to enlarge Fig: Fall in customer count in the past few years After taking over as CEO, Steve Easterbrook has made a number of changes like changing drive-thru ordering, improving quality of food by getting rid of certain antibiotics and increasing the speed of the kitchen. Introducing all-day breakfast also gave a healthy boost to sales. However, changes in customer preferences required a more drastic adjustment for the company. The new initiatives would not only provide a better experience for customers but have shown to give improvements in key metrics. The test runs in 500 restaurants showed increase in check size from average of $5 to $6. They also showed substantial improvement in customer satisfaction scores, especially for families who like having their food brought to them. Valuation After showing over 25% increase in 2015, McDonald's stock has been catching breath in 2016. The stock increased by 1.57% YTD compared to 6.75% by S&P500. One of the main reasons for this performance was lower comp sales numbers, especially in the domestic market. As the new initiatives are rolled out in all the restaurants we should see a good bump in comp sales growth within U.S. which can provide sustainable upward momentum for the stock. Click to enlarge Fig: Comparison of forward PE and yield between MCD, Yum brands (NYSE: YUM ), Panera Breads (NASDAQ: PNRA ) and Dunkin Brands (NASDAQ: DNKN ) Currently it is trading at 21.1 times forward earnings, lower than other competitors and is also giving healthier yield. Investor Takeaway McDonald's has launched new initiatives which include providing table service, mobile payments and self-serve kiosk at all restaurants in U.S. These changes should align the restaurants closer to the changing customer preferences. They should also lift the average check size as customers can order after seeing all the customization options available and do not feel pressured while ordering. In the long run we might see more customization options from McDonald's as the food delivery bottleneck is lifted by table service. The company should deliver better comp numbers in 2017, especially on the back of lower growth in 2016. This should give a good boost for the stock in the next 12 to 18 months.

      "text": "McDonald's and Louis Vuitton two global brands blamed for 'neutering' the Punk movement ahead of 40th Anniversary By Stephen Lepitak - 21 November 2016 07:11am McDonald's and Luis Vuitton are set to face fire at an event \nGlobally recognised brands such as McDonald's and Louis Vuitton are set to face retribution at an event which aims to reignite the founding principles of the Punk movement. \nThe event, created by Joe Corré, the son of Vivienne Westwood, and Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, will celebrate the 40th anniversary of Punk by identifying brands that have emulated it within their marketing activities, in turn 'neutering' what it once stood for. \nOther brands being that have been highlighted for attention will be Virgin Money and Switchcover. \n“Louis Vuitton recreated the front of the ‘Seditionaries’ shop on the King’s Road for a catwalk collection of limp designs including bondage trousers with just one zip. The most disgusting thing Louis Vuitton do, is at the end of each season, every unsold item is sent back to Paris and burned so they can protect their preposterous luxury image. Millions of pounds worth of products every season, year after year. It puts what I am burning into perspective,\" stated Corre. \nIn retaliation, Corré will burn his £5m Punk collection at a secret central London location. \n\"I can’t stand how corporations have appropriated, castrated, packaged and privatised punk. They’ve literally lobotomised it. Just like everything else that once belonged to the people of this country, the message is punk is not for sale” he says. \n“40 years ago all these people thought that punk was disgusting and dangerous and needed to be extinguished”. \nHe added: “The same people are now having a bit of punk with their tea and sandwiches”. \nThe event will be live streamed through a feed through added to this page on The Drum on Saturday 26 November. \nThis article is about: World , sex pistols , punk , Louis Vuitton , Vivienne Westwood , McDonald’s , Digital , Marketing , Media , Social Media , Creative , Brand Stephen Lepitak \nHi - I'm the editor of The Drum - so give me a shout if you have any news, feature ideas, opinion insights or views or update me on then drop me a line.",

      "text": "Automated fast food is soon to be a widespread reality : Bottom Line: Some McDonald's locations have already been using in-store automated kiosks for ordering. McDonald's has now confirmed that all 14,000+ US locations will have them sooner than later. They've made the move to make it mandatory to ensure a seamless in store process across the company. It's widely believed that once the process is commonplace in store, that the drive-thru will be next. Drive-thru is 70%+ of McDonald's business, so it's easier to roll out a new ordering system in store. Now the automated process may turnout to be a consumer benefit over the long run however it will eliminate thousands of entry level jobs at the same time . It's known that many fast food companies began working on this type of automated process due to the increased minimum wages in many cities and the threat in others. Simply put, $15 per hour minimum wages aren't viable for most McDonald's locations for entry level work. So unfortunately this is one of the largest examples yet of how artificially high entry level wages hurt those who simply need access to work.  ",

      "text": "Michael Keaton on McDonald's founder Ray Kroc Karl Quinn 21 Nov 2016, 4:48 p.m. Having narrowly missed out in 2015 with Birdman, Michael Keaton is once again stirring Oscar talk with The Founder. But, he tells Karl Quinn, he won't let the chatter go to his head. Michael Keaton on McDonald's founder Ray Kroc \"Work hard and never whine\": Michael Keaton's latest role has the Oscars pundits buzzing. Photo: Art Streiber / AUGUST/Raven & Snow ╳ exit \nThe official version of the McDonald's story runs as smooth and orderly as every one of the fast-food giant's franchise operations is meant to. \nA single burger stand in California gives birth to a global brand. The people who started it, brothers Dick and Maurice McDonald, watch on happily as the man who saw its potential rolls it out across the US. And when Ray Kroc offers them $3 million for full rights to the name and the company in 1961 (a sum worth about $24 million in today's money), everybody walks away from the table feeling pretty damned McHappy with themselves. \nOnly that's not quite how it played out. \nThe version of the McDonald's story told in John Lee Hancock's The Founder is rather different from the version you'll find on the McDonald's website , though both place Ray Kroc front and centre. In the official version he is an inspiration and a visionary. But the version of Kroc portrayed so brilliantly in the film by Michael Keaton is also a cut-throat, a drunk and an utter cad. \nSo, I ask Keaton, when you were offered the role, did Ray Kroc strike you as a heroic character or a villainous one? \n\"He struck me as an interesting character,\" he says. \"In a lot of ways this is not even a biopic. It's about a thing, a thing that is personified by Ray Kroc. It's the story of the free enterprise system, about capitalism.\" \nThe Founder opens squarely in Death of a Salesman territory, with Kroc a struggling travelling rep for a company that sells milkshake machines. They're bulky, expensive, and damned hard to shift. We get scene after scene of Kroc lugging one of these cast-aluminium beasts out of the boot of his car and onto the counter of some rundown milk bar in the middle of that vast American heartland, only to be greeted by the stony indifference of the proprietor. The only thing that stops him throwing in the towel, you suspect, is the fact he owns the company, Prince Castle. The Founder .\" src=\"http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/o/c/s/5/i/image.imgtype.articleLeadwide.620x349.png/1461626033536.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\">\nWinners are grinners: Could Keaton's turn as Ray Kroc spell Oscar glory? Photo: Roadshow \nIt is just the latest in a long line of moderately successful enterprises the thrusting Kroc has thrown himself into, we soon discover. His wife, played by Laura Dern, wants him to settle for what they've got – a big house, dinners at the country club, a place in polite society if only he stuck around long enough to take up the offer. \"When's enough going to be enough for you?\" she asks him at one stage. \"Probably never,\" he replies. \nKroc's life changes when he gets an order for six machines from one operator in San Bernardino, California. Intrigued, he drives thousands of kilometres to take a look. What he sees there – a fast-food joint run like an auto assembly plant, with the McDonald brothers' patented Speedee system and a workspace planned down to the inch – blows his mind. That the burgers are good, the fries crisp and the milkshakes thick, and all delivered to him seconds after ordering, only seals the deal. \nAnother day, another zero dollars. \nKeaton says it's hard for us to appreciate just how revolutionary this all was in 1954. \"I don't think people realise how much McDonald's changed things culturally. The way we eat – anywhere you want. You don't need any silverware, you don't need anything. We don't think about that now, but it really changed things.\" \nThere are now more than 36,000 McDonald's outlets globally. The company operates in 119 countries. For many of us it seems always to have been there ( the first McDonald's in Australia opened in 1971 ; today, there are more than 900 stores here). \nKeaton knew nothing about the origin story before he read the script. \"You just drive by those big arches, that big M, and you think it's just a thing like a tree, a thing I see every day,\" he says. \"I didn't even know there were McDonalds brothers.\" \nWhich is probably just the way Ray Kroc would have wanted it. \n\"That's exactly right,\" he says with a laugh. \nThere are many great moments in The Founder , but one of the finest has Kroc producing a business card with the single word \"Founder\" beneath his name. By the time he's pulled it out of his pocket, we know beyond doubt that he is not the founder – or at least not the founder of the burgers, the fries, the production line, the golden arches, the name or any of the other things we generally associate with McDonald's. But he is the man who saw the potential in all of that, the man who convinced the McDonald brothers – played here with a very straight bat by Parks and Recreation 's Nick Offerman and character actor John Carroll Lynch – to let him franchise the concept. \nMac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch) and his brother Dick (Nick Offerman) in The Founder . \nTo a degree, The Founder is really a meditation on the virtues or otherwise of copyright. Yes, the idea belonged to the McDonald brothers, but if it had stayed with them, its full potential might never have been realised (and granted, a lot of people might argue that would be no bad thing). Yes, Kroc is a bit of a crook, but in seeing and unlocking all that burger stand might become he is also something of a genius. \n\"It was really the beginning of branding, and Ray Kroc understood branding,\" says Keaton. \"He understood everything the McDonald brothers didn't understand. And they had the chance to jump on, they had every chance in the world to go along for the ride, and when they didn't he said, 'All right, I'm going to go on this ride without you'.\" \nKeaton is deeply ambivalent about Kroc. \"What I admire is his work ethic, his determination, his ambition, his hustle, his go-get-'em spirit. That I'll defend all day long.\" \nBut, he says, \"the choices he makes towards the end after he becomes successful are harsh, man – I mean harsh – and nothing I would ever do, nothing most people would ever do. But that's one of the more interesting things about the movie, if you ask me.\" \nHis favourite scene in the movie, he says, \"doesn't even have dialogue\". It's just Kroc staying behind into the night, after everyone else has gone home, to obsessively sweep and clean the forecourt of his store in Des Plaines, Illinois (the first one opened under his management). \"My oldest brother ran a dry-cleaning business and he worked like that,\" he says. \nKeaton was one of seven kids raised by his Catholic parents in a farmhouse in Pennsylvania. In the speech he gave at the Golden Globes in 2015, when he won best actor in a comedy film for Birdman , he said \"I don't ever remember a time when my father [a civil engineer] did not work two jobs\". \nMichael Keaton let it all hang out in Birdman . \nRay Kroc would have been perfectly comfortable with the principles instilled by the parents of the man born Michael Douglas (he changed his name when he took to acting for obvious reasons). \"In the household in which I was raised, the themes were pretty simple,\" he said at the Globes. \"Work hard. Don't quit. Be appreciative. Be thankful. Be grateful. Be respectful. Also to never whine. Ever. Never complain and always, for cryin' out loud, keep a sense of humour.\" \nThe ruthless side of Kroc doesn't sit so well with Keaton, an avowed Democrat (albeit one who enjoys hunting in the wilds near his home in Montana), but there was never any question of softening his sharp edges for the screen. \n\"To try and sugar-coat anything, I had zero interest in that,\" he says. \"To be honest with you, I find it kind of cowardly as an actor to always need to be loved, to be begging for sympathy. \n\"The people I love, like Joaquin Phoenix and Daniel Day-Lewis, the people whose work I like, it never enters their mind. The character is the character. The story is the story. My job is to serve it.\" \nIt's fair to say that, at 65, Michael Keaton is enjoying a career renaissance when most people are thinking about retiring. It's not that he ever stopped working: between Batman in 1989 and Birdman in 2014, he made 24 movies, including one as star and director ( The Merry Gentlemen , 2008), and a bunch of TV too. It's just that he somehow slid inexorably off that rung reserved for stars and back into the ranks of the jobbing actor (albeit the jobbing actor still getting film roles in Hollywood). \nBut there's no question Birdman set his career soaring again. With its fading star most famous for playing a superhero, Alejandro Inarritu's film looked like it had been written specifically for Keaton, though it had not. But it certainly reminded the world what it had been missing. \nKeaton won the Golden Globe and was hotly tipped to add the best actor Oscar. But while the film won four statues in February 2015, Keaton missed out to Eddie Redmayne (for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything ), and the eagle-eyed cringed for him as the camera briefly caught sight of Keaton putting his acceptance speech back in his pocket. \nIt must have been a bittersweet experience, I suggest. \n\"It was just a sweet experience,\" he shoots back. \"Sweet, sweet, sweet. Eliminate the bitter. Sweet, sweet, sweet as can be. I just loved it, loved all of it.\" \nThere's a growing sense that The Founder may give him another crack; certainly the film's release has been timed for an Oscar run and the buzz around it, and Keaton's performance, is strong. We can certainly expect to see a rash of \"for your consideration\" ads in the Hollywood trade papers over the next couple of months. \nDoes that create any kind of pressure? \n\"It's flattering but it doesn't really affect me,\" says Keaton. \"I mean it affects you because it's bigger than you are, it's a giant international industry, and you'd have to be an idiot to be totally ignorant of the process. But I ain't gonna die one way or the other. I'm gonna keep doing what I do, in my career and in life.\" \nKarl Quinn is on facebook at karlquinnjournalist and on twitter @karlkwin ",

      "text": "By Kim Mateus   publishers like Coursera are offering specializations for their audience; McDonald’s brings a multiplatform approach to app marketing; WPP and Spotify form partnership \nMultiplatform publishers can do amazing things by adding to a variety of offerings. Some of these publishers are experienced in the digital world, while others are starting to get their feet wet with digital interactions. \nCoursera is one of the experienced publishers in this discussion. The company’s new engagements include charging customers on a subscription basis, instead of using an up-front model. Subscription Insider reports, “Coursera, a for-profit, online education platform that partners with top universities and organizations worldwide, just made professional education a little more affordable. The company recently announced that it would offer Specialization subscriptions, a new payment model that would allow students to pay for all the content in a particular area of study on a month-to-month or annual basis. Coursera launched the new program October 31, and will continue to roll out its most popular Specializations in the coming months.” The results are in: Discover how to make money with digital magazines, and launch a digital magazine that consumers actually want to buy,   2016 Mequoda American Magazine Reader Study & Handbook and handbook today. \nThis new product will allow users to avoid a long-term commitment, and the subscriptions will be priced between $39 and $89 per month. \nThe other digital properties coming together for special reasons are Spotify and WPP’s Data Alliance. These two are joining through a global partnership to share data and insights. \nMediaPost reports on the partnership. “As part of the agreement WPP has access to the listening preferences and behaviors of Spotify’s 100 million users in 60 countries. The multi-year deal enables WPP and its clients to glean insights from the connection between music and audiences’ moods and activities, according to the holding company, which could enhance campaign planning and potentially lead to more relevant creative work. “Music attributes such as tempo and energy are proven to be highly relevant in predicting mood, which enables advertisers to understand their audiences in a new emotional dimension,” the firm stated in a release.” \nThis partnership will also involve programmatic marketing platforms (PMP) as another multiplatform approach developed between these two companies. \nNow we come to McDonald’s, the company we wouldn’t normally think as a deep park of the multiplatform paradigm, but one that may become a bigger player in that area. \nMcDonald’s has launched a new app iOS 10 McRib Finder iMessage app. This has been done for a limited-time while the famous McRib sandwich is available at locations around the country. An article on Digiday discusses this foray into app marketing with McDonald’s, and what the app means for the future of McDonald’s digital marketing pursuits. “The app launch is part of the brand’s move to digital that began with a new CEO, Steve Easterbrook, who came on board in March last year. Since then, the brand hasn’t been shy about needing a turnaround as younger customers opt out of Big Macs in favor of healthier fast-casual food. Last year, the brand sent teams to SXSW in Austin, to work with startups via pitch competition aimed at digitizing the company. That includes ideas like drone delivery — or more prosaic ones like mobile ordering or voice-recognition in drive-thru speakers.” \nIt’s an interesting time as we continue to see major brands get involved in the world of digital   .

      "text": "McDonald's Table Service Will Be a New Feature at Its Restaurants By: Joey Haar   bloomberg & restaurantnews As one of the largest QSRs in the world, McDonald's has had a a knack for being at the forefront of developments in the industry, and it seems that that might be happening once more with the announcement of McDonald's Table Service. The restaurant announced that its locations will soon offer table service for all guests, meaning that a McDonald's staff member will bring people their orders as well as taking orders from the table. According to Steve Easterbrook, the CEO of McDonald's, \"Customers are getting increasingly demanding, and their expectations will only grow.\" Considering that it's only getting easier for consumers to order food directly to their homes, McDonald's table service is a logical step for the QSR to increase convenience in its restaurants.",

      "text": "Email \nAOL- McDonald’s announced on Thursday that the fast-food giant plans to roll out table service at all locations across the US. The fast-food giant has begun the process of implementing table service across all 14,000 American locations. With the new system, customers can place orders using a digital kiosk or at the counter, and then choose to either pick up their food to-go or have meals served to them at tables. \n“For the best part of our 16 years, we’ve asked customers to work around our business model,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a media event on Thursday. “But now, customers are more demanding, and we’re looking to evolve our business.” Currently, McDonald’s offers table service in more than 500 US locations in New York City, Florida, and Southern California. The company is rolling out table service in Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle in early 2017. Beyond that, McDonald’s does not have a set timeline for the roll out, though McDonald’s incoming US president Chris Kempczinski said the chain plans to move as “quickly as possible” after collecting data from test markets. \nYo Fat Ron, stay in your lane homeboy. If I wanted actual table service and fancy burger displays with fries in a metal basket, I would go to a real restaurant that makes real food. I go to McDonald’s when I am in a rush or I want to make myself feel better before the food ends up making me feel much much worse. The less human contact the better. Now I get that having a machine take your order cuts down on the face time you have with actual people and I appreciate that. But the action of having another person bringing your food to the table is just way too much for me. It’s the reason I always do self checkout at the grocery store and the reason there is always a gaggle of people eating their drive-thru Mickey D’s in their cars in the parking lot (these are the saddest people on the planet, by the way). I feel like we had an unwritten agreement with McDonald’s. We let them continue to cook tasty but unhealthy food that bends the definition of the word food as much as possible while they let us pick up our food at the counter, let us smile and nod at the cashier to feel good about ourselves before wallowing in our own personal halo of misery. Lets not reinvent the wheel here, people. Clem",

      "text": "National Fast Food Day: Owner of 29 McDonald’s Generating $60M is ‘Lovin’ It’ Roland Parris offers some keen insight on becoming a franchisee A- A A+ (Image: istock.com/jessicaphoto) \nMany fast food restaurants are offering deals in honor of National Fast Food Day. One person who is “lovin’ it” as a McDonald’s franchisee is Roland Parrish. Since opening his first McDonald’s quick-service restaurant in 1989, he now owns 29 McDonald’s restaurants in the Greater Dallas area. As CEO of Parrish Restaurants Ltd. (No. 54 on the BE 100s Industrial/Service Companies list with over $59.7 million in revenues in 2015), he still practices the same blue-collar ethic he had that first day on the job by working some 70 hours per week to personally run the business. He’s also a stickler for providing a “great customer experience.” For instance, he makes sure employees are well-groomed and proficient order takers, everything from the latte machine to air conditioning is working properly, and the restrooms are cleaned. \nRoad To Owning Mickey D’s \n\nThe road to success for Parrish, 62, has not been a cakewalk. His first and only application to become a franchisee was rejected in 1987. But his desire to win would not let him quit. Parrish made inroads by attending a two-year McDonald’s training program. He worked 25 hours per week with no pay to learn the nation’s largest fast-food restaurant chain’s system. He used $180,000 in savings he had accumulated during his 13 years working at ExxonMobil to buy his first McDonald’s franchise. He also lived on those same funds for about six months before taking any money from the net revenues of the business. “The value of saving is critical,” says Parrish. He has steadily added stores by using working capital, business equity, and bank loans to finance those units. \nStartup costs, including construction and equipment expenses, average between $955,708 and $2.3 million, according to McDonald’s. That’s in addition to a $45,000 initial franchise fee. The average McDonald’s restaurant generates $2.5 million in sales annually, according to QSR magazine. \nParrish was elected to a third-year term as the 2015–16 CEO/Chair of the National Black McDonald’s Operators Association , a group representing 1,400 restaurants and $3.6 billion in sales. It provides about $750,000 in scholarships a year “to people who look like us,” he adds. Here, the McDonald’s owner/operator shares his insight on becoming a franchisee. \nWhat information should potential buyers request from a franchisor? \nThe franchisor should explain what the company’s performance financially and operationally has been over time and what the growth plan is. Ask for the Financial Disclosure Document (extensive information on 23 items including fees, obligations, and restrictions). Find out about any lawsuits the franchisor has had or may be facing. Several lawsuits raise a red flag. \nHow many existing franchisees should one talk to about a franchise? \nA minimum of two; preferably people who you don’t know. Talk to a local franchisee and one outside of your geographical area. Ask what their relationship with the franchisor is and some of the pitfalls they faced. Even after you get in, keep developing relationships with franchisees to learn the pros and cons of operating a franchise for continued growth. \nWhat advice would you give a potential owner about sustainability? \nMost individuals who look like me are not born with the financial foundation to buy a McDonald’s franchise, which can run about $500,000 to start up. You must save money and have a good credit report. My company has monthly expenses of about $4 million, so you need the right habits to not overspend and know how to budget money coming in. You need to think long term and build a cash reserve that can be used for future expansion, remodeling, retirement, and other expenses. \nWhat has been your biggest lesson learned as a business owner? \nYou need that inner fire to achieve and be competitive. At the same time, you have to stay humble to treat employees well and serve customers. My five-year vision is now focused on quality and not quantity. I want to have all of my locations remodeled or rebuilt, with each one having strong leaders inside running great, profitable restaurants with outstanding operations. \nReporting by Jeffrey McKinney",

      "text": "CALGARY — A Canadian coffee company brew battle has been decided, with McDonald's Canada winning the right to fly its McCafe brand on WestJet aircraft. WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky said Monday Tim Hortons and Starbucks Canada also bid to supply their coffee to the Calgary-based airline.\nBut McDonald's was selected based on price and other factors including previous partnering with WestJet in children's charities.\n\"We serve 30,000 cups a day and so, clearly, good visibility for the McCafe brand,\" said Saretsky.\n\"How it helps us is we're going to be serving a better cup of coffee so it improves the guest experience and just ups the game in the coffee wars in the Canadian skies.\"\nAir Canada serves Second Cup coffee on its flights, while Porter Airlines serves Starbucks coffee in its lounges and on its aircraft.\nWestJet said it will start serving McDonald's coffee on a flight from Toronto to Calgary today and expand service across its fleet, including its regional airline, WestJet Encore.\nSaretsky said the airline's McCafe coffee will be slightly different than the coffee served in McDonald's restaurants because people's taste buds aren't as sensitive at flying altitude. WestJet's coffee machines have also been revamped.\n\"To make the coffee taste the same at 40,000 feet as it tastes on the ground, we had to do a darker roast of beans and we had to raise the temperature of the water on board the aircraft,\" he said.\nThe coffee is to be served in a McDonald's branded double-walled cup and will come with an optional lid to avoid spilling. Cappuccino and lattes won't be offered because the aircraft doesn't have a machine to steam milk.\nWhen asked if WestJet will co-brand with McDonald's on other products such as Chicken McNuggets, Saretsky said: \"Possibly. We really want to make sure we get the coffee right first.\"",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK – McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook knows the business of food is changing. \nSo the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service. \nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017. \nNow, McDonald’s loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they’ll even have the option of mobile ordering. \n“Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,” Easterbrook said in an interview with CNNMoney’s Cristina Alesci. \nThat’s pushing consumers to demand more, he says — especially in the way of personalized eating. \n“They’re expecting us to evolve and offer greater convenience,” Easterbrook said. \nThe move is the company’s latest attempt to win back the customers it’s lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack. When Easterbrook took the reins in March 2015, McDonald’s was suffering from falling sales and lousy earnings. \nSince then, McDonald’s has launched an all-day breakfast menu. It’s introduced more customizable sandwiches with fancier ingredients, and announced two new sizes of Big Macs. The chain is also trying to be healthier, cutting artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and offering more wraps and salads. \nThe strategy is working. Revenue and profits for the third quarter topped forecasts. \nConsumer tastes aren’t the only thing changing the way companies operate. \nDonald Trump ‘s victory in the U.S. presidential election has left many business executives wondering what his administration means for employment, trade and economic growth. In the meantime, Easterbrook and McDonald’s are sitting tight. \n“No one likes uncertainty,” he said. “The sooner we get through this period, and there’s some clarity as to the way things are going to go going forward, we’ll be able to make the long term decisions of business.” 40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "Wikimedia Commons // Public Domain Like us on Facebook \nForget turkey gravy—McDonald’s wants customers to ring in the holiday season with the taste of barbecue sauce on their lips. As Fortune reports , the McRib recently returned to select restaurants, and will be available for purchase until December 31. To help fast food fans track down the limited-edition item, McDonald’s created an iMessage app, the McRib Finder , that locates the nearest franchise selling the popular pork-based sandwich. \nOpen the McRib Finder in iMessage, and a map will pop up showing your location, along with nearby McDonald’s outlets selling the sandwich. Click on the location markers to get the address—and if you’re meeting a friend for a bite to eat, you can even send it to them, along with a McRib-themed sticker. (Sorry, Android users—you'll have to rely on the McRib Locator website .) \nFew McDonald’s menu items are as elusive as the McRib. The franchise introduced the barbecue-flavored sandwich in 1981 , but due to poor sales, it was removed from the national menu a few years later. Eventually, the McRib returned—but it wasn’t until 2005, when McDonalds began offering the savory sandwich for limited time spans only, that it truly reached cult status with customers. Today, the McRib returns at random, typically popping up at sporadic locations across America during the fall.",

      "text": "WestJet Airlines to start serving McDonald’s... | 2 hours ago | Vote 0 0 WestJet Airlines to start serving McDonald’s coffee on its flights Coffee By Dan Healing CALGARY — A Canadian coffee company brew battle has been decided, with McDonald's Canada winning the right to fly its McCafe brand on WestJet aircraft. WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky said Monday Tim Hortons and Starbucks Canada also bid to supply their coffee to the Calgary-based airline. But McDonald's was selected based on price and other factors including previous partnering with WestJet in children's charities. \"We serve 30,000 cups a day and so, clearly, good visibility for the McCafe brand,\" said Saretsky. \"How it helps us is we're going to be serving a better cup of coffee so it improves the guest experience and just ups the game in the coffee wars in the Canadian skies.\" Air Canada serves Second Cup coffee on its flights, while Porter Airlines serves Starbucks coffee in its lounges and on its aircraft. WestJet said it will start serving McDonald's coffee on a flight from Toronto to Calgary today and expand service across its fleet, including its regional airline, WestJet Encore. Saretsky said the airline's McCafe coffee will be slightly different than the coffee served in McDonald's restaurants because people's taste buds aren't as sensitive at flying altitude. WestJet's coffee machines have also been revamped. \"To make the coffee taste the same at 40,000 feet as it tastes on the ground, we had to do a darker roast of beans and we had to raise the temperature of the water on board the aircraft,\" he said. The coffee is to be served in a McDonald's branded double-walled cup and will come with an optional lid to avoid spilling. Cappuccino and lattes won't be offered because the aircraft doesn't have a machine to steam milk. When asked if WestJet will co-brand with McDonald's on other products such as Chicken McNuggets, Saretsky said: \"Possibly. We really want to make sure we get the coffee right first.\" | Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Most Read",

(Photo: WestJet) \nIf you’ve ever had a hankering for a McDonald’s coffee at 35,000 feet, you’ll soon be in luck when you fly on Canadian carrier WestJet. \nMcDonald’s beat out competing bids from Starbucks and Canadian brand Tim Horton’s for an exclusive contract to provide its coffee on WestJet’s 650 daily flights, The Canadian Press reports . WestJet will become the world’s first airline to exclusively serve McDonald’s \"McCafé\" coffee on its flights. \nThe first cups served under the deal will come Monday on a flight from Toronto to Calgary. WestJet expects to expand the offering to all of its Boeing 737 and Boeing 767 aircraft by Dec. 1. WestJet also plans to serve the McDonald’s brew on flights operated by its Encore regional affiliate, though the company did reveal a precise timeline for that. United now serving better coffee, upgrades to illy \n\"We serve 30,000 cups a day and so, clearly, good visibility for the McCafé brand,\" WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky says to The Canadian Press. \"How it helps us is we're going to be serving a better cup of coffee so it improves the guest experience and just ups the game in the coffee wars in the Canadian skies.\" \nThe CBC writes “the move is the latest front in an all-out war in the coffee industry to win Canadians loyalty in their coffee buying. Tim Hortons was once untouchable in the space, but McDonald's has made inroads with its free coffee promotions.” \nAir Canada, Canada’s biggest airline, has an exclusive contract with Second Cup while No. 3 Porter Airlines uses Starbucks, according to the CBC.

      "title": "'The Founder' Review: Michael Keaton Channels the Hamburglar in True-Life McDonald's Tale",
      "text": "Michael Keaton in The Founder (Photo: The Weinstein Company) More By Leslie Felperin, The Hollywood Reporter\nAnd they say Americans don’t do irony. The Founder is a dramatized account written by Robert Siegel ( The Wrestler ) of how traveling salesman Ray Kroc — played with bounce and oleaginous charm by Michael Keaton — gained control of the McDonald’s brand and built an empire. The movie is practically deep-fried in knowingness, starting with the big stage wink that is the title itself. As many students of business and fans of Mark Knopfler’s 2004 song “Boom, Like That” already know, Kroc “founded” McDonald’s only in the sense that he literally found a burger stand in San Bernardino, California, run by two brothers named Dick and Mac McDonald (Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch, respectively), took over franchising their concept, and eventually wrested control of the business entirely.\nBy making this ethically challenged man the film’s protagonist, director John Lee Hancock creates something a good shade or two darker than The Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks , his more cheerful and wholesome previous efforts in true-life-inspired storytelling. However, Hancock’s apparently irrepressible penchant for folksy Midwestern types and perky montages dilutes any cynicism or misanthropy that might have given this material the edginess it deserves.\nThe result is a wishy-washy take on both Kroc and McDonald’s itself, which tries to play off its timidity as fairness, balance or some such. In fact, it plays more like a film that can’t make up its mind whether it wants to be an exposé of Kroc’s scheming, Hamburglar venality or a sly celebration of his capitalist chutzpah. No doubt, 50 years in the future, the industry will churn out biopics about Donald Trump that are just as tonally muddy and ideologically confused.\nAt least this work doesn’t feature McDonald’s as a producing entity in the opening credits, making it less beholden to the company it depicts than the Disney-produced Saving Mr. Banks , which revolved around the encounter between Walt Disney himself (rather white-washed in the hands of Tom Hanks) and P.L. Travers (played by Emma Thompson), the author of the novel Mary Poppins . Even so, The Founder is careful to avoid in any way offending the company, once famed for being highly litigious. McDonald’s notably sued and won a case against British activists Helen Steel and David Morris for daring to distribute leaflets claiming the chain’s products were unhealthy and destructive to the environment, although arguably in the long run the case only hurt the company with bad publicity.\nThis film, unlike, say, the documentaries McLibel and Super Size Me , takes pains to remind viewers that the brand was founded by the McDonald brothers with high-quality food stuffs (“100 percent government-approved meat!”), produced to exacting quality-controlled standards yet made with incredible speed. Best not viewed on an empty stomach, this film abounds with shots of the cast members and extras ecstatically sinking their teeth into juicy, paper-wrapped patties, resulting in slow-motion smiles that spread across faces as sunnily as those in any of the commercials for the chain made in the last 30 or 40 years.\nWhat’s most interesting is that Siegel’s screenplay doesn’t start with Mac and Dick McDonald, former Columbia Studio truck drivers who went into the food-service industry after WWII and who came up with a near-revolutionary “Speedy System” to streamline burger production. Instead, it starts with Kroc, the Chicago-reared son of Czech immigrants, who as the story begins is just over 50 and wearing out his tire rubber visiting greasy, teen-infested, drive-in restaurants with bad service from roller-skating waitresses around the Midwest, hoping to talk owners and managers into buying a five-spindle Multi-Mixer for making milkshakes.\nRead More: Michael Keaton Back in the Oscar Hunt for Under-the-Radar McDonald’s Movie ‘The Founder’\nWhen Kroc’s secretary June (Kate Kneeland, underused) reports that the McDonalds’ stand in Southern California wants six, no make it eight, mixers because their business is booming so fast, Ray gets in his Chevy and drives all the way down Route 66 to see what their secret is. It turns out there’s no real secret in the secret sauce (at that point not yet invented). Under Dick’s exacting eye and commitment to practice, the brothers have merely reduced the menu to the best-selling items and then worked out a way to make them as efficiently as possible, inspired by time-and-motion studies and assisted by homemade inventions, such as ray-gun-like dispensers for squirting just the right amount of ketchup and mustard onto a bun.\nRead More Via a long expository dialogue and edited in flashbacks, they explain how they assembled their workers in a tennis court, drew and redrew the kitchen with chalk, and had the team perform a “burger ballet” — it’s really more like miming than dancing, but whatever — to perfect the production process.\nEntranced, and passionate about the food, Ray pitches woo to the McDonalds, begging for a chance to franchise their menu, system and branding elements such as Nick’s beloved “Golden Arches” architectural design, which they tried at a failed branch in Phoenix, Az.\nWith some trepidation since some franchisees in the past failed to stick to the menu (they sold burritos in Sacramento — the horror!), the McDonalds agree. Ray starts his first one near his home in Illinois, raising capital by mortgaging his house without telling his long-suffering wife Ethel (Laura Dern, perhaps a shade too innately glamorous ever to be convincing as someone named Ethel). Their marriage has long been under strain due to Ray’s frequent absences on the road. It’s also implied that his controlled but constant drinking — he has a dainty hip flask always ready in his pocket — doesn’t help.\nOnce Ray has begun to make a success of things, his eye is caught by Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini), the wife of one of his franchise-holders (Patrick Wilson). Joan is a svelte, younger blonde whose lack of baggage is signaled by her sparser dress sense, forming a contrast to Ethel’s voluminous, high-maintenance New Look frocks and fussy, chintz-filled interior decoration. Like the perfect magician’s assistant, Joan takes delight in a good, cost-cutting sleight of hand, as revealed in a scene where she turns Ray on to instant milkshake mix, a concoction that reduces the need for refrigeration bills and represents the ultimate betrayal of the McDonald brothers’ purist vision.\nIt’s around this point that the film switches from being a jolly romp about some hard-working food-service visionaries and becomes something more like a Faustian parable, with B.J. Novak taking the Mephistophelean role of Harry J. Sonneborn, a financial adviser who gets Kroc to see that the real power lies in controlling real estate, not the petty means of production — truly a post-modernist approach to capitalism and ultimately the key to the company’s success. But the shift in register taxes Hancock, and his production team, and the jolliness they flood through the pacing, lighting and design doesn’t recede at the same time the story itself shifts.\nKeaton seems to have figured out long before everyone else that the tone is going to transmute swiftly, and it’s impressive the way he ups the sleazy factor by subtle degrees early on. The better-dressed he gets, the more his soul rots and the deader his eyes become, like some evil clown version of Dorian Gray. Even the folksy way he says “Nope,” full of finality and steel, becomes menacing, delivering it like a gun shot through a fluffy sweater. Of all the troubled, compromised and problematic characters Keaton has played in the course of this recent career resurgence, Ray Kroc, like a crocodile — “but not spelled that way,” per the song by Knopfler who also co-owns with Jeremy Renner The Combine, which produced this — may be the most disturbing.\nDistributor: Weinstein Co.\nProduction companies: Faliro House Productions, FilmNation Entertainment, The Combine\nCast: Michael Keaton, Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch, Laura Dern, Linda Cardellini, Patrick Wilson, B.J.

      "text": "McDonald’s Uses Tech. to Seduce Millennials (MCD) By Dan Moskowitz | November 21, 2016 — 3:58 PM EST \nIn 2,600 international restaurants and 500 restaurants in urban areas throughout Southern California, New York City, and Florida, McDonald's Corp. ( MCD ) has added self-order kiosks, table service, and premium menu items. The goal is to attract Millennials , who mostly prefer fast-casual dining, such as Chipotle, Panera, and Shake Shack. However, McDonald’s knows that Millennials also prefer urban living, which might present an opportunity. \nMost urban McDonald’s restaurants don’t have a drive-thru. Therefore, consumers must walk inside the restaurant. If those consumers are impressed with the new features, then they’re more likely to return. The problem is that McDonald’s has to get more Millennials to walk through those doors, and unless McDonald’s can shed its image of sub-par food in terms of quality, the new features are going to be meaningless. McDonald’s will also launch mobile ordering and mobile pay in the United States next year. \nThese initiatives are necessities; they don’t demonstrate that McDonald’s is ahead of the curve. In order to thrive again in the U.S., McDonald’s would have to completely change its image, which would require significant upfront costs. With Baby Boomers not favoring McDonald’s as a dining option and Generation Xers saving money by feeding their families at home on most nights, McDonald’s needs Millennials in the domestic market. It’s not a major problem for McDonald’s yet, but given all the new competition and Millennial dining preferences, it eventually could be. \nThe self-order kiosks, table service, and premium menu items will be added to locations in Seattle, Boston, and Washington D.C. next year. These initiatives should have a positive impact for existing customers, but expecting them to have a material impact on Millennial traffic might be a reach. \nMCD has appreciated 4.83% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 3.18%.",

      "text": "Courtesy of The Weinstein Company  48PM PT John Lee Hancock's knowingly mistitled biopic of McDonald's mogul Ray Kroc proves an unexpectedly piquant moral parable for the Trump era. \nAny habitual McDonald’s diner knows that their burgers are nothing without the pickle. The nominal beef patty tastes more like an evocation of meat than an honest slab of steer, and there’s no secret weapon in that cheap cotton-wool bun. But it’s those two sharp, green slices of vinegary tang, set in relief by a sweet smear of ketchup, that really contain all the brand’s essential, kazillion-dollar flavor. By the same token, it’s the dash of pickle in Robert Siegel’s script — a streak of sour, cheek-puckering cynicism amid its warmer, blander conventions — that gives “ The Founder ” its mojo. A ruefully titled biopic of Ray Kroc, the man who didn’t found McDonald’s but ruthlessly made it what it is, John Lee Hancock ’s glowingly crafted, smartly acted film largely holds the cheese. Instead, it spins a classical tale of underdog entrepreneurship and American Dream-chasing with one eccentric twist: its chief hero and villain are the same person. \nWhether audiences will respond en masse to a film that slides so much corrosive irony beneath its gleaming awards-season veneer remains to be seen. Not since “Steve Jobs” has such a bright prestige spotlight been granted to such a nakedly venal protagonist, played by Michael Keaton with an easy, puppy-eating grin and unhinged salesman’s patter that makes his narcissistically self-pitying thesp from “Birdman” look positively cuddly by comparison. \nIndeed, perhaps more than its makers could have known at the time of production, “The Founder” plays very much as a period piece for the immediate political present: a fable of vast self-made success gained at the expense of truth and integrity. In an America bitterly divided by its new President-elect, some viewers may well see Kroc’s story as inspiring; others will view it as positively nihilistic. That implicit moral tension, combined with a fascinating but distinctly niche focus on business strategy and property law, makes this an unexpected, commercially unpredictable digression from the helmer of such soft-centered biographical dramas as “Saving Mr. Banks” and “The Blind Side,” even as it shares their outward trappings of wholegrain populism. Cinematographer John Schwartzman, for starters, lights proceedings with a sunny, advertorial evenness that belies the friction beneath, though a deft, mischievous score by Carter Burwell clues us in earlier, signaling discord through low, brooding jazz motifs and antsy military percussion. \nThis is less surprising material, however, for Siegel, whose finely scaled scripts for “The Wrestler” and “Big Fan” likewise probed the bleak flipside of a quintessentially American will to win — the difference being that “The Founder” examines the spoils (in all senses of the word) of victory rather than defeat. “Nothing in the world is more common than unsuccessful men with talent,” we are told at two points in the film: toward the beginning, in 1954, on a hoary motivational LP played incessantly by Kroc in his days as a frustrated milkshake-mixer salesman, and toward the end, two decades later, appropriated wholesale into a speech where the now-minted mogul outlines the secret of his success. It’s a nifty screenwriting pretzel, encapsulating our protagonist’s belief that no idea is too big or too good to be stolen: Talent is less important than knowing what to do with it, even (or perhaps especially) if the talent in question isn’t your own. \nAn alternative draft of “The Founder” could have centered on the fast-food empire’s actual, well, founders: Dick McDonald ( Nick Offerman , visually and vocally fashioned as a mid-century relative of “Parks and Recreation’s” Ron Swanson) and his more retiring brother Maurice (John Carroll Lynch), who opened their first, highly innovative burger joint in post-WWII San Bernardino, Calif. Siegel and Hancock frame the brothers’ obstacle-ridden backstory as a kind of condensed film-within-a-film, narrated over the course of a dinner meeting with an enraptured Kroc — who has driven all the way west from his Illinois base to meet them, acting on a hunch that there’s gold in them thar grills. \nContent with the humming success of their personally supervised restaurant, and deterred from franchising by a fear of compromised standards, the original McDonalds believe their story has reached its happy ending. Little do they know it’s a mere first act, with Kroc as its Faustian pivot. Convinced that the unprecedented speed and simplicity of their service model has the potential to go countrywide, the silver-tongued out-of-towner wheedles his way into a business partnership, overseeing the establishment of further McDonald’s branches far from California — and, crucially, out of earshot of the brothers, who only clock the extent to which Kroc has claimed and colonized their brand when it’s too late to stop the bandwagon. \n“Business is war,” Kroc states drily. The battle lines are clearly drawn, as he and the increasingly disenfranchised (so to speak) brothers verbally fire shots and burn bridges in one brisk phone conversation after another — edited in terse, talky, unabashedly repetitious style by regular Nicole Holofcener collaborator Robert Frazen. It’s not the stuff of searing cinematic drama, yet the ethical and philosophical complexities of their dispute prove peculiarly gripping. Just whose side, if either, are the filmmakers on? The McDonalds hold all the moral cards, yet Siegel’s script holds them at a cool distance from us; it’s Kroc’s calculating head we’re invited to enter, as the film finds a perverse sympathy in his long-stymied desperation to be a part, and finally a possessor, of something wholly successful. \n“You and your endless parade of nos, cowering in the face of progress,” he spits over the phone as the elder McDonald rejects his latest cost-saving proposal — this time a new form of powdered milkshake that perfectly symbolizes his commitment to productivity over principle. The compelling quandary of “The Founder” is that he’s at once in the wrong and wholly correct — and that McDonald’s would never have become one of the great American institutions without his grossly toxic intervention. (Don’t expect any promotional tie-ins, incidentally, for a film that shows a global corporate superpower to be built on an act of theft.) \nKeaton plays Kroc as a man both pathetic and singularly possessed, cannily resisting lovability at every turn, while delivering the internalized self-help speak of his sales pitches with chillingly glib precision. Yet his strongest scenes may be the aching, awkward glimpses into his home life with resignedly neglected wife Ethel (a fine Laura Dern, all the more poignant for being underused) in which we see how impossible it is for him to simply be a respectable working man: The too-wide spaces and too-long silences between them are consumed with his inchoate yearning for something greater. Daniel Orlandi’s typically pristine costume design emasculates Kroc in this aim throughout, consistently boxing him into unformidable suits in shades of tan and bodily-function brown — as well as one yellow gingham short-sleeved shirt that wittily presages generations of burger-flipper uniforms to come. \nA carefully chosen ensemble bolsters this rivetingly repulsive star turn without entirely surrendering to it: As Kroc’s future partner Joan Smith, the wonderful Linda Cardellini gets a terrific scene in which a personal and professional eye-contact contract is signed between them in the time it takes for her to stir one synthetic vanilla shake. “I drink your milkshake… I drink it up,” the characters seem on the verge of saying at any point. While inducing comparisons to Paul Thomas Anderson’s “There Will Be Blood” likely wouldn’t have flattered Hancock’s smaller, slighter, less gourmet study in the unsavory benefits of all-American corruption, its dubious hero would have been characteristically proud of the steal.

      "text": "Kittery teen earns diploma, thanks to McDonald's Monday Nov 21, 2016 at 4:48 PM Nov 21, 2016 at 4:57 PM By Brian Early bearly@seacoastonline.com \nKITTERY, Maine — Add one more name to the high school Class of 2016 scrolls. \nHis name is Josh Dunne, and his pomp and circumstance occurred not on the grounds of a traditional high school, but in the atrium of the McDonald’s Restaurant on Route 1 by the Kittery outlet stores. \nDressed in a red cap and gown, Dunne was all smiles as walked from one side of the atrium to the other as the \"Graduation March\" played last Thursday. In the crowd were his parents and other family members, as well as regular customers. They cheered as received his high school diploma from Peter Napoli, who co-owns the business with his son Sal Napoli. He credited the encouragement of his family members and co-workers with helping him complete a McDonald's supported program to get his diploma online. \nHis immediate boss, store general manager Alex Landry, praised Dunne's work ethic. \"Somehow, in between 50 hours of work a week, he's managed to complete (the program) four months in advance,\" Landry said. \nDunne, 19, has worked at the restaurant for the past three years without a car. He often walked about 30 minutes each way from his home in the Admiralty Village in all sorts of weather until he recently bought a car with his savings. (He passed his driver test the prior to attending the ceremony.) \nDunne was working at McDonald's when as a junior at Traip Academy, he dropped out amid struggles at both school and home. “I liked this better,” he said of his job. “On the same token, I wasn’t doing well in school.” \nHis mother was an alcoholic and the relationship between his parents at the time was poisonous. “He was watching his mom self-destruct,” said his mother Linda Dunne, who is now a year sober. She recalled that she moved out of the house while Josh was at school. When he came back, she was gone without any warning. \n\"All of us hit rock bottom,\" Josh Dunne said. \nWhile home and school life were challenging, he excelled at work. “He threw his life into working and making himself better,\" Linda Dunne said. Work helped Dunne keep focus as well as assist the family. He paid his share of rent and utilities (\"Got to pay my keep\"), and saved the rest, banking over $10,000. He was well-liked by his co-workers and superiors who also respected his work ethic. The owners and management of the franchised store rewarded him with raises and promotions. Two weeks ago, he was promoted to assistant store manager. \nDunne received the diploma through the McDonald's Archways to Opportunity program, which allows crew members and managers to receive their high school diploma through the nationally accredited Career Online High School at no cost to them. For post-secondary education, there is tuition assistance available to employees in good standing. \nDunne is the first employee in the 60-odd restaurants owned by the N.H. based Napoli Group that employs about 2,200 to receive a high school diploma through the program, which he began in 2015. “On average, it takes … about 18 months to complete the program; Josh finished it in just 14 months,” said Sal Napoli at the ceremony. “We’ve had a lot of people apply. Josh not only started the program but completed the program. I think that tells you a little bit about his character and who is a man and who he is as a member of the Napoli Group and Team McDonald’s.\" \nPeter Napoli credited the restaurant industry in general as a great entry point for people with few skills to make something of themselves. The elder Napoli immigrated to the United States from Italy with his family when he was 13 years old. When he was 17, Napoli started working at a McDonald’s in Massachusetts as a crew member. By age 21, he decided to make it a career. “It gives all of us an opportunity to make a good living,” he said. While the educational opportunities allow employees to grow within the company, Peter Napoli understands that others will use the educational opportunities to take jobs outside of the company. \nThe upper management who attended the short ceremony were all crew members of McDonald’s at one point, including the president of the business, who was a 1993 graduate of Portsmouth High School. Jeremy Hinton started at the Newington restaurant by the malls on Gosling Road when he was 15 years old and continued working there through college. \nLarry Johnston, a district manager who oversees the Kittery store, said the company hopes Dunne will inspire others to utilize the program. \"He’s so proud of himself. We’re hoping he will be a role model for other employees,\" he said. Dunne is certainly a role model for his mother. \"He's done more at 19 than me at 41,\" she said. \"To see all of this... this is a gift.\" About Us",

One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police.\nKimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department)\nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported.\nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police.\nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor.\nThey were both released on $5,000 bond.\n41.278637 -73.026528 ",

      "text": "ORANGE, Conn. – Two McDonald’s employees called police after walking out of the restaurant to find a couple in a parked car “engaged in sexual activity,” police said Monday.\nThe workers had just finished their shifts at the Orange, Connecticut, McDonald’s around 9:30 p.m. on November 15, when they noticed the vehicle. One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police.\nKimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department)\nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported.\nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police.\nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor.\nThey were both released on $5,000 bond.\n41.278637 -73.026528 ",

Well, it’s back and looks delicious as ever!\nThe McRib has seasoned pork with McDonald’s signature McRib sauce, which is a sweet and smoky, yet also tangy western barbecue style sauce. Throw in some dill pickles and fresh onions, finished off with a bun and that’s what has everyone day dreaming about lunch!\nSo finally after 2 years of being missed the McRib and Dr.Pepper are going on a Pork & Pepper Comeback Tour! The tour will hit L.A., Orange, Riverside, San Bernadino, & Ventura counties.\nFor more info on the events and festivities (or to just drool over the McRib) go to McRibTour.com and follow @McDonalds_SoCal on Twitter or Instagram.\n",

      "text": "ORANGE, Conn. – Two McDonald’s employees called police after walking out of the restaurant to find a couple in a parked car “engaged in sexual activity,” police said Monday.\nThe workers had just finished their shifts at the Orange, Connecticut, McDonald’s around 9:30 p.m. on November 15, when they noticed the vehicle. One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police.\nKimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department)\nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported.\nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police.\nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor.\nThey were both released on $5,000 bond.\n41.278637 -73.026528 ",

      "text": "McRib Returns To Southern California November 21, 2016 11:09 AM Filed Under: McDonald's , McRib (Photo by David Paul Morris/Getty Images) \nLOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — The fabled McRib sandwich has returned to Southern California McDonald’s restaurants, the fast food chain announced Monday. \nThe scarcely available pork sandwich has been absent from local McDonald’s for two years, but is back by popular demand, McDonald’s said in a statement. \n“Southern California McRib fans are among the most passionate, dedicated and creative in the world,” Paul Tulaphorn, McDonald’s franchisee and association president of the local McDonald’s owner operators group, said in a statement. “We’re excited to reward their loyalty and join them to celebrate the return of an icon.” \nThe fast food chain has also launched the “McRib Finder,” an iOS 10 app showing users their closest location offering the sandwich. \nThe McRib holds a rarefied place among fast food special-menu items. It was first introduced in 1981 but was pulled from menus around 2005. Since then, it has been made available on a limited basis and has accumulated a cult following. \nThe sandwich returned to local menus on Monday and will be available for a limited time, McDonald’s said.",

      "text": " Shares of McDonald's ( MCD ) were lower in early afternoon trading on Monday, after JPMorgan removed the stock from its Analyst Focus List earlier today. The firm says it sees \"limited upside\" for the stock.\n\"It looks like it will be a battle around the 200-day now. It kind of ran into this downtrend that it's been in since May,\" Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Monday afternoon.\nThe fast food restaurant stock will be a \"tough stock\" to make money from going forward, unless something \"dramatic\" happens, he said. \"Valuation is stretched and a lot of great news on the turnaround has already been baked in.\"\n\"I don't hate it, but I don't love it,\" Brown said in conclusion.\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.\nTheStreet Ratings team rates McDonald's as a Hold with a ratings score of C+. The primary factors that have impacted the team's rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks.\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: MCD\nMCD data by YCharts",

One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police.\nKimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department)\nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported.\nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police.\nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor.\nThey were both released on $5,000 bond.",

      "text": "McDonald's franchise owner files for bankruptcy Patt Johnson , pjohnson@dmreg.com 5:56 p.m. CST November 21, 2016 A sign for a McDonald's restaurant is seen. (Photo: Getty Images ) \nThe owner of five McDonald’s restaurant stores in Des Moines and one in Indianola has filed for bankruptcy, citing a significant drop in business in the past three years because of increased debt and competition from newly opened company stores. \nBrown Customer Delight Group Inc. (BCDG) principals Larry and Brenda Brown filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday, citing about $15.6 million in liabilities and $6.7 million in assets. The West Des Moines couple is hoping to sell the stores back to McDonald’s Corp., said their attorney, Jeffrey Goetz. \nBCDG stores are at 3000 SE 14th St., 1404 Des Moines St., 710 Army Post Road, 4201 Fleur Drive and 2901 SW Ninth St., all in Des Moines; and 1207 N. Jefferson St. in Indianola. All of the stores are open. \nIn court documents, Larry Brown said the six restaurants generated gross sales of $7.6 million from January to August of this year. He said the stores lost $4.5 million in 2015. \nBrown said sales at his stores were hurt when McDonald’s Corp. built two to three restaurants in the metro in 2014 and 2015. The existing stores also needed upgrades, including adding double drive-through lanes, digital menu boards and extra equipment to accommodate serving all-day breakfast. \nBrown leases the buildings from McDonald’s Corp., which also owns the real estate, the documents stated. \nThe Browns owned McDonald’s franchises in Minnesota, which they sold before buying 10 stores in 2011 in the Des Moines metro, Perry and Indianola from Steve Nelson, Larry Brown said. He built a store in 2012. In 2014, Brown sold stores in Perry and Pleasant Hill and in 2015 the three stores in Ankeny. \nFaced with reduced income from under-performing stores and increased debt, Brown sought out loans to continue operations, court documents state. \nThe largest secured creditor listed in court documents is Citizens Bank of Boston, which is owed $6.1 million. TASS Enterprises Inc., which is owned by Steve Nelson, is the largest unsecured creditor at $4.7 million, the documents showed. \nThe Browns also have an unsecured claim of almost $2 million they gave to the company in loans. \n“We are going to make sure our employees are taken care of,” Brown said Monday. “I have been doing this 17 years, and it has been a great ride.” \nHe said he plans to retire. 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "title": "McDonald's (MCD) Stay on Its Post-Earnings Hot Streak?",
      "text": "It has been about a month   McDonald's( MCD   5% in the past month, easily outperforming broad markets    McDonald's Tops Q3 Earnings on Solid Comps Growth \n\nMcDonald's posted robust results in the third quarter of 2016, wherein both the bottom line and the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nEarnings and Revenue Discussion \n\nEarnings per share (EPS) of $1.62 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48 by 9.5% and improved 15.7% from the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to the turnaround plan announced by CEO Steve Easterbrook in May 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.03 per share on earnings in the quarter. Notably, at constant currency, earnings grew 17% year over year.\n\nRevenues of $6.42 billion fell 3% year over year mainly due to the impact of refranchising and currency headwinds. At constant currency, the figure declined 1%. Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.29 billion by 2.1%.\n\nBehind the Headlines Numbers \n\nIn the quarter, revenues at company-operated restaurants declined 7.3% to $3.97 billion. Revenues at franchise-operated restaurants, however, grew 5.1% to $2.45 billion.\n\nGlobal comps grew 3.5%, supported by positive comps across all the segments, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Moreover, comps compared favorably with last quarter’s increase of 3.1%.\n\nKey Segment Details \n\nU.S. : Comps grew 1.3% in the third quarter, reflecting the success of the All Day Breakfast platform launched in 2015 and the popularity of the company’s national value platform – McPick 2. The introduction of Chicken McNuggets with no artificial preservatives also boosted the segment’s performance. However, comps growth was less than the prior-quarter improvement of 1.8% due to softening industry growth.\n\nSegment operating income jumped 8%, mainly driven by improved restaurant profitability and higher gains from refranchising.\n\nGoing forward, the company will remain focused on expanding its All Day Breakfast menu, the quality of food and on enhancing guest experience.\n\nInternational Lead Markets : Comps at the International Lead Markets segment grew 3.3%, driven by strong performance in the U.K. and upbeat results in Australia, Canada and Germany. The upside reflects multiple menu, service and value initiatives across most of the markets, which led to positive consumer response. Moreover, comps were better than an increase of 2.6% recorded last quarter.\n\nOperating income was up 2%, including the impact of foreign exchange headwinds. At constant currency, the figure was up 5% on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars across most markets.\n\nHigh-Growth Markets : Comps grew 1.5% in High-Growth Markets, as positive performance in almost all markets was partially offset by negative comparable sales in China due in part to temporary protests concerning events surrounding the South China Sea and strong prior-year comparisons. Notably, comps had witnessed growth of 1.6% last quarter.\n\nThe segment's operating income rose 8% (10% in constant currencies) fueled by improved restaurant profitability in China, which benefited from the recent VAT reform.\n \n  \nIt turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the month following earnings, at least when looking at the current quarter. MCD's prospects for the full year are brighter, as the consensus estimate here has been on the rise over the past month and analysts are now expecting EPS growth close to 15% year-over-year.\nArguably, the long-term turnaround in the fortunes of McDonald's shareholders is continuing, as evidenced by the chart below:\n \nMCDONALDS CORP Price and Consensus MCDONALDS CORP Price and Consensus | MCDONALDS CORP Quote \n \nVGM Scores \nAt this time, McDonald's stock has a nice Growth score of 'B', though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a 'D'.   'C'   third quintile for this investment strategy.Overall though, the company is just average from a fundamental look, as its VGM score comes in at 'C', putting it into the middle 20% of all companies we study. \nOutlook \nThanks to the positive longer term trends in estimates for MCD, shares of the stock have a Zacks Rank # 2 (buy). This means that we are expecting the run in MCD to continue, and we are looking for more outperformance in the weeks ahead too.",

      "text": "McDonald’s commits to fair wages after minimum wage announced in SA   8:17pm FILE: McDonald’s South Africa on Monday said it was committed to paying fair and just wages to all its employees . \nJOHANNESBURG – McDonald’s South Africa on Monday said it was committed to paying fair and just wages to all its employees as stipulated by law following the announcement of a new national minimum wage. \nThis comes after social media users criticised Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa after he announced that the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) advisory panel had proposed a national minimum wage rate of R20 an hour, or about R3,500 a month. \nRamaphosa’s company, the Shanduka Group, received a 20-year agreement in 2011 to run 145 McDonald’s restaurants in South Africa. Under the agreement Ramaphosa owned all McDonald’s assets in South Africa, including property. \nBut Ramaphosa announced that he was divesting from Shanduka to avoid any possibility of conflict of interest after he accepted the deputy president position shortly after the national government elections in 2014. \nDespite this, social media users had no kind words for him after the announcement of a national minimum wage did not go down well with many people and organisations. \nWith over 200 restaurants in all nine provinces across South Africa, McDonald’s employs more than 10,000 people. \nJo-Ann de Wet, chief operations and supply chain officer for McDonald’s SA, said the company took its role in helping strengthen communities seriously and was committed to the well-being and livelihood of all its employees. \n“McDonald’s South Africa places the highest importance on its staff. All our labour policies align to the South African Labour Law Act and ensure fair and just remuneration,” De Wet said. \n“We furthermore strive to remain employer of choice by often exceeding industry standards and the introduction of various career building initiatives within the business.” \nThough De Wet could not provide figures for the least-paid workers at McDonald’s, data pulled from a jobs site indicated that an average McDonald’s monthly salary ranged from R1,047 a month for a crew member to R9,584 a month for a manager. \nIn America, McDonald’s has committed to plans to raise workers’ pay to $10 (R142.53) an hour, up from $9.01, by end of the year after they went on a protest demanding $15 minimum wages. \nWhile the African National Congress welcomed the release of the proposed national minimum wage, the Democratic Alliance said it supported sectorial minimum wages but a one-size fits all approach, no matter how well the intention, would result in further job-losses. \nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) rejected outright the proposal, saying that it favoured business at the expense of workers. \n“Any minimum wage that is below R4,500 will not make any difference to the lives of workers or the resolution of inequality in wages and actual living conditions,” the EFF said.

      "text": "Email \nORANGE, Conn. – Two McDonald’s employees called police after walking out of the restaurant to find a couple in a parked car “engaged in sexual activity,” police said Monday. \nThe workers had just finished their shifts at the Orange, Connecticut, McDonald’s around 9:30 p.m. on November 15, when they noticed the vehicle. One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. 41.278637 -73.026528 ",

      "text": "\nWe McDonald knocked it out of the park with her performance of Rihanna’s “Love On The Brain.” It was a dream come true. Iconic. The live playoffs are upon us as The top 11 hopeful artists compete to come out on top on The Voice.\nThe name Wé is Kenyan for “diligence,” which is something that Wé has had her entire life. Her father helped her get into vocal lessons at the Harlem School of the Arts, which she still attends after school and on weekends. Wé has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and, most recently, at the Apollo Theater. Although Wé has always found her place with music, she struggled to fit in at school. Kids teased her for her high-pitched voice and thick glasses, but she stuck it out and slowly things got better. Now she embraces her differences and is hoping her uniqueness will help her stand out on The Voice.\nIn the final live-performance phase of the competition, the Top 12 artists compete each week against each other during a live broadcast. The television audience votes to save their favorite artists. The three artists with the lowest number of votes are eligible for the “Instant Save.” These artists each perform a new song that represents why they should earn the save. Then, America has the opportunity to save their favorite performer by tweeting #VoiceSave along with the artist’s name. The singers with the lowest number of votes are sent home each week. In the end, one is named “The Voice” and receives the grand prize of a recording contract.\nShare with us who you liked during the live playoffs in the comments section. Whose performance do you think was better? Who do you think will ultimately win the competition?\nThe Voice Social Media Reactions @we_mcdonald is goals. #voicetop11 \n— Braden Mills (@Millskelly1) November 22, 2016 \n\n. @we_mcdonald I swear you become possessed with the ghost of musics past when you perform! #TeamAlicia #VoiceTop11 \n— Lisa Wright Smith (@lisaksmith7) November 22, 2016 \n\n. @aliciakeys #VoiceTop11 OMG she is amazing..

For the first time, a pair of female coaches will command the red chairs for NBC’s immensely popular musical competition series. The show’s innovative format features five stages of competition: the first begins with the blind auditions, followed by the battle rounds, the knockouts, the live playoffs and, finally, the live performance shows.\nIn the final live-performance phase of the competition, the Top 12 artists compete each week against each other during a live broadcast. The television audience votes to save their favorite artists. The three artists with the lowest number of votes are eligible for the “Instant Save.” These artists each perform a new song that represents why they should earn the save. Then, America has the opportunity to save their favorite performer by tweeting #VoiceSave along with the artist’s name. The singers with the lowest number of votes are sent home each week. In the end, one is named “The Voice” and receives the grand prize of a recording contract.\nPhoto Credit: Source \n",

(Town of Orange Police Department) \nORANGE, Conn. – Two McDonald’s employees called police after walking out of the restaurant to find a couple in a parked car “engaged in sexual activity,” police said Monday. \nThe workers had just finished their shifts at the Orange, Connecticut, McDonald’s around 9:30 p.m. on November 15, when they noticed the vehicle. One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. 41.278637 -73.026528 ",

      "text": "Can McDonald's (MCD) Stay on Its Post-Earnings Hot Streak? November 21, 2016, 07:41:00 PM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nIt has been about a month since the last earnings report for McDonald's(MCD). Shares have added about 5% in the past month, easily outperforming broad markets in that time frame. \nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. \nRecent Earnings: McDonald's Tops Q3 Earnings on Solid Comps Growth \nMcDonald's posted robust results in the third quarter of 2016, wherein both the bottom line and the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings and Revenue Discussion Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.62 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48 by 9.5% and improved 15.7% from the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to the turnaround plan announced by CEO Steve Easterbrook in May 2015. Meanwhile, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.03 per share on earnings in the quarter. Notably, at constant currency, earnings grew 17% year over year. Revenues of $6.42 billion fell 3% year over year mainly due to the impact of refranchising and currency headwinds. At constant currency, the figure declined 1%. Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.29 billion by 2.1%. Behind the Headlines Numbers In the quarter, revenues at company-operated restaurants declined 7.3% to $3.97 billion. Revenues at franchise-operated restaurants, however, grew 5.1% to $2.45 billion. Global comps grew 3.5%, supported by positive comps across all the segments, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Moreover, comps compared favorably with last quarter's increase of 3.1%. Key Segment Details U.S. : Comps grew 1.3% in the third quarter, reflecting the success of the All Day Breakfast platform launched in 2015 and the popularity of the company's national value platform - McPick 2. The introduction of Chicken McNuggets with no artificial preservatives also boosted the segment's performance. However, comps growth was less than the prior-quarter improvement of 1.8% due to softening industry growth. Segment operating income jumped 8%, mainly driven by improved restaurant profitability and higher gains from refranchising. Going forward, the company will remain focused on expanding its All Day Breakfast menu, the quality of food and on enhancing guest experience. International Lead Markets : Comps at the International Lead Markets segment grew 3.3%, driven by strong performance in the U.K. and upbeat results in Australia, Canada and Germany. The upside reflects multiple menu, service and value initiatives across most of the markets, which led to positive consumer response. Moreover, comps were better than an increase of 2.6% recorded last quarter. Operating income was up 2%, including the impact of foreign exchange headwinds. At constant currency, the figure was up 5% on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars across most markets. High-Growth Markets : Comps grew 1.5% in High-Growth Markets, as positive performance in almost all markets was partially offset by negative comparable sales in China due in part to temporary protests concerning events surrounding the South China Sea and strong prior-year comparisons. Notably, comps had witnessed growth of 1.6% last quarter. The segment's operating income rose 8% (10% in constant currencies) fueled by improved restaurant profitability in China, which benefited from the recent VAT reform. \nHow have estimates been moving since then? \nIt turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the month following earnings, at least when looking at the current quarter. MCD's prospects for the full year are brighter, as the consensus estimate here has been on the rise over the past month and analysts are now expecting EPS growth close to 15% year-over-year. \nArguably, the long-term turnaround in the fortunes of McDonald's shareholders is continuing, as evidenced by the chart below: MCDONALDS CORP Price and Consensus \nMCDONALDS CORP Price and Consensus | MCDONALDS CORP Quote \nVGM Scores \nAt this time, McDonald's stock has a nice Growth score of 'B', though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a 'D'. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of 'C' on the value side, putting it in the third quintile for this investment strategy.Overall though, the company is just average from a fundamental look, as its VGM score comes in at 'C', putting it into the middle 20% of all companies we study. \nOutlook \nThanks to the positive longer term trends in estimates for MCD, shares of the stock have a Zacks Rank # 2 (buy). This means that we are expecting the run in MCD to continue, and we are looking for more outperformance in the weeks ahead too. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "text": "A Lonely Wooden Doll Finds Love at McDonald's in Brand's Holiday Film Festive Campaign is Brand's Biggest U.K. Xmas Effort So Far By Alexandra Jardine.   \nMcDonald's has entered the U.K. blockbuster holiday ad race in the U.K. this year, with its biggest holiday campaign so far -- the poignant tale of a lonely wooden doll who's left on the shelf in the toyshop during the festive season. \nThe spot, directed by Gary Freedman for Leo Burnett London, is the tale of a Juliette, a vintage doll who, it seems, is too old-fashioned even for customers of the incredibly vintage-looking toy shop she inhabits. \"Maybe this year,\" says the kindly store owner optimistically as he puts her in the window at the beginning of the festive season. \nAs the days on the calendar go by, the doll is transfixed by happy scenes in the McDonald's opposite -- people meeting friends, laughing and joking and enjoying each other's company. By Christmas Eve, still nobody has bought her -- but our heroine makes a daring bid for freedom across the street, and finally finds love, in McDonald's, with a shiny new \"Meteor Mike\" spaceman doll. MPC and model makers Artem helped bring the dolls to life, and it's heartwarming stuff that kids (and maybe real life Bridget Joneses) will appreciate. \nEmily Somers, vice president food & marketing, McDonald's UK, said in a statement: \"I am very proud of our contribution to the competitive Christmas advertising window, and delighted to bring our biggest ever campaign to life with Juliette and her adventure.\"  ",

      "text": "\nSANDUSKY, Ohio– A Facebook user live streamed a very disturbing scene as he pulled up to a McDonald’s in Ohio on Thursday. \nIt’s an incident that police across Northeast Ohio say has become routine. \nPolice were called to the restaurant on River Avenue just before 5 p.m. for two men overdosing in a car. \nWARNING: Some viewers may find this video difficult to watch. \nEddie Wimbley posted the video of the two people passed out. You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nRaw Video: ",

      "text": "McDonald’s: More touch screens and table service just the beginning of change \nNEW YORK– McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook knows the business of food is changing. \nSo the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service. \nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017. \nNow, McDonald’s loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they’ll even have the option of mobile ordering. \n“Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,” Easterbrook said in an interview with CNNMoney’s Cristina Alesci. \nThat’s pushing consumers to demand more, he says — especially in the way of personalized eating. \n“They’re expecting us to evolve and offer greater convenience,” Easterbrook said. \nThe move is the company’s latest attempt to win back the customers it’s lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack. When Easterbrook took the reins in March 2015, McDonald’s was suffering from falling sales and lousy earnings. \nSince then, McDonald’s has launched an all-day breakfast menu. It’s introduced more customizable sandwiches with fancier ingredients, and announced two new sizes of Big Macs. The chain is also trying to be healthier, cutting artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and offering more wraps and salads. \nThe strategy is working. Revenue and profits for the third quarter topped forecasts. \nConsumer tastes aren’t the only thing changing the way companies operate. \nDonald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election has left many business executives wondering what his administration means for employment, trade and economic growth. In the meantime, Easterbrook and McDonald’s are sitting tight. \n“No one likes uncertainty,” he said. “The sooner we get through this period, and there’s some clarity as to the way things are going to go going forward, we’ll be able to make the long term decisions of business.” Related stories ",

      "title": "'The Founder' Review: Michael Keaton Channels the Hamburglar in True-Life McDonald's Tale",
      "text": "By Leslie Felperin, The Hollywood Reporter \nAnd they say Americans don’t do irony. The Founder is a dramatized account written by Robert Siegel ( The Wrestler ) of how traveling salesman Ray Kroc — played with bounce and oleaginous charm by Michael Keaton — gained control of the McDonald’s brand and built an empire. The movie is practically deep-fried in knowingness, starting with the big stage wink that is the title itself. As many students of business and fans of Mark Knopfler’s 2004 song “Boom, Like That” already know, Kroc “founded” McDonald’s only in the sense that he literally found a burger stand in San Bernardino, California, run by two brothers named Dick and Mac McDonald (Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch, respectively), took over franchising their concept, and eventually wrested control of the business entirely.\nBy making this ethically challenged man the film’s protagonist, director John Lee Hancock creates something a good shade or two darker than The Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks , his more cheerful and wholesome previous efforts in true-life-inspired storytelling. However, Hancock’s apparently irrepressible penchant for folksy Midwestern types and perky montages dilutes any cynicism or misanthropy that might have given this material the edginess it deserves.\nThe result is a wishy-washy take on both Kroc and McDonald’s itself, which tries to play off its timidity as fairness, balance or some such. In fact, it plays more like a film that can’t make up its mind whether it wants to be an exposé of Kroc’s scheming, Hamburglar venality or a sly celebration of his capitalist chutzpah. No doubt, 50 years in the future, the industry will churn out biopics about Donald Trump that are just as tonally muddy and ideologically confused.\nAt least this work doesn’t feature McDonald’s as a producing entity in the opening credits, making it less beholden to the company it depicts than the Disney-produced Saving Mr. Banks , which revolved around the encounter between Walt Disney himself (rather white-washed in the hands of Tom Hanks) and P.L. Travers (played by Emma Thompson), the author of the novel Mary Poppins . Even so, The Founder is careful to avoid in any way offending the company, once famed for being highly litigious. McDonald’s notably sued and won a case against British activists Helen Steel and David Morris for daring to distribute leaflets claiming the chain’s products were unhealthy and destructive to the environment, although arguably in the long run the case only hurt the company with bad publicity.\nThis film, unlike, say, the documentaries McLibel and Super Size Me , takes pains to remind viewers that the brand was founded by the McDonald brothers with high-quality food stuffs (“100 percent government-approved meat!”), produced to exacting quality-controlled standards yet made with incredible speed. Best not viewed on an empty stomach, this film abounds with shots of the cast members and extras ecstatically sinking their teeth into juicy, paper-wrapped patties, resulting in slow-motion smiles that spread across faces as sunnily as those in any of the commercials for the chain made in the last 30 or 40 years.\nWhat’s most interesting is that Siegel’s screenplay doesn’t start with Mac and Dick McDonald, former Columbia Studio truck drivers who went into the food-service industry after WWII and who came up with a near-revolutionary “Speedy System” to streamline burger production. Instead, it starts with Kroc, the Chicago-reared son of Czech immigrants, who as the story begins is just over 50 and wearing out his tire rubber visiting greasy, teen-infested, drive-in restaurants with bad service from roller-skating waitresses around the Midwest, hoping to talk owners and managers into buying a five-spindle Multi-Mixer for making milkshakes.\nRead More: Michael Keaton Back in the Oscar Hunt for Under-the-Radar McDonald’s Movie ‘The Founder’ \nWhen Kroc’s secretary June (Kate Kneeland, underused) reports that the McDonalds’ stand in Southern California wants six, no make it eight, mixers because their business is booming so fast, Ray gets in his Chevy and drives all the way down Route 66 to see what their secret is. It turns out there’s no real secret in the secret sauce (at that point not yet invented). Under Dick’s exacting eye and commitment to practice, the brothers have merely reduced the menu to the best-selling items and then worked out a way to make them as efficiently as possible, inspired by time-and-motion studies and assisted by homemade inventions, such as ray-gun-like dispensers for squirting just the right amount of ketchup and mustard onto a bun.\nRead More Via a long expository dialogue and edited in flashbacks, they explain how they assembled their workers in a tennis court, drew and redrew the kitchen with chalk, and had the team perform a “burger ballet” — it’s really more like miming than dancing, but whatever — to perfect the production process.\nEntranced, and passionate about the food, Ray pitches woo to the McDonalds, begging for a chance to franchise their menu, system and branding elements such as Nick’s beloved “Golden Arches” architectural design, which they tried at a failed branch in Phoenix, Az.\nWith some trepidation since some franchisees in the past failed to stick to the menu (they sold burritos in Sacramento — the horror!), the McDonalds agree. Ray starts his first one near his home in Illinois, raising capital by mortgaging his house without telling his long-suffering wife Ethel (Laura Dern, perhaps a shade too innately glamorous ever to be convincing as someone named Ethel). Their marriage has long been under strain due to Ray’s frequent absences on the road. It’s also implied that his controlled but constant drinking — he has a dainty hip flask always ready in his pocket — doesn’t help.\nOnce Ray has begun to make a success of things, his eye is caught by Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini), the wife of one of his franchise-holders (Patrick Wilson). Joan is a svelte, younger blonde whose lack of baggage is signaled by her sparser dress sense, forming a contrast to Ethel’s voluminous, high-maintenance New Look frocks and fussy, chintz-filled interior decoration. Like the perfect magician’s assistant, Joan takes delight in a good, cost-cutting sleight of hand, as revealed in a scene where she turns Ray on to instant milkshake mix, a concoction that reduces the need for refrigeration bills and represents the ultimate betrayal of the McDonald brothers’ purist vision.\nIt’s around this point that the film switches from being a jolly romp about some hard-working food-service visionaries and becomes something more like a Faustian parable, with B.J. Novak taking the Mephistophelean role of Harry J. Sonneborn, a financial adviser who gets Kroc to see that the real power lies in controlling real estate, not the petty means of production — truly a post-modernist approach to capitalism and ultimately the key to the company’s success. But the shift in register taxes Hancock, and his production team, and the jolliness they flood through the pacing, lighting and design doesn’t recede at the same time the story itself shifts.\nKeaton seems to have figured out long before everyone else that the tone is going to transmute swiftly, and it’s impressive the way he ups the sleazy factor by subtle degrees early on. The better-dressed he gets, the more his soul rots and the deader his eyes become, like some evil clown version of Dorian Gray. Even the folksy way he says “Nope,” full of finality and steel, becomes menacing, delivering it like a gun shot through a fluffy sweater. Of all the troubled, compromised and problematic characters Keaton has played in the course of this recent career resurgence, Ray Kroc, like a crocodile  — “but not spelled that way,” per the song by Knopfler who also co-owns with Jeremy Renner The Combine, which produced this — may be the most disturbing.\nDistributor: Weinstein Co.\nProduction companies: Faliro House Productions, FilmNation Entertainment, The Combine  \nCast: Michael Keaton, Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch, Laura Dern, Linda Cardellini, Patrick Wilson, B.J.

      "title": "New potato varieties chosen for McDonald’s fries",
      "text": "New potato varieties chosen for McDonald’s fries November 21, 2016 Share on Facebook \nBy Scott Weybright, College of Agricultural, Human & Natural Resource Sciences \nPULLMAN, Wash. – When it comes to potatoes, french fries are the big outlet for Columbia Basin farmers. And when it comes to selling french fries, McDonald’s is the holy grail. \nSo for Washington State University potato researchers Rick Knowles and Mark Pavek, having a new variety chosen by McDonald’s is a big deal. In September, the worldwide fast-food chain chose two relatively new varieties developed in part by WSU researchers. WSU scientist Mark Pavek and two Tri-State potato research colleagues check out new potato varieties in a WSU research field. \n“McDonald’s has expert tasters, kind of like with fine wine,” said horticulture professor Knowles. “Their gold standard potato for french fries is a Russet Burbank, which makes a great fry but is really inefficient from a production standpoint.” \nTo develop varieties that are more efficient, stress tolerant and sustainable, WSU researchers work with colleagues from the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS), Oregon State University and the University of Idaho through the Northwest Potato Variety Development Program, commonly called the Tri-State Program. WSU in on four of seven accepted varieties \n“Burbank has disease issues and requires high soil fertility and water,” said Pavek, an associate professor and potato specialist in the Department of Horticulture. “And it has a lower yield of the highest-grade tubers because it’s susceptible to so many stress-related disorders. \n“We need something to replace it that still makes fries McDonald’s will accept,” he said. \nA new variety can take 10-15 years to come to market from the time plants are first cross-pollinated, making it difficult to quickly replace a reliable yet inefficient potato. So when McDonald’s officially accepted the Clearwater Russet and Blazer Russet, everyone in the Tri-State Program rejoiced. \n“These are the first two varieties McDonald’s has added from our program since 2000,” Knowles said. “And they only have seven varieties on their list now, four of which were developed by the Tri-State Program. They’re very selective.” 33 percent higher protein \nSince the announcement, Knowles said, the potato industry has ramped up production of seed for the two new russets because demand always increases when McDonald’s, the largest buyer of potatoes in the world, accepts a new variety. \nThe increase in production will help the Tri-State breeding program, which earns royalties on varieties it develop. \n“Those royalties, split among the three universities and the USDA-ARS, will allow us to keep developing newer and even more efficient and nutritious varieties,” Knowles said. \nAnd the Clearwater Russet comes with an unexpected, though nutritious, side effect: 33 percent higher protein concentration than Burbank. \n“Potatoes are already very nutritious, with high levels of vitamin C and a good balance of amino acids,” Pavek said. “But Clearwater Russets are even better. It’s a nice little add-on to an already great potato.” \n\nRick Knowles, WSU Department of Horticulture, 509-335-3451, Mark Pavek, WSU Department of Horticulture, 509-335-6861,",

Truth rating: 10 By Shari Weiss | 10:02 pm, November 21st, 2016 VIDEO (NBC) \nWe McDonald covered Rihanna for her Top 11 performance on Monday’s “The Voice.” Check out the video below! \nAs Gossip Cop has reported, McDonald’s deep singing voice at only 17 years old has continually impressed the coaches throughout the season. Last week, she took the audience to church with her version of Hozier’s “Take Me To Church.” And now she gave just as strong a performance while also showcasing a different side of herself with Rihanna’s “Love On The Brain.” \nBefore taking the stage, McDonald was seen with coach Alicia Keys in rehearsal, where the aspiring star said she wanted to “match” Rihanna in her performance. Keys predicted her artist’s “contemporary spin” on the “vintage-sounding” track would make it sound brand new. And that version seemed to go over quite well when McDonald eventually closed out the two-hour live show. \nThere was only time afterward for Keys to speak, and the superstar said, “We, you always come with it. You’re so young, but you sing like you’ve had a trillion, thousand years of experience… You deserve everything. You deserve to be here and you deserve to soar.” She even said that the audience “can’t deny” McDonald’s power.

By Zacks Investment Research | Just Now (Nov 22, 2016 07:41AM ET) This article has already been saved in your Saved Items Follow \nIt has been about a month since the last earnings report for McDonald's(NYSE: MCD ). Shares have added about 5% in the past month, easily outperforming broad markets in that time frame. \nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. \nRecent Earnings: McDonald's Tops Q3 Earnings on Solid Comps Growth McDonald's posted robust results in the third quarter of 2016, wherein both the bottom line and the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings and Revenue Discussion Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.62 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48 by 9.5% and improved 15.7% from the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to the turnaround plan announced by CEO Steve Easterbrook in May 2015.Meanwhile, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.03 per share on earnings in the quarter. Notably, at constant currency, earnings grew 17% year over year.Revenues of $6.42 billion fell 3% year over year mainly due to the impact of refranchising and currency headwinds. At constant currency, the figure declined 1%. Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.29 billion by 2.1%. Behind the Headlines Numbers In the quarter, revenues at company-operated restaurants declined 7.3% to $3.97 billion. Revenues at franchise-operated restaurants, however, grew 5.1% to $2.45 billion.Global comps grew 3.5%, supported by positive comps across all the segments, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Moreover, comps compared favorably with last quarter’s increase of 3.1%. Key Segment Details U.S. : Comps grew 1.3% in the third quarter, reflecting the success of the All Day Breakfast platform launched in 2015 and the popularity of the company’s national value platform – McPick 2. The introduction of Chicken McNuggets with no artificial preservatives also boosted the segment’s performance. However, comps growth was less than the prior-quarter improvement of 1.8% due to softening industry growth.Segment operating income jumped 8%, mainly driven by improved restaurant profitability and higher gains from refranchising.Going forward, the company will remain focused on expanding its All Day Breakfast menu, the quality of food and on enhancing guest experience. International Lead Markets : Comps at the International Lead Markets segment grew 3.3%, driven by strong performance in the U.K. and upbeat results in Australia, Canada and Germany. The upside reflects multiple menu, service and value initiatives across most of the markets, which led to positive consumer response. Moreover, comps were better than an increase of 2.6% recorded last quarter.Operating income was up 2%, including the impact of foreign exchange headwinds. At constant currency, the figure was up 5% on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars across most markets. High-Growth Markets : Comps grew 1.5% in High-Growth Markets, as positive performance in almost all markets was partially offset by negative comparable sales in China due in part to temporary protests concerning events surrounding the South China Sea and strong prior-year comparisons. Notably, comps had witnessed growth of 1.6% last quarter.The segment's operating income rose 8% (10% in constant currencies) fueled by improved restaurant profitability in China, which benefited from the recent VAT reform. \nHow have estimates been moving since then? \nIt turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the month following earnings, at least when looking at the current quarter. MCD's prospects for the full year are brighter, as the consensus estimate here has been on the rise over the past month and analysts are now expecting EPS growth close to 15% year-over-year. \nArguably, the long-term turnaround in the fortunes of McDonald's shareholders is continuing, as evidenced by the chart below: MCDONALDS CORP Price and Consensus \nMCDONALDS CORP Price and Consensus | MCDONALDS CORP Quote \nVGM Scores \nAt this time, McDonald's stock has a nice Growth score of 'B', though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a 'D'. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of 'C' on the value side, putting it in the third quintile for this investment strategy.Overall though, the company is just average from a fundamental look, as its VGM score comes in at 'C', putting it into the middle 20% of all companies we study. \nOutlook \nThanks to the positive longer term trends in estimates for MCD, shares of the stock have a Zacks Rank # 2 (buy). This means that we are expecting the run in MCD to continue, and we are looking for more outperformance in the weeks ahead too. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. ",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nIt has been about a month since the last earnings report for McDonald's( MCD - Free Report ) . Shares have added about 5% in the past month, easily outperforming broad markets in that time frame. \nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to their next earnings release, or is the stock due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. \nRecent Earnings: McDonald's Tops Q3 Earnings on Solid Comps Growth McDonald's posted robust results in the third quarter of 2016, wherein both the bottom line and the top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings and Revenue Discussion Earnings per share (EPS) of $1.62 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48 by 9.5% and improved 15.7% from the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to the turnaround plan announced by CEO Steve Easterbrook in May 2015.Meanwhile, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.03 per share on earnings in the quarter. Notably, at constant currency, earnings grew 17% year over year.Revenues of $6.42 billion fell 3% year over year mainly due to the impact of refranchising and currency headwinds. At constant currency, the figure declined 1%. Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.29 billion by 2.1%. Behind the Headlines Numbers In the quarter, revenues at company-operated restaurants declined 7.3% to $3.97 billion. Revenues at franchise-operated restaurants, however, grew 5.1% to $2.45 billion.Global comps grew 3.5%, supported by positive comps across all the segments, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales. Moreover, comps compared favorably with last quarter’s increase of 3.1%. Key Segment Details U.S. : Comps grew 1.3% in the third quarter, reflecting the success of the All Day Breakfast platform launched in 2015 and the popularity of the company’s national value platform – McPick 2. The introduction of Chicken McNuggets with no artificial preservatives also boosted the segment’s performance. However, comps growth was less than the prior-quarter improvement of 1.8% due to softening industry growth.Segment operating income jumped 8%, mainly driven by improved restaurant profitability and higher gains from refranchising.Going forward, the company will remain focused on expanding its All Day Breakfast menu, the quality of food and on enhancing guest experience. International Lead Markets : Comps at the International Lead Markets segment grew 3.3%, driven by strong performance in the U.K. and upbeat results in Australia, Canada and Germany. The upside reflects multiple menu, service and value initiatives across most of the markets, which led to positive consumer response. Moreover, comps were better than an increase of 2.6% recorded last quarter.Operating income was up 2%, including the impact of foreign exchange headwinds. At constant currency, the figure was up 5% on the back of sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars across most markets. High-Growth Markets : Comps grew 1.5% in High-Growth Markets, as positive performance in almost all markets was partially offset by negative comparable sales in China due in part to temporary protests concerning events surrounding the South China Sea and strong prior-year comparisons. Notably, comps had witnessed growth of 1.6% last quarter.The segment's operating income rose 8% (10% in constant currencies) fueled by improved restaurant profitability in China, which benefited from the recent VAT reform. \nHow have estimates been moving since then? \nIt turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the month following earnings, at least when looking at the current quarter. MCD's prospects for the full year are brighter, as the consensus estimate here has been on the rise over the past month and analysts are now expecting EPS growth close to 15% year-over-year. \nArguably, the long-term turnaround in the fortunes of McDonald's shareholders is continuing, as evidenced by the chart below:",

      "text": "Imagine a huge multinational corporation making products that your town considers so unhealthy they decided not to let the company open up shop. Imagine only 59 people in your town (4%) actually wanting the company to come in, demolish local landmarks, and open their doors. Now imagine that company taking your community to court, to sue for the right to sell their unhealthy products right across from an elementary school, in spite of your town almost unanimously opposing it.\nThat is exactly what has happened in the Australian town of Tecoma.\nLocals describe the town as “a peaceful village in the Dandenong Ranges, 40 kilometres east of Melbourne, with a population of 2085 residents.” In spite of their small numbers, Tecoma activist got the word out and came together with others to gather over 100,000 signatures demanding that McDonalds stay out of town.\nOnce the signatures were compiled, activists from an organization called BurgerOff flew thousands of miles to the McDonald’s global headquarters just outside of Chicago to deliver the petition and page after page of signatures. Company representatives refused to accept the petition, or pile of signatures. They literally wouldn’t even touch it according to BurgerOff activists.\nFor years now, activists from BurgerOff and the people of Tecoma focused their opposition to the McDonald’s branch positioning its 24-hour drive-thru location near an elementary school. This, they explained would be “a giant advertisement for junk food” for young children.\nActivists in Tecoma have turned to regular protests outside of the site and others nearby, voicing their discontent with the corporation’s plans for the town.\n“They sent out a P.R. [public relations] lady and a guy from corporate responsibility,” Garry Muratore, a Tecoma McDonald’s protester said to Australia’s Sunrise Live.\n“They wouldn’t touch the actual petition; it was like we were giving them poison. They handed the 7,000 pages [of the petition] to a poor security guard there.”\nAccording to Muratore, McDonalds has been running ads saying that the community is demanding that they set up a location in Tecoma. “That’s a lie that McDonald’s in Australia keeps pushing,” he explained. “We know that nine out of 10 people don’t want this.”\nHow does Muratore know?\nAccording to local activists from BurgerOff:\n“On October 11th 2011, local Councillors met and voted on the proposed development. 650 local residents attended to hear the decision and once again voice their objections. The Shire of Yarra Ranges Council UNANIMOUSLY rejected the proposal.”\nFurthermore, “A door-knock survey of 80% of the adult residents of Tecoma was then conducted in November/December 2012.”\n“Every household in Tecoma was door-knocked,” activists explained. “All households that were not home in the first instance were door-knocked a second time during the following fortnight. One question was asked “ Are you for or against the proposed McDonald’s development in Tecoma? ” The results were overwhelming, with 88.2% of Tecoma’s residents stating that they are against the development (1085 people), 7% didn’t know or didn’t care (86 people) and a lowly 4.8% were for it (59 people).”\nBut McDonalds isn’t stopping there, they are actually suing the town in the Victorian Supreme Court, after having their attacks on the townsfolk repeatedly dismissed.\n“We then pointed out that if they were being responsible, why are they suing us? And it was a little bit like the Quote: from the Vietnam War that we had to destroy the village to save it,” Muratore explained further. “They actually told us that they were suing us for our own legal protection… I don’t know what that meant, but they seemed to think it was a great idea.”\nWhat are your thoughts? If you agree with the protesters, sign the petition here and pass the word on to others who might be interested.\n( Article by M. David; image via CampusScope ) Share this:",

      "text": "Share on Facebook istock/jessicaphoto \nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, and a McDonald’s shareholder, is calling on the fast food chain to make removing antibiotics from its supply chain a priority. \nWhile McDonald’s has already begun to source antibiotic-free chicken for products served in the U.S., the shareholder group says the chain needs to make the same commitment to all of its animal products—not just in the U.S., but across the planet—in order to help reduce the antibiotic resistant epidemic. \nAccording to Reuters, more than 20 percent of McDonald’s shareholders recently voted similarly in another proposal. And the Sisters are hopeful that their proposal will be voted on in 2017. \n“More than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use,” reports Reuters. “Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant ‘superbug’ infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.” \nThe World Health Organization continues to urge world leaders to take antibiotic resistance seriously and to find ways to remove them from the food supply in order to protect people from antibiotic-resistant infections. \nMcDonald’s told Reuters it continues “to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.” \nAccording to McDonald’s, under current policies, it works with suppliers in providing guidance and systems to help ensure antibiotic-free compliance. \nAntibiotics are routinely given to livestock animals as a preventative against diseases and infections common in dense factory farms. But they’re also given because they increase animal size and weight in a short period of time, allowing producers to push animals to market more quickly, thus increasing profits.

      "text": "Email \nORANGE, Conn. – Two McDonald’s employees called police after walking out of the restaurant to find a couple in a parked car “engaged in sexual activity,” police said Monday. \nThe workers had just finished their shifts at the Orange, Connecticut, McDonald’s around 9:30 p.m. on November 15, when they noticed the vehicle. One of the employees told a 911 operator it appeared the pair were having sex, and that “a small child was seated in the back, watching,” according to police. Kimberly Onorato, 28, and Rory Clark, 27, allegedly told police that they were “cuddling” after two McDonald’s employees called 911 to report two people engaged in sexual activity in the parking lot. (Town of Orange Police Department) \nWhen police arrived, they found a woman partially-naked in the front seat with a man, and a 6-year-old in the back seat who was “alert and awake,” WTIC reported. \nThe couple said they were “cuddling” after eating at McDonald’s, according to police. \nOfficers arrested Rory Clark, 27, of West Haven, and Kimberly Onorato, 28, of Bristol. Both were charged with second-degree breach of peace and impairing the morals of a minor. \nThey were both released on $5,000 bond. 41.278637 -73.026528 ",

      "text": "WestJet Announces New Coffee Partnership With McDonald’s November 22, 2016 by lucky Leave A Comment \nMany airlines introduce partnerships around their food & beverage offerings as a way of trying to position their product in a certain way. If a customer doesn’t have a strong feeling about the airline as such, they may have a more favorable impression if the airline partners with a brand they otherwise love. For example, United serves Illy coffee, and JetBlue serves Dunkin’ Donuts coffee. \nWell, Canadian low cost carrier WestJet (the Canadian equivalent of Southwest) has just announced a new onboard partnership, and it’s an interesting one. Rather than trying to partner with a premium brand, they’re instead going for a brand that many people love. As of December 1, 2016, WestJet will serve McDonald’s McCafe coffee on all flights . Per the press release : \nWestJet announced today it has partnered with McDonald’s ® Canada in a move that will see the restaurant’s McCafé Premium Roast coffee available on board WestJet aircraft. \nThe first flight, taking place on November 21, 2016 , from Toronto to Calgary , represents a global-first for McDonald’s and an unprecedented next step in the McCafé coffee journey, which in recent years has continued its emphasis on providing Canadians with A New Way to Café . \nBy December 1 , WestJet will offer McCafé Premium Roast coffee across its fleet of Boeing 737NG and 767NG aircraft with the company’s regional airline, WestJet Encore, to follow. \nIt’s expected that WestJet will serve 30,000 cups of McCafe coffee every day. For those of us into collecting rewards, the WestJet McCafe cups will have the same on-cup rewards sticker as cups on the ground, so you can even earn McCafe loyalty points. \nPer CBC , here’s some of the motivation behind the partnership: \nThe move is the latest front in an all out war in the coffee industry to win Canadians loyalty in their coffee buying. Tim Hortons was once untouchable in the space, but McDonald’s has made inroads with its free coffee promotions. \nSecond Cup is the exclusive coffee provider on Air Canada flights, and Toronto-based regional carrier Porter Airlines uses Starbucks exclusively. \nWestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky said Monday that Tim Hortons and Starbucks Canada both tried to bid for the contract to serve coffee on WestJet’s flights, but were unsuccessful. \nWhen asked if WestJet will co-brand with McDonald’s on other products such as Chicken McNuggets, Saretsky said: “Possibly. We really want to make sure we get the coffee right first.” \nTim Hortons does not currently have a deal with any airlines to be the provider of coffee on board. Bottom line \nWhile unconventional, this is a brilliant partnership. McCafe coffee is actually quite good, in my opinion, and in this case they’re going with a brand many people love, rather than being concerned about how premium it is. Furthermore, given the market share battle with Tim Hortons in Canada, I suspect WestJet is getting the coffee for next to nothing. \nAre you a fan of McCafe coffee?

      "text": "McDonald's Corp has asked a federal judge to throw out a proposed class action filed by workers at a California franchise, arguing that it cannot be held liable for state law violations just because workers believed the company rather than the local franchisee was their employer.\nIn a brief filed Friday, McDonald's, represented by Jones Day, tried to convince a federal judge for a second time to stop a lawsuit from proceeding under a theory of ostensible agency, a California common law doctrine that says a company can be held liable for labor law violations if workers reasonably believed it was their employer. The laws that the plaintiffs sued under, however, McDonald's argued, limit liability to those that have control over working conditions.\nTo read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2gbYxmB",

(AP) — A Connecticut couple is facing charges after police say they engaged in sexual activity in a parked car with a 6-year-old boy in the back seat.\nPolice in Orange say two McDonald’s employees were leaving the restaurant on Nov. 15 when they spotted two people engaged in sexual activity in the front seats of a car. They say the child was in the back seat, awake and alert.\nPolice say they arrived to find 28-year-old Kimberly Onorato partially undressed. Police say Onorato and 27-year-old Rory Clark stated they had only been cuddling.\nClark and Onorato are both charged with impairing morals of a minor and breach of peace. Online court records don’t list lawyers for the pair.\nThe child was turned over to a relative. Police also contacted child welfare authorities.",
