      "text": "58.51 USD \nNew blood is good, right? Well, not exactly. \nStarbucks Corp.'s stock dropped as much as 10 percent in after-market trading Thursday on news that CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down from the coffee chain he bought in 1987 and transformed into an $86 billion company. Roasted Starbucks sales fell precipitously when Howard Schultz stepped down from Starbucks the first time Source: Bloomberg \nThis reaction isn't surprising: The last time Schultz stepped away from the company -- from 2000 to 2008 -- Starbucks's sales had their worst performance since the company went public. During that time, it posted five straight years of comparable-store sales growth declines. Its stock fell 50 percent from its 2006 high. Leadership Vacuum Starbucks shares dropped 50% from its 2006 high at the time Schultz came back as CEO Source: Bloomberg \nWhen Schultz came back, he gave Starbucks a much-needed energy boost. He slowed U.S. store openings to re-establish the chain as a premium brand, accelerated international expansion, and streamlined bureaucracy. The company perked up big time, with shares shooting up nearly 1200 percent since then. \nStarbucks Stock Gain Since Schultz's Return As CEO 1200% \nSchultz was also ahead of the game on technology, ushering in a successful mobile-payment and digital-ordering system that sped up orders and engendered loyalty among customers. \nWhich brings us to Schultz's reasoning for stepping aside: On a call with Wall Street analysts Thursday, Schultz said his successor, former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson, was much better equipped than he was to continue Starbucks's foray into the digital world. (Though Schultz stressed he would remain as chairman of the board and focus on Starbucks's move into higher-end, premium line of shops.) \nIt's likely we will hear more about the company's new strategic plans at its annual investor meeting later this month, but in the meantime, here's a short list of issues Johnson should attack right away: Food: Starbucks's food fight has gone on for decades at this point. The company is terrific at driving coffee sales; food sales, not so much . And that's despite a buffet of deals over the years to try to get people to buy more food at its stores. The coffee chain recently bought a stake in Princi, a high-end Italian bakery and pizzeria. But investors and customers need to see more convincing proof Starbucks has found a way to crack its food conundrum. Loyalty program: Recent changes to Starbucks's loyalty program look good, in theory. The company should be able to juice sales by encouraging customers to spend more. But the initial reaction hasn't been great. There's a lot more work to be done here to make sure loyal customers don't get frustrated with the new system and abandon Starbucks for its competitors. Restaurant recession: From a macro perspective, Starbucks is also up against some real struggles in the retail and restaurant industries . Retail and mall traffic are in secular decline. And people are spending less on restaurants as they can find cheaper stuff at the grocery store. Starbucks should reach into its 2008 playbook and figure out how to offer premium products its competitors lack, in order to keep customers coming back and paying ever-higher prices. \nWhen asked Thursday why history wouldn't repeat itself upon his second departure, Schultz said he had more confidence in the current management team this time. Personally, he said he was more prepared to step down than he was the first time. \nThat may be so, but Schultz is again leaving the company at a tenuous time. It's still not clear Kevin Johnson is ready to take the reins. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. \nTo contact the author of this story: Shelly Banjo in New York at \nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at Wire transfers to a money changer 20 ",

View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161201006372/en/\nKevin Johnson, president and coo of Starbucks, will expand role to ceo effective April 3, 2017. Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo, will be appointed executive chairman. (Photo: Business Wire)\nAlso effective April 3, 2017, Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo, will be appointed executive chairman and will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve ® Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve ® retail store format and the company’s social impact initiatives. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board.\n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI — both in the U.S. and around the world,” said Schultz. “As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson — our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years — has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.”\nAs president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses across all geographies as well as the core support functions of Starbucks supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Starbucks board of directors.\n\"Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team. Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,\" said Johnson. “It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team. Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.”\nJohnson's career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks. At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and the management team in 2015.\nConference Call Details\nStarbucks will hold a conference call hosted by Howard Schultz and Kevin Johnson today, December 1, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time/4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The conference call will be webcast and can be accessed on the company’s website: http://investor.starbucks.com .

      "text": "Longtime Starbucks chief Howard Schultz to step down as CEO Posted: By CBS MoneyWatch Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz stepping down. \nStarbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz - the expansion-minded Seattle espresso fanatic who turned a local coffee house into a global brand with 25,000 stores and $21 billion in sales - announced Tuesday he will be stepping down as chief executive in the spring. \nSchultz, 63, will be replaced as CEO by Kevin Johnson, the current president and chief operating officer, the company said in a statement, adding that Schultz will remain chairman of the Starbucks board. \nJohnson will take over as barista-in-chief next April. He’ll certainly have his work cut out for him. Starbucks, once one of the fastest-growing and most profitable companies in U.S. history, faces significant challenges to deliver the kind of growth investors have been used to from the company. \nShares of the Seattle-based company fell 3.3 percent to $56.57 in after-hours trading after the news was released. \n© 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

Starbucks ( SBUX ) head Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive officer next April, the coffee shop giant said Thursday.\nSchultz will \"focus on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultrapremium retail formats,\" according to the statement on Starbucks' press site .\nCurrent COO Kevin Johnson will be the new chief executive officer. He took the new COO post two years ago, with some observers at the time speculating he was the heir apparent.\nOn a conference call later, Johnson said no other leadership changes are planned.\nSchultz, currently chairman, will be executive chairman after stepping down as CEO.\nShares fell 3.7% in late trading. Starbucks closed up 0.9% to 58.51 on the stock market today .\nPresumably more details of the succession will be provided at Starbucks' investor day next Wednesday.\nSchultz joined the coffee company in 1982, then bought the retail unit in 1986, renaming its Starbucks. Schultz was a long-time CEO of Starbucks, but stepped down from 2000-2008. His return coincided with a revival in Starbucks' growth.",

Starbucks shares have since recovered and are trading down 3.6 percent after-hours.\nThe transition will occur on April 3, 2017, and it will allow Schultz to focus on turning Starbucks' Reserve-branded coffee bars into destination restaurants.\nSchultz was quick to remind analysts on a conference call Thursday that he is not leaving the company, but instead transitioning into this new role.\n\"As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson — our current president, COO, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years — has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future,\" Schultz said in a news release.\n\nThe company's flagship Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room opened in its home market of Seattle in 2014. These \"megastores\" are designed to be much larger than a traditional Starbucks cafe and allow the company to do small-batch roastings of \"rare and exotic\" Reserve coffees. \n\n\"This is an opportunity for us to elevate food,\" Schultz told reporters back in July. \"This will once again reaffirm Starbucks' leadership in all things coffee.\"\n\"Howard Schultz has been phenomenally successful in building up the Starbucks business into the global powerhouse it is today,\" Neil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, told CNBC. \"However, the business is now at a different stage and as a more mature entity the future opportunities are less about expansion and more about careful operational management to generate incremental growth and drive efficiencies. Schultz has the capability to do this, but it is probably not what excites him: he's a business builder and an innovator. By comparison, Kevin Johnson is a good operational head who knows the business and has the full trust of Schultz.\"\n\nSchultz first joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing when the company only had four stores, according to Starbucks. Over time he grew it into a iconic brand.\n\nThis will not be the first time Schultz has vacated the CEO role: He had previously served as the company's chief executive from 1987 to 2000, but he returned to the position in 2008.\nSome see his planned departure as a good sign for Starbucks' outlook.\n\"It is obvious that he thinks Starbucks is in a good place,\" Bonnie Riggs, restaurant industry analyst for the NPD Group, told CNBC. \"He stepped back in when they were struggling and most definitely turned the concept around. He can now move on to other areas of interest, but I have no doubt should they falter, he would jump back in.\" \n\nThe company noted during the call that there are no other planned leadership changes in the near term.\n\nJohnson, who has been the company's president and chief operating officer, joined Starbucks in 2015, according to his company biography. He has served on the company's board of directors since 2009.\nJohnson previously served as CEO of Juniper Networks and was the president of the platforms division at Microsoft.\n\"Kevin has been a wise and supportive resource for me,\" Schultz said during a conference call Thursday. \n\nSchultz praised Johnson, noting that the last two fiscal years have been the best in the company's history in part because of the COO.\nThe leadership transition also sparked speculation about Schultz's potential political plans: He has been a supporter of President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and some have already questioned whether he would pursue his own presidential run.\n—CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed to this report. \n\nMore From CNBC \n\nTop News and Analysis \nLatest News Video \nPersonal Finance",

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \nNEW YORK • Starbucks says CEO Howard Schultz, who transformed the chain into a global coffee brand, is stepping down from that role at the chain that he joined more than 30 years ago. \nThe Seattle-based company announced Thursday that Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will become chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, currently chairman and CEO, will become executive chairman to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. \nIn a message to Starbucks employees, Schultz spoke of his “enduring love” for the company and called himself “incredibly excited” to work on projects such as the expansion of premium Starbucks Roasteries around the world. \nHe is credited with turning around the coffee chain’s fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. Schultz, 63, has overseen the expansion of the company’s popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nSpeaking on a conference call, Johnson called Schultz one of the world’s “most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.”",

      "text": "New York (AFP) - Howard Schultz, the charismatic head of Starbucks, will step aside as CEO next year, turning a major page in the history of a company he built into an iconic global brand.\nHaving led the company's rise from a sleepy Seattle chain into the world's biggest coffee business, Schultz will stay on as executive chairman and chairman of the board, the coffee giant said Thursday in a surprise announcement that sent the share price down after hours.\nThe change will take effect April 3.\nSchultz will hand the reins to president and chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a close friend who was tapped as number two at the company in 2015 and has been a Starbucks board member since 2009.\nThe move comes as the firm faces an increasingly crowded market for higher-quality retail coffee shops and seeks to bolster foot traffic.\nSchultz will devote his time to developing high-end superpremium coffee shops around the world known as Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, the company said in a statement.\nIt plans to open 20 to 30 outlets in the coming years.\n\"I will be here full-time,\" Schultz told a conference call with analysts. \"I am not leaving the company, I am here day to day.\"\n- New initiative -\nSchultz, who joined Starbucks in 1982 as a sales manager, is considered the driving force behind the worldwide success of the coffee chain begun in 1971.\nHe briefly left in 1986 following a dispute with the then-owners to set up his own company, Il Giornale, before buying out their shares in 1987 with support from local small investors.\nStarbucks now operates more than 25,000 stores in more than 75 countries, with a turnover of around $20 billion in fiscal year 2015.\nSchultz, 63, told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the company's new initiative would help maintain in-person sales as consumers increasingly move to online shopping rather than visiting malls, where many Starbucks outlets are located.\n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" he said. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\"\nIncoming CEO Johnson is a tech industry veteran, having spent 16 years at Microsoft and five as CEO of the networking equipment company Juniper Networks.\nPrior to the announcement, the company's share price closed up 0.9 percent in New York but fell 3.35 percent in after-hours trading to $56.55 at 2250 GMT.\n- Socially responsible -\nSchultz is outspoken about social issues such as gay rights and gun violence and has worked to make Starbucks socially responsible.\nThe company increased the base salaries of its US employees by 5 percent in July after they expressed concerns about the effect new software enabling customers to place orders on their smartphones would have on jobs.\nThe company has also opened outlets in poor areas and supported initiatives against racism.\nSchultz is close to the Democratic former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom he supported during the election campaign. But he has dismissed persistent rumors he would run for office himself. Many, including some of his friends, have said he may run for president in four years.\nHe steps down as Starbucks goes ahead with plans to double the number of its stores in China over five years.\nBut it has run afoul of European regulators, one of several major US companies the European Commission accused of having received illegal tax benefits from Ireland.\nIn October 2015, the commission also ordered Starbucks to repay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) in the Netherlands, saying tax breaks there amounted to unlawful state aid.\nThe Dutch authorities are fighting the decision.\nSchultz has sought to step away from running Starbucks before.\nThe Wall Street darling became the company's chairman in 2000 before returning as chief executive in 2008 with the onset of the global financial crisis.\nShares worth $10 at that time climbed to a record high of more than $60 by the end of last year.",

      "text": "Share via Email Print FILE - In this Wednesday, March 23, 2016, file photo, Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer of Starbucks Corp., holds up one of the coffee company's prepaid Visa debit cards, at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. Starbucks announced Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, that CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down from the coffee chain that he joined more than 30 years ago, and that Johnson will become chief executive as of April 3, 2017. Schultz will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) By: Candice Choi And Michael Sisak The Associated Press Published on NEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Since returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Investor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 per cent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. During a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. Schultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. In a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. Over the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. Johnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority. Editors' Picks ",

      "text": "By Lisa Baertlein and Gayathree Ganesan\n(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive.\nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans.\nStarbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008.\n\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior.\n\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.\nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure.\n\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company.\nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune.\nJohnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015.\nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp .\nOn a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\"\n\"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.\n\"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's.\nTraffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales.\nThe company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics.\n\"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said.\n(Reporting by Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; additional writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Oatis)",

Warren, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. Get breaking news sent instantly   Breaking News   \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

Effective April 3, he will be appointed executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, design and developing Starbucks locations. \nSchultz is being replaced by former Microsoft senior exec Kevin Johnson, who will become the new CEO. \nIn a statement, Schultz said the move “ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nSchultz famously returned to Starbucks in 2008 to help guide the coffee giant through the recession and restore growth at the company. 47.606209 -122.332071 ",

      "text": "Starbucks ' chairman and CEO Howard Schultz will be stepping down from his role in 2017, the company announced on Thursday, though he will not leave the company entirely. Schultz will hand over the reins to current president and COO Kevin Johnson.\nSchultz's new role at the company — the biggest global coffee brand with more than 24,000 stores in 70 countries — will be as executive chairman. The position, according to the New York Times , will allow Schultz to lead Starbucks' charge on social issues, along with the development of a \"superpremium line\" of coffee products and stores.\n\"Our complementary backgrounds — my entrepreneurial journey building Starbucks and Kevin's decades spent scaling global businesses — will continue to help Starbucks navigate this new period of worldwide growth and innovation,\" Schultz said in a statement .\nThere has been increased speculation that Schultz will eventually assume a political career in the future , as the Times points out.\nSchultz was a supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in this year's election, and has talked in the past about fixing the \"dysfunction in Washington.\"\nSpeaking with Mic in September, Schultz cited \"fractured leadership\" in the United States as one of the reasons his company started \"Upstanders,\" an original series aimed at highlighting individuals making a positive change in their communities.\nAfter the announcement of Schultz's new role, shares in Starbucks were down by more than 3%, according to Business Insider .\nThough Starbucks has certainly had its share of controversies under Schultz's tenure, the CEO has been praised for his social stances.\nHoward Schultz is an actual role-model billionaire. His work on human rights and his treatment of his employees are American values.\nSince Schultz joined the company in 1987 —",

(Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 8:31 PM. EST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "Starbucks's visionary CEO Howard Schultz stepping down New York, Dec 2, 2016 (PTI) Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz, credited with taking the company from small beginnings to an international behemoth, is stepping down as CEO to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the reins to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Schultz, 63, will continue to serve as chairman of the Board and will be appointed executive chairman effective April next year. \n\nHe handpicked 56-year-old Johnson, the company's president, chief operating officer and a 7-year member of the Starbucks Board of Directors, to serve as the new CEO. The Seattle-based company said in his new role, Schultz will focus on the \"next wave of retail innovation\", design and development of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve retail store format and the company's social impact initiatives.\n\n\"I will remain Starbucks executive chairman, focusing full-time on the incredible growth opportunities we have in expanding Roasteries and building out our portfolio of Reserve stores and on Starbucks social impact agenda which will be a significant part of the focus going forward,\" Schultz said in an investor and media conference call yesterday.\nSchultz, who was named by Fortune magazine this month in its list of Businessperson of the Year, is credited with doubling the company's revenues since he returned for his second stint in 2008, surpassing USD 20 billion for the first time over the past 12 months. Starbucks now has 25,000 stores in 75 countries, including India.\n\nSchultz's career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and in 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nSchultz's focus will be developing and expanding the company's Roasteries, high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Describing the Roastery as the world's \"most immersive, coffee-forward retail experience,\" Schultz said the Roastery has \"become a learning laboratory for breakthrough innovation and experiential design and a beacon for the next wave of Starbucks global growth and evolution.\"\n\nStarbucks Reserve is a new, premium retail coffee format that will showcase the newest coffee-brewing methods and offer customers hi-end assortment of exclusive, micro-lot coffees sourced from around the world. \"I am personally as passionate about developing the Reserve brand, and opening more Roasteries, as I was about opening our first espresso bar more than 30 years ago in Seattle,\" he said.\n\n\"We share a passion for customer-focused innovation and a commitment to preserving Starbucks heritage. Our complementary backgrounds – my entrepreneurial journey building Starbucks and Kevin's decades spent scaling global businesses – will continue to help Starbucks navigate this new period of worldwide growth and innovation,\" he said about his successor Johnson.",

      "text": "The announcement by Starbucks that long-serving CEO Howard Schultz would step down in 2017 certainly jolted Wall Street on Thursday. But Schultz told analysts and investors not to fret the change at the top of the coffee giant: he promises he is leaving the global restaurant chain in good hands.\nOn April 3, Starbucks sbux will be handed off to President and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who first joined Starbucks’ management team back in early 2015 after Troy Alstead decided to take a sabbatical after 23 years with the company. Johnson, who received $8.5 million in compensation last year, has little experience in building a consumer brand, but instead brings a lot of background in the world of tech to the role.\nJohnson had decades of experience in tech having previously served as CEO of Juniper Networks jnpr and as an executive at Microsoft msft . His expertise in tech is important for restaurant chains like Starbucks, which have seen consumers use mobile devices as a way to engage with brands and expect more as it relates to order and pay, delivery, and promotions.\nSchultz, meanwhile, will retain his role as executive chairman and focus on a passion project that has been brewing at Starbucks for some time: a focus on premium beverages and a premium retail experience through the company’s Roastery locations. Starbucks wants to role out more of these massive retail locations across key cities like New York City and Tokyo, while also opening up 1,000 “Reserve” coffee bar stores that feature a greater variety of brewing methods than what customers see in a typical Starbucks store today.\nBy focusing more of his energy on the bet on premium, Schultz says he can dedicate more energy to a business that will be a new source of revenue and profitability for the greater Starbucks’ corporation.\n“I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz said. He said that while he will be busy “building a new franchise at Starbucks and will help Kevin and the team when necessary,” Johnson is “in charge.”\nWall Street observers fretted the transition a bit during a conference call hosted by Starbucks on Thursday afternoon. That’s because Starbucks enjoyed a lot of success under Schultz’s leadership during his first 13-year tenure as CEO, which ended in 2000. He had to return to that role in 2008 as the coffee giant found itself struggling in the U.S. during the financial crisis. Many observers credit him for helping the brand become a powerhouse again.\nSchultz and Johnson stressed that their close working relationship—Johnson even sounded emotional on the call when talking about his boss—had been well established and gave Johnson plenty of insight into the opportunities and challenges that Starbucks faces.\nThe leadership pivot points to the success that Starbucks, along with Domino’s Pizza dpz , Panera Bread pnra , and a few other restaurant chains have had when it comes to incorporating mobile into the restaurant experience. Mobile payments now make up 25% of all transactions at Starbucks, while mobile order & pay accounts for 6% of transactions. Those figures will likely continue to tick up higher.\n“I think Kevin is better prepared to be the CEO on a go-forward basis than I am,” Schultz told analysts during a conference call following the announcement, specifically citing Johnson’s tech expertise.\nThough Johnson has only been in active management since 2015, he has been a member of the board since 2009. There are also no plans to make any significant changes to the current leadership team, which Schultz touted as the strongest bench in Starbucks history.",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive. Schultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans. Starbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008. \"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior. \"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations. Many of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure. \"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. The announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune. Johnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015. Johnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp. On a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\" \"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management. \"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's. Traffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales. The company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics. \"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said. -Reuters ",

The shares already were down 2.5 percent this year through Thursday’s close. \n\n© Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close ",

      "text": "Blaine, Washington needs a Starbucks with drive-thru   8:55 PM by BlaineStarbuck Blaine, Washington needs a Starbucks plain and simple. Having enjoyed the benefits of being a Gold card member since 2013 with my co-workers and friends daily in Bellingham, WA, I was extremely disappointed to find there was no Starbucks in the city of Blaine when I transferred to a new job. I'm sure the executives of Starbucks have looked into the area however I'm thinking it may be a good time to revisit the prospect of developing a site here in Blaine. Exit 275 off I-5 in Washington alone had an impressive 378,747 truck crossings alone, not including British Columbia data. That's in ONE direction at ONE crossing, for commercial trucks only. Exit 276 and 275 combined personal car crossings, one direction had a whopping 4,234,824 crossings. These people that have smart phones and I'm thinking a good share enjoy Starbucks are getting ready to sit in border traffic or have been sitting in border traffic and are ready for a break. In addition the commuter traffic for the general working public, myself included, and residents have to wait until getting to Ferndale,WA, get out of there car and go into Haggens Starbucks coffee bar or continue to Bellingham at Bakerview and NW to visit a Starbucks with a drive-thru. I respectfully request this request be activly considered. Sincerely, Donna Hall",

Effective April 3, he will be appointed executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, design and developing Starbucks locations. \nSchultz is being replaced by former Microsoft senior exec Kevin Johnson, who will become the new CEO. \nIn a statement, Schultz said the move “ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nSchultz famously returned to Starbucks in 2008 to help guide the coffee giant through the recession and restore growth at the company.

      "text": "  18:07 PM EST Starbucks Announces New Leadership Structure to Drive Next Wave of Global Growth \nKevin Johnson, President and COO of Starbucks with Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO. \nKevin Johnson to become chief executive officer and assume full responsibility for Starbucks global business and operations \nHoward Schultz to become executive chairman and focus on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultra-premium retail formats \nSeattle, WA   Starbucks Corporation ( NASDAQ: SBUX ) today announced that Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer and a 7-year member of the Starbucks Board of Directors, will expand his responsibilities and assume the role and responsibilities of president and chief executive officer, effective April 3, 2017. \nAlso effective April 3, 2017, Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo, will be appointed executive chairman and will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve® retail store format and the company’s social impact initiatives. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board. \n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI — both in the U.S. and around the world,” said Schultz. “As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson — our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years — has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nAs president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses across all geographies as well as the core support functions of Starbucks supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Starbucks board of directors. \n“Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team. Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,” said Johnson. “It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team. Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.” \nJohnson’s career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks. At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and the management team in 2015. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee.

      "text": "Starbucks CEO Schultz to step aside, stay as chairman John Biers Luc Olinga, Agence France-Presse Posted at Dec 02 2016 11:15 AM \nShare FILE PHOTO: Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz speaks during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, Washington March 18, 2015. REUTERS/David Ryder/File photo \nNEW YORK - Howard Schultz, the charismatic head of Starbucks, will step aside as CEO next year, turning a major page in the history of a company he built into an iconic global brand. \nHaving led the company's rise from a sleepy Seattle chain into the world's biggest coffee business, Schultz will stay on as executive chairman and chairman of the board, the coffee giant said Thursday in a surprise announcement that sent the share price down after hours. \nThe change will take effect April 3. \nSchultz will hand the reins to president and chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a close friend who was tapped as number two at the company in 2015 and has been a Starbucks board member since 2009. \nThe move comes as the firm faces an increasingly crowded market for higher-quality retail coffee shops and seeks to bolster foot traffic. \nSchultz will devote his time to developing high-end superpremium coffee shops around the world known as Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, the company said in a statement. \nIt plans to open 20 to 30 outlets in the coming years. \n\"I will be here full-time,\" Schultz told a conference call with analysts. \"I am not leaving the company, I am here day to day.\" \nNEW INITIATIVE \nSchultz, who joined Starbucks in 1982 as a sales manager, is considered the driving force behind the worldwide success of the coffee chain begun in 1971. \nHe briefly left in 1986 following a dispute with the then-owners to set up his own company, Il Giornale, before buying out their shares in 1987 with support from local small investors. \nStarbucks now operates more than 25,000 stores in more than 75 countries, with a turnover of around $20 billion in fiscal year 2015. \nSchultz, 63, told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the company's new initiative would help maintain in-person sales as consumers increasingly move to online shopping rather than visiting malls, where many Starbucks outlets are located. \n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" he said. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\" \nIncoming CEO Johnson is a tech industry veteran, having spent 16 years at Microsoft and five as CEO of the networking equipment company Juniper Networks. \nPrior to the announcement, the company's share price closed up 0.9 percent in New York but fell 3.35 percent in after-hours trading to $56.55 at 2250 GMT. \nSOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE \nSchultz is outspoken about social issues such as gay rights and gun violence and has worked to make Starbucks socially responsible. \nThe company increased the base salaries of its US employees by 5 percent in July after they expressed concerns about the effect new software enabling customers to place orders on their smartphones would have on jobs. \nThe company has also opened outlets in poor areas and supported initiatives against racism. \nSchultz is close to the Democratic former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom he supported during the election campaign. But he has dismissed persistent rumors he would run for office himself. Many, including some of his friends, have said he may run for president in four years. \nHe steps down as Starbucks goes ahead with plans to double the number of its stores in China over five years. \nBut it has run afoul of European regulators, one of several major US companies the European Commission accused of having received illegal tax benefits from Ireland. \nIn October 2015, the commission also ordered Starbucks to repay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) in the Netherlands, saying tax breaks there amounted to unlawful state aid. \nThe Dutch authorities are fighting the decision. \nSchultz has sought to step away from running Starbucks before. \nThe Wall Street darling became the company's chairman in 2000 before returning as chief executive in 2008 with the onset of the global financial crisis. \nShares worth $10 at that time climbed to a record high of more than $60 by the end of last year. \nShare ",

      "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to Step Down",
      "text": "Starbucks' Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO from the business he transformed into the world's largest coffee brand over the past 30 years.\nSchultz made the announcement Thursday, saying he will make the transition on April 3 and remain at the company as executive chairman.\nSince purchasing the Starbucks chain in 1987, Schultz built the brand's empire with more than 25,000 stores in 75 countries and a market value of $84 billion, according to The New York Times. Schultz has been a highly visible CEO while leading the company to take on social and political issues such as gun violence, race relations, gay rights, student debt, veterans rights and more.\nHis successor will be Kevin Johnson, the company's current president and chief operating officer.\nSchultz said he plans to continue to lead Starbucks' social efforts while focusing on developing its higher-end shops, such as the 15,000-square-foot flagship Reserve Roastery in downtown Seattle, as well as smaller premium stores and \"bars\" in current Starbucks stores. Schultz's move is sure to feed speculation that he has plans to enter politics, though he has said that is not in his current plans.\nUnder Schultz's direction, Starbucks has not only grown as a coffee brand but a powerful player in music. The company's investment began with the acquisition of music retailer Hear Music in 1999, initially focusing on compilations for music discovery sold in its coffee shops.\nIn the mid-2000s, the company developed a partnership with William Morris to help identify music to feature in its stores and Schultz helped bring in a number of exclusive music releases under the Hear Music record label in partnership with Concord Music Group. This incentive included albums by Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Sia, Elvis Costello, James Taylor and more.\nHear Music also developed into a branded retail store with several Starbucks Hear Music Coffeehouses around the country, as well as \"media bars\" within existing Starbucks locations.\nA 2006 Billboard article cites annual album sales of 3.6 million units, or approximately $65 million in music revenue, via Starbucks.\nIn a 2004 interview with Fast Company, Schultz noted of Starbucks' jump into music: \"The nature of shopping for a CD or a piece of music at a traditional record store is, at its best, a very poor consumer experience. ... The Starbucks customer [who] might want to find a Diana Krall album, a Tony Bennett album, or anything that was not being played on the radio, well, they would have a hard time going into Tower Records. Maybe they'd find the album there, but they could not find someone who could talk to them about it. That consumer has disposable income and has had a long history of buying and enjoying music, but they have nowhere to go.\"\nThe Hear Music Coffeehouses shut down in 2008, as the company transferred the record label's day-to-day management fully to Concord that same year. And in 2015, the Starbucks coffee shops stopped selling CDs but has continued its music efforts, this year announcing a partnership with Spotify.\nThis story originally appeared on Billboard.com.",

      "title": "Sen.se GuardPeanut Review: A $29 movement sensor for the IoT",
      "text": "Reddit \nIf you’ve ever spent time working at your local Starbucks, you’ll probably be familiar with the Coffee Guilt Security Dilemma. It’s the feeling that you should probably buy another drink, because you don’t want to be labeled a freeloader, yet you’re worried about leaving your laptop on the table while you queue. Do you pack everything up and risk someone stealing your spot by the outlet? French Internet of Things firm Sense wants to assuage your paranoid guilt, and it’s doing that with the $29 GuardPeanut. \nIt’s the second sensor in Sense’s IoT series, following on from the ThermoPeanut . That, as the name suggests, focused on temperature: effectively a thermometer probe blended with a Bluetooth dongle. It donated its form-factor to this new sensor, though the goal is now security. \nThe GuardPeanut itself is a small, lightweight lozenge of plastic. As the name suggests, it’s vaguely peanut-shaped; unlike a peanut you can switch out the shell for different colors (they’re reflected in the app to help you differentiate) and two come in the box with the GuardPeanut. While it’s open you can replace the button-style CR2032 battery, which Sense says should last for four months of typical use. \nAlso in the box are a small array of mounting accessories. There’s a plastic clip which you can use to attach the GuardPeanut to a bag or coat, along with a keyring loop, self-adhesive pad, and “sticky putty” which adheres better to uneven surfaces. Of course, you could always just drop the whole thing into a bag or case, though then you’ll be at risk of false-motions. \nSetup is simple: pull the plastic tab out of the side of the GuardPeanut, open the iOS or Android app, and search for a new device. After discovery, you can name it, change its color from the default, and then set whether your phone sounds an alert on movement, the GuardPeanut does, or both. Advanced settings include five levels of sensitivity, how quickly an alert is dismissed in the app, and adjusting how obnoxious the alarm is. \nThe dimple in the GuardPeanut itself is actually a button; long-pressing it toggles the motion alarm on and off. Sense is adding IFTTT integration as well, so you’ll be able to trigger other services when motion is detected, though that wasn’t enabled during my testing. Unlike the ThermoPeanut, there’s no Nest support: GuardPeanut doesn’t have a thermometer. \nFirst, I tried attaching it to my bag using the clip and keychain. Sure enough, at the default medium sensitivity level, as soon as I picked it up I got a notification on my iPhone and a series of beeps from the GuardPeanut itself. Unfortunately there’s no way to set the alarm so that it only sounds if it’s not connected to its host device. \nNext, I mounted it on the front door. With sensitivity set to maximum, even a knock on the door triggered an alert. Since you can pair a single GuardPeanut with multiple iOS and Android devices – just as long as they support Bluetooth 4.0+ – it doesn’t matter which phone is nearby; it automatically connects to whichever is closest. \nFrom the app you can manually trigger the GuardPeanut’s alarm to help you track it down. A log of the past thirty days activity is shown in the app too, but Sense actually stores all the alerts in the cloud. You can request a CSV file be emailed to you with all that data – or data from just a specific subset of dates – from within the app, too. \nThere’s no shortage of Bluetooth trackers on the market these days, with Tile, TrackR, and several others all promising to help keep an eye on your keys or belongings. GuardPeanut differs slightly in that it doesn’t offer much in the way of locating lost items beyond the siren: there’s no map or crowdsourced positioning. On the flip side, none of the others have the same smart home potential. \nAt $29 it’s more interesting to me as an IoT trigger with IFTTT, though the reassurance of knowing my laptop will shout if it’s moved unexpectedly is handy for Starbucks’s. Just make sure you react fast if you hear the alarm, since once it’s out of audible range the GuardPeanut can’t help you track it down. It’s on sale today.",

      "text": "Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz. (Stephen Brashear/Getty Images) × Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to step down Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz. (Stephen Brashear/Getty Images) \nSEATTLE — Howard Schultz, the visionary leader of Starbucks, will be stepping down next year as CEO of the iconic coffee giant. \nSchultz’s surprise decision to step aside as the leader of Starbucks sent the stock sinking 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday. \nStarbucks said Schultz isn’t going away completely. Effective April 3, he will become executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, the company’s premium offerings and on social impact. Current chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a tech industry veteran, will replace Schultz as CEO. \n“This is a good thing. I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz told CNN’s Poppy Harlow by phone on Thursday. \nThe 63-year-old said he had been planning the move for at least a year. Asked if he’s going to Washington, Schultz laughed and said, “No, I’m not going to Washington.” \nInstead, Schultz emphasized a desire to focus on the company’s social impact initiatives. \n“Given the state of things in the country, there is a need to help those left behind,” Schultz told CNN. \nSchultz said he also wants to focus on Starbucks’ premium offerings, such as the Roasteries that allow customers to watch freshly-roasted beans arrive. \nSeparately, in a conference call, Schultz said Johnson brings “unparalleled understanding of market dynamics” and he deserves a “tremendous amount of credit” for the company’s recent record results. \nDuring the call, Johnson called Schultz “among the world’s most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.” \nJohnson seemed to choke up and his voice broke when he said it had been a “privilege to work side-by-side with Howard.” \nSchultz joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of retail operations and he helped turn the company into a retail powerhouse and an iconic American brand. He stepped down as CEO in April 2000 to concentrate on executing the company’s global strategy. \nBut Starbucks struggled without him at the helm and seemed to have lost its way. Schultz returned as CEO in 2008 and helped guide the coffee giant through the Great Recession and get it back on track. Today, Starbucks is valued at $84 billion and it has more than 24,000 retail stores in 70 countries. \nSchultz has also been outspoken on a variety of social issues. He has supported raising the minimum wage, he offered his employees free college and pushed Starbucks to open a store in Ferguson following the city’s violent protests. \nAsked if he’s concerned Starbucks could suffer again in his absence as CEO, Schultz said the “differences between then and now couldn’t be greater.” \nSchultz said the Starbucks management team didn’t have the “capability and experience” to navigate the Great Recession. By contrast, he praised Johnson’s skills and even said his deputy is “better prepared than I am” to be CEO at this point. ",

      "text": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Stepping Down To Focus On Upscale Coffee \nDecember 1, 2016 5:33 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler @akieler a new leader is hired starbucks moving out ceo howard schultz making moves staying with the company a new leader coffee \nAfter eight years as the man behind the morning cup of joe for many millions of coffee drinkers, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has decided to step aside and let someone else run the coffee colossus. \nAccording to Starbucks, Schultz will officially end his ride as CEO in April 2017, handing the reins over to the company’s president and chief operating office, Kevin Johnson (the guy on the left in the above photo). \nJohnson, who has been a member of the Starbucks Board of Directors for seven years, will assume the role and responsibilities of president and chief executive officer, effective April 3, 2017. \nSchultz isn’t leaving the company, however. Starbucks says that he will be appointed executive chairman and will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board. \nInstead of focusing on day-to-day operations, Schultz’s new position will entail working on innovation, design, and development of the company’s upscale Reserve Roasteries division, which has become a pet project of sorts for Schultz. \nLast month, the company announced the chain was planning to open 1,000 of those mini cafes within Starbucks cafes by the end of 2017. That could be more feasible now with Schultz’s full attention on the program. \n“This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future,” Schultz said in a statement. \nBuilding out the Reserve division makes sense for Schultz, who has a long history with Starbucks. According to the Wall Street Journal, he joined the company in 1982 as its marketing director. \nHe left the company just four years later to start his own coffee business called Il Giornale. However, he later returned to Starbucks by way of buying the company from its previous owners. He then renamed his business Starbucks and the rapid expansion of coffee shops began. \nAs for Johnson, he says he’s the right man for the head honcho job. \n“Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team,” the former tech industry executive said in a statement. “Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future.” ",

The move is a nod to the company’s growing reputation for innovation: It introduced the world’s first successful mobile-payment service, beating out the likes of Apple Inc. and Google Inc., and gets an increasingly large portion of its revenue from that source.\nSchultz will keep the role of executive chairman at Starbucks, focusing on the rollout of its upscale Reserve brand.\n“I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz, 63, said on a conference call after the change was announced Thursday. “But Kevin and the team are in charge.”\nJohnson, who joined the board in 2009, was tapped for the operating chief job after Troy Alstead went on sabbatical. Johnson, 56, previously worked at Microsoft Corp. and Juniper Networks Inc. In 2008, he was named to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, where he served under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n© Leslie Patton BC-STARBUCKS-TECH-CEO Schultz’s Shadow\nThe CEO change jarred investors, who briefly sent the shares down as much as 12 percent, though Johnson was seen as a possible successor since he took the No. 2 job last year.\nFor many shareholders and customers, Schultz has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. And he’s used the company to pursue social causes -- occasionally clumsily -- such as racial strife and sustainability.\nClick here to see the latest SBUX share price\nSchultz will focus on expanding Starbucks’ Reserve Roasteries, a chain of massive coffee houses that provide tastings and other experiences, as well as new Reserve retail stores. The executive has been working to position the Reserve name as Starbucks’ new higher-end brand. Schultz also will continue the company’s “social impact” efforts.\nAs CEO, he’s already pushed to open stores in low-income areas and supported gay marriage. It hasn’t always gone smoothly. Schultz’s idea for employees to discuss race relations with customers was criticized as ham-fisted.\nInvestors weren’t anticipating Schultz’s departure as CEO so soon, though having both executives focus on different parts of the company could have benefits, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus.\n“The timing of this is a surprise,” she said. “I do think the ‘divide and conquer’ strategy is probably good for the company long-term.”\nMobile Transactions\nStarbucks’ digital and technology prowess has put it ahead of its peers, allowing it to serve more customers faster. Same-store sales rose 5 percent in the Americas region in the most recent quarter. Mobile payments accounted for about 25 percent of U.S. transactions in that period.\nStarbucks built on its tech leadership with an order-ahead feature, which lets customers select and pay for drinks in advance. They then can pick up the beverages at a shop without waiting in line.\nSince Johnson became operating chief, Starbucks has rolled out mobile ordering across the U.S. and even tested delivery. The Seattle-based company also is boosting spending on digital ventures, including taking its app and rewards platform to countries such as China.\nThough shares of Starbucks tumbled immediately after the announcement, they recovered some of that ground during extended trading. As of 5:54 p.m. in New York, the stock was down 3.3 percent to $56.58.\nSecond Retirement\nThis isn’t Schultz’s first retirement as CEO. After serving in the job from 1987 to 2000 -- punctuated by an initial public offering in 1992 -- he stepped down in 2000. But Schultz returned in 2008 after Starbucks faltered. The company had opened too many locations too quickly and got hit by the financial crisis. Profit plunged.\nSchultz put Starbucks back on firmer footing.\n“The difference between then and now couldn’t be greater,” he said on Thursday. “In 2007-2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies and Starbucks was not immune.”\nThe company now has the “strongest leadership team in history,” he said.\nIt’s been speculated that Schultz might make a run for U.S. president, though he’s repeatedly said he has no intention of doing so. While speaking at a conference in New York last month, Schultz said he wouldn’t serve as part of President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet. He also denied rumors of running for president last year in a New York Times opinion piece.\nIt’s probably too early to tell if Schultz has designs on the White House, Bartashus said.\n“Certainly if he is interested in a political career, he has the next 2 1/2 years to sow those seeds,” she said. “A lot will depend on the first half of the Trump administration.”\n--With assistance from Olga Kharif To contact the reporters on this story: Leslie Patton in Chicago at lpatton5@bloomberg.net, Nick Turner in New York at nturner7@bloomberg.net.

      "title": "Rags To Multi-Billionaire Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Steps Down To Focus On Philanthropy And Social Causes",
      "text": "Howard Schultz , the self-made multi-billionaire 63 year old CEO of Starbucks, announced today that he is stepping down to focus the rest of his life on philanthropy and solving social causes. It will be the first time Starbucks has been run by someone other than Schultz in 16 years. Schultz will remain Chairman of the Board.\nHoward Schultz is one of the most impressive rags to riches stories we've ever covered on CelebrityNetWorth. He was literally raised DIRT POOR in a New York City housing project. In order to distract himself from the poverty at home, Howard escaped through sports. He played high school baseball, football, and basketball. He was eventually awarded a football scholarship to Northern Michigan University—his ticket out of his impoverished childhood. He was the first person in his family to go to college.\nAfter graduation, Schultz spent four years working at Xerox before moving on to a job at a Swedish manufacturer of drip coffeemakers. He eventually became manager of U.S. operations for the company and this is how he ended up at the Pike Place Market Starbucks in 1981. Starbucks at the time was one of his best customers.\nOn that fateful day, Schultz was drawn into conversation with these connoisseurs of coffee who, rather than roasting the easiest bean, sought out the very best tasting, best smelling, highest quality coffee they could find. But it was more than just that passion for the best coffee that struck Schultz, it was also how the Starbucks proprietors wanted to share this passion for coffee with others.\nSchultz saw a massive opportunity and immediately knew he had to get a job at Starbucks. It took him a year to convince Starbucks to hire him. In 1982, Schultz left New York and moved to Seattle to become Starbucks' Director of Operations and Marketing. At the time, Starbucks had four stores and Schultz was 29 years old .\nGetty Images\nIn 1983, Howard took a trip to Italy and was taken in by the romance of the Italian cafe culture. These little romantic cafes existed on every block. They were the meeting place where everyone came have a conversation or read the paper. These Italian coffeehouses were an integral part of their patrons' days. Howard thought he could bring that Italian coffeehouse tradition back to Seattle, turning a coffee bar into an integral stop in a person's day. His instinct was clearly spot on.\nHowever, in order to make his dream a reality, he had to leave Starbucks, which at the time was solely a purveyor of coffee beans. The owners at the time did not envision turning Starbucks into a \"restaurant\".\nSchultz started his own coffee company called Il Giornale. He would not be gone from Starbucks for long, however. He came back in 1987 to buy the company (with the help of local investors including flutist Kenny G whose parents were friends with Howard!) for $3.8 million. That's roughly $7 million dollars after adjusting for inflation.\nUnder Howard's leadership, Starbucks expanded rapidly in the 1990s. The shops seemed to multiply like rabbits overnight, on every corner. Schultz modeled Starbucks' domination on McDonald's, with one huge difference—Every McDonald's location is franchised, while Starbucks owns most of its stores.\nStarbucks went public in 1992.\nToday the company has a market cap of $80 billion and Howard is personally worth $ 3.1 billion . Not a bad outcome for a kid from the projects!\nRead more: Rags To Multi-Billionaire Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Steps Down To Focus On Philanthropy And Social Causes ",

      "text": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (Photo by Stephen Brashear/Getty Images) × Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to step down Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (Photo by Stephen Brashear/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK — Howard Schultz, the visionary leader of Starbucks, will be stepping down next year as CEO of the iconic coffee giant. \nSchultz’s surprise decision to step aside as the leader of Starbucks sent the stock sinking 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday. \nStarbucks said Schultz isn’t going away completely. Effective April 3, he will become executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, the company’s premium offerings and on social impact. Current chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a tech industry veteran, will replace Schultz as CEO. \n“This is a good thing. I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz told CNN’s Poppy Harlow by phone on Thursday. \nThe 63-year-old said he had been planning the move for at least a year. Asked if he’s going to Washington, Schultz laughed and said, “No, I’m not going to Washington.” \nInstead, Schultz emphasized a desire to focus on the company’s social impact initiatives. \n“Given the state of things in the country, there is a need to help those left behind,” Schultz told CNN. \nSchultz said he also wants to focus on Starbucks’ premium offerings, such as the Roasteries that allow customers to watch freshly-roasted beans arrive. \nSeparately, in a conference call, Schultz said Johnson brings “unparalleled understanding of market dynamics” and he deserves a “tremendous amount of credit” for the company’s recent record results. \nDuring the call, Johnson called Schultz “among the world’s most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.” \nJohnson seemed to choke up and his voice broke when he said it had been a “privilege to work side-by-side with Howard.” \nSchultz joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of retail operations and he helped turn the company into a retail powerhouse and an iconic American brand. He stepped down as CEO in April 2000 to concentrate on executing the company’s global strategy. \nBut Starbucks struggled without him at the helm and seemed to have lost its way. Schultz returned as CEO in 2008 and helped guide the coffee giant through the Great Recession and get it back on track. Today, Starbucks is valued at $84 billion and it has more than 24,000 retail stores in 70 countries. \nSchultz has also been outspoken on a variety of social issues. He has supported raising the minimum wage, he offered his employees free college and pushed Starbucks to open a store in Ferguson following the city’s violent protests. \nAsked if he’s concerned Starbucks could suffer again in his absence as CEO, Schultz said the “differences between then and now couldn’t be greater.” \nSchultz said the Starbucks management team didn’t have the “capability and experience” to navigate the Great Recession. By contrast, he praised Johnson’s skills and even said his deputy is “better prepared than I am” to be CEO at this point. Related stories ",

      "text": "( JTA ) — Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz will leave his post as the company’s chief executive, the company said.\nSchultz, 63, will become the company’s executive chairman, and current President and COO Kevin Johnson will become Starbucks’ next CEO, NBC News reported Thursday based on a statement from the company.\nThe changes will take place on April 3, the company said.\nStarbucks shares dipped about 4 percent in after hours trading following the news of the planned leadership transition, according to NBC.\n“This is a big day for me,” Schultz said in an interview to the New York Times. “I love the company as much as I love my family.” But he said it was the right time to hand the keys to Johnson, whom he described as being “better equipped” to “run the company than I am,” ticking off a list of Johnson’s operational talents, and saying that he wanted to “relinquish the role and responsibility to the right person.”\nSchultz, who is Jewish, first joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing when the company only had four stores, according to Starbucks. Under his stewardship, the tiny coffee roasting outfit has grown into a global empire with 25,000 stores in 75 countries.\nSchultz will remain at the company as executive chairman, focusing on the company’s involvement in social causes and on growing Starbucks Reserve, the company’s new superpremium brand and chain of high-end stores, the New York Times reported.\nUnder Schultz, Starbucks has become a vocal part of the national conversation on issues like gun violence, gay rights, race relations, veterans rights and student debt.\nSchultz grew up poor in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. He had a coffee epiphany while paying a client call on a coffee bean store in Seattle in 1981, and then went to work at the company the next year, according to the New York Times. In 1983, he visited Italy and was impressed not only by the ubiquity of coffee bars, but also their central role as community gathering spots — a role he refers to as “the third place” in society.\n",

      "text": "27 Mins Ago | 02:26 \nStarbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz revealed on Thursday that he will leave his post as the company's chief executive, handing off the position to President and COO Kevin Johnson. \n\"What was clear was Kevin's ability,\" Schultz said on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \", \"He is much better prepared to managed the global operations.\" \nThe changes will take place on April 3 and will allow Schultz to focus on turning Starbucks' Reserve-branded coffee bars into destination restaurants. \n\"I can't try to be Howard. I'm not Howard.\" Johnson said on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \", explaining that he needs to authentic in his new role. \nSchultz first joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing when the company only had four stores, according to Starbucks. Over time he grew it into a iconic brand, with over 25,000 stores in 75 countries. \nThis will not be the first time Schultz has vacated the CEO role: He had previously served as the company's chief executive from 1987 to 2000, but he returned to the position in 2008. \nSchultz, who is seen as a visionary leader, will remain at the company as executive chairman. \n\"We are not surprised that Mr. Schultz has chosen to step back from day-to-day operations and that Mr. Johnson was appointed his replacement, but we view the timing as notable given the heightened level of strategic endeavors the company currently has ongoing,\" Mark Astrachan, an analyst with Stifel wrote in a research note Thursday. \nJohnson joined the Starbucks' management team in 2015 and has served on the board of directors since 2009. \nShares of Starbucks are currently trading down 3.6 percent at about $56.37. \n\"The negative initial perception (and stock reaction) to the leadership transition is understandable and the timing likely will raise questions,\" an analyst at BMO said. \"The transition of Howard Schultz, the visionary at the core of Starbucks' success over time, away from the CEO role is likely to create a sense of trepidation among investors, particularly given the eventual deterioration in the company's performance after he last stepped down from the position.\"",

Full Bio The author is a Forbes contributor. The opinions expressed are those of the writer. Loading ... This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File) \nWhy would Howard Schultz, the revered CEO of Starbucks Corporation, leave his job as he announced yesterday? He made a reasonable public statement about it but what's his personal answer, the one that he says only to himself? \nTo be very open about it, I never met the man, I can't say what's in his head. Perhaps he's leaving for the usual right reasons, to allow new leadership to take the Company to the next stage or to spend good, healthy years of his life with the important people in his life. But knowing what we know about the world of retail today, perhaps there are reasons why Schultz, or any good manager, would want to get out of a giant legacy retailer of food to start something new. \nI don't mean to disparage Starbucks, they created a new category in America, changed consumer habits and are enormously profitable. Those are all about the hardest things to do in business for any company. But when you look at where they are today and where the world is going, it's not surprising that a senior person in a dominant retail company would want to do something more innovative. \nIt used to be true that big, established retailers had enormous strengths of scale and capital that would prevent smaller competitors from encroaching on their market share. But what we're seeing now is that the historical method of running a company, a big, vertical organization chart, with hierarchy and very defined responsibility, is limiting creativity. In fact, if you look at the organization chart of young, innovative consumer companies, they are different. The organization chart is horizontal, there is highly distributed responsibility, and many people can take on as much responsibility as they can handle. If you think about a service business like an accounting firm, a law firm or a medical practice, each professional is their own profit center and they are responsible for the success of their business. New, creative retailers are much more like professional service organizations than they are like the old vertical structure with strict reporting lines and responsibilities. When you structure organizations horizontally instead of vertically and you get good people in the company, something amazing happens: creativity. And thus it becomes possible to build a big organization with creative people who can not only be successful and happy in their jobs but they can also offer consumers much more interesting products and environments. \nOne of the characteristics of having a horizontally-oriented organization chart is that it can't be grafted on to a traditional company, it just won't fit and the two can't coexist. It's not like adding a new division with new people, the two organizations can't work together, they have to stand apart. \nSo why would Howard Schultz leave his job and go on to run a new venture called Starbucks Reserve? Maybe it's for the usual reasons. But maybe not. Maybe, the guy who got excited by building a new coffee venture a long time ago, isn't so excited about watching what he built be the establishment behemoth that finds itself under attack by innovation. Maybe he's more excited to be the place where everyone can be creative and assume the maximum responsbiilty they can handle. Maybe he wants to experience what is new in the world where millennials are more interested in working because they are free to do their jobs as best they can. Maybe he believes that companies organized to focus on the skills of their people are becoming highly successful and adjusting to changes in the market much more quickly. Maybe when he goes to work he just wants to have more fun. ",

      "text": "Ty Wright/Getty Images \nOutgoing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz struck a conciliatory tone over the election of Donald Trump in an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box on Friday morning.\nSchultz was a vocal supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the campaign and said he was \"stunned\" by the election of Trump in a letter to employees the day after the election. He also stepped down as CEO of Starbucks on Wednesday , transitioning to Executive Chairman.\n\"I don't think of any level that Starbucks or the brand is at odds with  Trump or his supporters,\" said Schultz. \"We feel very  strongly as a company is to demonstrate a level of social impact to the community th at we serve.\" \nDue to Schultz's support of Clinton, there have been a number of protests against Starbucks including customers asking for Trump's name to be written on their cups. \n\"We have been concerned with a number of social issues that have not been addressed by Republicans in the past, but we hope that the new administration will address them,\" Schultz told CNBC. \nThroughout the line of questioning, Schultz expressed optimism for the new administration saying \"we all want the president-elect to do well.\" \nAdditionally, Schultz was asked about the recent rally in stocks since the election of Trump as the market prices in possible tax cuts for corporations and fiscal stimulus from the administration. \n\"I need to separate the stock of Starbucks from the Trump administration and the rest of the stock market.\" said Schultz, saying that the unique value of Starbucks had driven the company's post-election surge.\nFinally, Schultz was asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin if he was panning a run for office as some have speculated he might following his change in roles.\n\" I am all in at Starbucks and that is my focus at this time,\" replied Schultz. \nNOW WATCH: Here's how much you need to make to be in the top 1% of every state \n",

      "text": "SBUX announced last night that its founder is stepping down from the CEO role. \nBut the incoming CEO has no doubt been groomed to take his place. \nAnd with Schultz free to focus on growth, I'm excited for what's ahead. Photo credit Last night, investors in Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) received some huge news; founder Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO next April. That's a momentous event to be sure as this company has thrived and become one of the most valuable brands in the world under its founder's leadership over the years. But with the appointment of new CEO Kevin Johnson, are things really going to be that different? After all Schultz will still be on the board as Executive Chairman and isn't retiring, so why is the stock selling off? Click to enlarge Starbucks has been caught in a downtrend for better than a year as growth has slowed somewhat in that time. The famous price increases the company pushes through each year have remained extremely effective but traffic has actually declined of late. It seems that Starbucks isn't Starbucks any longer when it comes to growth. That has me concerned as a long time bull but not enough to abandon ship as there is a lot going for this company even if something as important as traffic is negative. But what does the departure of Schultz actually mean? Why is the stock being sold on the news? To be sure, any time the founder of a business leaves, it is a real event. The genius of Schultz has created a global powerhouse that is unrivaled to say the least and since he's not going to be running day-to-day operations, there is going to be some change. Perhaps change itself is what investors are afraid of even if there is no reason to be. The incoming CEO, Kevin Johnson, has a wide array of leadership experience in the tech world, including five years as Juniper's CEO, and, importantly, has been President and COO of Starbucks for two years. He's also been a director longer than that so to make a long story short, it isn't like some random person is coming in to lead. Johnson has no doubt been groomed for this job over the past two years and will continue to be groomed for the next five months. The alarm being raised by selling investors makes no sense and reeks of a knee-jerk reaction. Schultz will still be around to guide and direct where necessary but it seems Johnson is more than capable of running the business. Schultz will be free to direct his attention on the Roasteries concept and how to grow Starbucks in the years to come. The current format of stores works well and doesn't need the daily attention of Schultz. Instead, he'll be focusing on the next evolution of the brand, something that investors should be cheering, not jeering. It is also important to note that presumably Johnson would be better equipped to continue Starbucks' digital transformation, something that has taken center stage in recent years. The work that has already been done with the mobile app and deliveries has been wildly successful and with Johnson's deep, tech-heavy resume, it seems a brilliant choice to put him in charge. Johnson can certainly continue the tech journey in the years to come as Starbucks works to diversify away from its traditional format. The stock is off better than three percent as I write this and to be honest, this is a terrific buying opportunity. Schultz isn't retiring - he isn't going anywhere - he's just refocusing his efforts towards growth instead of operations. Johnson seems more than capable of filling those shoes and not only do I not think this is a negative event, I see a lot of positives. The stock is currently at 23.7 times forward earnings so it isn't cheap, but it never is. And if more weakness ensues from this news, it will be an even stronger buy. The stock has cleared the 200DMA and as long as it doesn't move down to the $56 level or below in the next week or two, the 200DMA will turn up. That would be a welcome development for the bulls to be sure but for now, I'm excited for what's to come in terms of growth and the fact that the market is giving us the gift of a lower stock price for no good reason. Buy here on weakness because the fundamentals are not only intact, but I'd suggest they can strengthen over time as the founder focuses solely on growth. Disclosure: I am/we are long SBUX.

      "text": "Getty Images Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz. \nOutgoing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told CNBC on Friday he hopes Donald Trump addresses social issues that past Republican administrations have ignored. \nSchultz said he doesn't spend a lot of time thinking about how Trump's presidency will impact Starbucks. He said the success of the coffee giant has been executing on strategy and building shareholder value, while balancing profit with \"social impact.\" \nSchultz supported Democrat Hillary Clinton , and there was even speculation during the campaign that he was considering a presidential bid himself. In an interview on \"Squawk Box,\" Schultz said there was a \"lack of respect between the two parties\" over the past year. \n\"[But] I don't think on any level that the brand or what we represent is at odds with the president-elect or his supporters,\" Schultz said. \"Ninety million customers a week are going through Starbucks stores, and I assume many of them voted for Donald Trump.\" \nSchultz announced on Thursday he plans to give up the CEO post and become executive chairman in April. \nStarbucks President and COO Kevin Johnson will take over as chief executive from the 63-year-old Schultz, who said he's going to focus on turning the company's Reserve-branded coffee bars into destination restaurants.

      "text": "Download PDF version 08:15 02 Dec 2016 Howard Schultz will step aside in April 2017, although he will stay with the company as executive chairman The man who will replace Schultz, Kevin Johnson, is credited with the success of Starbucks' mobile app \nThe man who built Starbucks ( NASDAQ:SBUX ) into the world’s largest coffee chain has announced that he will step down as chief executive of the coffee firm for the second time next April. \nHoward Schultz – whose love affair with the Starbucks brand dates back over 30 years – told investors that he will be handing the reins over to his right-hand man, Kevin Johnson. \nShares fell by almost 3% in pre-market trading, with investors concerned about the impact of the man who made the company what it is today departing. \nHe isn’t going far though, and will continue to remain as Starbucks’ executive chairman, focusing on the firm’s premium roaster and the retail store business. \nSchultz – dubbed the Steve Jobs of the coffee world by some commentators – first stepped down as chief executive back in 2000, before returning to the position in 2008 to guide the struggling brand through the financial crisis. \nThe company has opened up more than 25,000 stores around the world since he bought it out for just a few million bucks back in the late ‘80s. \nThe man who will take over from the billionaire next April, Johnson, has been on the Starbucks board for seven years, although he only joined as President last year. \nHe’s often thought of as the ‘tech-savvy’ brains behind the operation having spent more than a decade working for Microsoft , and is also credited with the success of Starbucks’ mobile app. \nSchultz started working for Starbucks back in the early 1980s but grew frustrated at the lack of ambition and left to found his own coffee house. \nA couple of years later, he was offered the chance to buy the Starbucks brand for the relatively small sum of around US$3.8mln, which he duly opted to do. \nThe rest, as they say, is history.

      "text": "As Schultz Steps Down, Next Starbucks CEO Brings Tech Savvy (1) Leslie Patton Dec 02, 2016 8:33 am ET (Bloomberg) -- After turning Starbucks Corp. into the world’s largest coffee chain, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz will hand the reins to a lieutenant who could solidify its role as a technology company. Kevin Johnson, a 33-year veteran of the tech industry who became Starbucks’ chief operating officer last year, will take the helm from Schultz on April 3. The move is a nod to the company’s growing reputation for innovation: It introduced the world’s first successful mobile-payment service, beating out the likes of Apple Inc. and Google Inc., and gets an increasingly large portion of its revenue from that source. Schultz will keep the role of executive chairman at Starbucks, focusing on the rollout of its upscale Reserve brand. “I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz, 63, said on a conference call after the change was announced Thursday. “But Kevin and the team are in charge.” Johnson, who joined the board in 2009, was tapped for the operating chief job after Troy Alstead went on sabbatical. Johnson, 56, previously worked at Microsoft Corp. and Juniper Networks Inc. In 2008, he was named to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, where he served under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Schultz’s Shadow The CEO change jarred investors, who briefly sent the shares down as much as 12 percent, though Johnson was seen as a possible successor since he took the No. 2 job last year. For many shareholders and customers, Schultz has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. And he’s used the company to pursue social causes -- occasionally clumsily -- such as racial strife and sustainability. Schultz will focus on expanding Starbucks’ Reserve Roasteries, a chain of massive coffee houses that provide tastings and other experiences, as well as new Reserve retail stores. The executive has been working to position the Reserve name as Starbucks’ new higher-end brand. Schultz also will continue the company’s “social impact” efforts. As CEO, he’s already pushed to open stores in low-income areas and supported gay marriage. It hasn’t always gone smoothly. Schultz’s idea for employees to discuss race relations with customers was criticized as ham-fisted. Investors weren’t anticipating Schultz’s departure as CEO so soon, though having both executives focus on different parts of the company could have benefits, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus. “The timing of this is a surprise,” she said. “I do think the ‘divide and conquer’ strategy is probably good for the company long-term.” Mobile Transactions Starbucks’ digital and technology prowess has put it ahead of its peers, allowing it to serve more customers faster. Same-store sales rose 5 percent in the Americas region in the most recent quarter. Mobile payments accounted for about 25 percent of U.S. transactions in that period. Starbucks built on its tech leadership with an order-ahead feature, which lets customers select and pay for drinks in advance. They then can pick up the beverages at a shop without waiting in line. Since Johnson became operating chief, Starbucks has rolled out mobile ordering across the U.S. and even tested delivery. The Seattle-based company also is boosting spending on digital ventures, including taking its app and rewards platform to countries such as China. Though shares of Starbucks tumbled immediately after the announcement, they recovered some of that ground. The stock was down 2.4 percent in Germany to the equivalent of $57.13 in trading before U.S. markets opened on Friday. Second Retirement This isn’t Schultz’s first retirement as CEO. After serving in the job from 1987 to 2000 -- punctuated by an initial public offering in 1992 -- he stepped down in 2000. But Schultz returned in 2008 after Starbucks faltered. The company had opened too many locations too quickly and got hit by the financial crisis. Profit plunged. Schultz put Starbucks back on firmer footing. “The difference between then and now couldn’t be greater,” he said on Thursday. “In 2007-2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies and Starbucks was not immune.” The company now has the “strongest leadership team in history,” he said. It’s been speculated that Schultz might make a run for U.S. president, though he’s repeatedly said he has no intention of doing so. While speaking at a conference in New York last month, Schultz said he wouldn’t serve as part of President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet. He also denied rumors of running for president last year in a New York Times opinion piece. It’s probably too early to tell if Schultz has designs on the White House, Bartashus said. “Certainly if he is interested in a political career, he has the next 2 1/2 years to sow those seeds,” she said. “A lot will depend on the first half of the Trump administration.” (Updates with premarket trading in 15th paragraph.) --With assistance from Olga Kharif To contact the reporters on this story: Leslie Patton in Chicago at lpatton5@bloomberg.net, Nick Turner in New York at nturner7@bloomberg.net.

      "title": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation | WPRI 12 Eyewitness News",
      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) In this Wednesday, March 23, 2016, file photo, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz walks in front of a photo of Starbucks baristas, at the coffee company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company’s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.” \n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks’ announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, “race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he’d do again “in a heartbeat.” \n“It was one of my proudest moments,” he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson’s technology background will help ensure Starbucks’ digital initiatives will remain a priority. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "On Thursday, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) announced that Howard Schultz would be stepping down as CEO to take on the role of executive chairman. \nBTIG’s Peter Saleh maintains a Buy rating on the company, with a price target of $64. Executive Change \nMentioning that this executive transition has been a long dreaded one among investors, Saleh stated there was likely to be investor concern regarding this announcement, given the success achieved by Starbucks under Schultz. \n“We tend to dismiss comparisons to Mr. Schultz’s previous retirement as CEO (in 2000, returning in 2008) as we believe the brand, retail offering and customer engagement are all much more established today,” the analyst went on to say, conveying that this would offer some confidence that the near- and long-term prospects of the company would not change. Reasons To Be Positive \nHowever, while the stock might be pressured by investor reaction, Saleh believes Starbucks’ compelling fundamentals and various sales drivers offer sufficient reasons to remain positive. \nThe company also announced that Kevin Johnson , the current chief operating officer and president, would take on the role of CEO. The changes will go into effect on April 3, 2017. \n“In his new role, Mr. Schultz will focus on the company’s emerging retail formats including the Reserve Roastery and Reserve stores and Starbucks’ social impact initiatives. He will also remain chairman,” the analyst noted. \nAt last check in Friday's pre-market, Starbucks shares were down 2.73 percent at $56.91. Latest Ratings for SBUX",

      "text": "Business News | Fri Dec 2, 2016 | 8:44am EST Starbucks' CEO transition unlikely to disrupt growth: analysts Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, speaks during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, Washington March 19, 2014. REUTERS/David Ryder By Sruthi Ramakrishnan \nStarbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to disrupt growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. \nStarbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nThe company's shares were down 2.6 percent in premarket trading as investors worried that the legendary CEO's exit would spell trouble for the company. \nThe last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged. \nSchultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. \n\"Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. \nJohnson's experience of working with Schultz for nearly two years as well as his technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) and Juniper Networks Inc ( JNPR.N ), sets him up for the job, analysts said. \nSchultz said on Thursday that he had personally asked Johnson to take the CEO job, highlighting Johnson's technology chops at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. \nStarbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc ( DNKN.O ) and Panera Bread Co ( PNRA.O ) to follow suit. \nThe mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones. \nStarbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ). \n\"While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note. \nSchultz's plans to \"premiumize\" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive, Herzog added. \nThe outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world. \nThese efforts come as Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. \nThe company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks' birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. \n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Next In Business News",

If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nNEW YORK – Starbucks says CEO Howard Schultz, who transformed the chain into a global coffee brand, is stepping down from that role at the coffee chain that he joined more than 30 years ago. \nThe Seattle-based company announced Thursday that Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will become chief executive as of April 3. \nREAD MORE: Starbucks Canada boosts mental health benefits to $5K per year \nSchultz, currently chairman and CEO, will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. Schultz, 63, is credited with turning around the coffee chain’s fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the company’s popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nThe company’s sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they’ve slowed more recently. \nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 per cent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and has spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. © 2016 Thompson Reuters ",

      "text": "A \nREUTERS: Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to disrupt growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. \nStarbucks Corp said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nThe company's shares were down 2.6 percent in premarket trading as investors worried that the legendary CEO's exit would spell trouble for the company. \nThe last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged. \nSchultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. \n\"Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. \nJohnson's experience of working with Schultz for nearly two years as well as his technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp and Juniper Networks Inc , sets him up for the job, analysts said. \nSchultz said on Thursday that he had personally asked Johnson to take the CEO job, highlighting Johnson's technology chops at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. \nStarbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc and Panera Bread Co to follow suit. \nThe mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones. \nStarbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp . \n\"While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note. \nSchultz's plans to \"premiumize\" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive, Herzog added. \nThe outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world. \nThese efforts come as Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. \nThe company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks' birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. \n(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) - Reuters",

      "text": "Starbucks’ CEO Who Had Famed “Blanket” Story with Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel... Starbucks’ CEO Who Had Famed “Blanket” Story with Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel Steps Down December 2, 2016 0 \nStarbucks announced Thursday that Howard Schultz plans to step aside as chief executive to focus on new initiatives at the coffee giant, an abrupt change for a man widely praised for putting a once adrift company back on track and guiding it through a period of rapid global expansion. \nSchultz famously related the following story involving Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel, rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Mir Yerushalayim: \nWhen I was in Israel , I went to Me’ah She’arim, the traditionally Orthodox area within Jerusalem . Along with a group of businessmen I was with, I had the opportunity to have an audience with Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, the head of the Mir Yeshiva seminary there. I had never heard of him and didn’t know anything about him. We went into his study and waited ten to 15 minutes for him. Finally, the doors opened. \nWhat we did not know was that Rabbi Finkel was severely afflicted with Parkinson’s disease. He sat down at the head of the table, and, naturally, our inclination was to look away. We didn’t want to embarrass him. \nHe asked, “Who can tell me what the lesson of the Holocaust is?” We were all looking away, and we heard this big bang on the table: “Gentlemen, look at me, and look at me right now.” Now his speech affliction was worse than his physical shaking. It was really hard to listen to him and watch him. He said, “I have only a few minutes for you because I know you’re all busy American businessmen.” You know, just a little dig there. \nThen he asked, “Who can tell me what the lesson of the Holocaust is?” He called on one guy, who didn’t know what to do — it was like being called on in the fifth grade without the answer. And the guy says something benign like, “We will never, ever forget…” And the rabbi completely dismisses him. I felt terrible for the guy until I realized the rabbi was getting ready to call on someone else. All of us were sort of under the table, looking away — you know, please, not me. He did not call me. I was sweating. He called on another guy, who had such a fantastic answer: “We will never, ever again be a victim or bystander.” \nThe rabbi said, “You guys just don’t get it. Okay, gentlemen, let me tell you the essence of the human spirit. \n“As you know, during the Holocaust, the people were transported in the worst possible, inhumane way by railcar. They thought they were going to a work camp. We all know they were going to a death camp. “After hours and hours in this inhumane corral with no light, no bathroom, cold, they arrived at the camps. The doors were swung wide open, and they were blinded by the light. Men were separated from women, mothers from daughters, fathers from sons. They went off to the bunkers to sleep. \n\n“As they went into the area to sleep, only one person was given a blanket for every six. The person who received the blanket, when he went to bed, had to decide, ‘Am I going to push the blanket to the five other people who did not get one, or am I going to pull it toward myself to stay warm?’” \nAnd Rabbi Finkel says, “It was during this defining moment that we learned the power of the human spirit, because we pushed the blanket to five others.” \nAnd with that, he stood up and said, “Take your blanket. Take it back to America and push it to five other people.” \nSchultz, who rarely shied away from putting Starbucks in the center of public policy debates, said he will stay on as chairman as he turns the CEO reins over to Kevin Johnson, the coffee chain’s chief operating officer. His sudden move revived speculation that he may one day try his hand at politics. \nIn a conference call with investors, Schultz declared that Johnson, with his background in the technology industry that includes a 16-year stint at Microsoft, “is better prepared to be the CEO on a go-forward basis than I am.” \nStarbucks, like virtually every other retailer, is trying to adapt to an increasingly digital world. Starbucks has had unusual success at it, developing a widely used mobile payment app that has led to many headlines about how the coffee chain is transforming into a technology company. In tapping Johnson as chief executive, Starbucks is making a statement about its intentions to stay out in front in the digital realm. \nWhen the leadership handoff takes place in April, Schultz will turn his focus to an ambitious project to make major brands out of two relatively new concepts in the Starbucks portfolio: Roasteries, sprawling facilities where the company roasts and packages premium coffees and offers a tasting-room-style experience, and Starbucks Reserve, cafes that serve the fancy coffee made at the roasteries. Schultz said the company has plans for at least 20 roasteries and 1,000 Reserve stores worldwide. \nSchultz has been in his second stint as CEO job for nearly nine years – he initially stepped down in 2000 and then famously came back in early 2008. Interestingly, the first time he stepped away he also did so to take on a more strategic, high-level role: He became the company’s “chief global strategist.” \nOn Thursday’s call with investors, Schultz sought to emphasize that this time would be different. \nIn talking about his return as chief executive in 2008, amid a national financial crisis, Schultz said that the “management team at that time just did not have the capability to navigate through that difficult period.” \nNow, however, he said he believes the leadership team is better equipped to fend for itself. And, he added, “on a personal level, I don’t think I was as prepared then as I am now.” \nWall Street has long been a big fan of Schultz. After news of the transition broke, Starbucks stock sank nearly 4 percent in after-hours trading. \nThe hallmark of Schultz’s leadership of Starbucks has long been his willingness to speak out about societal issues more than most CEOs of companies of its size. \nIn 2013, Schultz told an investor he could sell his shares if he didn’t like the company’s stance on same-sex marriage. He got credit for company programs such as offering college education benefits and promoting the hiring of young, minority workers and veterans. In March, he put together a series of online videos that offered feel-good lessons on civic engagement. \nOther efforts didn’t work so well, such as his “Race Together” campaign to get baristas and customers speaking about race, which many saw as tone deaf, a company going one step too far in its effort to bring political values into the workplace. \nThat’s led some to question whether Schultz has aims on higher office. In March, he made some presidential-sounding remarks at the company’s annual stockholder meeting. Speaking in lofty terms about the lack of civility and leadership in the country, he said that “there are moments when I’ve had a hard time recognizing who we are and who we are becoming. We are facing a test not only of our character but of our morality as a people.” \nHe seemed to be alluding to the divisiveness of the 2016 presidential campaign. “What is the role and responsibility of all of us as citizens? We must do everything we can to reclaim and reimagine the American Dream and fill the reservoir back up – not with cynicism but with optimism, not with despair but with possibility, not with division but with unity,” he said. \nIn an op-ed in the New York Times in August, Schultz said he has “no intention of entering the presidential fray.” \nAsked again about it in an interview on CNN recently, he didn’t entirely rule out a run, saying: “I’m still a young man. Let’s see what the future holds.” Later, Schultz added, “I determined for myself that at this time, I can do more as a private citizen and as the CEO of a public company to advance the causes that I think are important for the country and for our company.” \nIn the Thursday call with investors, Schultz said: “I’m not leaving the company. I’m here every single day.” A spokeswoman for Starbucks said Schultz has no plans to run for political office. \nJohnson has worked as the company’s chief operating officer since 2015 and has been a member of the board of directors since 2009. \nPreviously, Johnson was chief executive of Juniper Networks and served on the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee. \nMatzav.com with (c) 2016, The Washington Post · Sarah Halzack, Jena McGregor \n{ Matzav.com }",

      "title": "Starbucks' CEO transition unlikely to disrupt growth - analysts",
      "text": "Share By Sruthi Ramakrishnan (Reuters) - Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to disrupt growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. The company's shares were down 2.6 percent in premarket trading as investors worried that the legendary CEO's exit would spell trouble for the company. The last time Schultz stepped down as CEO - in 2000 - the company's shares had plunged. Schultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. \"Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. Johnson's experience of working with Schultz for nearly two years as well as his technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N), sets him up for the job, analysts said. Schultz said on Thursday that he had personally asked Johnson to take the CEO job, highlighting Johnson's technology chops at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. Starbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) and Panera Bread Co (PNRA.O) to follow suit. The mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful - a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones. Starbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N). \"While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note. Schultz's plans to \"premiumize\" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive, Herzog added. The outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world. These efforts come as Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. The company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle - Starbucks' birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. (Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Reblog",

      "title": "Johnson Named Starbucks CEO; Schultz To Focus On Roasteries 12/02/2016",
      "text": "Starbucks’ founder-in-effect, chairman and chief executive Howard Schultz will hand over the CEO position to COO Kevin Johnson in April to “shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve retail store format and the company’s social impact initiatives,” the company announced yesterday. \nThe game-changing visionary “could be considered the Steve Jobs of coffee,” writes the New York Times ’ Andrew Ross Sorkin. “This is a big day for me,” Schultz tells Sorkin in an interview. “I love the company as much as I love my family.” \nBut Schultz says it’s “the right time to hand the keys to Mr. Johnson, whom he described as being ‘better equipped’ to ‘run the company than I am,’ ticking off a list of Mr. Johnson’s operational talents, and saying that he wanted to ‘relinquish the role and responsibility to the right person,’” Sorkin continues.\nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 and was named COO in January 2015. Previously, he was CEO of Juniper Networks and president of the platforms division at Microsoft, Catherine Garcia reports for The Week .\nThe financial markets were wary of the transition, with shares off more than 3% in premarket trading today. \nSchultz had previously stepped down as CEO in 2000 but returned in 2008 “to guide the company through the financial crisis,” reports Lindsay Whipp in Financial Times . Since then, Starbucks’ margin on earnings before interest and tax has tripled to 18.1% and shares have risen nearly eightfold.\nSchultz isn’t exactly retiring to the veranda with a grande Iced Caffè Latte.\n“Schultz said the company has plans for at least 20 roasteries and 1,000 Reserve stores worldwide,” report Sarah Halzack and Jena McGregor for the Washington Post .\n“Starbucks’s move toward high-end coffee, a project referred to internally as ‘Siren Works’ — after the mythological creature in the coffee chain’s logo — is aimed at refreshing its brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia, as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin’ Donuts, which has been introducing more drinks such as cold-brewed coffee,” reports Julie Jargon for the Wall Street Journal .\nSchultz tells Jargon: “This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.” Jargon writes that “the big bet is based solely on Mr. Schultz’s instinct that it is the right thing to do. ‘There was no research,’ he said. Convincing his board and senior management team to create another brand wasn’t easy.”\nBut his POV does tend to prevail, and few doubt it will continue to.\n“Charles Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware and a corporate governance expert, said the move appeared to be a ‘title swap’ as the executive chairman is ‘still running the show,’ writes FT ’s Whipp. \nOthers, however, speculate that Schultz has his eye on a second career. \n“During an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and he did not rule out running for office himself at some point. In his message to employees Thursday, he said he planned to extend his ‘focus on our social impact agenda,’” the Associated Press reports . Schultz “has made Starbucks a vocal part of the national conversation on issues like gun violence, gay rights, race relations, veterans rights and student debt,” points out the NYT ’s Sorkin. \nThe more than 25,000 Starbucks outlets around the world, meanwhile, face challenges that the tech-oriented Johnson may be more adept at addressing. \n“Starbucks, like virtually every other retailer, is trying to adapt to an increasingly digital world. Starbucks has had unusual success at it, developing a widely used mobile payment app that has led to many headlines about how the coffee chain is transforming into a technology company,” point out the WP ’s Halzack and McGregor. “In tapping Johnson as chief executive, Starbucks is making a statement about its intentions to stay out in front in the digital realm.”\nBut the competition is undoubtedly getting more fierce.\n“Just based on casual observations in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco: The local coffee shops that do their own roasting appear to be flourishing,” writes Herb Greenberg, a partner at Pacific Square Research, on LinkedIn. \nBut “I believe Schultz will go down as one of the great CEOs, period. And one thing is for sure: Creating a concept is one thing; executing is another. He did both. Never ever count him out,” Greenberg concludes. “And don't assume that just because he's 63 he's headed out to the pasture.”\nHear, hear!",

      "text": "Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nWhy 'basic' is bad for Starbucks Abha Bhattarai With 24,000 locations across the world, Starbucks has become an everyday stop for millions.\nBut that ubiquity could now be its problem.\n\"Starbucks is now competing with chains like Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's ,\" Business Insider proclaimed this week. \"It has gotten, in a sense, too basic.\"\n\"Basic,\"...\nWith 24,000 locations across the world, Starbucks has become an everyday stop for millions.\nBut that ubiquity could now be its problem.\n\"Starbucks is now competing with chains like Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's ,\" Business Insider proclaimed this week. \"It has gotten, in a sense, too basic.\"\n\"Basic,\"...\n(Abha Bhattarai) Schultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.\nAssociated Press\nCopyright © 2016, Hartford Courant Howard D.

CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday some of his initial disappointment about Howard Schultz 's decision to step down as Starbucks CEO has been alleviated. \n\"I feel better,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk Box \" after the chief executive, in an exclusive interview with CNBC, expressed confidence in his successor, Kevin Johnson. \n\"When I heard the news,\" Cramer said, \"I was immediately very disappointed because I love what Howard [has] done. He is iconic. But what Howard did subsequently in our interview is state, 'Look, this is how it's going to go. I'm still very much involved, but we do have technology problems.' Kevin's better than that, better at that than he is.\" \nOn Thursday, Schultz said he hand over the CEO post to Johnson, the current president and COO of Starbucks. The announcement surprised investors and sent Starbucks's stock tumbling. It was down about 2 percent in early trading Friday. \nSchultz said Johnson was \"well-equipped\" to take the company to a higher level.\n\n\"What was clear was Kevin's ability,\" Schultz said. \"He is much better prepared to manage the global operations of the company than I am at this stage.\" \n\nBefore joining Starbucks, Johnson worked closely with Steve Ballmer at Microsoft and was CEO of Juniper Networks.\n\n—CNBC's Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Jobless Rate Sinks To 4.6% As Labor Market Tightens; 178,000 Jobs Added (Investor's Business Daily) \nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) announced Thursday chief operating officer Kevin Johnson would replace Howard Schultz as the CEO of the company, effective April 3, 2017. \nBernstein’s Sara H. Senatore maintains an Outperform rating on the company with a price target of $65. Change In Leadership \nStarbucks also announced that Schultz would be appointed the executive chairman . \n“While the timing was earlier than we expected, we believe the reorganization announcement in July 2016 set the stage for the leadership change,” Senatore mentioned. \nThe company earlier announced Schultz would focus more on global strategy, innovation and store development while transitioning some of his direct reports to Johnson. \n“Johnson appears to have been an important behind-the-scenes contributor to Starbuck's [ sic ] post-recession turnaround, and his background in technology should position him well as SBUX continues its transition to a technology-led company,” the analyst went on to say. Business Momentum To Continue \nSenatore believes Johnson’s prior experience with tech companies will prove helpful as Starbucks continues to focus on its digital/loyalty platform. \nThe analyst expressed optimism that this announcement suggested business momentum was expected to persist. \n“We think the focus on Roasteries and Reserve will – along with technological innovation — allow SBUX to stay ahead of coffee competitors,” Senatore added. \nAt last check in Friday's pre-market session, Starbucks shares were down 3.26 percent at $56.60.

      "text": "Posted December 2, 2016 08:20 am By Associated Press Starbucks: Howard Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation \nIn this Wednesday, March 23, 2016, file photo, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz walks in front of a photo of Starbucks baristas, at the coffee company’s annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. (Ted S. Warren/Associated Press) \nIn this Wednesday, March 23, 2016, file photo, Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer of Starbucks Corp., holds up one of the coffee company’s prepaid Visa debit cards, at the company’s annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. (Ted S. Warren/Associated Press) \nNEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company’s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.” \n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks’ announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, “race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he’d do again “in a heartbeat.” \n“It was one of my proudest moments,” he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson’s technology background will help ensure Starbucks’ digital initiatives will remain a priority.

      "text": "Share \nStarbucks announced a new leadership structure on Thursday (Dec. 1) that it said will help to usher in a new wave a digital growth. As of April 3, 2017, the company’s longtime CEO and Chairman Howard Shultz will step down from his role and will be replaced by Starbucks President and COO Kevin Johnson. \nWith this change, Shultz will take on the role of executive chairman and focus on retail innovation and accelerating the global growth of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries and retail stores, the company confirmed. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the board. \n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination,” Schultz said in a statement. “The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUVs and ROI, both in the U.S. and around the world.” \n“As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson — our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years — has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer,” he added. “This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nJohnson has held the role of COO since March 2015 and been a Starbucks board member since 2009. During that time, he has led the expansion of the company’s global operating businesses and its supply chain, marketing, HR, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. \n“Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team. Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks, and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,” Johnson said. \n“It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron, and I consider it a privilege to work side by side with Howard, our world-class board of directors and a very talented leadership team. Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.”",

      "text": "Howard Schultz: Starbucks is not 'at odds with Trump or his supporters' Friday Dec 2, 2016 at 8:55 AM Due to Schultz's support of Clinton, there have been a number of protests against Starbucks including customers asking for Trump's name to be written on their cups. Bob Bryan/Business Insider \nOutgoing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz struck a conciliatory tone over the election of Donald Trump in an interview on Friday morning. \nSchultz was a vocal supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the campaign and said he was \"stunned\" by the election of Trump in a letter to employees the day after the election. He also stepped down as CEO of Starbucks on Thursday, transitioning to executive chairman. \n\"I don't think on any level that Starbucks or the brand is at odds with Trump or his supporters,\" said Schultz, on CNBC. \"We feel very strongly as a company is to demonstrate a level of social impact to the community th at we serve.\" \nDue to Schultz's support of Clinton, there have been a number of protests against Starbucks including customers asking for Trump's name to be written on their cups. \n\"We have been concerned with a number of social issues that have not been addressed by Republicans in the past, but we hope that the new administration will address them,\" Schultz told CNBC. \nThroughout the line of questioning, Schultz expressed optimism for the new administration saying \"we all want the president-elect to do well.\" \nAdditionally, Schultz was asked about the recent rally in stocks since the election of Trump as the market prices in possible tax cuts for corporations and fiscal stimulus from the administration. \n\"I need to separate the stock of Starbucks from the Trump administration and the rest of the stock market.\" said Schultz, saying that the unique value of Starbucks had driven the company's post-election surge. \nFinally, Schultz was asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin if he was panning a run for office as some have speculated he might following his change in roles. \n\"I am all in at Starbucks and that is my focus at this time,\" replied Schultz.

Kevin Johnson, who's currently Chief Operations Officer, will replace Schultz as CEO in April 2017. \nLittle known fact about Schultz: he wasn't an original founder of Starbucks. He started out as Marketing Director at the chain in 1982. After failing to convince the owners to introduce Italian-style espresso drinks, he defected and opened his own store. In 1986, the original Starbucks owners sold Schultz their retail units, allowing him to rename his own shop 'Starbucks'. The rest is history. \nOriginally, Schultz only allowed whole milk in stores. In 2007, due to overwhelming demand, Starbucks switched to using 2% by default. \nFollow Kai Ryssdal at @kairyssdal .

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters  59   \n(Dec 2): Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to disrupt growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. \nStarbucks Corp said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nThe company's shares were down 2.6% in premarket trading as investors worried that the legendary CEO's exit would spell trouble for the company. \nThe last time Schultz stepped down as CEO — in 2000 — the company's shares had plunged. \nSchultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. \n\"Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. \nJohnson's experience of working with Schultz for nearly two years as well as his technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp and Juniper Networks Inc, sets him up for the job, analysts said. \nSchultz said on Thursday that he had personally asked Johnson to take the CEO job, highlighting Johnson's technology chops at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. \nStarbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc and Panera Bread Co to follow suit. \nThe mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful — a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones. \nStarbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of least 7% since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp. \n\"While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note. \nSchultz's plans to \"premiumize\" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive, Herzog added. \nThe outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world. \nThese efforts come as Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. \nThe company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle — Starbucks' birthplace - to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo.",

      "text": "PR Starbucks CEO resigning, shifting focus to more upscale outlets Howard Schultz, who will pass the baton to COO Kevin Johnson, plans to develop its premium-coffee stores. Despite an upbeat call to investors, shares tumbled. By Beki Winchel   Tweet Starbucks is shaking things up—but not by changing the ingredients in its pumpkin spice latte. \nOn Thursday, the company’s chief executive, Howard Schultz, announced that he will step down on April 3. Starbucks’ chief operating officer, Kevin Johnson, will take over. \nSchultz will stay on as executive chairman and “will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries around the world,” the company said in a statement . \nIn a call with investors and reporters, Schultz further explained his vision for the company’s high-end coffee stores: Since its opening two years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become widely recognized as the world’s most immersive, coffee-forward retail experience. Executives from premier global retailers like Apple, Nike and Zara have shared with me their view that the Roastery delivers the best retail experience – in or out of coffee – that they have ever encountered. Our Roastery is attracting customers and visitors to Seattle alike, and casting a bright halo across the entire Starbucks global brand and ecosystem. With the Roastery, we introduced into the coffee category a previously unattained level of premiumization. Its success is unparalled, last year achieving a comp sales increase of 24% and delivering a ticket that is four times the ticket of a typical Starbucks store. The Roastery has become a learning laboratory for breakthrough innovation and experiential design and a beacon for the next wave of Starbucks global growth and evolution. Going forward, we will open at least 20 Roasteries around the world, six by the end of calendar 2019 alone. At the same time, elements of the Roastery are forming the basis of the 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores we will be opening around the world in the years ahead. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported : Starbucks’s move toward high-end coffee, a project referred to internally as “Siren Works”—after the mythological creature in the coffee chain’s logo—is aimed at refreshing its brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia, as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin’ Donuts , which has been introducing more drinks such as cold-brewed coffee. \nExecutives’ desire to be creative \nIs Schultz’ focus on building Starbucks’ high-end offerings about more than just boosting the coffee chain’s bottom line? \nForbes’ contributor Richard Kestenbaum posited : I don't mean to disparage Starbucks, they created a new category in America, changed consumer habits and are enormously profitable. Those are all about the hardest things to do in business for any company. But when you look at where they are today and where the world is going, it's not surprising that a senior person in a dominant retail company would want to do something more innovative. \nKestenbaum continued: … New, creative retailers are much more like professional service organizations than they are like the old vertical structure with strict reporting lines and responsibilities. When you structure organizations horizontally instead of vertically and you get good people in the company, something amazing happens: creativity. And thus it becomes possible to build a big organization with creative people who can not only be successful and happy in their jobs but they can also offer consumers much more interesting products and environments. \n“One of the characteristics of having a horizontally-oriented organization chart is that it can't be grafted on to a traditional company,” Kestenbaum wrote. “It just won't fit and the two can't coexist.” \nThe move’s effect on Starbucks’ image \nIn his call on Thursday, Schultz gave Johnson a glowing recommendation: Kevin brings to the CEO role an unparalleled understanding of the market dynamics and strategic choices that have driven Starbucks to become one of the world’s most recognized and respected companies and brand. We share a passion for customer-focused innovation and a commitment to preserving Starbucks heritage. Our complementary backgrounds – my entrepreneurial journey building Starbucks and Kevin’s decades spent scaling global businesses – will continue to help Starbucks navigate this new period of worldwide growth and innovation. Kevin is, in every respect, a true servant leader and a person whose courage, compassion and empathy model the very characteristics we want for all partners and all our leaders. His approach to solving complex problems and his ability to bring out the best in people will continue to make all of us at Starbucks better in the same context that he has made me better. \nHowever, the endorsement didn’t calm investors, who sent shares tumbling after the announcement. \nThe reason for the anxiety lies in Schultz’ embodiment of Starbucks’ thriving reputation and business success. \nBloomberg reported : The CEO change jarred investors, who briefly sent the shares down as much as 12 percent, though Johnson was seen as a possible successor since he took the No. 2 job last year. For many shareholders and customers, Schultz has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. And he’s used the company to pursue social causes -- occasionally clumsily -- such as racial strife and sustainability. \n“I can’t try to be Howard. I’m not Howard,” Johnson told broadcasters on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” \nPerhaps that’s not such a bad thing—once confidence in Johnson’s leadership has been instilled. \nOn Friday morning, Starbucks’ shares were down 2.39 percent in pre-market trading.",

      "text": " count=\"416\" data-total-count=\"416\">Donald J. Trump has managed to keep about half of the 2,000 jobs at Carrier that Indiana stood to lose, and there is more to come , he said. While touring the factory floor at the heating and cooling company on Thursday, Mr. Trump indicated that he intended to follow through on pledges to impose stiff tariffs on imports from companies that move production overseas and ship their products back to the United States. The approach he took to the Carrier deal, however, was akin to intercepting a driver on his way to his car in a parking garage and trying to persuade him to stay parked longer, Justin Wolfers writes .\nBut there is a reason parking businesses don’t do that. There are many more potential customers outside the garage, and they can attract them by offering a more convenient experience.\nA parking garage stays full and an economy stays healthy only if they are constantly refreshed, Mr. Wolfers says. It remains to be seen how Mr. Trump might focus resources on the potential entrepreneurs who could open businesses and refresh the economy.\n Mr. Trump’s embrace of the Wall Street elite has already been noted and, indeed, Goldman Sachs executives do have a tradition of taking leading roles in public service, but another theme in his cabinet is a lack of directly relevant policy experience. There are exceptions, but Mr. Trump seems to be betting that nuts-and-bolts experience running government agencies just doesn’t matter, Neil Irwin writes .\nIt seems that the swamp being drained is the one inhabited by wonkish technocrats who have devoted their careers to the details of policy making.\nSign Up for the DealBook Newsletter Every weekday, twice a day, get the news driving the markets and the latest on mergers and acquisitions.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy In Mexico, the uncertainty that has rattled the country’s economy since Mr. Trump’s election has increased after the governor of the central bank, Agustín Carstens, said he would leave next July . Mr. Carstens will leave the Bank of Mexico, where he has been governor for seven years, to lead the Bank for International Settlements, which acts as a bank of central banks.\nQuotation of the Day “It’s unbelievable to us in Italy that we’d be comparing Berlusconi to an American president.”\n— Oreste Pollicino, a professor of constitutional law at Bocconi University in Milan. Silvio Berlusconi , who served nine years as Italy’s prime minister, faced calls to divest his business empire, just as Mr. Trump does now. But he retained majority ownership and installed his offspring in oversight positions.\nStarbucks Chief to Step Down Howard Schultz, who some might consider the Steve Jobs of coffee, will step down as chief executive of Starbucks next year.\nHe will hand over the reins at the word’s largest coffee business to Kevin Johnson, the company president and a longtime board member.\nThe move is likely to renew speculation about whether Mr. Schultz plans to enter politics. He is an outspoken Democrat and has made his company a vocal part of the national conversation on issues like gun violence, gay rights and race relations.\nThe company had already been signaling its intent to carry out a succession plan. Mr. Johnson was given oversight of day-to-day operations in the summer and he has been on a listening tour with employees over the last year.\nComing Up The Labor Department will publish data on hiring and unemployment for November. The report is expected to show 175,000 jobs added and an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. A very weak number could affect the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates in December.",

      "text": "It’s the end of an era for the global corner coffeeshop: Howard Schultz is stepping down as Starbucks’ CEO. And investors are uneasy about it. \nShultz announced the move Thursday in a statement released right after the stock market’s official trading session ended. He will take on the title of executive chairman, while Starbucks President and COO Kevin Johnson will assume the CEO role. Both men held a conference call to reassure investors that, far from disrupting Starbucks’ long history of success, the moves will pave the way for future growth. \nShultz will remain at Starbucks, but will focus on building out new categories of stores , such as the high-end, 15,000 square-foot Roastery it opened in Seattle. Johnson will focus on running the 25,000 stores Starbucks has in 75 countries, drawing on his experience at Microsoft and Juniper Networks to employ technology aimed at keeping customers coming to its coffeeshops. \nSo iconic is Shultz as a retail CEO, however, that Starbucks shares dropped 4% on the announcement. Nor did the stock recover much after repeated assurances from both executives that this was “an evolutionary process” that has been in the works for several months as Starbucks charted out a five-year strategic plan. Evolutionary or not, it came as a surprise to investors. \n“I’m here every single day,” Shultz said. “And I’m going contribute to what I think is a significant growth opportunity of a new franchise within Starbucks.” For his part, Johnson underscored he won’t be running Starbucks alone. “Over the last two years, we’ve worked much more closely together,” he said. “Our offices are connected. We talk several times a day. We brainstorm.” \nRead more: TIME’s 2015 cover story about outgoing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz \nShultz joined Starbucks in 1982 after working for a Swedish housewares company and noticing the a small Seattle store was buying more cone filters than anyone. He bought Starbucks in 1987, expanded into other cities and took the company public in 1992. In 2000, having brought the company to $2.2 billion in annual revenue, Schultz stepped down. \nEight years later, Schultz returned as CEO after the stock entered a prolonged slump that saw its value decline 80% over a two-and-a-half year period. Once Schultz returned, Starbucks’ stock went on a tear that pushed it to new heights, rising more than 500%. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq Over the past year, however, that rally has stalled, with the stock down 9% from its record high of $64 a share. Schultz says retailers in general are undergoing a “seismic shift away from bricks and mortar toward online retailing.” Starbucks isn’t immune to the loss of foot traffic, which is why he’s embarking on a new kind of coffeeshop designed to become what he calls “relevant consumer destinations.” \nStarbucks plans to open as many as 30 Roastery stores in coming years, including one in New York and another in Shanghai, which feature on-site roasting and $12 cups of coffee. Schultz said the Roastery stores will feature baked goods from the Italian restaurant Princi as well as “a broader category” that Starbucks will unveil at its investor day on Dec. 7. \nThe company will also build as many as 1,000 smaller stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand, which will offer high-end coffee without the on-site roasting, while remodeling many older stores to include Reserve espresso bars. Johnson, meanwhile, will work to improve customer engagement with initiatives like loyalty programs, app-driven orders and digital payments. \nGiven Schultz’ lifelong entrepreneurial bent, the plan the company has outlined for growth into high-end stores makes sense. The chief concerns are that the new stores could cannibalize business from its traditional stores and that pulling Schultz away from a $21 billion enterprise could lead the stock lower. \nOne analyst on today’s call called Schultz a “master merchant” and asked whether “that merchant gene and level of entrepreneurial spirit” would remain in the managerial team. Another asked why this changing of the guard would be different from the last time Schultz stepped down 16 years ago. \n“The differences between then and now couldn’t be greater,” Schultz said. “I don’t think there’s ever been a time in the company’s history with a pipeline of product innovation.” For now, investors don’t seem so sure. The new roles for Johnson and Schultz may prove to be just what Starbucks needs for its next chapter. But don’t change the fact that there is a difference between a capable CEO and an iconic one. ",

      "title": "What Starbucks’ New CEO Means For Your Daily Coffee Fix",
      "text": "\nIt’s the end of an era for the global corner coffeeshop: Howard Schultz is stepping down as Starbucks’ CEO. And investors are uneasy about it. \nShultz announced the move Thursday in a statement released right after the stock market’s official trading session ended. He will take on the title of executive chairman, while Starbucks President and COO Kevin Johnson will assume the CEO role. Both men held a conference call to reassure investors that, far from disrupting Starbucks’ long history of success, the moves will pave the way for future growth. \nShultz will remain at Starbucks, but will focus on building out new categories of stores , such as the high-end, 15,000 square-foot Roastery it opened in Seattle. Johnson will focus on running the 25,000 stores Starbucks has in 75 countries, drawing on his experience at Microsoft and Juniper Networks to employ technology aimed at keeping customers coming to its coffeeshops. \nSo iconic is Shultz as a retail CEO, however, that Starbucks shares dropped 4% on the announcement. Nor did the stock recover much after repeated assurances from both executives that this was “an evolutionary process” that has been in the works for several months as Starbucks charted out a five-year strategic plan. Evolutionary or not, it came as a surprise to investors. \n“I’m here every single day,” Shultz said. “And I’m going contribute to what I think is a significant growth opportunity of a new franchise within Starbucks.” For his part, Johnson underscored he won’t be running Starbucks alone. “Over the last two years, we’ve worked much more closely together,” he said. “Our offices are connected. We talk several times a day. We brainstorm.” \nRead more: TIME’s 2015 cover story about outgoing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz \nShultz joined Starbucks in 1982 after working for a Swedish housewares company and noticing the a small Seattle store was buying more cone filters than anyone. He bought Starbucks in 1987, expanded into other cities and took the company public in 1992. In 2000, having brought the company to $2.2 billion in annual revenue, Schultz stepped down. \nEight years later, Schultz returned as CEO after the stock entered a prolonged slump that saw its value decline 80% over a two-and-a-half year period. Once Schultz returned, Starbucks’ stock went on a tear that pushed it to new heights, rising more than 500%. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq Over the past year, however, that rally has stalled, with the stock down 9% from its record high of $64 a share. Schultz says retailers in general are undergoing a “seismic shift away from bricks and mortar toward online retailing.” Starbucks isn’t immune to the loss of foot traffic, which is why he’s embarking on a new kind of coffeeshop designed to become what he calls “relevant consumer destinations.” \nStarbucks plans to open as many as 30 Roastery stores in coming years, including one in New York and another in Shanghai, which feature on-site roasting and $12 cups of coffee. Schultz said the Roastery stores will feature baked goods from the Italian restaurant Princi as well as “a broader category” that Starbucks will unveil at its investor day on Dec. 7. \nThe company will also build as many as 1,000 smaller stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand, which will offer high-end coffee without the on-site roasting, while remodeling many older stores to include Reserve espresso bars. Johnson, meanwhile, will work to improve customer engagement with initiatives like loyalty programs, app-driven orders and digital payments. \nGiven Schultz’ lifelong entrepreneurial bent, the plan the company has outlined for growth into high-end stores makes sense. The chief concerns are that the new stores could cannibalize business from its traditional stores and that pulling Schultz away from a $21 billion enterprise could lead the stock lower. \nOne analyst on today’s call called Schultz a “master merchant” and asked whether “that merchant gene and level of entrepreneurial spirit” would remain in the managerial team. Another asked why this changing of the guard would be different from the last time Schultz stepped down 16 years ago. \n“The differences between then and now couldn’t be greater,” Schultz said. “I don’t think there’s ever been a time in the company’s history with a pipeline of product innovation.” For now, investors don’t seem so sure. The new roles for Johnson and Schultz may prove to be just what Starbucks needs for its next chapter. But don’t change the fact that there is a difference between a capable CEO and an iconic one. \n",

      "text": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation Candice Choi and Michael Sisak, Associated Press Updated 5:32 am, Friday, December 2, 2016 \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz will step down in 2017. Media: Fortune NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson , who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Since returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Photo: Ted S.

Warren, AP Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Investor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. During a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. Schultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" FindTheCompany | Graphiq \"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. In a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. Over the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. Johnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.
