Post to Facebook Colts punter roasts Terrelle Pryor over claims he ripped off celebration Got him.  //usat.ly/2gaATKD   Join the Nation's Conversation   Colts punter roasts Terrelle Pryor over claims he ripped off celebration Nate Scott , USA TODAY Sports 9:22 a.m.   19 Shares \n(Photo: AP) \nThe Colts were beaten pretty badly by the Steelers on Thanksgiving, but they did have one highlight - Colts punter Pat McAfee tossing a 35-yard completion on a fake punt and celebrating with the Conor McGregor dance. \nBrowns receiver Terrelle Pryor (himself no stranger to being a bright spot in a losing effort) apparently saw McAfee's celebration, and thought he was cribbing from another punter who likes to celebrate - the Raiders' Marquette King . \nMcAfee took exception to this, and (lightly) roasted Pryor with a very good joke. Child please.. I've been doing this since you were still a quarterback https://t.co/naxpnMTIr9 — Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) November 28, 2016 \nIn terms of roastings, it's pretty good, because he called out Pryor for his lack of knowledge without hurting him too bad. The guy was a quarterback a few years ago, and now he's an awesome wide receiver, so good for Pryor. Anyway that's what's going on in the NFL internet this morning.

      "text": "Now that the holiday season is here again, so is a familiar holiday scam.\nPolice are warning people about the “secret sister gift exchange” currently making the rounds on social media, including Facebook.\nThe secret sister gift exchange promises that if you buy one $10 gift for someone and add your name to a list, you’ll get between six and 36 gifts in the mail.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video Authorities say it's too good to be true and illegal.\nCaitlin Coller of Danville, Pennsylvania, was tagged in a Facebook post.\n\"At first when I read it, I thought it was pretty cool,\" said Coller. \"The girl who tagged me in it is pretty reliable and is really nice, so it seemed like something she came up with. It seemed like this original thing.\"\nBut it's not an original thing. According to investigators, the secret sister gift exchange is a scam.\n\n\"You have no idea who you're giving that information to, so ultimately what you're setting yourself up for is identity theft,\" said Danville Police Chief Eric Gill.\nThe post asks you to mail a gift to someone on a list add your name and address to the list and you'll get gifts in return.\nChief Gill says it's illegal. The United States Post Office considers this a chain letter which is a form of gambling.\n\"Sending your private information to somewhere where you have no idea where it's going to go is very foolish,\" the chief said.\nPolice in Tennessee also posted a warning to their Facebook page this year:\n\nThe secret sister gift exchange was popular in 2015 and is making the rounds again.\nRebecca Kurtz of Lewisburg saw it on Facebook but thought it was questionable.\n\"My cousin has it on hers and I thought, OK, I'm not going to do it, though, because I don't know half the people.\"\nIf you want to do a gift exchange, the chief suggests doing one through work or with friends you personally know.\n\"It would be easier to go down to the local store and purchase something for $10 and wrap it and give it to them.\"\nIf you are invited to take part in the secret sister gift exchange, you can report it to Facebook.\nU.S. Postal Inspection Service has this guidance:\n“There’s at least one problem with chain letters. They’re illegal if they request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants. Chain letters are a form of gambling, and sending them through the mail (or delivering them in person or by computer, but mailing money to participate) violates Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302, the Postal Lottery Statute. (Chain letters that ask for items of minor value, like picture postcards or recipes, may be mailed, since such items are not things of value within the meaning of the law.”\n",

      "text": "Image source: Facebook.\nMuch like LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD) before it, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is considering playing by China's censorship rules in order to get access to the Middle Kingdom.\nThe professional network expectedly hit this exact same hurdle over two years ago when it officially started expanding into China, even though LinkedIn \"fundamentally disagrees with government censorship.\" But that was simply the price of admission if it wanted to be able to reach the roughly 140 million professionals in China at the time, a figure that has likely increased in the years since. LinkedIn has grown its China membership base by over fivefold to 20 million members.\nThe New York Times recently reported that Facebook is working on software that could censor posts in News Feeds based on geographical location. Facebook would not be making censorship decisions itself, but would abdicate that responsibility to a third-party Chinese company once it builds the tools. To be clear, this is just an idea that Facebook is working on, and the company has not finalized any decisions and the censorship tool may never be released. Facebook has been banned in China since 2009.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE! Heres how to play the largest growth opportunity in history Forget Apple!

It's not clear exactly how many China-based users there currently are -- third-party estimates range from 50 million to 60 million -- but with a population of nearly 1.4 billion, you can bet that Facebook wants in. As of last quarter, Facebook had 1.79 billion monthly active users worldwide.\nZuck Dawg speaks out ",

They’re like koalas, albeit they’re vicious and love attacking unsuspecting bushwalkers, most often tourists. \nThey’ve received recognition here and there – the most notable one a web page in the Australia Museum website – but most laugh them off as a hoax. Now, Drop Bears are finally getting much-deserved respect, with their very own landmark. \nTamworth recently honoured Drop Bears with plans of renaming a road after them. “The habitat in this beautiful country area where this unknown road runs up along the creek with quite heavily timbered surrounds. It would be an ideal habitat for the drop bear to sustain,” Mayor Col Murray told Mashable. \nThe renaming won’t be until a few months from now, but once it happens, “I’m sure there’ll be significant celebration,” added the mayor. \nTourists, better have Vegemite or toothpaste behind your ears just in case you pass by Drop Bear Lane. \nVia Mashable About the author \nInigo is a writer and graphic designer from Manila, Philippines.

      "text": "Facebook twitter Google November 28, 2016 Nvidia Xavier chip 20 trillion operations per second of deep learning performance and uses 20 watts which means 50 chips would be a petaOP at a kilowatt While Moore’s Law for traditional CPU-based computing is on the decline, Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia CEO says that we are just on the precipice of a new Moore’s Law-like curve of innovation—one that is driven by traditional CPUs with accelerator kickers, mixed precision capabilities, new distributed frameworks for managing both AI and supercomputing applications, and an unprecedented level of data for training. Huang sees a new golden age of computing ahead and it is one so fast-moving that even our current goals for exascale capabilities might arrive sooner than expected and while this might have a hyperbolic ring to it, after listening to HPC end users and vendors from both hardware and software sides, there is indeed a fortunate merging between AI and supercomputing codes and systems. With their lower precision focus and offloading of traditional simulation results to deep neural networks for large-scale inferencing, there is the possibility of lower power consuming, higher-yielding supercomputers around the corner. Judging from the nodes on the forthcoming Summit supercomputer, which is setting the stage for machines capable of handling mixed precision, mixed HPC/AI workloads Intelligent machines powered by AI computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error. This is truly an extraordinary time. In my three decades in the computer industry, none has held more potential, or been more fun. The era of AI has begun. Today, we stand at the beginning of the next era, the AI computing era, ignited by a new computing model, GPU deep learning. This new model — where deep neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data — has proven to be “unreasonably” effective at solving some of the most complex problems in computer science. In this era, software writes itself and machines learn. Soon, hundreds of billions of devices will be infused with intelligence. AI will revolutionize every industry. AI researchers everywhere turned to GPU deep learning. Baidu, Google, Facebook and Microsoft were the first companies to adopt it for pattern recognition. By 2015, they started to achieve “superhuman” results — a computer can now recognize images better than we can. In the area of speech recognition, Microsoft Research used GPU deep learning to achieve a historic milestone by reaching “human parity” in conversational speech. Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU deep learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, NVIDIA’s GPU runs deep learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why NVIDIA GPUs are used broadly for deep learning, and NVIDIA is increasingly known as “the AI computing company.” Whereas the old computing model is “instruction processing” intensive, this new computing model requires massive “data processing.” To advance every aspect of AI, we’re building an end-to-end AI computing platform — one architecture that spans training, inference and the billions of intelligent devices that are coming our way. Soon, the tens of billions of internet queries made each day will require AI, which means that each query will require billions more math operations. The total load on cloud services will be enormous to ensure real-time responsiveness. For faster data center inference performance, we announced the Tesla P40 and P4 GPUs. P40 accelerates data center inference throughput by 40 times. P4 requires only 50 watts and is designed to accelerate 1U OCP servers, typical of hyperscale data centers. Software is a vital part of NVIDIA’s deep learning platform. For training, we have CUDA and cuDNN. For inferencing, we announced TensorRT, an optimizing inferencing engine. TensorRT improves performance without compromising accuracy by fusing operations within a layer and across layers, pruning low-contribution weights, reducing precision to FP16 or INT8, and many other techniques. Someday, billions of intelligent devices will take advantage of deep learning to perform seemingly intelligent tasks. Drones will autonomously navigate through a warehouse, find an item and pick it up. Portable medical instruments will use AI to diagnose blood samples onsite. Intelligent cameras will learn to alert us only to the circumstances that we care about. Nvidia created an energy-efficient AI supercomputer, Jetson TX1, for such intelligent IoT devices. A credit card-sized module, Jetson TX1 can reach 1 TeraFLOP FP16 performance using just 10 watts. It’s the same architecture as our most powerful GPUs and can run all the same software. Nvidia offers an end-to-end AI computing platform — from GPU to deep learning software and algorithms, from training systems to in-car AI computers, from cloud to data center to PC to robots. NVIDIA’s AI computing platform is everywhere. AI Transportation: At $10 trillion, transportation is a massive industry that AI can transform. Autonomous vehicles can reduce accidents, improve the productivity of trucking and taxi services, and enable new mobility services. We announced that both Baidu and TomTom selected NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 for self-driving cars. With each, we’re building an open “cloud-to-car” platform that includes an HD map, AI algorithms and an AI supercomputer. NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 is a scalable architecture that can span the entire range of AI for autonomous driving. At GTC, we announced DRIVE PX 2 AutoCruise designed for highway autonomous driving with continuous localization and mapping. We also released DriveWorks Alpha 1, our OS for self-driving cars that covers every aspect of autonomous driving — detection, localization, planning and action. Nvidia introduced Xavier, the most ambitious single-chip computer they have ever undertaken — the world’s first AI supercomputer chip. Xavier is 7 billion transistors — more complex than the most advanced server-class CPU. Miraculously, Xavier has the equivalent horsepower of DRIVE PX 2 launched at CES earlier this year — 20 trillion operations per second of deep learning performance — at just 20 watts. AI Enterprise: IBM, which sees a $2 trillion opportunity in cognitive computing, announced a new POWER8 and NVIDIA Tesla P100 server designed to bring AI to the enterprise. On the software side, SAP announced that it has received two of the first NVIDIA DGX-1 supercomputers and is actively building machine learning enterprise solutions for its 320,000 customers in 190 countries. AI City: There will be 1 billion cameras in the world in 2020. Hikvision, the world leader in surveillance systems, is using AI to help make our cities safer. It uses DGX-1 for network training and has built a breakthrough server, called “Blade,” based on 16 Jetson TX1 processors. Blade requires 1/20 the space and 1/10 the power of the 21 CPU-based servers of equivalent performance. AI Factory: There are 2 billion industrial robots worldwide. Japan is the epicenter of robotics innovation. At GTC, we announced that FANUC, the Japan-based industrial robotics giant, will build the factory of the future on the NVIDIA AI platform, from end to end. Its deep neural network will be trained with NVIDIA GPUs, GPU-powered FANUC Fog units will drive a group of robots and allow them to learn together, and each robot will have an embedded GPU to perform real-time AI. MIT Tech Review wrote about it in its story “Japanese Robotics Giant Gives Its Arms Some Brains.” The Next Phase of Every Industry: GPU deep learning is inspiring a new wave of startups — 1,500+ around the world — in healthcare, fintech, automotive, consumer web applications and more. Drive.ai, which was recently licensed to test its vehicles on California roads, is tackling the challenge of self-driving cars by applying deep learning to the full driving stack. Preferred Networks, the Japan-based developer of the Chainer framework, is developing deep learning solutions for IoT. Benevolent.ai, based in London and one of the first recipients of DGX-1, is using deep learning for drug discovery to tackle diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and rare cancers. According to CB Insights, funding for AI startups hit over $1 billion in the second quarter, an all-time high.AI Factory: There are 2 billion industrial robots worldwide.

AI for Everyone AI can solve problems that seemed well beyond our reach just a few years back. From real-world data, computers can learn to recognize patterns too complex, too massive or too subtle for hand-crafted software or even humans. With GPU deep learning, this computing model is now practical and can be applied to solve challenges in the world’s largest industries. Self-driving cars will transform the $10 trillion transportation industry. In healthcare, doctors will use AI to detect disease at the earliest possible moment, to understand the human genome to tackle cancer, or to learn from the massive volume of medical data and research to recommend the best treatments. And AI will usher in the 4th industrial revolution — after steam, mass production and automation — intelligent robotics will drive a new wave of productivity improvements and enable mass consumer customization. AI will touch everyone. The era of AI is here. SOURCES- Nvidia, Next Platform",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is pushing back on an attempt by Porter Ranch residents to derail Southern California Gas Company's $4 million plea deal to resolve criminal charges stemming from last year's massive gas leak. \nA gas well ruptured in October 2015 at SoCal Gas's Aliso Canyon gas storage field, leaking out of control for four months. It caused two school campuses and some 8,000 households to leave the area temporarily. \nAfter the leak was plugged, the DA brought four misdemeanor criminal counts against SoCal Gas. The plea deal, reached in September , goes to Superior Court Judge Alan S. Rosenfield for approval on Tuesday. It called for the company to pay fines, hire additional staff to monitor the Aliso Canyon Gas Storage Facility and to install new equipment to detect leaks of natural gas. It did not directly compensate any victims. Under the deal, the company would plead no contest to one charge of waiting three days to notify county authorities of the leak, and the county DA's office would petition the court to dismiss three other counts. One was for allowing the leak to occur and the remaining two were for waiting to report the leak. \nAttorneys for residents displaced by the leak said in court papers filed last month that the plea bargain shortchanges them, because the agreement does not provide restitution for their losses, such as medical care, moving expenses and loss of value in their homes. \nPeople affected by the natural gas release are not entitled to restitution under California's 2008 victims' rights law, DA Jackie Lacey and the office's environmental crimes staffers said in court papers filed last week. Prosecutors say the deal should go through. DA spokeswoman Jane Robison said the office had no comment beyond its court papers filed in support of the plea deal. In those papers, the DA's office said that the residents' economic losses have been covered by hundreds of millions of dollars in payments from SoCal Gas. It also said the victims' rights law approved by voters in 2008 does not allow plaintiffs in a civil case to intervene as victims in the criminal prosecution.

Does Facebook offer a way to see who's viewed your profile or posts?\nDespite the rumors you may have heard over the years, the answer is a resounding no. The concept of Facebook profile views is a pure myth. The Facebook Help Center states :\nNo. Facebook doesn't let you track who views your profile or your posts (ex: your photos.) Third-party apps are also unable to do this.\nIf you come across an app that says it can show you who's viewing your profile or posts, please report the app.\nNote Facebook's emphasis on third-party apps: Chances are you've encountered a website or mobile app boldly claiming its service allows you to \"See who views your profile!\" Not only are those third-party clients lying, but they could be collecting your personal information or infecting your device with malware . Whatever their intention, all of these apps are scams.\nFor more info, check out Facebook's data policy .",

      "text": "  Forget Fake News on Facebook – The Real Filter Bubble Is You Forget Fake News on Facebook – The Real Filter Bubble Is You \nBanning false news on popular social media sites amounts to censorship. Will Self, writing for New Statesman, questions any manipulation of news on such sites – curating news for positive or negative stories, writing algorithms that match stories to readers or selecting specific articles for trending news. “Back in the days when everyone read the print edition of the New York Times this sort of manipulation was, it is argued, quite impossible; after all, the US media historically made a fetish of fact-checking, an editorial process that is pretty much unknown in our own press,” Self writes from the United Kingdom. He then goes on to describe the tendency toward “confirmation bias,” people creating their own filter bubbles by selecting reading materials, trusting and sharing opinions that reinforce values and beliefs. People fundamentally disagree about any set of facts – religious, historical, financial, scientific – that guide society. Bans and curations can’t overcome the uncomfortable observation that the world’s education systems are producing people who prefer entertainment over critical thinking and society’s values are self-centered, biased and mean. Self concludes by noting that the internet remains a lead resource for truth-telling and fact-checking. – YaleGlobal Forget Fake News on Facebook – The Real Filter Bubble Is You If people want to receive all their news from a single feed that reinforces their beliefs, there is little that can be done Will Self",

      "text": "Email \nNow that the holiday season is here again, so is a familiar holiday scam. \nPolice are warning people about the \"secret sister gift exchange\" currently making the rounds on social media, including Facebook. \nThe secret sister gift exchange promises that if you buy one $10 gift for someone and add your name to a list, you'll get between six and 36 gifts in the mail. \nAuthorities say it's too good to be true and illegal. \nCaitlin Coller of Danville, Pennsylvania, was tagged in a Facebook post. \n\"At first when I read it, I thought it was pretty cool,\" said Coller. \"The girl who tagged me in it is pretty reliable and is really nice, so it seemed like something she came up with. It seemed like this original thing.\" \nBut it's not an original thing. According to investigators, the secret sister gift exchange is a scam. \n\"You have no idea who you're giving that information to, so ultimately what you're setting yourself up for is identity theft,\" said Danville Police Chief Eric Gill. \nThe post asks you to mail a gift to someone on a list add your name and address to the list and you'll get gifts in return. \nChief Gill says it's illegal. The United States Post Office considers this a chain letter which is a form of gambling. \n\"Sending your private information to somewhere where you have no idea where it's going to go is very foolish,\" the chief said. \nPolice in Tennessee also posted a warning to their Facebook page this year: \nThe secret sister gift exchange was popular in 2015 and is making the rounds again. \nRebecca Kurtz of Lewisburg saw it on Facebook but thought it was questionable. \n\"My cousin has it on hers and I thought, OK, I'm not going to do it, though, because I don't know half the people.\" \nIf you want to do a gift exchange, the chief suggests doing one through work or with friends you personally know. \n\"It would be easier to go down to the local store and purchase something for $10 and wrap it and give it to them.\" \nIf you are invited to take part in the secret sister gift exchange, you can report it to Facebook. \nU.S. Postal Inspection Service has this guidance: \n“There’s at least one problem with chain letters. They’re illegal if they request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants. Chain letters are a form of gambling, and sending them through the mail (or delivering them in person or by computer, but mailing money to participate) violates Title 18, United States Code, Section 1302, the Postal Lottery Statute. (Chain letters that ask for items of minor value, like picture postcards or recipes, may be mailed, since such items are not things of value within the meaning of the law.”",

      "text": "Brady pokes fun at his lead-block ability with Facebook video Brady pokes fun at his lead-block ability with Facebook video By Phil Perry November 28, 2016 8:34 PM \nPatriots coach Bill Belichick praised, of all things, Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick's willingness to throw a block in the days leading up the Week 12 matchup between division rivals. Tough quarterback, Belichick explained. \nIt was Belichick's signal-caller, though, who found himself leading the way for a running back at MetLife Stadium on Sunday. \nIn the first quarter, during the Patriots' second drive, running back LeGarrette Blount reversed course when his running lane was cut off and soon found himself in Brady's wake. He rumbled behind Brady as Brady carefully avoided contact -- for some reason, Jets defenders avoided him as well -- leading to a 10-yard pick-up. \n\"You guys saw what happened when I got out in front of a running back,\" Brady told WEEI's Kirk and Callahan Show on Monday. \"I can't do [crap]. I don't even know what to do when I'm out there. I'm looking around . . . I'm really a fish out of water when I'm out there . . . Things happen so fast. It's like you're on the highway. I'm never out there. It's a weird thing.\" \nBrady went the extra mile to poke fun at himself later in the day when his Facebook page posted a video of the 39-year-old's audition for fullback James Develin's job. \nPre-snap... LG: “Tom I’m gonna bounce back and you lead the way, cool?” TB: \"I got you, LG.\" Posted by Tom Brady on Monday, November 28, 2016",

By addressing fake news as a human issue, not a technical problem, my firm has been able to stop people from sharing fake news. By Joseph Steinberg Joseph Steinberg is a cybersecurity expert and entrepreneur. He is CEO of SecureMySocial , which recently brought to market the world's first system to warn people in real time if they are making inappropriate social media posts. He is also the inventor of several popular cybersecurity technologies, and the author of books and articles on information security and business-related topics. Full bio: www.JosephSteinberg.com CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nOver the past few weeks, numerous media outlets have discussed the problem of significant numbers of \"fake news\" stories circulating on social media - primarily on Facebook. Some commentators even claim that the widespread dissemination of misinformation during recent presidential campaign may have contributed to Sec. Hillary Clinton's loss to President-elect Donald Trump . \nBut there is a more sinister element to fake news, which is important to understand if we are to combat the problem. \nWhen someone posts fake news, the risk is not just one of looking foolish, or of spreading lies - fake news posts may cause all sorts of other problems. Nefarious parties running fake news sites may be making small fortunes off running advertisements on their sites - advertisements that are being seen by many people due to click-bait type false headlines; by sharing fake news, social media users enrich those involved and incentivize other unscrupulous parties to create and publish even more fake news, which undermines trust in online news in general. Worse, it is not hard for a criminal to write, or copy, fake news stories that are likely to go viral due to their headlines, and to place such stories on a website that distributes malware, or to create a site for such a purpose from the get go. \nWhile fake news has recently received a lot of media attention, it is a problem that I have been dealing with for several years. \nWhen I founded SecureMySocial , my goal was to create technology that protected people against making problematic social media posts of all sorts. In fact, there are numerous types of problematic posts, and they can inflict many different types of damage. One early beta test of our then patent-pending technology (the first patent has since been granted) - included warning users if they were sharing links to articles on sites known to contain various questionable materials. While the term \"fake news\" was not yet a household word, what would ultimately be termed \"fake news\" was one of the types of material whose publication could be detrimental to the poster and his or her employer - and a type of post that we were to stop. \nWe did not do this by censoring people. Our tests showed that simply warning people if they were sharing problematic links was highly effective. It is far better for people to censor themselves once they are warned of the consequences of their actions, than to be censored by social media security companies, the government, or by the social media providers themselves (certainly when it comes to first time offenses that do not break any laws). \nSince then SecureMySocial has been blocking fake news in such a fashion - and, as of last week, our team even created an explicit configuration item to warn people about fake news as its own type of problem, rather than including it within other rule-sets. \nWhy is this important to you? \nBecause there is a profound lesson that so many people seem to be missing when it comes to the discussion about fake news: \nWhile so many people focus on technology - how to identify as many fake pieces as possible without falsely identifying real news as bogus - it is really a human issue: The creation of fake news is not the core problem - lying has been around for as long as people have spoken ( \"Thou shalt not bear false witness,\" the Bible says ). The problem on social media is that people who don't know better spread the lies - and the technology enables them to do so faster than ever before. Like the difference between a fire on someone's stove and a forest fire burning thousands of acres, virality is the primary issue, not the original lie. If warnings start being issued just as a fake news piece is staring to spread - its virality comes to a halt, and its creator loses much of the financial incentive to continue creating more fake news. \nYes, the fake news issue is more complicated and has many other factors. It is important not to confuse real news sites that occasionally make errors and publish misinformation with sites intending to mislead. Some sites contain both legitimate and fake news, and fake news creators can also keep creating new sites. There are many other issues, and many technical methods of identifying bogus stories (those topics are beyond the scope of this article). But, it is important to realize, however, that ultimately, curtailing virality through warnings to people sharing fake news not only hits fake news writers in the pocketbook, it also de facto trains users to spot fake news for what it truly is the next time around - which can have an even greater long-term impact than any technology on cutting down fake news . \nAnd that brings me to the most important lesson from fake news: Ultimately, as is so often the case, technology is not the source of the problem. It is we humans who are the weak link. In the end, it is people, not computers, who will determine whether or not we, the human users of social media, continue to spread fake news.

      "text": "Earlier this year, Facebook was effectively banned from using their ‘Free Basics’ program to connect more users in India due to concerns around a perceived conflict of interest in the service. Basically, Facebook would be able to provide free internet access to, potentially, more than a billion people in India who don’t currently have it, but in doing so, Facebook would also retain the rights to pick and choose which services were made available via the option, which would give The Social Network a significant advantage in the market. And while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued strongly for the program to be allowed in India - even writing an opinion piece for The Times of India – Indian regulators eventually opted against Free Basics being allowed in the country, a significant setback for Facebook’s internet.org program.\nBut India is a key to Facebook’s ‘ connect the world ’ mission, and as such, Facebook’s now come up with a new plan to connect Indian users via their Express Wi-Fi service , another element of internet.org .\nUnlike Free Basics, Express Wi-Fi is a paid service, though it can be provided at very cheap rates . Working with local ISPs, Facebook will be able to connect users via data packs to enable them to access the internet via the Express Wi Fi network. This works within regulatory requirements, and Facebook has reportedly partnered with local provider RailTel , among others, which could provide give them coverage to up to 70% of the country.\nGetting more access to India would be a major move for Facebook. Looking at the raw numbers, Facebook currently has around 1.79 billion active users. The current population of the world is just under 7.5 billion , which means Facebook’s reaching around 24% of the global population.\nBut that calculation doesn’t provide an accurate account of The Social Network’s real popularity or audience penetration – you see, of that 7.5 billion, only around 3.8 billion of them can actually access Facebook at all. This is due to several factors:\nFacebook’s banned in China (1.4b people) Facebook’s banned in varying capacities in other nations (150 million est.) People under 13 can’t sign-up for Facebook (1.17b est.) Only around 18% of the population in India has access to the internet (1b+ without access) This is an incomplete list, there are various other limitations and factors that mean Facebook can’t possibly reach everyone, but even taking just these considerations into account, Facebook’s actual, possible global reach is more like 47% - i.e. of all the people who can access Facebook, almost one in two do so.\nGiven this, if Facebook can provide internet access to an extra billion users in India, even if they don’t make Facebook the main focus of that access, it’s a fairly safe bet that a lot of them will become Facebook users either way.\nThis is why Facebook’s so keen to connect more regions, because their audience penetration is so significant, and it continues to grow . Connecting more people will give The Social Network more connections, more data and more ways to expand their platform into a facilitator of global commerce.\nOn this front, reports have also suggested that Facebook’s working on a new process to get into China, the most populous nation in the world (India, worth noting, is second on that list ). According to reports, Facebook’s developed tools which could enable administrators to prevent sensitive posts from appearing in Facebook feeds in \"specific geographic areas\". This would work in line with China’s strict media regulatory requirements, which could open the door for Facebook to get into the local market. Of course, Facebook would still have to compete with the existing Chinese social media giants , but simply gaining access would be a huge positive for the company, and would likely mean that Zuckerberg’s long-standing efforts to woo China were worth the effort.\n(As an aside, news of Facebook’s selective censorship tool was reportedly leaked by insiders amid fears that the incoming US Government could also get their hands on it).\nAs noted, Facebook currently has 1.79 billion monthly active users, but Zuckerberg’s flagged that he wants to boost that to 5 billion by 2030 . For that to happen, Facebook needs internet.org to work – they’re making big investments in millimeter wave technology and solar-powered drones to facilitate this, while the aforementioned efforts in India and China will also play a big part.\nGiven their progress, it’s not hard to imagine Facebook continuing their amazing user growth rates and becoming an even bigger, more influential platform in future.\nSuch efforts may not matter a lot to you or your business as yet, but the potential of that wider connectivity, and the role Facebook will play in any such rollout, is huge. It’s worth paying attention to these movements.",

Marketers have lots of separate data — from in-store footfall, to social media metrics, and online advertising analytics — but not necessarily the ability to connect it together to know whether that specific Facebook fan, who saw that online ad, went on the next day to buy a pair of shoes.\nMPlatform is creating what it is calling an \"mID\" — a piece of code that will act as a consumers' ID as they switch across display advertising, mobile, video, apps, and using offline loyalty programs. \nGleason said: \"mID is beyond a cookie. It's code that pulls [data] together. The interesting thing is what's sourcing into it. mID can be any type of data, a single point of truth, from first-party data, to third-party, offline, online, it's all aggregated. Think about it as a translation tool ... it gives our customers the ability to have a 360-view [of their audiences] which is significant.\"\nmID bears a close resemblance to Apple ID, Google ID, or Facebook ID. They're the account you use for everything you do across those companies' various apps, sites, and services. They are also the unique IDs that advertisers use to target and track consumers across those services.\nBut the problem for an advertising platform like GroupM is that consumers don't sign up to use any of its services, so it doesn't have that login data. By connecting more of its companies together under mPlatform, it can link up data from several sources — including WPP-owned companies Wunderman, Kantar, and Millward Brown, plus GroupM's own data from agreements with media partners — to make it more accurate and useful.\nGleason says mID is PII compliant — meaning it will only aggregate data, rather than letting advertisers target or track specific people based on their personally identifiable information.\nHe added: \"mPlatform will bring together addressability across all media. When agencies plan, they will have the ability to plan — from search, to linear TV — in a fluid fashion. It will bring accountability at the same time: the ability to evaluate different inventory sources on a common platform.\"\nUltimately, mPlatform is also a way for GroupM to simplify all of the digital, data, and technology businesses it has acquired over time. Some older company brand names may fade out as a result. \nmPlatform will be split into four divisions:\nmCore: The data platform where mID will sit. mInsights: A media-planning tool. mAnalytics: An analytics unit. mReport: A data dashboard. The launch of mPlatform comes in the same month GroupM North America streamlined its operations and made leadership changes , including switching chief investment officer Rino Scanzoni into the new role of chairman and CEO of the company's addressable TV group, plus Modi Media, and Midas Exchange.\nNOW WATCH: Here's why some people have a tiny hole above their ears \n",

      "text": "Share on Facebook © Outside Found \nThere once was a time, circa pre-Internet, when the idea of living a lifestyle other than the prescribed social norm was seen as 'fringe'. Fast-forward to today, and the easy dissemination of alternative information and memes via social media make a plurality of ideas like living simply and mortgage-free , urban homesteading , free-range parenting and co-working seem way less marginal and even desirable. Time and time again, we hear how ordinary people rethink and find the inner courage to make big changes that are better for them and for the planet. \nWill Hitchcock and Alyssa Pelletier of Outside Found are yet another example of a couple who took a chance and headed for the unknown. Both were employed in stressful, Silicon Valley start-up jobs in San Francisco's Bay Area, and the two outdoor enthusiasts found themselves yearning for the outdoor activities they didn't have the time or space to do in the city. So they quit their jobs and moved to Boulder, Colorado, launching their own tech consulting company, and then deciding they wanted to travel and work remotely. Their new home on the road: an 2001 GMC Bluebird bus that they renovated themselves. \n© Outside Found \nThe couple found the 38-foot-long bus on Craigslist, and despite not having any construction experience, began the task of making it into a cozy home. It wasn't easy, says Alyssa: \"Will and I worked on the bus every day for almost four months, and not a day went by that we didn't have some sort of unique challenge to overcome.\" \nThe interior was completely insulated and redone. The front of the bus acts as the mud room for taking off soiled boots and shoes. That overlaps with the main sitting area, which faces the all-purpose table which can fold down so that the couple's dog, Hilde, can run around. There is storage integrated into the custom-built sofa. \n© Outside Found © Outside Found \nBeyond that lies the kitchen, which faces the couple's large workstation area, which has a lot of desk space, legroom, and storage (the bus' solar power equipment is hidden somewhere here). \n© Outside Found",

      "title": "Is It Illegal to Criticize Your Employer on Social Media?",
      "text": "Pop quiz! Can the comments you post on Facebook, Twitter or even Glassdoor cost you your job?\nGenerally, the answer is no . But it’s important that before you turn to social media to gripe about your employer or the annoying things your boss does, that you know what is and what is not an illegal move.\nFor the answer, we turned to Todd Wulffson, managing partner in the Orange County office of Carothers DiSante & Freudenberger LLP, a leading California employment, labor and business immigration law firm providing litigation defense and counseling to California employers. Wulffson has 25 years of experience counseling and defending businesses in labor and employment issues. \nHere’s what he had to say when we asked him “Is It Illegal to Criticize Your Employer on Social Media?”\nOn the legal limits an employee should be mindful of: \n“If an employee posts on a public site and uses the employer’s name, the employer has the right to review the posts – and in fact, the employer should be routinely making sure its name, brand and online reputation are not improperly tarnished. It is problematic for an employer to be targeting specific employees’ posts (it might be illegal discrimination), but if an employee’s post can be found in a search of the company’s name, the employee should make sure the potential post does not provide a basis for discipline or a possible lawsuit by the employer.”\n[Related: Can My Boss or Employer Fire Me For Posting on Glassdoor? ]\nOn what’s okay and what isn’t: \n“As a general rule, an employee has the right to post information about his or her wages, hours and working conditions online – and those are very broad categories. So, general complaints or grievances are protected under federal law (the National Labor Relations Act) and various state laws that protect employees from retaliation for complaining about working conditions. What is not protected are threats of violence, racial epithets or other hate speech, harassment, or disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information. The employer may have an obligation to investigate and ensure that other employees and/or its confidential information are protected.\nOf lesser importance, but an area where employers are likely to take action, is when employees post false or misleading information on social media sites that they know to be false or are designed to harm the company’s reputation or that of its management employees.”\n[Related: Submit a Review of Your Company ]\nOn what to be cautious of: \n“Finally, an area where employees find themselves in legal hot water is when they post positive information about their employer – but fail to disclose that they are employees. The Federal Trade Commission has specific regulations about employees disclosing their affiliation with a business if they post positive information online. Many businesses have been blind-sided with unfair competition lawsuits by competitors because employees were unknowingly trying to “help” the company’s marketing by posting positive information on social media sites, but not disclosing that they are employees.”\nOn if an employee can be fired for posting online: \n“ Yes – employees can be reprimanded if the employees are on notice that their (even off duty) posts may be found (in general searches regarding the company’s name or reputation) and reviewed by the company. If the employee posts information that is improper or requires the company to respond – for example, threats of violence, hate speech, harassment, disclosure of trade secrets, or information that may lead to the company being sued, discipline may not only be appropriate, but it may be legally required. It is a best practice for companies to have a clear, concise and informative social media policy, letting employees know what the limits are for online posting. Nobody wants to be perceived as, or act like, “Big Brother,” but employees also need to know that there are limits to what can be posted online, just as there are limits to what they can say in the workplace or even out in public.” \n[Related: Tips To Save Your Job If You Think You Could Be Fired ]\nOn what your boss has in his or her arsenal: \n“Yes, there are legal protections that employers can utilize if they need or want to take action on an online post made by an employee. First, there is a great deal of case law authorizing (and in some cases mandating) disciplinary action against employees who engage in harmful conduct online. An employee who uses social media or online posts to harass, threaten or bully colleagues, may find himself fired the same way he would be if the conduct occurred at work. Employees who defame the company, disclose trade secrets in violation of the law or contractual obligations, or otherwise try intentionally to harm the company’s brand or reputation, may find themselves properly, and immediately, made available to the competition.”\nNo matter what, remember that laws vary state by state, and please refer to your employee handbook for specifics. See Glassdoor’s Community Guidelines for what’s ok and what isn’t.\nEDITOR’S NOTE: This blog does not provide legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship.

      "title": "How ‘Ok Go’ made a 4-minute music video with 4.2 seconds of footage",
      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter \nLast week, Ok Go blew our minds yet again with their new music video, ‘The One Moment’. Now that we’ve had time to pick our jaws up off the floor, the one question we’re all asking is: How? \nThe first part of the music video features a series of exploding water balloons and guitars taking place in just 4.2 seconds. Then, everything is shown again – but this time in slow motion. It’s here we see the brilliance of it all, with each segment revealing smaller interactions happening in mere milliseconds. \nSo how did Ok Go pull this off? \n“We used very precise digital triggers to set off several hundred events in extremely quick succession. The triggers were synchronized to high speed robotic arms which whipped the cameras along the path of the action,” explained frontman and director Damian Kulash. \nThe band also used a complex spreadsheet detailing the exact timing and the different camera speeds they had to work with for all the mini-events to sync together. \nKulash added: “When the guitars explode, we are 200x slower than reality (6,000 frames per second), but Tim and Andy’s short bursts of lip sync (Tim twice and Andy once) are only 3x slower than real life (90 frames per second). The watermelons are around 150x, and the spray paint cans are a little over 60x.” \nOk Go’s music videos are as much-awaited (if not, more) as their actual songs. The band became known a decade ago for their incredibly-synchronised dance on treadmills for ‘Here It Goes Again’. Since then, they’ve churned out mindblowing videos one after another. \n“We’re always trying something that is just on the edge of possible,” Kulash told Mashable . \nCheck out Ok Go’s behind-the-scenes video to know more about how they made a music video in a blink of an eye.",

      "text": "print Brian Gleason, CEO of Xaxis. Xaxis \nGroupM, the media investment group that sits within the world's largest advertising holding company WPP, is forming a new data and technology unit called mPlatform. \nMPlatform will be led by Brian Gleason, currently the global CEO of Xaxis, WPP's programmatic advertising platform. \nXaxis, which now has more than 2,000 staff, will sit under Gleason's mPlatform unit, alongside other GroupM-owned companies that are specialists in data, technology, and digital — such as Connect and Catalyst. \nSpeaking to Business Insider, Gleason said the reshuffle was enacted on the insight that \"less than 10%\" of its clients have a \"single view\" of their customer. Marketers have lots of separate data — from in-store footfall, to social media metrics, and online advertising analytics — but not necessarily the ability to connect it together to know whether that specific Facebook fan, who saw that online ad, went on the next day to buy a pair of shoes. \nMPlatform is creating what it is calling an \"mID\" — a piece of code that will act as a consumers' ID as they switch across display advertising, mobile, video, apps, and using offline loyalty programs. \nGleason said: \"mID is beyond a cookie. It's code that pulls [data] together. The interesting thing is what's sourcing into it. mID can be any type of data, a single point of truth, from first-party data, to third-party, offline, online, it's all aggregated. Think about it as a translation tool ... it gives our customers the ability to have a 360-view [of their audiences] which is significant.\" \nmID bears a close resemblance to Apple ID, Google ID, or Facebook ID. They're the account you use for everything you do across those companies' various apps, sites, and services. They are also the unique IDs that advertisers use to target and track consumers across those services. \nBut the problem for an advertising platform like GroupM is that consumers don't sign up to use any of its services, so it doesn't have that login data. By connecting more of its companies together under mPlatform, it can link up data from several sources — including WPP-owned companies Wunderman, Kantar, and Millward Brown, plus GroupM's own data from agreements with media partners — to make it more accurate and useful. \nGleason says mID is PII compliant — meaning it will only aggregate data, rather than letting advertisers target or track specific people based on their personally identifiable information. \nHe added: \"mPlatform will bring together addressability across all media. When agencies plan, they will have the ability to plan — from search, to linear TV — in a fluid fashion. It will bring accountability at the same time: the ability to evaluate different inventory sources on a common platform.\" \nUltimately, mPlatform is also a way for GroupM to simplify all of the digital, data, and technology businesses it has acquired over time. Some older company brand names may fade out as a result. \nmPlatform will be split into four divisions: mCore: The data platform where mID will sit. mInsights: A media-planning tool. mAnalytics: An analytics unit. mReport: A data dashboard. \nThe launch of mPlatform comes in the same month GroupM North America streamlined its operations and made leadership changes , including switching chief investment officer Rino Scanzoni into the new role of chairman and CEO of the company's addressable TV group, plus Modi Media, and Midas Exchange.",

      "text": "(Picture: JoAnne Dyck / Facebook) Hairless cats, with their alien-like faces and wrinkly skin, are an acquired taste – but they can be pretty cute.\nThat is, when they’re genuinely hairless.\nThere's now a book dedicated to London's best pub cats But, as one woman found out, scammers are trying to sell people fake hairless sphynx kittens by cruelly shaving regular kittens and pulling out their whiskers.\nJoAnna Dyck, from Alberta, Canada, bought what she thought was a sphynx online.\nShe paid ÂŁ560 for the cat, which was delivered to her home after the breeder refused to let her come and pick him up.\nA hairless sphynx cat. (Picture: Getty Images) ‘He was like a little tiny kitten, no more than eight weeks old, and he was naked. Completely hairless,’ she tells CBC.\nVlad, as he was then named, ‘looked like a sphynx because he was very, very skinny and his face was really angular’.\nHowever, JoAnne says that the kitten couldn’t get along with her other cat, so soon after buying him online, she turned to a Facebook buy and sell group to find a new owner for Vlad.\nHe was bought by Shaniya Yung, who noticed when she got the kitten home that he was covered in little cuts and had a large gash on his tail.\nThe kitten also failed to settle there, and he didn’t like being touched or cuddled – which is unusual for regular sphynx cats, as they like to keep warm.\nShaniya says that the little cat just sat on the floor with his tail tucked under him, trembling.\nShe took him to the vet to see if they could find out what was wrong – and was stunned to be told Vlad was likely not a hairless cat, and that the cuts and wounds were probably caused when the dealers removed the cat’s fur, either by shaving it or with a hair removal cream.\n(Picture: JoAnne Dyck / Facebook) ‘The vet said the cat had cuts on his skin, and that they were most likely caused by razor burn or Nair or something like that,’ JoAnna says.\n‘I thought he was crying for his mum, but he was probably in pain.’\nThe cuts on his tail had become so infected that the vet debated amputating it.\nShaniya took Vlad home with some medication and the cat started showing signs of recovery – and she noticed hair beginning to sprout out of his ears and feet.\nA week later, Vlad had grown a full ginger coat.\nMore This guy's Instagram is the most realistic view of veganism we've seen yet \nThis stigma of taking sick days really needs to stop \nPlease don't use wasabi as a 'natural lip filler' \nJoAnna and Shaniya tried to report the incident to the local animal protection centre, but they were unable to help, as the trauma had passed and the cat had already seen a vet.\nAccording to the RSPCA, itÂ can be difficult for vets to assess how much trauma animals have suffered if the event has occurred some time in the past, as the level of suffering the animal experienced forms the main basis for prosecution.\nA genuine hairless cat (Picture: Getty) Fortunately for Vlad, he is now happy and healthy, still living with the woman who bought him from JoAnna.\nFor her part, JoAnna recommends that anyone looking for a pedigree should go to the breeder’s house and ‘if they won’t let you come to their house, their residence, it’s a probably a bad sign’.\nIf you’re thinking about buying cats you’ve found on an internet site, the RSPCA has the following advice: ‘We advise prospective buyers to see the kitten with its mother, ask lots of questions, check paperwork and documentation, and to visit more than once.\n‘This is practically impossible to do if buying a kitten abroad or over the internet so, for that reason, we would advise buyers to be very careful.’\nMORE: Thereâ€™s now a book dedicated to Londonâ€™s best pub cats \nMORE: This Scottish Fold cat likes to sit like a human ",

The’re based on HTML5 – basically minimal browser games – allowing them to load quickly. \nOn Messenger, you’ll see a new controller icon under your typing area, where you can select a title, view leaderboards, participate in group conversations with other players and more. Instant Games are also hitting your News Feed though, letting discover new games more easily via your friends’ posts and challenges. \nThere are 17 games to start, including some retro classics like Pac-Man, Galaga, Space Invaders and Track & Field 100M. Then there are modern titles like Words with Friends too. \nMuch like Instant Articles did for news, the simplicity and speed of Instant Games will likely get more people to playing Facebook titles. Personally, there have a been a few titles I’ve been casually interested in, but never enough to bother downloading and configure sharing settings. Instant Games might just make it easy enough for me to overcome my reservations. \nInstant Games goes live today in 30 countries on iOS and Android .

      "text": "November 29, 2016 Andrew Hutchinson \nEarlier this year, Facebook was effectively banned from using their ‘Free Basics’ program to connect more users in India due to concerns around a perceived conflict of interest in the service. Basically, Facebook would be able to provide free internet access to, potentially, more than a billion people in India who don’t currently have it, but in doing so, Facebook would also retain the rights to pick and choose which services were made available via the option, which would give The Social Network a significant advantage in the market. And while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued strongly for the program to be allowed in India - even writing an opinion piece for The Times of India – Indian regulators eventually opted against Free Basics being allowed in the country, a significant setback for Facebook’s internet.org program. \nBut India is a key to Facebook’s ‘ connect the world ’ mission, and as such, Facebook’s now come up with a new plan to connect Indian users via their Express Wi-Fi service , another element of internet.org . \nUnlike Free Basics, Express Wi-Fi is a paid service, though it can be provided at very cheap rates . Working with local ISPs, Facebook will be able to connect users via data packs to enable them to access the internet via the Express Wi Fi network. This works within regulatory requirements, and Facebook has reportedly partnered with local provider RailTel , among others, which could provide give them coverage to up to 70% of the country. \nGetting more access to India would be a major move for Facebook. Looking at the raw numbers, Facebook currently has around 1.79 billion active users. The current population of the world is just under 7.5 billion , which means Facebook’s reaching around 24% of the global population. \nBut that calculation doesn’t provide an accurate account of The Social Network’s real popularity or audience penetration – you see, of that 7.5 billion, only around 3.8 billion of them can actually access Facebook at all. This is due to several factors: Facebook’s banned in China (1.4b people) Facebook’s banned in varying capacities in other nations (150 million est.) People under 13 can’t sign-up for Facebook (1.17b est.) Only around 18% of the population in India has access to the internet (1b+ without access) \nThis is an incomplete list, there are various other limitations and factors that mean Facebook can’t possibly reach everyone, but even taking just these considerations into account, Facebook’s actual, possible global reach is more like 47% - i.e. of all the people who can access Facebook, almost one in two do so. \nGiven this, if Facebook can provide internet access to an extra billion users in India, even if they don’t make Facebook the main focus of that access, it’s a fairly safe bet that a lot of them will become Facebook users either way. \nThis is why Facebook’s so keen to connect more regions, because their audience penetration is so significant, and it continues to grow . Connecting more people will give The Social Network more connections, more data and more ways to expand their platform into a facilitator of global commerce. \nOn this front, reports have also suggested that Facebook’s working on a new process to get into China, the most populous nation in the world (India, worth noting, is second on that list ). According to reports, Facebook’s developed tools which could enable administrators to prevent sensitive posts from appearing in Facebook feeds in \"specific geographic areas\". This would work in line with China’s strict media regulatory requirements, which could open the door for Facebook to get into the local market. Of course, Facebook would still have to compete with the existing Chinese social media giants , but simply gaining access would be a huge positive for the company, and would likely mean that Zuckerberg’s long-standing efforts to woo China were worth the effort. \n(As an aside, news of Facebook’s selective censorship tool was reportedly leaked by insiders amid fears that the incoming US Government could also get their hands on it). \nAs noted, Facebook currently has 1.79 billion monthly active users, but Zuckerberg’s flagged that he wants to boost that to 5 billion by 2030 . For that to happen, Facebook needs internet.org to work – they’re making big investments in millimeter wave technology and solar-powered drones to facilitate this, while the aforementioned efforts in India and China will also play a big part. \nGiven their progress, it’s not hard to imagine Facebook continuing their amazing user growth rates and becoming an even bigger, more influential platform in future. \nSuch efforts may not matter a lot to you or your business as yet, but the potential of that wider connectivity, and the role Facebook will play in any such rollout, is huge. It’s worth paying attention to these movements. Author Information",

      "title": "Reality bites: Watch as man using VR in Microsoft store falls from fake cliff and hits real floor",
      "text": "Experiencing virtual reality — and gravity — in a Microsoft store. (Facebook screen shot via George Takei) The makers of virtual reality headsets and content may still be waiting for consumers to fall for the medium as a full-fledged entertainment option, but one guy in a viral Facebook video is ahead of the curve — at least when it comes to the falling part.\nPlenty of users have no doubt stumbled and probably even hit the deck while becoming disoriented inside of a VR world. Capturing video of that happening might even pass as more entertaining than what can be seen inside the headset.\nGeorge Takei , Facebook’s resident sharer of stuff that makes us laugh, posted a video credited to the video feed Jukin Media in which a man is seen trying out an Oculus headset inside a Microsoft store. The video has been viewed 8.5 million times.\n\nThe man is playing a game in which he is climbing some sort of cliff or mountain. He does a check of the ground to see how high up he is and as he’s reaching to climb higher, the man falls face first to the real-world floor. A Microsoft employee contains her laughter long enough to ask the man if he’s OK, which he says he is as he gets back to his feet.\nPerhaps the strangest part of the entire scene occurs in the background, as Facebook commenters point out on Takei’s page. Watch for two Microsoft workers who rise from behind a counter when they hear the crash and then descend again after assessing the situation.\nReality wins again.",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \nYou might have heard of Homeboy industries , the downtown L.A. based group that works to help at-risk youth and former gang members. Homeboy offers a variety of free programs such as mental health counseling, work-readiness training and even tattoo removal. \nHow those tatts can change someone's self-image is the subject of a book project that turns the tables on gang life. \"Skin Deep\" features photographs of heavily tattooed ex-gang members before and after their tattoos have been completely photoshopped off. \nWhen the subjects see the images of their tattoo-free skin, their reaction is emotional and powerful. Steven Burton is a photographer and the mind behind the project, which features the photographs of 27 homeboys and homegirls. Francisco Flores was one of them. \nA Martinez spoke to both of them about the project and Francisco recalled his life before all the ink. \"I grew up in South Central. It was a rough life. Both parents were addicts so I kind of had to fend for myself for most of my life,\" Flores said, \"So, at a young age I got in trouble...then I went to prison. Once I got out of prison my parole officer was adamant of me going to Homeboy industries to get tattoo removal and that's how I started...\" \nBefore he began the removal process, Flores speculates he had over a thousand tattoos all over his body including his face. His eyebrows, eyelids, lips, jawline and cheeks were all covered with ink. The sight of him would put people on edge. \n\"I wouldn't be able to walk up to people,\" Flores laughed, \"I'll be walking on the street and I'll have somebody just jump away from me and they'll grab their purse or they'll grab their kids....I'm like, 'I'm not going to do nothing to your kid, I'm just like you.'\" \nIt was around this time that photographer Steven Burton came into the picture. He was at Homeboy industries to view a documentary about the organization's founder when he became drawn to the tattoo removal program. He set out to photograph as many 'homeboys' and 'homegirls' as he could. \n\"The actual photographs themselves didn't take too long, it was like a couple of days. The photoshop took a long time depending on who I was photoshopping,\" Burton said of the project's timeline, \"If you could actually see any skin...a lot of times I'd have to take parts of my own skin and then photoshop them onto him...so in total it took around 400 hours, but then after that the hardest thing was actually to find people again.\" \nOnce everyone was tracked down, they were shown the photographs and the reactions were raw and insightful. \nFrancisco reaction \nIn Francisco's initial reaction video, he says he'd rather be labeled a fat guy than a cholo. 'Cholo' is Spanish slang for thug or gangster, and a term that Francisco wants nothing to do with any longer. \n\"Cholo is just...I'm not that no more. It was my past, but it's not me no more and I still get labeled as that gang member, the gang member and it's like...I'm not a gang member no more, I'm a father....\" \nThe people most affected by the tattoo-less images of Francisco were his children. He has five, and he explained why they are the main motivation for the tattoo removal. \n\"I just want to show my kids something different. I just don't want them to see the gang side and be like 'Oh, what's that?' and have them go through it again and be like 'Oh I was gone for so many years out of your life.',\" Francisco explained, \"And they remember that and then it puts them in a place I don't want them to be. I want them to be happy and remember the good times and not go back and reminisce about the past and all the-harsh things that I did and...I wasn't a good person.\" \nTo hear the full interview, click the blue play button above.

      "text": "News \nAnyone remember the days of playing those silly Facebook games? Since the world has changed quite radically since the heyday of Zynga, it feels like that era was so long ago. Perhaps in a bit of nostalgia or an urge to incite over-competitiveness among friends, Facebook has rolled out games within the Messenger app. \nGames are started by hitting the controller in a conversation, then selecting which title to play. Upon finishing a round, the other person (or people) in the thread will see your score. Each one will include leaderboards and contextually-based chat. The hope here is that these will add to the social, fun, and competitive elements just like the good ol' days. \nThis new initiative marks the first step in Facebook's Instant Games platform. A lot of these titles are instantly recognizable and should be plenty of fun for Messenger users. For those of us that do not use the app, however... well, I am not entirely sure that this will convince us to start. Source:",

      "title": "How To Tell If Your Partner Is Actually The Crazy One",
      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nI’m not going to lie: Sometimes, I look sort of bonkers . \nI pound into a room in loud, platform boots, and the wings of my eyeliner are so massive, I’m surprised I don’t fly away. I also wear oxblood lipstick during the day, and I draw a constellation of freckles across the bridge of my nose because I think it looks cute. \nPeople with a subtler aesthetic often think I’m crazy. And since I’m not one of those girls who is appalled by the word “crazy” (I think it’s sort of glam), I went with it. \nAnd while I’m pretty shy, I’m also wildly eccentric once you get to know me. I have zero fears when it comes to talking about the highs and lows of my sex life, my mental health issues , my sexuality and the radical ideas that swirl through my brain. \nSo obviously, people who are more timid when discussing issues like dildos and depression often deem me crazy as well. \n“You’re so crazy, Zara! I can’t believe you wrote about throwing up on a dick on the internet!” my friends constantly tell me. \nAnd then, I found myself in a relationship with a girl (we’ll call her Conservative Cathy), who always turned red in the cheeks when I talked about my panic attacks and my embarrassing sex fails. \nShe would try to force me to change my clothes when I wanted to wear a pink, cropped, faux fur jacket (super chic by the way) to the bar. \n“You’re fucking crazy!” Cathy would yell at me during one of our notorious screaming matches. \n“This is just me!” I yelled back so often, it became my battlecry. \nI know this is a boring cliché, but if someone calls you something long enough, you actually begin to believe it. “If someone calls you something long enough, you actually begin to believe it.” \nSo after a while, I began to believe I wasn’t just an individual with her own sense of style — I was crazy. And not a glamorous crazy, but a damaged and deranged crazy. \nIt wasn’t just about my clothes and outspoken nature anymore. The belief that I was actually crazy trickled down into all of my thoughts and feelings. \nCathy even began using her affection as a manipulative tool to make me upset. \n“You haven’t been affectionate with me all day,” I would chirp, playfully nudging her arm. \nShe would immediately push my arm away and growl, “You’re so crazy. You’re way too needy. You need help.” \nI even started saying really reductive things about myself, like, “Oh, I’m CRAZY. I don’t know how she puts up with me!” when I only wanted to stay an hour later at the bar on a Friday night. \nThen, one evening, we were lying and watching “Blackfish,” a documentary about the abuse of whales at SeaWorld. \nNow, I’m a hardcore animal lover, so naturally, I was heartbroken by the documentary. Tears ran down my face, and I was haunted by the images of animal abuse for the rest of the night. “If your partner says you’re ‘crazy’ for having feelings, then they are the ones acting crazy, not you.” \nAnd like clockwork, Cathy said to me, “It was just a documentary. You’re acting crazy again.” \nThat was the day it hit me: She had always called me crazy, but really, she was the one that was totally nuts. \nIf you’re having an emotional reaction to anything — a documentary, a life event, a family crisis or even a moving commercial — and your partner says you’re “crazy” for having feelings, then they are the ones acting crazy, not you. \nAnd if someone calls you crazy because of your style, that’s crazy, too. I won’t sugar coat this for you: It’s totally illogical and downright nasty to insinuate someone is mentally unstable because of the way they express themselves. \nI’ve been doing the relationship song and dance for a long time, and 90 percent of the time, if someone is always accusing you of something or calling you a certain name, they possess the very quality they’re accusing you of having. \nThis logic applies to the word “crazy” especially. Women, in particular, are written off as crazy for merely disagreeing with their partners. \nAnd lesbian relationships are no exception. Often, the more masculine-presenting woman will call the feminine-presenting woman crazy. \nSo if you’re currently feeling stuck in this dynamic, being called “crazy,” “nuts” or “unstable” by your partner, I want you to take a step back, babes. \nLook at your relationship through a wider lens. When you’re so near your partner all the time, you’re too close to gain any real perspective. \nAfter taking a step back, I want you to ask yourself a pretty jarring question: Is my partner calling me crazy all the time? \nIf your answer is yes, then I will boldly say you’re not the crazy one. Even if you do struggle with mental health issues, no one who really loves you and who is stable themselves would ever call you that. \nRemember, eccentricity, personal style and being unafraid to voice your opinions is not crazy. In fact, all of those things are pretty spectacular. “Eccentricity, personal style and being unafraid to voice your opinions is not crazy.” \nIt’s important you find a person who won’t reduce your fabulousness to being crazy just because they’re threatened by your light. Your partner should embrace your fire, not try to put it out. \nSo now that we’ve established you’re not the crazy one in your relationship, it’s time to step out of this toxic dynamic and gracefully run for the hills. \nAnd if you’re afraid, please know we only have so much space in our lives. And the person calling you crazy is taking up a lot of space. Imagine what kind of wondrous new things could fill that empty void? \nAt the end of the day, letting go of the negative will always leave a fresh, open spot for the positive.

Yeah, she’s going home,” Desi wrote on Facebook. \nAnother volunteer, Janay, told BuzzFeed News it was “obvious the dog knew them.” \n“They just started sticking their hands in the fence petting her and talking to her,” she said. ID: 10074388 6. Desi walked over to the family, and asked if they had come to reclaim Zuzu. They said no: they were there to adopt a new dog instead of Zuzu. Downey Animal Care Center ID: 10074412 “Their reason was because she was crying and sad since her father passed away. She wasn’t a happy dog anymore,” Desi wrote on Facebook. “Their solution for her unhappiness was just leaving her here. And [to] go get another dog.” \nDesi said she wasn’t sure if the family actually got another dog. ID: 10074436 8. Desi shared the video and Zuzu’s story on her Facebook page, writing “let’s get her into the perfect home please.” Thousands of people shared and reacted to the video, many saying they couldn’t believe she had been abandoned. Facebook ID: 10074476 9. Desi said Zuzu is being taken in by a rescue organization, which will find her an “exceptional” home. Downey Animal Care Center ID: 10074520 She said when she heard the family’s story, she realized things were working out for the best. \n“[I was] honestly sad but glad,” she said. “I knew the rescues who come to [the shelter] would find her a good home where she would be a family member.” \nShe said she is not quite sure how her post became so big. \n“We get so many wonderful dogs and we get so many back stories, good and bad,” she said. “It surprises me which thread takes off and the others don’t.” ID: 10074531 Stephanie McNeal is a social news editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

      "text": "Science confirms that comparing yourself to your Facebook friends is harmful to your mental health — but you probably already knew that Social media definitely has its upsides — especially for those of us whose friends are scattered across the country and world, making it difficult to find mutually convenient times for phone dates. But, in a study that reaffirms what we already knew, science confirms that comparing yourself to your Facebook friends is harmful to your mental health.\nResearchers from Lancaster University investigated the phenomenon of “Facebook depression,” a clinical term that refers to the depression that’s often developed by adolescents and pre-teens who spend an unhealthy amount of time on social media sites like Facebook.\nAfter reviewing studies from 14 countries, which involved 35,000 participants, the researchers concluded that comparing yourself to your Facebook friends has a different impact than comparing yourself to people in the real world — and the practice is more likely to make you depressed. Pexels Lead researcher Dave Baker investigated the data by using standardized measures of depression and cross-checking them with people’s social media habits.\n“We found that comparing yourself with people on social media was more likely to make you feel depressed than comparing yourself offline,” Baker tells Broadly . “Rumination—meaning you spend a lot of time overthinking your experiences online—was another. So if you log on and see something and you’re still thinking about it afterwards, that can make you become depressed.” Shutterstock However, one caveat is that research can’t confirm cause and effect — which leaves scientists with the question of whether Facebook makes people depressed, or unhappy people tend to spend more time on social media than their happier peers.\nFor example, science has shown that posting negative Facebook statuses is highly correlated with depression — but there’s no direct proof that Facebook is the cause of a person’s depression.\nShutterstock Social media isn’t going anywhere, so Baker hopes further research will help scientists determine ways these platforms can provide support for individuals suffering from depression or other mental illnesses. “I want to see whether social networking sites can be used as a supportive mechanism for bipolar disorder,” he says . Until then, let’s use the practice of “if you see something, say something.” If a Facebook friend posts a status indicating that he or she is struggling, it’ll only take a few minutes out of our day to reach out and express that we care and are here to listen if the person wants to talk. When someone is suffering from depression, seemingly small acts of kindness can make a world of difference.\nThe post Science confirms that comparing yourself to your Facebook friends is harmful to your mental health — but you probably already knew that appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nHAVANA (CBSMiami) – There are thousands and thousands of people at the Plaza of the Revolution paying homage to Fidel Castro.\nBut not everyone is mourning the former Cuban leader’s death.\nCBS4’s Eliott Rodriguez met Berta Soler in her home, where the Ladies in White leader is keeping a low profile.\n“We are not interested and not worried about whether or not Fidel Castro died, because for the Cuban people he’s been dead for a long time. He hasn’t run this country in 10 years,” she said.\nSoler and other women founded the group in 2003 after dozens of government opponents were rounded up and taken to jail.\nHer home has photos of her with world leaders and human rights activists in Cuba as well as the four Brothers to the Rescue members killed in the 1996 shoot down.\nAnd staring at her home is another photo she is not fond of.\nThe image of Castro was put there six months ago by neighbors who support the Castro regime and are mourning the death of the former Cuban leader.\n“I was happy to hear that Fidel Castro died,” she said. “I do not rejoice in the death of a fellow human being, but I do rejoice in the death of a dictator.”\nBut across Havana there is deep sorrow.\nLuis Muniz set up a small memorial outside of his home a block from the U. S. Embassy.\n“He was our leader, a leader respected around the world. We have lost him physically, but his ideas will continue to live on in Cuba,” he said.\nRodriguez asked him about the celebrations that are going on in Miami, explaining it’s not about the death of Castro but about a feeling in South Florida that there will be change.\nHe said he’s still is not comfortable with that.\nHe also knows about the Ladies in White and said he considers them mercenaries.\n",

      "title": "The Best Cheese In The World Is From Norway And Will Make Your Mouth Water",
      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \n“One cheese to rule them all.” \nI don’t think I’m making any waves when I say that cheese is honestly just the best. It’s better than most sunrises, and I love a decent chunk of my family members less than I love even mediocre Gouda. \nBut what is the best cheese? How can you even begin to qualify what would make one cheese universally better than the other? Who would win in a knives-only street fight: Cheddar or Swiss? \nThese are all equally important questions and thanks to the Guild of Fine Food, we finally have an answer to two of these. Giphy \nThis year’s World Cheese Awards (now in its 29th year), which were produced by the Guild and took place at the International Cheese Festival, has officially crowned the top cheese in the world. \nAll other cheeses can go jump off a building– AND THEN STRAIGHT INTO MY MOUTH!!!! GIMME GIMME GIMME! \nI present to you Kraftkar from the Tingvollost family farm in the village of Torjulvågen, Norway, the literal best cheese in the world. Bustle \nKraftkar, which beat out 3,000 other cheeses to take home the gold, ousted torta-style Cremositos Del Zújar and the washed rind goats’ milk Cala Blanc during a tie break to be named the best in the competition. \nNick Tsioros of Canada’s Olympic Cheese explained why this cheese is the best cheese, \nThe mould in this cheese is developed really nicely. It’s very evenly distributed. On top of that, the texture is great: when it crumbles you get a soft creaminess. And on the finish, it coats your tongue with a real soft landing. \nUnfortunately, this cheese is primarily available in Scandinavia and not, as I hoped, in the bodega around the corner from my apartment in Harlem. \nWho knows? They may expand, right?!?! RIGHT?!?!?!?! \nThere’s still no word on that knives-only street fight thing. My money is on Cheddar though. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss. Shares CITATIONS Bustle Bustle",

      "text": "  Congregants pack the New Light Christian Center in Houston, Texas during Sunday service. (Facebook/New Light Christian Center) \nA church in Texas has come up with a novel way to attract more members: Free mortgage and rent payments to lucky raffle ticket holders who will attend its New Year's Eve and New Year's Day service. \nAn official of New Light Christian Center in Houston, Texas, who requested anonymity, told The Christian Post on Monday that the annual raffle is the brainchild of the church's pastor, Bishop Ira V. Hilliard. \nThe more than 28,000-member megachurch made the special church service and raffle announcement on its Facebook page on Saturday. \n\"It's just a way to encourage members to come on out to service even though it's New Year's Day,\" the official said, adding that they began issuing tickets to the event in October. \nThe official said the number of lucky raffle prize winners is still undetermined but that an announcement regarding this will be made either on the night before or during the service itself. Advertisement \nAccording to its website, New Light Christian Center Church has six locations in Texas. The ministry includes a nationwide television ministry, an aviation division, a credit union and an early childhood development centre.   \nHilliard and his wife Bridget E. Harrison co-founded the church in September 1984. The church was honoured as one of the Top 50 Most Influential Churches in America. \nThe couple also founded the Association of Independent Ministries (AIM) fellowship with the objective of spiritually mentoring other pastors. Its current membership comprises more than 1,000 churches across America. \nThe church website noted that Hilliard began preaching God's Word at the age of nine, delivering his first sermon on a Mother's Day night at the age of 10. \nAbout a month ago, Hilliard was hospitalised with an unidentified health issue, according to The Christian Post. He recently returned to his church, which issued a statement saying that he was on the road to \"total healing.\" \n\"The Hilliard family and New Light Church appreciates your interest and concern regarding the health of Bishop I.V. Hilliard. Bishop is in great spirits and strong in faith for a supernatural recovery. Everyone that has attended to Bishop have been believers and stand in faith with us for total healing ... we continue to believe for a speedy recovery and total healing,\" the statement said.",

      "title": "21-Day Challenge for You",
      "text": "Here’s a special invite for you.\nI recently started a new private Facebook group (it’s free for readers like you), where the members commit to making a 21-day habit change.\nSo far I’ve used it to stop consuming artificial sweeteners and to start a daily habit of reading from a book for 20-minutes every day. (I read online articles and other ‘stuff’ all day, but had lapsed on my book reading… but now I’m back and reading almost a book a week!).\nThese 21-day habit change challenges are fun, and you’ll get the support and accountability you need to… \n• Wake up earlier\n• Finally finish your sales letter\n• Start a new business\n• Lose weight and feel great again\n• Stop drinking too much alcohol\n• Start drinking a green juice every day\n• Stop hitting the snooze button\n• Start writing every morning\nOr whatever habit it is that you want to change.\nJoin me in the habit change club — for free — here \nI’d love to see you in our groups participating and making change in your life. It’s a really great environment with over 900 members and the group has helped people overcome a lot of struggles.\nDecember will be an interesting challenge as we band together to fight through the excessive temptations of the holidays…\n…and January will bring a record number of new members and a high-energy environment for helping us all stick to our New Year’s Resolutions.\nIt’s an important place for all of us to get the support and accountability we need.\nI need it just as much as you do.\nI struggle with lots of temptations and bad habits.\nI like to say that the reason I’m so disciplined is because I’m so lazy and weak. If I didn’t have my systems in place, I’d be watching television 8 hours a day and doing nothing with my life.\nThe temptation is real, every day, but the Habit Change Club and my Perfect Day Formula systems lead me out of temptation and deliver me from evil.\nSo whatever you are struggling with, use the energy of the Habit Change Club to get you started on making big changes, and harness the power of the support and accountability to keep going through tough times.\nJoin me in the habit change club — for free — here \nHere’s what the accountability can do for you…\nWhen I first started last month’s challenge of reading for 20 minutes each day, there were many nights where I felt too tired to open a book before bed.\nOften there was other, less valuable, but more tempting activities that called my name (like watching a movie on my computer).\nBut I couldn’t let my friends in the Habit Change Club down. I had to live and lead by example, and so I did what I said I would do.\nYou’ll feel that way too, and when you share your goals and get accountability (even from strangers on the Internet), you’ll get the spark to energize you through the task of the day.\nIt’s like magic. I’ve witnessed this hundreds of times over the years in our Turbulence Training Transformation Contests. I’ve watched people go from struggling to success, literally changing their bodies, their lives, and their futures, simply because they finally had support and accountability in their lives.\nCatherine Gordon, our famous TT spokeswoman who has inspired tens of thousands of women to start using my programs, is one of our greatest examples. Catherine has gone from frustrated mom to TT Transformation Champion to personal trainer changing hundreds of lives at Gordon Studios in her hometown.\nThe accountability, the community, and the love of the ETR and TT world helped her through tough times, just as it will help you, and just as it has helped me finally figure out what I should really be doing with my life.\nAs much as I loved spreading the word of fitness and short workouts, it wasn’t until I wrote The Perfect Day Formula book and created the Perfect Life coaching program that I finally found my full purpose in life.\nThat’s why I’m so excited about 2017.\n“A field of grace seems to form around us when we commit ourselves to something that satisfies our souls,” writes Dr. Gay Hendricks in his book, Conscious Living. “Invisible pathways open up through the universe. We meet people who are on a similar path, and we are given forms of assistance that seem like Magic.”\nYES! This is so true. Everything seems so natural and easy now.\nI’ve discovered my magic, just as you will, if you dig deep into your heart and mind and figure out exactly what you’ve been put here on earth to do. It might not be overnight, and yes, you’ll have to set aside your ego and ask yourself difficult questions during the journey.\nBut you will have a big breakthrough.\nAnd when you do, your big breakthrough will lead to big breakthroughs for other people, just as my big breakthrough and business transformation has led to even bigger “A-ha moments” and breakthroughs for my Perfect Life Workshop clients.\n“This one day Perfect Life workshop was a game changer… and I’ve been working on myself, my structure and my entrepreneurial clarity for a decade. One breakthrough from the workshop is going to be worth $750K in new income to me over the next 12 months. I don’t know of any other ONE thing that can give a person so much focus, clarity and structure to live a perfect life and have a perfect business. Do whatever you have to in order to make it out to Craig’s next event!” – Bedros Keuilian\n“Craig, I’m fired up! Your coaching helped a lot with my clarity, purpose and focus. Thanks again for that and your continued support and friendship. Life is too short not to do new stuff and reinvent yourself, like Arnold, The Rock, and YOU! It’s so inspiring to see you in this new phase of your career exceeding what you did in fitness! Love it.” – Jason Ferruggia\nThat’s what change is all about… becoming the BEST version of yourself, at any age, no matter what you have accomplished – or struggled with – in the past.\nIf you’d like to attend a Perfect Life Workshop, you can apply here. \nLINK: www.PerfectLifeWorkshop.com \nTalk soon,\nCraig Ballantyne\n“The line between failure and success is so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it. How many times has a man thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort, a little more patience, would have achieved success? Just a little more effort and what seemed hopeless failure may turn into glorious success.” – Elbert Hubbard\nThe post 21-Day Challenge for You appeared first on Early To Rise .\n",

Hathaway needed to bring in more staff, but he wasn’t making enough to cover the extra insurance costs and staffing costs, he said. \nFor now, Hathaway is packing inventory up and putting it into storage, and said he plans to just catch his breath. Whether or not he’ll be able to bring the shop back to Boise is “a mystery,” but he plans to work on it starting next week, he said. \n“I built a place for the community and the community loves it, so I might as well make it happen,” he said.",

      "text": "Next \nBOYNTON BEACH, Fla. - This story had many of our viewers buzzing on Facebook this week. \nBoynton Beach Police say two local kids skipped school, stole two BB guns from a nearby Wal-Mart and took aim at cars driving along Minder Road at Ocean Parkway. The incident happened on Monday afternoon, prompting 911 calls. \nIf that wasn’t bad enough those BB guns looked like the real thing. And officers say that put their lives at risk. \nThis story could have ended badly but didn’t because of the instinct of the officers who responded to this scene. \nOne of them was K9 officer Mark Sohn, a 15-year veteran of the department. \n\"It looked 100% like the real fire arm,\" he told WPTV's Alanna Quillen in a follow up interview on Tuesday. \"It didn't have any orange tips. This could've turned out a lot worse than what it was.\" Monday afternoon, Officer Sohn responded to the scene and found two young boys fitting the 911 caller's description -- one wearing a yellow shirt and the other wearing a Spider-Man sweater. The boys were only 10 and 11-years old. The boys took off from officers but were found trying to hide in the yard of a nearby home. The boys were taken into police custody and questioned. \"You have to take that extra precaution to believe that it's a real firearm, not only for your own life but for the public's life,\" said Sohn. \"Many times we respond to calls and they are never what they seem to be in the first place. So you go in there, like yesterday's call with kids, maybe it's a BB gun but there's a chance that it might be a real firearm as well.\" Officer Sohn is thankful he and his colleagues made the right decision. \n\"As police officers we are trained to encounter certain situations and we're not here to take chances. If we believe it to be a real fire arm going to act accordingly,\" said Sohn. \nNot every situation is as fortunate. \"Especially nowadays, there are unprovoked attacks on law enforcement so you never know what you were getting into,\" he said. \"Around the country today there are a lot of officer involved shootings both with realistic and fake fire arms. I don't think it's anything any officer wants to do, it's kind of a last resort.\" Just across the street from where Sohn found the two boys, a daycare full of children. \"Glad no body got hurt walking by or driving by or anyone would have taken matters into their own hands,\" said Linda Martinez, a daycare worker at Tiny Tikes Academy. Martinez says she teaches her kids that guns -- even toy guns -- are no laughing matter. \"Guns are just plain not toys. It's not a funny issue. It's not anything anyone should play around with,\" she said. \nOfficer Sohn says parents need to teach their kids that safety is the number one priority when dealing with any kind of firearm, even toy guns that look real. \n\"They are meant to be used under the supervision of parents ages 16 and under. Obviously were dealing with 10 and 11-year-olds,\" he said. We couldn't get a hold of either boys parents, but Officer Sohn made it clear to the boys that they got away lucky they were not hurt. \"I gave them a pep talk. I think they were a little naive to believe that it could've ended worse,\" he said. \"Mom was pretty supportive of the point we were trying to make to them, which was -- that it's not safe and they shouldn't be skipping school to partake in criminal activity like this.\" Because no driver came forward to press charges of any damage, Boynton Beach police released the boys back to their mothers. Police also spoke with Wal-mart officials, who are not pressing theft charges because no one witnessed the boys steal the BB guns. Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Facebook's Getting Into Gaming Again With Messenger Games Remember 'Farmville,' guys? Facebook November 29, 2016 F acebook , the third-biggest website in the world and a Silicon Valley juggernaut on the bleeding edge of technology, thinks that Pac-Man , a video game created in 1980, is the future. On Tuesday, the company announced that it’s adding a suite of video games to its popular Messenger app, including titles like Words With Friends and EverWing in addition to the ‘80s classic. There will be 17 launch titles to start, though Facebook will probably roll out more in the future. “Earlier this year, we introduced a simple game of basketball on Messenger that allowed you to play some virtual hoops by sending an emoji to your friends,” the head of Messenger at Facebook, David Marcus, explained in a post . “1.2 billion plays later, we knew we were on to something.” “Games are social by definition, so this experience encourages interaction, competition and celebration with leaderboards, group chat opportunities and easy ways to challenge any of your Messenger contacts,” Marcus continued, sounding very much like a normal human being and not at all like an alien who has studied (but not mastered) basic social interactions. The games don’t appear to be that complex or impressive, but that’s probably the whole point. Casual gaming, especially on mobile devices, has become a welcome distraction and time suck for many a bored commuter. Facebook’s library of games are accessible by design and will likely draw countless users in — though we’ll have to wait and see if anything approaches Farmville -like levels of mania. The video accompanying the news is puzzling, to say the least. Using visuals that were unquestionably ripped off from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World , the spot follows a nondescript office-type as he battles friends and family in Messenger’s various new games. At the end, he wins the affection of a hip new gamer girlfriend by losing in a game of EverWing . It’s somewhere south of cute and just north of icky. It’s the type of ad that some marketers either thought about way too much or way too little. Plus, we’re talking about playing Pac-Man on a mobile phone. Maybe Facebook is giving itself a little too much credit. Photos via Facebook James Grebey @jgrebes \nJames Grebey is a writer, reporter, and fairly decent cartoonist living in Brooklyn.

      "text": "Who is \"The Guy\" on this team? By Nick_H22 on Nov 29, 2016, 11:32pm EST +  Share Share on Facebook + Comments \nOn the eve of the ACC/BIG Ten Challenge matchup with Ohio State, I can't help but wonder who will score for this team in a time of need. The days of Joe Harris hitting a clutch three are long gone. Justin Anderson isn't coming back from Dallas to throw one down to motivate the team. Sadly, Malcolm Brogdon isn't here to put the team on his back anymore either. It's my biggest worry about this team. When a big time ACC team is in the JPJ and the game is tight, who gets the ball to take a big shot? \nIs it the obvious answer of the senior leader London Perrantes? London is great. I can't stress enough how grateful I am to have been fortunate enough to have watched the Cali cool point guard develop in his four years into the star that he is today. I just don't see him as someone who gets the ball in a big situation. He's shown that he can create for his teammates, as any good point guard should, but is he going to be the go to guy? He can certainly hit clutch threes when the team needs them, but in a tie game with 10 seconds left, is London going to be able to create a shot for himself? I just don't see it. \nI think it would be unfair to have this conversation without mentioning the current leading scorer, Darius Thompson. Thompson saw his role diminish a bit last year and saw minutes hard to come by towards the end of the year. However, he has stepped into the starting lineup this year and been very efficient. I think he's quite underrated for his athleticism and he's more than capable of hitting open threes. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean he can create shots on his own. Most of the shots Thompson knocks down tend to be spot up threes or fast break finishes. I just don't view him as someone who will create on his own (Yes, I got just as excited as you when he hit the greatest shot of all time at Wake). \nMaybe it's the 3rd year from Ottawa coming off the bench, Marial Shayok. Throughout his two years and change at UVA, Shayok has shown that he's a capable offensive threat. His defense is solid enough to keep Tony putting him in the game, but he has an obvious offensive mindset about him. Every time Shayok gets the ball he seems to be thinking score. He would be my best bet as to who gets the ball in a must score situation, but that's also worrisome because I definitely feel that he forces his chances at times. \nThe final option that I can see is the MacDonald's All American, Kyle Guy. So far it seems as though Tony doesn't fully trust Guy to get major minutes based on a defensive standpoint. That certainly doesn't mean that as the year progresses that Guy won't see more playing time, but it would be a lot to ask of a first year to hit the big shot. Is that what a MacDonald's All American should be able to do? I guess we'll see going forward. \nTo me, it just seems that this team will struggle in big games. They've dominated small competition as a team so far, but who can step up when it matters? Do I hope I'm wrong about the lack of playmakers? Of course. I just can't help but feel some cautious pessimism about who put this team on their back in their time of need. FanPosts are user-generated content not necessarily endorsed by Streaking The Lawn.

She seemed to be blaming Facebook for Hillary Clinton's loss because of the fake news stories. \nThe reason Donald Trump won over Hillary is because of her personality toward the American people. \nIf you want to quit Facebook, that is your right. The people had heard enough of Clinton being negative. I guess people wanted to ride the Trump train rather than be on a sinking ship. \nThe people voted on what they heard from the parties and voted for who they believed in. \nTerry Craft",

      "text": "The Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Secretariat. Photo: Facebook.\nJNS.org – A Jerusalem-based watchdog of non-governmental organizations said Monday that its efforts to reveal that an international funding mechanism supports anti-Israel initiatives have led Norway to abandon its position as a financial donor to the group.\nNGO Monitor wrote in an email to supporters that the group had alerted Norwegian stackholders and “fully briefed” Israeli officials about its research into the Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Secretariat (IHL Secretariat), which — as the watchdog group wrote in September fact sheet — devoted $5.78 million of a $17.6 million total budget to 13 organization supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.\nThe Israeli officials then raised NGO Monitor’s concerns with their Norwegian counterparts, the organization said, and “this, coupled with the negative media attention, led many Norwegian officials to acknowledge the depth of Israel’s concerns about this problematic funding scheme, ultimately leading [the Norwegian government] to leave the IHL Secretariat.”\n 30, 2016 12:55 am 0 Revealed: In Private Fundraiser, Keith Ellison Said Israel Controls US Policy Congressman Keith Ellison's announcement earlier this month that he wants to be the Democratic National Committee's next chairman drew quick support from...\nNorway had joined the IHL Secretariat earlier this year and contributed about $300,000 to the group — though NGO Monitor stated it is “unclear how this funding was used” — before departing. Governments who continue to fund the organization include Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark.\nNGO Monitor added that it continues its efforts to get the Netherlands to follow Norway’s lead on departing from the IHL Secretariat.\nThe institute said its research was recently mentioned twice on the floor of the Dutch Parliament, but that the Dutch Policy and Operations Evaluation Department’s most recent review of government funding failed to “professionally, effectively, and impartially” analyze Dutch funding of groups with ties to terrorism and BDS.",

If you enjoy playing classic style games from the era before Facebook was born, you’re in for a treat. And the best thing about this, you get to compete with your Facebook friends inside the app. \n\nA number of games are available for play including EverWing, Space Invaders, Track & Field 100M, Galaga, and much more. \nThe feature will be initially available for select 30 counties and will slowly roll out to more. It’s available for ” newer iOS and Android operating systems” according to Facebook.",

      "text": "By Juste Semetaite In Blogroll , Freelancers , Small Business , Tips & Advice 30 Nov 2016 First of all, let’s see what this is all about. Well, Facebook gives a chance to a mobile app developer to target or sell his app to a refined and very specific audience. Not only it helps you find new clients, but it also helps you keep them interested and engaged over a longer period of time, so your promotional campaign is now sustainable. Now, that we know what Facebook Ads for Mobile Developers is all about, let’s take a closer look at a few critical aspects. Okay. So essentially, the main benefit of using Facebook for promoting your mobile app is a targeted audience based on sex, interests and even age group. Likewise, it helps you keep your audience interested over time, and, last but not least, it gives you access to all these remarkable analytics reports so you can further shape your campaigns for an even higher turnover. Create a Business Page A Facebook Business page helps you interact with the right audience in the right away. It also ensures a better online presence. Users can like your page, share your posts, and the beauty is that you can always respond to them in this manner. Taylor the right Ads Audience If you got a mobile app, you certainly want it to fall into the right hands. And you want people to engage with it, and spread the word about it, right? With Facebook Ads, you can now target your ad campaigns based on interests, sex, age, and location. Isn’t that just stunning? Remarket your ads After you have successfully ended your first campaign, you get some sort of a remarketing list. It means you can always get back and re-engage the audience from the previous campaigns, which are usually people that already love your app. Leverage the Audience Network Power By using the Audience Network, you have the ability to easily adapt your campaign efforts with other third party apps that may come handy at some point in time. Taking your time to better understand this concept will surely help you to gain more and more clients each and every day. Performance Reports. Analytics. Statistics. \nSome might argue that this stuff is simply boring and absolutely NOT necessary for achieving success. It may be true in some instances, but let’s assume for a second that you have already had success with past campaigns. Would you mind having a 10% or 15% increase in your sales just by fine-tuning your ads, because you saw an opportunity after “consulting” with these Performance, Analytics, Statistics, and other “mind-numbing” reports? Are we on the same page now? Great 🙂 Target specific Devices It’s quite breathtaking that you can really target devices with Facebook Ads, isn’t it? Imagine, you can promote your app to specific android devices only… Uncle Sam would probably laugh at me right now. But hey, new smartphones always come out with features that are lacking in older devices. What if you want to target devices with this specific sensor that came out just yesterday? Well, you can (and you should). Strategy for success First of all, it is crucial to use authentic content for your ads. And it is equally important to visually show what your app does to grab consumer attention and increase their interest. A good advice would be to include a mobile image in your ads. A respectable clear call to action button like “install now” will help you generate more leads. Successfully launching a mobile app isn’t easy, but with Facebook, the process can be less painful. The thing is that you have to make experiments, update your ads from time to time and see if you get positive results. And don’t forget to take a look at Facebook Analytics! Remember, knowledge is power, and in your case, it really means pure PROFIT. \n\nAbout the Author: \nSilviu Isidor is a senior Business Student, and a business owner.

      "text": "butterbutter4cr Embed Why haven't you started using Facebook for marketing your business? Are you in need of some of your Facebook marketing questions being answered? Do you want proven advice? This article can give you all that and more. Do not hesitate to share links to other sites on Facebook. If you come across an article or a video your audience will be interested in, think about sharing it on Facebook. It is best to avoid sharing links to website you are in competition against or you could lose customers. All content on your site should be easy to Like and Share on Facebook. It should also appear in shortened form with a link on your Facebook wall. If people are able to share your content with their followers, you'll find that your reach begins to expand exponentially, and so will your profits. Do not wait too long in between posts, or you can risk your audience being swayed by another business owner. People these days have a need for loads of information. if they get that then they have to wait to receive anymore, they will become bored and impatient. Try post at least once every day or two. Remember to respect your followers privacy when using Facebook to market your business. If someone sends you a glowing review through a private message, remember to ask their permission before making it public. They may have chosen to send you the message that way because they did not want to be publicly acknowledged. Regulate your page for spam. You can put filters in place that will help you to keep things on track when you are away. Anyone with admin rights can put in keywords into the filter that are going to be filtered out. Try using custom tabs on your Facebook page. When you first create your business Facebook page, you'll have general tabs like the Wall and Info tabs. Try extending your capabilities by creating your own custom tabs. Some businesses have tabs that contain links to various kinds of content like products, newsletters, and ongoing contests. Don't think of your fans as numbers. That's a big no-no in Facebook marketing. You aren't collecting numbers, you are building brand champions. You are creating a community of people who love your company or brand. Treat them with the respect that they are due. These people can make a difference for your company. Make listening your main thing. This life lesson is really important on Facebook too. People don't want to be talked at. They want to be talked to. That means hearing them and responding based off of the conversation. The better listener you are on Facebook, the more fans that you'll make. Try using a call-to-action graphic to convert visitors to your page into followers of your page. This will encourage people to \"like\" your page in order to receive some discount or content. When people come to your page, all they see is \"like our page for more info\", then after they like the page, they can see the content. Only post content on your Facebook page that is relevant to the interests of your target audience. Don't let yourself get caught up in the social aspect and start posting everything you find interesting. Keeping your posts relevant will better engage your audience than having lots of pointless posts. Facebook is more effective if you use it as a connection builder, so do not use it the same way you would use a direct marketing tool. If everything you post is marketing related, you may lose a lot of fans. People tend to be more interested in your business as a whole, and they don't want to be feel like you are spamming them. Encourage two-way communication with your customers. If a customer posts a great photo of your product or service, share it with everyone. Also take advantage of the Reply feature getting rolled out to respond directly to particular comments on an individual basis. Facebook allows for both group and individual communication simultaneously. Do not subscribe to paying services that claim they can help you get more subscribers. You have no way of knowing how new subscribers will be targeted. It is best to promote your Facebook page yourself to make sure all the subscribers are likely to purchase your products or share your updates with their friends. http:// jewishbusinessnews.com/2016 /11/14/facebook-responds-to-accusations-of-racism-updates-ethnic-affinity-marketing/ … and discounts. People love feeling like they are part of an exclusive group. If you give offers that only those that are fans can take advantage of, then you are helping build some real brand loyalty among your fans. They'll definitely pay attention for more opportunities. Remember to keep questions you ask in order to engage your readers simple on your Facebook page. Although you want to keep it interesting, the simpler a question is to respond to, the more people will do so! Posing a query that needs only a one or two word answer will garner you the greatest number of reactions. You have to realize that the number of subscribers is not necessarily a good indicator of how http://www. business2community.com/mark eting/quality-quantity-influencer-marketing-done-right-01714572 … is at the time. Customers on Facebook that really want to know about you are the ones who should be targeted. Measure the success of the campaign you are running by looking at the conversion rates. With this advice at the ready, your heart providing the drive and your soul giving you the impetus to succeed, you now are primed and ready to start your campaign. Get to the drawing board and use the tips you've read to begin. When you get the job done, you'll be so proud of what you've accomplished. Read next page",

      "text": "Photo Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, in San Francisco in April. Credit Stephen Lam/Reuters Ever since the election, there’s been endless finger-pointing at Facebook by those who blame it for letting malicious “fake news” onto its social platform. So it must have been refreshing for opinion editors at The New York Times to have a piece that actually gave Facebook a bit of a break. The piece , by the journalist Jessica Lessin, argued that Facebook should not be expected to accept the type of fact-checking responsibilities that some critics say should come with being the dominant news aggregator. “No matter how many editors Facebook hired, it would be unable to monitor the volume of information that flows through its site, and it would be similarly impossible for readers to verify what was checked,” she wrote. Who is this woman brave enough to come forward in Facebook’s defense? Lessin’s tagline identifies her as the founder of a technology website, The Information . And near the end of her piece, she mentions in passing that her husband briefly worked at Facebook. What neither Lessin nor The Times’s opinion editors told readers is that Lessin and her husband, Sam, have close ties to Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. Sam Lessin is a long-time friend of Zuckerberg since their days at Harvard . When young Zuckerberg was shopping for money to start his business, Sam took him around to meet investors . When Sam had a business of his own, Zuckerberg bought it , and then Sam went to work at Facebook. He became the social media giant’s vice president overseeing product, and one of a handful of top executives who reported directly to Zuckerberg. The Facebook founder was even reported to be in the wedding party when Sam and Jessica got married. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story I wouldn’t expect Times editors to necessarily put all that information in a piece explaining Jessica Lessin’s connections to a company she’s writing about. But simply saying her husband “worked at Facebook for a brief period” doesn’t cut it. Clearly, there is the potential for a conflict of interest here and one that readers should be made aware of. After all, the author landed a spot on the coveted New York Times Op-Ed page for a piece that could easily be interpreted as largely defending Facebook.",

      "text": "Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg said the social network bans content \"based on context\", indicating that News Feed algorithm fixes to remove hoaxes and scams are highly unlikely in the near future.(Photo : Justin Sullivan Via Getty Images) \nFacebook is increasingly becoming everyone's choice for news and other information but low standards and Mark Zuckerberg's stance had let in many websites that lack factual basis on certain reports that use images to attract attention and relay messages. Zuckerberg blames both US political factions for the spread of propaganda -- an indication that it may not be able to fix hoax news in everyone's feeds. Advertisement \nAccording to Slate.com , Facebook has a \"more permissive stance\" towards the US President-Elect Donald Trump and other politicians and public figures. A Facebook Spokesperson said, \"When we review reports of content that may violate our policies, we take context into consideration\" that may include value of political discourse. Advertisement \nAccording to Newsweek Europe , Facebook can never fix hoaxes in its network and could potentially harm its social media brand. Newsweek Tech Writer Kevin Massey cited an anonymous Facebook insider mentioning Facebook's lackluster attempts to remove hoax websites from its system could potentially damage the brand. Massey also commented on Facebook becoming a \"media site\" setting up deals with publishers populating timelines with stories that maximize profit. \nThe Facebook news feed works by selecting the most relevant and engaging stories. It choose the best content out of several thousand stories spreading in its network each day. It prioritizes stories that each individual users would like, click and share. Because the more engaging the content the more people return to Facebook -- aside from seeing the latest tagged photos and videos of friend and family. Advertisement \nFacebook is clearly an ineffective medium for information. If a user likes, clicks or shares a harassment video, \"hate\" post or even a racial slur, Facebook's news feed algorithm -- along with Zuckerberg's stance -- would allow it \"based on context\". This is what allowed many political posts without factual sources and possible scams such as \" The Blessing Loom \" to surface and spread like wildfire. \nUnless Facebook adopts Twitter's social content rules that apply to everyone including politicians and leaders -- rules that ban users who encourage hate messages or disturbing actions -- it still has hope. Brand is not the only thing Facebook has that gets damaged; it also damages the world's mentality.  ",

      "text": "225 I have an account on Facebook. My dog also has an account which I use to keep tabs on all this Facebook malfeasance (since 2007ish or whenever they opened it up to non-college people and dogs.) Once, my account (my dog) was blocked because someone reported me as not a real person. I changed my (my dog’s) last name and happily continued to be on Facebook. I expect I will get reported again for the same reason and I will gladly send them my (my dog’s) AKA papers which has his parentage and welp date. They will deny me continued use as my dog is not a real person, but by then, I will have become someone else and my friends(?) will find me and follow me there. Dogs are pretty clever that way. (If you know me and care about me, you’ll find me and my dog…. I trust that about my friends…) I have — up to now — used my “real” persona on Facebook for business, rather straight-laced, down the middle type stuff. The Right and Left in my world both buy what I sell and money is money. Recently, though, I’ve gotten more “political” with ideas like From the nomination to the 2016 election, there are 100 days. I intend to write one letter each day to Hillary Clinton… medium.com and frame medical care not so much within a political and moral sturcture, but as just good business as we continue to slide ever more into a gig economy, where companies should just get out of the health insurance game for their own survival. Companies that will thrive in the next century are those that automate the routine and invest in people for the next new ideas. I suspect the day is coming where we will have to all make a choice. But I digress… I don’t understand people who resign in protest. I think they are better equipped to counter the creuelty of a “job” inside the organization rather than shaking their fist at the glass windows of a nameless, faceless building. Kindness, empathy and truth will always gum up the works for profit-seeking corporations. Kindness, empathy and truth will probably eventually get the employee fired, but they will have eased the pain for others in the meantime. I intend to stay within the system as long as I can get away with it, doing just that. Kindness, empathy and truth scares power. They lash out with cruelty and anger. But then, you know you’ve hit a nerve, their Achilles Heel. When someone gets angry at empthy, kindness and truth, you know you have exposed their weak spot. They may strike me down in anger (they did Jesus and look how that turned out in the long arc… it even spawned a movie series Star Wars !) but my words — spoken/written with truth, empathy and kindness — will live on way past my expiration date. Now that I committed the Mortal Sin of Blasphemy by comparing myself to Jesus, I’ll be off to Facebook and see if I can’t redeem myself by saving at least one soul over there today. And saying three Hail Marys and one Our Father….",

Show Caption Previous Next \nPolice departments frequently use social media to try to identify criminals caught in the act on camera. \nFor example, in Mentor, police asked residents to help identify a man who allegedly stole jackets from a local retail store. \nBut when residents start posting pictures, they walk a fine line between being helpful and calling out innocent people. \nA post to a local neighborhood community page shows two people just walking outside. \nBut the resident who posted the photo claimed the pair \"seem to be up to no good.\" \nAnd a post to a Lakewood community Facebook page warned of a white van that was allegedly involved in home break-ins. But police said they've received no complaints about the white van. \n\"The problem is someone decides to post something, a picture of somebody or something going on, but they don't know the full story,\" national security expert Tim Dimoff told News 5. \nDimoff said people can let their emotions drive their actions to post. \n\"Many people will post stuff on social media because of what they strongly believe, but it's not what they strongly know.\" \nDimoff said the best thing to do is send the picture directly to the police department.

      "title": "Burial - Young Death / Nightmarket",
      "text": "Share on Facebook 6 Since their accidental distribution on Black Friday's Record Store Day at Toronto's Sonic Boom, the new Burial release has taken industry press by storm — this is the most coverage the sample aficionado has received since classics like \"Nova\" and his LP, Untrue. That said, it's difficult to gauge whether the 12-inch single warrants a similar, overwhelmingly positive critical reception. \"Young Death\" and \"Nightmarket\" revive all the familiar stylistic trappings that are native to masterpieces like Untrue , only with a demure interest in arpeggiated synths and their ability to steer tracks with only scattered percussion. The conviction that marked tracks like \"Arc Angel\" is lost to wispy, disembodied vocal samples that are either too invested in structural variance to truly ensnare the listener, or wallow too long in their own moodiness. While Burial's melancholic dubstep underpinnings have reaped extensive praise, it's unclear whether this release has the soul to reel listeners in in quite the same way. The London producer emphasizes structural variety over substance, and relies on former sonic signatures to push a release that remains distinguished within the electronic landscape. However, in the context of his oeuvre, Young Death / Nightmarket listens like just another cut of the same. ( Hyperdub ) Get It",

      "text": "Share on Facebook 6 Spec. is producer Timm Ewest of Stuttgart, Germany. With a few EPs behind him, he's taken on the audacious task of creating his debut album of tech-house from Mobb Deep samples (using Havoc's USB stick). The result is almost as dark as the source material, channelling the minimalist tension of Havoc's original production style (so well-suited to Mobb Deep's harsh street-realism). Perhaps the darkest track is \"Black Cocaine,\" which opens with Ice-T's \"This is not supposed to be positive…\" intro rant, and is then carried by the mechanical percussion and dirty bass sample. Unfortunately, the word \"mechanical\" also applies to much of the rest of the album, as Spec. seems reluctant to alter the original samples or lose their character, resulting in static loops that seem cut and pasted together at times. The string pad on \"Intro\" never even gets the slightest filter sweep, and even though the organ stabs on \"Hightimes\" do get a bit of sweeping, the same sample repeats for the entire seven minutes. Hopefully his next outing allows him more freedom to develop and play with texture. (Infamous Tracks) Get It",

      "text": "Loading... \nMy friend Denise actually posted this question on Facebook, but I decided to steal it and use it here. \n“Does anyone know if you have a smart TV and Amazon Prime, already is there anything beneficial about having the Fire Stick?” \nFirst, let’s talk about just what a smart TV actually is. It’s like TV with a great big tablet built in. You use a remote instead of a touchscreen to navigate, but like a tablet, it depends on an Internet connection and is capable fo running apps. What types of apps you can run on your TV depends on the manufacturer. A Fire Stick is really designed to be a low-cost substitute for a smart TV. If give you many of the same features you’d get with a much more expensive smart TV. \nUsually, you’ll be able to run apps for services like Netflix, Showtime, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. \nA Fire Stick is really designed to be a low-cost substitute for a smart TV. If give you many of the same features you’d get with a much more expensive smart TV. You just plug it into the HDMI port on your television. Fire TV normally costs around $40, but sometimes will go on special for around $30. \nThere are two reasons you might consider a Fire Stick if you already have a smart TV. If you have Amazon Prime and your TV doesn’t offer the Amazon Prime Video app, the Fire Stick would allow you to watch video programming. \nAlso, the Fire Stick does offer voice controls with the Alexa virtual assistant, so you can start apps or play programs without having to push any buttons. You’ll also be able to use Alexa for other tasks like playing your Prime Music or searching for information on the Internet.",

      "title": "Brown Hired As Police Contributor For ABC News",
      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) – Back in September, when pressed about what he would be doing after his October retirement, former Dallas police chief David Brown would only provide a coy response. He repeatedly said, “That’s nobody’s business but me and my baby.” Now, it’s everybody’s business. ABC News announced Wednesday that Brown has been hired as a contributor for the organization. According to a statement, Brown will offer a “unique perspective to inform our reporting on many of the nation’s fault lines — economic inequality, gun violence, race relations, policing and social justice.” The former police chief begin his work with ABC News in January. “It’s been an honor and it’s been humbling to serve as the Dallas police chief,” Brown said during his September statement. He had been with the Dallas Police Department for 33 years — his entire career — leading them for more than six years. “That’s a long time to be somewhere.” Brown is the Dallas Police Department’s longest-serving chief. During his time, he achieved the city’s largest crime reduction and cut down on deadly force by issuing 1,000 body cameras to his officers. He also made great strides in community policing, and was praised by city officials . The chief was inspired to become a police officer in Dallas, he said, by a desire to bring change to his Oak Cliff neighborhood, which had been deteriorating due to drug problems. Brown went to attend college in Austin, but dropped out early in order to return to Dallas and join the force. “I came here to serve, in any capacity that the department chose to assign me to,” the chief said. “I really thought that being a public servant was a high calling.” Brown ended up having a great impact on the entire city. “I felt like I’ve accomplished the goal of serving,” he said. The former chief’s retirement came two months after the downtown police shootings that took the lives of five officers. But the tragic incident, Brown said, did not impact his retirement decision. Something being said in the days following the attack, however, did make Brown feel uncomfortable — the notion that he was now untouchable. “The job of a police chief is to be challenged. The job of a public servant is to be criticized,” Brown said in September. “The idea of being untouchable has not felt right to me.” Still, many people across North Texas and the nation were impressed by how Brown handled the downtown Dallas ambush in July. The tragic incident pushed his name into the greater public’s mind. “Blue Bloods” actor Tom Selleck even stated on “The View” that he cast his presidential vote in November for David Brown .",

Our response, he says, should be to meditate on this glory all month and watch for glory interactions wherever you are. \nChuck says the Lord told him on Nov. 27, \"The next 10 days are critical.\" \n\"Everything seems critical and for the Lord to say it like that ... there's still something about this election we're not getting. This is a God-thing we are in, and things are going to turn upside down,\" Chuck shares. \"I gave a word eight years ago that said, 'In 2016, the Electoral College will be the issue.' God is dealing with a structure in this nation that will cause the future to be reprogrammed.\" \nIn his prophetic discussion, Chuck also asserts Russia will again be prominent this year. One can see the stage being set for this reality. Chuck insists it's vital to understand what God is doing in the church in Russia. \n\"With Fidel Castro dying, things are about to change as never before,\" Chuck says. \"It has to do with the way we worship in freedom. It has to do with us in this nation and the nations aligning ... What is happening right now is very key. With Fidel Castro dying and Donald Trump coming into office, there will be a realignment. The nations are realigning in the earth for a great latter-day shift, a great harvest shift, great movement from Russia into Israel for fulfillment. You're looking at a real key team in that shift.\" \nProphetically, Chuck sees a true apostolic move coming, one that has never been in Russia, and he declares the prophetic dynamic of that nation will come alive. \n\"There is only a short, 10-year window for this revival. Russia, Hong Kong and America represent a triangle God is forming; He is redoing the alignments of the nations. Because of Mr. Trump, we will remain aligned with Israel for this short, 10-year window,\" Chuck says. \"What it represents in your life is an unlocking and a restoration of the captivities of the past. This is a fulfillment of the captivities of the past being broken off of us. You are in a place where the glory of God will realign nations. All the dragon nations will have to realign. What you are hearing today is key. Don't try to understand it with your mind. It will redo the way we do things in days ahead. Quit being legalistic in the way you think and operate; this is a time of change like never before.\" advertisement \nChuck plans to pull an apostolic-prophetic network from every one of those nations and review the teachings that need to get in. Then, he prophesies, Cuba will come alive. \n\"The door to Cuba that is now open will be an open door with many, many enemies involved. I say to Florida, get ready! You must secure a glory road throughout that state or else what would come through will form a government in Atlanta,\" Chuck says. \n\"This is a time that I am realigning the lands and the people of the lands. Lay down your prejudices and your political gleanings—what I am doing is way above this. I am creating a government in the earth that will shake things in a new way. I am working both the heavens and the earth. These next 10 days are critical to aligning the heavens, the earth and the nations of the earth. Get ready, for I have brought you here for a time such as this.\" \nThe Lord told me He is releasing the angels of abundant harvest.

      "text": "It’s fun to be 1!\nOn Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the popular social media site to share a photo to mark daughter Max ‘s first birthday. In it, Zuckerberg and wife Dr. Priscilla Chan are holding their little girl while all three family members sport festive birthday hats amidst a background of balloons.\n“I can’t believe it’s been a year! And she kissed me on the cheek for the first time yesterday,” the proud papa, 32, wrote next to the snap, adding a smiley-face emoji.\n“Here’s to many more years of happiness and health for Max and all children around the world,” he added.\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

She’s got a lot of election nights ahead of her,” Zuckerberg captioned a Facebook photo he posted the day after Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United States, showing himself and Max watching TV as the results rolled on.\nHe added, “Holding Max, I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children. This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.”\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch Mark Zuckerberg Give His Best Piece of Parenting Advice \nIt’s likely an extra sweet milestone for the couple, who tied the knot at their Palo Alto, California, home in 2012, considering the struggles they have shared in the past about their road to conception .\n“You just love that little being so much, more than you ever thought was possible,” pediatrician Chan told Today’ s Savannah Guthrie — who herself is currently expecting a baby boy — in September.\n“And you have so many hopes and dreams for that child. And that drives me to want to work harder and invest now to make sure that the future is where it needs to be for all of our children.”",

      "text": "All Other Social Networks Pastor Greg Fryer sets up his prayer booth. ( Facebook ) \nJoin us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com . \nA New York pastor is offering spiritual advice for five cents, similar to Lucy van Pelt of Peanuts fame. \nGregory Fryer, the pastor of Immanuel Lutheran Church in the Upper East Side, speaks Jesus from the streets as people pull up outside his booth and ask him for prayer. \nFryer has been praised for the \"audacity, the courage to brazenly sit there out there in public and offer to deal with important matters.\" \nOf his booth, Fryer says: I do this booth both for fun and for real. Passersby often give me a smile, but many of them are off to work on Tuesday mornings when I have my booth. Still, some take a seat on the stool. \"I think I'm getting a cold. Could you pray for me?\" \"I am on my way to a job interview. This is very important. Could you pray for me?\" I do. I take their hand and pray for them. One young woman sat down and burst into tears. She was worried for her grandmother in Florida. People take a seat to talk about romance and family and illness and grief. \"Could you pray for me?\" And I do. The sign says \"5 cents,\" but that is simply part of the joke. I have a plate full of nickels for people to use if they want to put one into Lucy's jar. People smile and put money in the jar—nickels and quarters and bills. I think they like the idea of a pastor being on the sidewalk. At first, when I began my Tuesday-morning booth, I hoped people would notice our church, maybe go inside for some free coffee or to pray. So, at first, I hoped that people would notice us. But now, I find myself noticing them, more and more. I imagine that I am Jason Bourne, and I try to memorize the faces of the people streaming by. They are our neighbors.This booth is confirming what many of us suspect: There is spiritual need in our town. \n3 Reasons Why you should read Life in the Spirit. 1) Get to know the Holy Spirit. 2) Learn to enter God's presence 3) Hear God's voice clearly! Go deeper! \nHas God called you to be a leader? Ministry Today magazine is the source that Christian leaders who want to serve with passion and purpose turn to.

Steve DiMeglio , USA TODAY Sports 3:23 p.m. EST November 30, 2016 x Share Woods hasn’t played since finishing in a tie for 10th in the Wyndham Championship in August 2015. USA TODAY Sports Woods lines up a putt on the first green during the pro-am ahead of the Hero World Challenge. (Photo: Christian Petersen, Getty Images) \nNASSAU, Bahamas – Tiger Woods has put the rumors to bed about his demise since he arrived at Albany Golf Club last Saturday to put the final touches on his return to competitive golf for the first time in 15 months. \nAhead of Thursday’s first round of the Hero World Challenge at Albany Golf Club, Woods has shown the golf world he is healthy, he is powerful and long and he is relaxed and upbeat before finally getting back inside the ropes. \nThere are no disasters in wait at the end of his chipping clubs, his driver has been the best club in his bag through sessions on the range, practice rounds and the pro-am. He looks in sync with the new clubs in his bag – the three TaylorMade metal woods – looks comfortable with his Nike irons and trusty Scott Cameron putter in his hands and looks more than happy with the Bridgestone ball he is putting in play for the first time in his 20-year pro career. \nNow, however, the most scrutinized and criticized golfer on the planet has one more question to answer: Will he compete against a world-class field that includes Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, defending champion Bubba Watson and Ryder Cup hero Patrick Reed? \nIt’s a big ask even for the man with 14 majors and 79 PGA Tour titles. Is Tiger Woods back? He talks a good game, but we'll see if he can compete \nThe field is stout. The course likely will be windswept. And there will be plenty of rust Woods needs to shed. \nThe former No. 1 – who has fallen to No. 898 – said his biggest concerns this week are the adrenaline rushes he will feel for the first time in 466 days and the need to quickly find a rhythm to his rounds. Both will become heightened concerns if the wind howls over this flat, sand-encompassed course, intensifying his worries about flying his shots the proper distances and dealing with some of the best players in the world. \nAnd he hasn’t putted and chipped to tucked pin positions in competition for 15 months. Nor has he looked at a scoreboard to see where he stands. \nAll told, the thinking here is Woods shoots 70 to 73 (par is 72) in the first round and battles to finish mid-pack come Sunday. Considering his absence, that should be considered a confident outcome heading into 2017. Considering his back, if he finishes 72 holes without a health incident should be favorably received by one and all. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Tiger Woods has won 79 times on the PGA Tour, three short of the all-time record held by Sam Snead. Here, on June 15, 2008, Woods makes a birdie on the 18th green to force an 18-hole playoff with Rocco Mediate at the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines. Woods won that playoff the next day for his 65th victory and 14th major. Now, take a look back at all 79 of Woods' victories. Gary A.
