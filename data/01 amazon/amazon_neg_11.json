      "text": "Nov. 13, 2016 Amazon Expecting ‘Limited Quantities’ of NES Classic Online retailer Amazon details when and how you can pick up Nintendo’s retro mini console. By Jose Otero UPDATE: On Twitter, Amazon says \"We're out of stock on the NES Classic Edition. We will let you know when we get more in stock.\"\nDemand for the system appears to have briefly crashed the site . Not even joking. NES Classic killed Amazon. This is the homepage right now. pic.twitter.com/R9MvYiQH7h — Seth G. Macy (@sethmacy) November 11, 2016 \nOriginal story follows: The NES Classic Edition, a miniature retro games console made by Nintendo, will go up for sale on Amazon at 2:00 p.m. PT on Friday, November 11, the company announced today. Purchases of the console are limited to one per customer, and the company said that 1-Click Ordering will be disabled for NES Classic Edition. “We have very limited quantities of this item,” an email from the company said, “however we will be receiving additional quantities over the coming weeks. Please act quickly at 2:00 p.m. PT on Friday for your best chance at buying an NES Classic.” You can find the Amazon listing for the NES Classic at this link. Amazon said that demand is expected to be ‘very high,’ and there are no guarantee that the NES Classic Edition will remain in stock for long. The company stated that it will release similar update announcements when additional inventory becomes available. The online retailer reminded customers to make sure they’ve updated purchase and shipping information to help speed up the checkout process. The NES Classic is preloaded with 30 games, comes with a single NES Classic Controller, and will be sold for $59.99 USD. Additional controllers are sold for $9.99 USD, but they are not mentioned in Amazon’s email. The first system in Nintendo’s ‘Classic’ label was announced last July . Few US retailers have taken pre-orders in the lead up to the NES Classic Edition’s release. GameStop announced it would not accept pre-orders, but a source told IGN that some locations would be receiving up to 12 units per store. These are all sure signs that the NES Classic will be a difficult product to pick up this holiday. Nintendo has made no announcements on the pre-order status of the system at major retailers, but the company posted on Facebook that the first 250 people in attendance at Nintendo World NY Store's retro '80s bash will be among the first to purchase the system in the US.

      "text": "One of the biggest challenges in looking over the Amazon Web Services catalog of available products is understanding what everything is, and how it all works. Both individual guides and inter-service guides are spread around the internet. This makes searching out the right guides a challenge in many cases, until the open-guides came along!\nOpen Guide for Amazon Web Services Thanks a collective community effort, the Open Guide to Amazon Web Services has been published to GitHub with a continuously growing set of guides and links on everything AWS. There is a lot of very well organized text in the guide, as well as a very nicely put together table of Basics, Tips, and Gotcha sections for every service within the AWS platform.\n\nAs a long-time fan of the AWS documentation that is provided by Amazon directly, I’ve been especially pleased to see this sort of “how we really use it” guide that takes the high-level content provided by AWS and brings it down to earth for the admin/dev users.\nThe AWS Documentation site should still be a bookmark site for continuous reference, but those docs tend to be very directed guides on the specific projects, and don’t have as much of the real “how to” type of approach. Having the gotcha items and other nifty tips is a real good help for those getting started with AWS. It’s even helpful for folks who have been using it for a while because there is a good chance that you may not have hit the gotcha items just yet. The Open Guide will hopefully save you some pain.\nContributing to the Open Guide Consuming good documentation is one thing, but being able to contribute your own learnings back to the docs is even better! This is where things get interesting as we see more and more guides landing on public spaces with the ability to add your own content directly.\nJust follow the contributing guide for the Open Guide to AWS and you are off to the races for adding your own tips and gotchas to help others save some time and effort. It’s my guess that more companies may see this type of guide and use it as a way to collaborate among their own customers and community to build out documentation.\nWhy do Community Guides Matter? Community-driven content means that your products and platforms are being actively used and contributed to. This is a healthy way to measure the usage of the platforms as a vendor or project owner. Not only that, but it’s also a good way to build out some free help guides. One of the difficulties with product management is that the way you believe your product is being consumed and how it is actually being consumed can be different.\nThe Open Guide GitHub organization only has the Amazon Web Services guide so far, but hopefully other vendors may see some love on that site. If you have a product or platform, it’s a great way to help share the valuable information with your community. These are different than traditional product documentation. As I mentioned, the AWS guides are great, but this open guide allows you to look at some more use-case specific content and learn from the little tips and tricks that our peers have discovered for us.",

      "text": "Amazon's 12-day sale starts tomorrow until busiest online day Black Friday Competition and Markets Authority warning sellers to not discuss prices Questions raised over whether Amazon 'sellers competition ' is actually helping customers with some items being £20 cheaper elsehwere \nBy Jessica Duncan For Mailonline \nPublished: 06:55 EST, 13 November 2016 | Updated: 07:13 EST, 13 November 2016 \nOnline giant Amazon is launching a massive 12-day sale starting tomorrow and culminating in Black Friday, when prices traditionally plunge for 24 hours in a shopping frenzy. \nAhead of Black Friday, one of the busiest times of the year for online sales, the Government’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is warning online sellers that discussing and agreeing price levels with competitors is illegal, and can result in serious penalties. \nCMA have written to a number of online companies which may be denying customers the best available deals and reminding them of their obligations under competition law. The CMA has also engaged with online marketplace providers which are helping make the CMA’s advice available to online sellers. \nOnline sellers are being warned about competition law ahead of the Black Friday rush. Pictured Amazon warehouse in Milton Keynes \nThis follows the CMA’s recent decision, in one particular case following an 8-month investigation, which imposed a fine of over £160,000 on an online seller of posters and frames, Trod Ltd, for agreeing with a competitor, GB eye Ltd (trading as ‘GB Posters’), not to undercut each other’s prices when selling on Amazon’s UK website. GB eye escaped a fine by reporting the cartel under the CMA’s leniency programme. \nIn an investigation The Sunday Times has claimed some independent retailers who sell via Amazon Marketplace platform are matching the prices of their rivals on products to suggest a bargain for shoppers. \nThe Parrot Bebop Drone (yellow) is being sold on Amazon currently at a price of £249 by sellers whilst Argos is offering a price of £199, a £50 saving for online shoppers \nLeft: You could save £22.94 on this Roberts classic Blutune radio currently being sold on Amazon at £89.94 but available at Oldrids & Downtown for £67. Right: A Le Creuset Cast Iron Wok 32cm will set you back £154.34 on Amazon but Kitchen Kapers could save you £14.34 with their price of £140 \nFor beginners this Christmas there is the Fender Esc80 education guitar with an Amazon price of £77 but a saving of £17.76 if bought from Zings at £59.24 \nBut in fact some of these products can be found cheaper on other online stores including on occasions the Amazon sellers own website. \nThe investigation raises questions over whether the competition expected on Amazon is really helping customers get the best deal. \nThere is no evidence that the retailers or Amazon are acting unlawfully. \nAccording to The Sunday Times one seller has claimed in an online forum that there are “unspoken” agreements between some rivals not to undercut prices, but there are always “one or two nitwits” who ruin it. \nOn some of the most popular items that could be purchases this Christmas, shoppers could save themselves on average £20 or more by checking other websites to Amazon and even by checking the Amazon seller’s own website. \nOn Monday CMA shared information that includes an at-a-glance summary for online sellers that explains what constitutes ‘price-fixing’ and what they can do to avoid it. \nIn the Trod/GB eye case, both companies used automated re-pricing software to implement their agreement not to undercut each other’s prices. \nLeft: Shoppers could save £61.01 on a Smeg stone grill PGF30B, which has an Amazon price of £380 but is available at £318.99 at The Gas Superstore. Right: Hotpoint dishwasher LTB4BO19 has a current price of £299 on Amazon but can be purchased from £259.99 at Powerdirect, saving you £39.01 CMA'S KEY WARNINGS TO ONLINE SELLERS ARE: Agree with their competitors what prices they will charge, or that they won’t undercut each other on price. Discuss their pricing intentions or strategies with competitors. \nStephen Blake, Senior Director of the CMA’s Cartels and Criminal Group, said: ‘Online markets are a hugely valuable tool for consumers to shop around and find the best value products, making the most of effective competition. But these benefits for shoppers are put at risk if the suppliers seek to restrict competition between them. \n‘The CMA is strongly committed to tackling anti-competitive behaviour in online markets. Entering into agreements that limit price competition cheats consumers, is illegal and can have serious consequences for the companies and individuals involved. \nLeft: Amazon sellers show a price of £69.99 for the Akai microwave A24006 but you can save £13.99 with a price of £56 at Zavvi. Right: Ruark black MR1 active wireless speakers are being sold for £299 on Amazon but you can save £60 at Ortons Audio Visual with their price of £239 \n‘We recognise that the majority of online sellers want to comply with the law. As we enter the peak shopping months of November and December, sellers should make sure they have read our advice so they don’t get caught out. The consequences for those who don’t can be serious.’ Prices compared in this article were sourced from Amazon and www.pricespy.co.uk on November 13. Read more:",

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nDon't have a lot of time? You're not alone. The fund industry recognizes that most people don't want to spend the time managing their accounts. If you find yourself prioritizing convenience and ease over cost, then target-date funds may be for you. \nTarget-date funds are designed to take the hard work out of managing a retirement account. All you have to do is pick a year that best corresponds to your expected retirement date. Target date funds automatically rebalance so that your account slowly shifts from higher-risk stocks to lower-risk bonds. The goal is to grow your investment quickly while retirement is still decades away and then to protect more of your capital from volatility as you approach the day when you'll rely on it for income. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nAs an example, see how Fidelity's Freedom Funds designed for 2020 retirees invest more conservatively than funds designed for 2050 retirees. \nYou could easily set up automatic investments through your bank account, set the fund to automatically reinvest distributions (the fund equivalent of dividends), and forget that the account exists. It's really that simple. \nThe ideal investor: Target-date funds are best for people who are just getting started. Their higher expenses may amount to a rounding error on $10,000 or $20,000 accounts, but investors with larger balances will find it harder to justify the additional expenses. Target-date funds carried average expense ratios of about 0.55% in 2015, making them more expensive than less convenient choices. Cheap and diversified funds \nInvestors who want broad diversification at a low cost would do well to consider index funds. Index funds eschew active management and instead passively track an index by holding all the same stocks in exactly the same proportions. Because index funds simply track an index of stocks or bonds, they don't have all the expenses of paying analysts and portfolio managers to pick stocks. Low overhead enables index funds to pass on fees that are about 87% lower than those of actively managed funds. \nHere are some of the most popular indexes that funds track: S&P 500 -- Often regarded as \"the index\" for U.S. stocks, the S&P 500 includes 500 of the largest companies listed on American exchanges. These companies account for about 80% of the total value of the stock market. Top components include Apple , Microsoft , and ExxonMobil . Russell 1000 -- Like the S&P 500, this index is mostly a large-cap index. It includes twice as many companies as the S&P 500 and thus ventures further into mid-cap stocks than the S&P 500 index. The Russell 1000 includes 92% of the U.S. stock market by market value, making it more diverse than the S&P 500. Russell 2000 -- This is a small-cap index that includes the 2000 companies that don't make the cut for the Russell 1000 index. Widely regarded as the small-cap index, it holds 2,000 of the smallest companies on the American exchanges. All in all, these 2,000 stocks make up about 8% of the American stock market's value. Russell 3000 and Total Stock Market Index -- These indexes seek to track the entirety of the investable market, or all U.S. stocks that are of practical size for a fund to hold. The Russell 3000 includes about 98% of U.S. stocks by market value, while the Total Stock Market Index includes stocks that make up 99.9% of the market's value. What they exclude is largely a function of practicality: If they bought smaller stocks, then funds that tracked the indexes might be the only buyers and sellers on any given day. \nThe best thing about these indexes is that they are the basis for a number of dirt-cheap index funds. There are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that track these indexes with expense ratios as low as 0.05% per year, or $0.50 for every $1,000 invested. It doesn't get much cheaper than that. \nThe ideal investor: Low-cost index funds are great for the cost-conscious investor. They're widely available and inexpensive to buy and hold, and you know exactly what you get with index funds. From Vanguard to Charles Schwab and Fidelity , virtually every major broker offers low-cost index funds that can suit your IRA investing needs. Risk-reducing investment choices \nNo diversified portfolio is complete without a dose of bonds. As boring and as foreign as they may be, bonds help balance out the risk of stocks. When stocks rise, investors can take some risk off the table by rebalancing into bonds. When stocks fall, bond holdings can be tapped to rebalance into lower-priced stocks. \nStocks and Bond Mix \nWorst Year From 1926 to 2015 \nAverage Annual Return From 1926 to 2015 \n100% stocks ",

      "text": "Amazon Ordered To Refund In-App Purchases Made By Kids   07:01 PST \nA federal judge has ordered Amazon to establish a process in order to refund parents whose kids made in-app purchases through games without their knowledge or consent. Amazon will be required to alert the parents and it will have to start processing the reimbursements from next year, a new report says. This comes after a federal judge agreed with the Federal Trade Commission earlier this year which said that Amazon did not sufficiently warn parents enough that some free games allowed players to make in-app purchases. \nIt wasn’t rare for some kids who played these games to make multiple in-app purchases without the knowledge or the consent of their parents. They’d only be hit by the bill shock when they found that their kids had been making these in-app purchases and they knew nothing about them. \nThe Federal Trade Commission had previously estimated that parents were charged up to $86 million combined . It said that Amazon should not only reimburse the amount charged but it should also pay a $26.5 million fine. \nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour has said that the FTC’s damages request is “too high” and he has agreed with Amazon that the commission might have taken into account failed password attempts that were unrelated to unauthorized in-app purchases made by kids. \nThe judge has also rejected Amazon’s request to issue parents refunds in the form of gift cards, adding that the company would “undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.” \nFiled in General .

      "title": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is suddenly making nice with Trump — there’s a big reason why (AMZN)",
      "text": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is taking a much more conciliatory tone towards President-elect Donald Trump, after publicly criticizing him on several occasions prior to the election.\nWhy the olive branch?\nIt could be as simple as Bezos taking the high road, despite his differences with Trump.\nBut there’s a much more pragmatic reason for Bezos to make nice with the 45th President of the United States: Amazon has grown so big, it needs Washington on its side to keep up its crazy growth.\nAmazon is no longer just an online shopping site. Over the past 20 years, the company has evolved from a small online book seller to the 5th most valuable company in the US. It now sells everything from detergent to cloud computing power, while expanding into new areas like voice-controlled technology and delivery drones.\nAdd that to Amazon's increasingly dominant position in online retail, and you have a company whose business interests are tightly linked to government policies, across areas like sales tax, cybersecurity, net neutrality, and shipping, just to name a few.\n\"If your company is as big as Amazon, it would be foolish to make enemies with the new administration right off the bat,\" Lee Drutman,  a senior fellow at New America Foundation and the author of “The Business of America Is Lobbying,” told Business Insider. \n\"Given what’s at stake for Amazon, why would Bezos take that fight?\" \nMore lobbying Amazon has moved to strengthen its ties with the nation's capital in recent years. \nThe clearest sign can be found in its lobbying expenditures. In 2015, Amazon dramatically increased its spending on lobbying  to $9.07 million, a whopping 91% jump from the year before. That may be peanuts for a company now generating over $100 billion a year in revenue, but it's still large enough to make it the 5th highest among all tech companies, and more than the bigger ones like Apple and Microsoft.\nAmazon is spending even more this year. It's already spent $8.3 million on lobbying in the first three quarters of the year, almost the same amount it spent all of last year, public records show . According to OpenSecrets.org , a non-profit political research group, Amazon only trails AT&T, Alphabet, and Comcast among tech companies, and has made it to the top 20 for the first time among companies from all sectors.\nOn top of that,  Bezos not only purchased The Washington Post, he hired former White House press secretary Jay Carney last year and recently moved Amazon's DC office to a much larger space . \n\"You hire lobbyists as your ear on the ground in Washington,\" Tim LaPira, associate professor of political science at James Madison University, told Business Insider. \n\"If a CEO and a major public official, the President of the United States, don’t have a good relationship, then it’s going to be that much harder for that company to be heard and their concerns to be taken seriously .\" \nAP Photo/Susan Walsh \nWhat would Trump do? Most of Trump's vitriol against Bezos have stemmed from tax and antitrust issues, but it’s unclear where exactly he stands on a lot of policy matters.\nNew America Foundation's Drutman said it's possible Trump could use his power over the Justice Department and IRS to push for antitrust scrutiny and increased tax audits on Amazon. Also, given Trump's stance on US trade and immigration reform, Amazon's overall business could take a direct hit.\nTo be sure, the president doesn't have the magic wand to make these changes or put pressure on specific companies at will. But the president does have huge influence on what the government decides to do, Professor LaPira said.\n\"The president essentially plans the administration’s policy agenda, and has a great deal of leverage in the legislative process,\" he said. \"He could  really influence the legislature’s to-do-list.\" \nPublic filings show Amazon's lobbying efforts have focused on a wide array of issues, including, sales tax, net neutrality, transportation safety, patent law, data protection, and mobile payments.\nIn its latest quarterly filing, Amazon warns that changes in government policies could harm its business. It writes:\n\"We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth.\"\nIt’s probably too early to predict what Trump's presidency will mean for Amazon. But investors sure don’t seem very reassured: Amazon's stock is now down more than 6% since Trump’s win on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high.\nNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception \n",

      "text": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos AP Photo/Susan Walsh\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos is taking a much more conciliatory tone towards President-elect Donald Trump , after publicly criticizing him on several occasions prior to the election.\nWhy the olive branch?\nIt could be as simple as Bezos taking the high road, despite his differences with Trump.\nBut there’s a much more pragmatic reason for Bezos to make nice with the 45th President of the United States: Amazon has grown so big, it needs Washington on its side to keep up its crazy growth.\nAmazon is no longer just an online shopping site. Over the past 20 years, the company has evolved from a small online book seller to the 5th most valuable company in the US. It now sells everything from detergent to cloud computing power, while expanding into new areas like voice-controlled technology and delivery drones.\nAdd that to Amazon's increasingly dominant position in online retail, and you have a company whose business interests are tightly linked to government policies, across areas like sales tax, cybersecurity, net neutrality, and shipping, just to name a few.\n\"If your company is as big as Amazon, it would be foolish to make enemies with the new administration right off the bat,\" Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America Foundation and the author of “The Business of America Is Lobbying,” told Business Insider.\n\"Given what’s at stake for Amazon, why would Bezos take that fight?\"\nMore lobbying Amazon has moved to strengthen its ties with the nation's capital in recent years.\nThe clearest sign can be found in its lobbying expenditures. In 2015, Amazon dramatically increased its spending on lobbying to $9.07 million, a whopping 91% jump from the year before. That may be peanuts for a company now generating over $100 billion a year in revenue, but it's still large enough to make it the 5th highest among all tech companies, and more than the bigger ones like Apple and Microsoft.\nAmazon is spending even more this year. It's already spent $8.3 million on lobbying in the first three quarters of the year, almost the same amount it spent all of last year, public records show . According to OpenSecrets.org , a non-profit political research group, Amazon only trails AT&T, Alphabet, and Comcast among tech companies, and has made it to the top 20 for the first time among companies from all sectors.\nOn top of that, Bezos not only purchased The Washington Post, he hired former White House press secretary Jay Carney last year and recently moved Amazon's DC office to a much larger space .\n\"You hire lobbyists as your ear on the ground in Washington,\" Tim LaPira, associate professor of political science at James Madison University, told Business Insider.\n\"If a CEO and a major public official, the President of the United States, don’t have a good relationship, then it’s going to be that much harder for that company to be heard and their concerns to be taken seriously .\"\nDonald Trump Thomson Reuters\nWhat would Trump do? Most of Trump's vitriol against Bezos have stemmed from tax and antitrust issues, but it’s unclear where exactly he stands on a lot of policy matters.\nNew America Foundation's Drutman said it's possible Trump could use his power over the Justice Department and IRS to push for antitrust scrutiny and increased tax audits on Amazon. Also, given Trump's stance on US trade and immigration reform, Amazon's overall business could take a direct hit.\nTo be sure, the president doesn't have the magic wand to make these changes or put pressure on specific companies at will. But the president does have huge influence on what the government decides to do, Professor LaPira said.\n\"The president essentially plans the administration’s policy agenda, and has a great deal of leverage in the legislative process,\" he said. \"He could really influence the legislature’s to-do-list.\"\nPublic filings show Amazon's lobbying efforts have focused on a wide array of issues, including, sales tax, net neutrality, transportation safety, patent law, data protection, and mobile payments.\nIn its latest quarterly filing, Amazon warns that changes in government policies could harm its business. It writes:\n\"We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth.\"\nIt’s probably too early to predict what Trump's presidency will mean for Amazon. But investors sure don’t seem very reassured: Amazon's stock is now down more than 6% since Trump’s win on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high.\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nSEE ALSO: Trump warned Amazon would have 'problems' under his presidency — here's what could happen NOW WATCH: We finally learned the purpose of that extra shoelace hole on your sneakers Loading video...

      "text": "Real Estate Tech Test: Google’s smart speaker playing catch-up with Amazon’s Echo The new Google Pixel phone is displayed next to a Google Home smart speaker, left, following a product event in San Francisco. (Associated Press files) \nBy ANICK JESDANUN, Associated Press \n 05 AM A A \nGoogle’s new smart speaker is at once a secretary, a librarian and a radio. \nAsk about your day, and the Home speaker will give you the time, weather, estimated commute, the news and upcoming calendar appointments. It will convert miles into feet, and dollars into euros. Want to hear Adele or Coldplay? Home will fetch you some tunes. \nIf this sounds familiar, it’s because Amazon has already been at it for about two years. Its Echo speaker can do what Home does and more, thanks to Amazon’s head start in partnering with third-party services such as Domino’s Pizza and Fitbit. But Home is smarter in a few other ways, as it taps what it knows about you from Gmail, Maps and other Google services. Home is also $50 cheaper, at about $130 (though Amazon offers a mini “Echo Dot” version for just $50). \n• AT YOUR COMMAND. \nThink of both Home and Echo as extensions of your iPhone or Android device. Sure, I can check weather on the phone, but why not just ask the speaker as I’m getting dressed? And no need to lift a finger to check the calendar. With guests over, I can resolve trivia disputes using voice searches and avoid screens. I was able to keep tabs on the Chicago Cubs’ quest to break a century-long World Series drought. \nBoth devices work as alarm clocks or timers — great in the kitchen. Both can control lights, thermostats and other internet-connected appliances, though you need capable devices first. \nOf course, I have to get used to speaking aloud with no one around. Privacy is a concern, too, once I enable all the features. Anyone within hearing distance will know when I’m seeing the doctor or leaving my apartment empty for vacation. Home and Echo are continually listening for commands, though Google and Amazon say nothing gets passed back to them until the speakers hear a keyword —“OK, Google” for Home and “Alexa” for Echo. A light comes on to remind you that it’s listening. You can turn off the microphone temporarily, too. \n• LONGING FOR MORE. \nNeither device is all that proactive. Android phones with the Google Now assistant will remind me when it’s time to leave for work or the airport, based on estimated travel times. But I’m usually not checking the phone as I’m getting ready to leave. I could use a nudge from either speaker. On the other hand, I might find a stranger’s voice jarring when I think I’m alone. It’s a new technology, and companies still have to figure out the right balance. \nAnd while Home and Echo offer the basics, neither lets me dig deeper. Sure, I have an appointment at 11 a.m., but where is it and with whom? And how can I get there? It’s back to the phone. Another limitation: Both speakers are tied to a single account, so families won’t get individual calendars and preferences. \n• IN UNITY. \nThe speakers are more powerful when they coordinate with your other devices. \nThe best stab so far comes from Amazon. Ask Echo the weather, and the speaker will tell you current conditions and the day’s forecast. But if you have an Amazon Fire tablet nearby, you automatically get a full-screen display with the week’s forecast. Ask Echo about the Cubs, and you’ll hear the score. The tablet gives you inning-by-inning breakdowns. \nHome can control Google’s Chromecast streaming TV devices, but the preview I’ve been testing has been painful to use. You can pause, resume or forward video; you’re also supposed to be able to rewind and start from the beginning, but Home gets fussy. It currently works only with YouTube video (Netflix and Google Photos are coming soon). Even then, Home keeps thinking I’m requesting a song that doesn’t exist. There’s potential here, but controls on the phone are much easier. Watching TV shouldn’t take a lot of work. \nIdeally, the technology will just know where and how to present information and entertainment. In such a scenario, you can set one alarm, and Google or Amazon will find you wherever you are — whether it’s on the speaker at home, or a phone if you’re away. Or if you ask the speaker about a nearby restaurant, directions go to your phone. For now, unification is limited to a shopping list you can add to and view (or hear) from any device. \n• EARLY SMARTS, EARLY DUMBS. \nHome, with an early incarnation of a Google digital companion called Assistant, seems the smarter of the two out of the gate. It knows about my upcoming flight, based on reservations in Gmail. It offers commute times using transit, as Google already senses through my Android phone that I don’t drive to work. Home can also estimate driving time to just about any other destination. Echo sends me to work, even when I ask about Boston. And Home is alone in setting alarms more than 24 hours away. \nBut partnerships will make these speakers more useful. I can ask Echo about my Fitbit goals or order pizza from Domino’s; I can’t with Home. Amazon has more than a thousand such partnerships, known as skills. Google’s integrations are initially limited to calling for Ubers, changing news or music providers and controlling smart devices from Phillips, SmartThings and Nest (a Google sister company). \nGoogle still has bugs to work out. How are the Chicago Cubs doing? Home told me the Cubs are the regular-season division leaders and are based in Chicago. Duh! I had to ask again for the World Series score. \nAnd after the Cubs won in extra innings early in the morning, both Home and Echo were nonchalant in giving me the final score. I wouldn’t have known from either that the Cubs were now the world champions and that Chicago fans got to finally celebrate.",

      "text": "print Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos AP Photo/Susan Walsh \nWhy the olive branch? \nIt could be as simple as Bezos taking the high road, despite his differences with Trump. \nBut there’s a much more pragmatic reason for Bezos to make nice with the 45th President of the United States: Amazon has grown so big, it needs Washington on its side to keep up its crazy growth. \nAmazon is no longer just an online shopping site. Over the past 20 years, the company has evolved from a small online book seller to the 5th most valuable company in the US. It now sells everything from detergent to cloud computing power, while expanding into new areas like voice-controlled technology and delivery drones. \nAdd that to Amazon's increasingly dominant position in online retail, and you have a company whose business interests are tightly linked to government policies, across areas like sales tax, cybersecurity, net neutrality, and shipping, just to name a few. \n\"If your company is as big as Amazon, it would be foolish to make enemies with the new administration right off the bat,\" Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America Foundation and the author of “The Business of America Is Lobbying,” told Business Insider. \n\"Given what’s at stake for Amazon, why would Bezos take that fight?\" More lobbying \nAmazon has moved to strengthen its ties with the nation's capital in recent years. \nThe clearest sign can be found in its lobbying expenditures. In 2015, Amazon dramatically increased its spending on lobbying to $9.07 million, a whopping 91% jump from the year before. That may be peanuts for a company now generating over $100 billion a year in revenue, but it's still large enough to make it the 5th highest among all tech companies, and more than the bigger ones like Apple and Microsoft. \nAmazon is spending even more this year. It's already spent $8.3 million on lobbying in the first three quarters of the year, almost the same amount it spent all of last year, public records show . According to OpenSecrets.org , a non-profit political research group, Amazon only trails AT&T, Alphabet, and Comcast among tech companies, and has made it to the top 20 for the first time among companies from all sectors. \nOn top of that, Bezos not only purchased The Washington Post, he hired former White House press secretary Jay Carney last year and recently moved Amazon's DC office to a much larger space . \n\"You hire lobbyists as your ear on the ground in Washington,\" Tim LaPira, associate professor of political science at James Madison University, told Business Insider. \n\"If a CEO and a major public official, the President of the United States, don’t have a good relationship, then it’s going to be that much harder for that company to be heard and their concerns to be taken seriously .\" \nDonald Trump Thomson Reuters What would Trump do? \nMost of Trump's vitriol against Bezos have stemmed from tax and antitrust issues, but it’s unclear where exactly he stands on a lot of policy matters. \nNew America Foundation's Drutman said it's possible Trump could use his power over the Justice Department and IRS to push for antitrust scrutiny and increased tax audits on Amazon. Also, given Trump's stance on US trade and immigration reform, Amazon's overall business could take a direct hit. \nTo be sure, the president doesn't have the magic wand to make these changes or put pressure on specific companies at will. But the president does have huge influence on what the government decides to do, Professor LaPira said. \n\"The president essentially plans the administration’s policy agenda, and has a great deal of leverage in the legislative process,\" he said. \"He could really influence the legislature’s to-do-list.\" \nPublic filings show Amazon's lobbying efforts have focused on a wide array of issues, including, sales tax, net neutrality, transportation safety, patent law, data protection, and mobile payments. \nIn its latest quarterly filing, Amazon warns that changes in government policies could harm its business. It writes: \"We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth.\" \nIt’s probably too early to predict what Trump's presidency will mean for Amazon. But investors sure don’t seem very reassured: Amazon's stock is now down more than 6% since Trump’s win on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high.

      "text": "\nAccording to a new investigative report, delivery drivers that handle Amazon packages in the U.K. are overworked and underpaid. As a result, the delivery drivers are forced to poo in their trucks, using bags and boxes to store their feces until their shift is over. Bottles are often used to store urine, as well. In addition, the drivers often speed well over the posted limit as they exceed the legally allowed times to drive, in an effort to meet the strict delivery demands put forth by Amazon.\nThe findings revealed that many of the drivers were making less than minimum wage after the long hours, that they were not paid additional for. Additionally, drivers that choose to hire help and gain additional insurance, were not paid extra for their services, according to Metro .\nThe revelation of the horrible working conditions were revealed when a reporter from the Corporation was hired at AHC Services, a European firm that delivers for Amazon, according to the Daily Mail . The unnamed investigator worked at Amazon’s depot in Avonmouth, Bristol for a period of two weeks, where he interacted with drivers on a daily basis.\nAmazon delivery drivers are forced to poo in a bag because they work 11-hour shifts without time to take breaks https://t.co/pKfNN1z8xz \n— CWU Eastern No5 (@cwuEastern__No5) November 12, 2016 \nDue to the strict demand set forth by Amazon, to deliver at least 200 packages per day, many of the hired delivery drivers are forced to skip breaks, work more than the legally allowed 11 hours, and exceed speed limits at dangerous paces, in order to meet their quota. As a result, many of the drivers opt to forgo bathroom breaks and urinate in bottles and defecate in bags, allowing just a little more time to deliver the packages.\nA former supervisor with AHC, Cody Cooper, revealed that she had to force one employee to pull over after he fell asleep at the wheel.\n“It was coming up to school time and there could [have been] a group of schoolchildren walking along… and he could have steered off,”\nAccording to AHC, the claims of defecating in bags, exceeding speed limits, and working unpaid overtime, were isolated and were not the norm within the company. They claim that they have made changes to ensure the impact did not stretch further.\n“Since then we have made changes to the way our checks are carried out and taken a number of steps to improve our ways of working,”\nHowever, many of the employees claim differently.\nThe pressure from Amazon and AHC does not require the delivery drivers to put forth the extra effort that was discovered during the investigation, but the pressure to meet the demands has coerced many of the drivers to continue to do what it takes to meet their goals.\nLuckily, no one has been injured or killed as the drivers speed through the streets and skip bathroom breaks.\nAmazon drivers ‘forced to poo in bags’ on ‘illegal shifts with no time for breaks’… https://t.co/POj7SYI2ne pic.twitter.com/nF47s0Rur9 \n— Report UK (@ReportUK) November 13, 2016 \nAmazon became aware of the situation after the investigation occurred and released as statement, claiming they are taking the matter seriously and are working toward improvement.\n“We take this matter seriously and strive for continuous improvement, understanding that our progress depends on good execution and judgment of our employees and our delivery providers,”\nAmazon was unaware of the conditions that their European drivers were forced to work under and reached out to their suppliers during an investigation.\n“Our delivery providers must abide by Amazon’s Supplier Code of Conduct and our more detailed Amazon Logistics contract. We investigate any allegation that a delivery provider is not meeting our expectations.”\nThe reported issue was only occurring in the United Kingdom, not the United States. However, with the busy holiday season coming up, it is expected many drivers will take shortcuts to lessen the time spent on the road during their stressful workdays.\n\n[Feature Image by Jeramey Lende/Shutterstock]\nAmazon Drivers Forced To Poo In Bags And Work Illegal Shifts In An Effort To Meet Strict Delivery Demands is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Home > Web > Amazon will be paying back parents after their… Amazon will be paying back parents after their kids made unauthorized app store purchases November 13, 2016 7:33 AM Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nParents whose children ran wild buying up apps from Amazon without permission can now breathe easy, as a judge has decided how the online retailer will be responsible for reimbursements. \nThe issue began in 2014, when the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) told Amazon that if it “didn’t adopt a more Apple-like policy about in-app purchases, it might wind up in court,” Engadget reported. This did indeed happen, as the FTC requested a court order to require Amazon to issue refunds to parents who did not authorize their children’s’ app purchases. Fast forward to April 2016, when a judge found Amazon liable for the purchases, but had not yet decided upon a method for the company to pay them back. \nNow on Thursday (six months after finding Amazon liable), U.S. District Judge John Coughenour directed the company to set up a “year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator’s request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout,” Reuters reported. \nMore: PlayOn Cloud is a DVR for streaming services like HBO Now, Amazon Video \nCoughenour had also declined the company’s offer to reimburse parents through gift cards, because the money would flow back to the company, saying to Reuters that Amazon would “undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue,” \nAmazon will now set up a notice-and-claims process next year to inform those who are eligible for money back. \nSpeaking on his decision, Coughenour said that the approach “removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.” \nAccording to Reuters, the unauthorized charges claimed in the original suit added up to an estimated $86 million. \nAmazon, along with Apple and Alphabet Inc. have put in place measures including password and security controls to prevent unauthorized charges in the future, as the latter companies had faced FTC settlements in 2014 as well.

      "text": "November 13, 2016 11:23 AM Amazon gets an F from carbon emissions monitor Amazon’s fast-expanding warehouses and data centers could become growing sources of carbon emissions. Ellen M. Banner TNS i Order Reprint of this Story Seattle \nMany global corporate giants have been sharing their data on carbon emissions with CDP, a nonprofit that gathers that information on behalf of big institutional investors worried about how their assets will fare in a warming world. \nBut Amazon.com , unlike many of its rivals, keeps those cards close to the chest. \nCDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, queries companies about carbon emissions and other data every year to build what it says is the most detailed collection of self-reported environmental information anywhere. \nAbout 70 percent of companies listed in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index contributed with data to its latest report, published in late October, said CDP’s North America president, Lance Pierce. That includes rivals of Amazon’s wild diversity of businesses, from behemoth retailers Wal-Mart and Costco Wholesale to Microsoft and Alphabet. Not everybody gets a good score. CDP grades companies based on a combination of factors, from the level of transparency to how much they do to address problems. \nApple made it to the A-grade list; so did Microsoft and Alphabet. Wal-Mart got a B, and Costco scored a C. \nThen CDP slapped an F on Amazon for nonparticipation (the company hasn’t responded to CDP’s questionnaires since at least 2010). \nAmazon declined to comment on its refusal to play ball with CDP’s request for openness. \nAmazon was the largest U.S. publicly traded company not to participate (it jostled for that title with Facebook and Berkshire Hathaway, which also got Fs.) \nMoreover, Amazon’s fast-expanding warehouse and logistics operations, as well as its power-hungry data centers, could become growing sources of carbon emissions, which scientists say have contributed to climate change. Investors interested in corporate carbon-emissions data “are not asking for it because they don’t have anything better to do,” Pierce, the CDP official, said in an interview. “They believe it’s material.” \nAmazon is “notable for the fact that it’s holding out in a space where clearly everyone else that is working with it and probably competing with it are in the process of disclosing,” Pierce said. There’s plenty of evidence Amazon factors the environment into its worldview. It’s building wind farms and solar arrays it says will generate enough power to meet half the needs of its data centers by next year, and eventually will cover all its cloud-computing energy requirements with renewables. In Seattle, it will harness heat from a local data center to power its new downtown buildings. \nThe company is a signatory of the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, a White House initiative that supported action on reducing carbon emissions, and has struck many other environmentally minded partnerships. \nAmazon also seems to be building a sustainability team under Kara Hurst, who joined the company in 2014. She’s the former CEO of The Sustainability Consortium, a nongovernmental organization focusing on sustainable consumption. \nAt the beginning of the month, there were more than 29 jobs open related to sustainability, ranging from software-development engineers to senior product managers focusing on waste reduction for packaging. \nBut Amazon keeps a veil on details that other companies share. For example, it doesn’t publish a comprehensive annual sustainability report, unlike many peers. A proposal by shareholders to issue such a document garnered only 25 percent of the vote at last May’s annual shareholder meeting. \nAmazon’s board said that, given it’s already committed to developing sustainable practices, working on an annual report “would not be an effective and prudent use” of time and resources. \nGreenpeace in 2015 gave it an F for transparency for not providing enough detail about energy-saving measures in its cloud-computing business. Aseem Prakash, director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington, says Amazon doesn’t disclose its figures to the CDP simply because it hasn’t felt it had to. \nThe company topped the 2016 list of “most reputable companies” among the U.S. public, gathered by the Reputation Institute, an advisory firm. Amazon has flown under the radar of most environmental groups focused on other companies or in other industries and has little damage to reputation to mitigate on that front. \n“Environmentalists have not paid sufficient political attention to Amazon,” Prakash said. \nMoreover, despite the CDP’s claims that big investors want to see environmental data, the reality is most investors don’t necessarily care, Prakash said. Amazon’s stock price has more than doubled in two years. The CDP says it represents 827 investors with $100 trillion in assets. Members include investment-management funds such as BlackRock and pension funds such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System. \n“It’s important to remember in the early days of corporate accounting, corporations were not expected to disclose what was on their books,” Pierce said. \n“Now, of course, that’s not an option, really, in order for investors to understand whether you’re a good investment or not. There’s a substantial subset of investors around the world who believe that’s the case on climate change.” \nPierce says publicly accounting for their carbon emissions has benefits for companies that go well beyond appeasing some investors or policymakers. \nHe said Wal-Mart, when establishing a process of CDP disclosure, found new ways of seeing and managing their operations more efficiently. \n“They learn things about their companies,” he said.

Fantastic price, given a neighbour up the road just had their house burnt down due to an electric wire fault behind their TV. I strongly recommend everyone has both mains MCBs and a local surge protector (they had neither). Surge protectors are not just for Christmas can literally be for life. Powerline adapters are not that great and get worse over time. I have one on a surge extension and their is probably a 10% difference. It still does the job",

      "text": "By Derrick Miyao \nThere’s a battle going on for your home, and it is between two major powerhouses – Google and Amazon. \nAmazon wants to rule your home with the Amazon Echo family of speakers; Echo , Echo Dot and the portable Tap . Google saw Amazon’s massive success with the smart speaker and recently released the Google Home to compete for your home. \nAlexa is Amazon’s assistant while Google uses the Google Assistant. Both are designed to do relatively the same thing like answer questions, play music, but most importantly control your smart home products. Smart home products are now into their second generation and might be the next major tech market boom. Some hoped for smartwatches of virtual reality to be the next major market, but the smart home seems to be where the major growth is gaining traction. \nAccording to statista , the smart home market is roughly $10B with a household penetration rate of just 24.9%. By 2021 it is predicting the smart home market to be well north of $30B with a household penetration rate of over 60%. Smart lights, sprinklers, thermostats, security systems, leak detectors, and central voice controlled hubs are powering the market today. So which one should you go with? \nMy choice would be Amazon. It has two full years of time on the market while Google is just now in its infancy. While Google home is compelling with a colorful light and egg shaped build, it has a long way to go in terms of maturing as a product. \nGoogle Home is expensive when you pit it up against the entire line of the Echo family . The Echo Dot which is the cheapest version and can be purchased for as low as $41.67 when you buy a six-pack. The cheapest and most expensive version of the Google Home can be bought for $129. If you buy three Dots, Amazon is even running a promotion where you can buy them for $129 when you use the discount code DOT3PACK at checkout. Buy three Google Home speakers and you’re in deep at $387. \nNo matter which smart speaker you choose, you are really going to want at least three. One for your kitchen, living room, and bedroom. In the kitchen is where you will be creating shopping lists, requesting cooking timers, converting units, and playing music or news. In the living room is where you will need a smart speaker to control your TV, close the garage, play music, change the thermostat temperature and even control your lights. \nYour bedroom is where you will want a smart speaker as an alarm, audiobook reader, light and temperature controller, and music or news player. \nIf you only purchase one smart speaker , it won’t maximize your smart home unless you’re willing to yell across the house, or walk to the room where it is located. While Amazon offers voice control through a remote that can be used throughout the house, Google does not. If you resort to just flipping the lights off manually, you’ve already wasted your smart lights. But Amazon also offers cheaper options to place around your home, or you could just get a Tap and bring it along with you in the home. \nGoogle Home is in its first generation and it has tons of potential. But potential really means nothing to me when Amazon already has a mature product. Some things that should have been better thought out on the Google Home just bother me. \nWhy would Google decide to go with the same “OK Google” phrase to activate the speaker? It seems like a poor decision to do that since that is the same phrase that activates my smartphones and tablets. It’s annoying to activate five devices at the same time. You might be thinking, “I don’t have five smartphones like a tech writer” but some families are loaded with Android devices. The last thing they want is for you to activate their devices. \nOther things like music detection don’t work on Google Home. I’ve asked it several times to identify a song with the volume blasting from my speakers for it to tell me nothing was playing. I’ve also had a hard time getting all three to sync. \nIt’s a lot to expect Google Home to do what Amazon has done with the Echo family. The Echo has been out for over two years which is a lifetime in technology. \nGoogle has a poor track of sticking with devices that it cannot monetize through ads. The last thing I want my smart speaker to do is read ads to me throughout the day. Amazon connects to its world’s largest online store which has proven to be a solid way of monetizing its Echo family. If the Google Home ever reads an ad to me, or listens in on a conversation to figure out a way to monetize my personal conversations, I might abandon Google altogether. The conversations we have at home are as private as it gets. \nWhat happened to the Google tablet lineup? Or Android TV? Anyone remember Google Glass? Google dabbles in quite a few areas but rarely ever follows up on its side projects. Amazon has already proven to us it is fully committed with the Echo speakers by releasing a standalone plug in speaker in the Echo, a portable voice assistant speaker in the Tap, and the smartest version of all, the Dot. \nI love the Dot mainly because it is so cheap. I have one in each main room of my house. I love turning off all of the lights in my house when I hit the sack with a simple voice command. No matter which room I’m in, I can have it play music and read podcasts to me. When I’m in the garage or at the pool, I bring along the Tap as the portable option. \nWhen it comes to sound, it’s debatable which full sized smart speaker is best. As someone who loves music, I’d almost never turn to the Google Home or Echo for music listening every day. I own far better speakers than them and you probably do too. That’s one reason why I love the Dots since I can connect them to my wireless speakers or Wi-Fi speakers from Raumfeld with a 3.5mm audio cable. The Google Home doesn’t even offer an output option on its speaker to connect out to another. So you’re stuck with the bass heavy little speaker no matter how you want to use it. \nThe other question left to wonder, is how will the Google Home treat Apple devices? Or how will Apple treat Google devices if it comes out with a smart option? While Samsung dominates global phone sales, Apple dominates the domestic market with the iPhone. A poor experience with Google Home will turn off iOS users. Amazon truly wants both software platforms to integrate with its Echo family. Android Wear has already proven that Google can’t play nice with iOS. \nAmazon’s products are mature and I’m simply not going to hold my breath for Google to update the Home anytime soon with its slow track record on Android TV. The battle has already been won by Amazon. If you want to do more research, read the real 45k+ reviews on Amazon about its Echo . Best Buy also has quite a few reviews up on the Google Home too.",

      "text": "svenska The American Heart Association and Amazon Web Services Launch Cloud-Based Precision Medicine Data Marketplace to Accelerate Scientific Discovery The AHA Precision Medicine Platform allows researchers and clinicians to access and analyze vast and diverse data to facilitate collaboration and accelerate breakthroughs in prevention, treatment and cures for heart disease and stroke. News provided by Nov 13, 2016, 16:00 ET Share this article NEW ORLEANS , Nov. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the American Heart Association (AHA) announced a milestone in its strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) – the launch of a global, secure cloud-based data marketplace that will help revolutionize how researchers and clinicians come together as one community to access and analyze rich and diverse data to accelerate solutions for cardiovascular diseases -- the No. 1 cause of death worldwide. The AHA Precision Medicine Platform, announced at today's AHA Scientific Sessions in New Orleans , will include a vast array of curated rich datasets, that are centrally stored, easily searched and accessible, and managed on the AWS cloud. This platform enables researchers and clinicians to aggregate and analyze a rich breadth and depth of data including longitudinal cohorts, proteomic, genomic, and gene expression data using a precision medicine approach to uncover critical cardiovascular disease insights that translate into medical innovations that positively impact millions of lives. Nancy Brown, AHA CEO Teresa Carlson, Vice President Worldwide Public Sector, AWS, Inc. The Possibility of Precision Cardiovascular Medicine Precision cardiovascular medicine takes into account an individual's biology, environment and lifestyle and is driven by advanced methods of aggregating, integrating and analyzing patient data to develop prevention and treatment strategies for individuals. Derived from the fullest possible range of biological and environmental factors relevant to a patient's cardiovascular health, the Platform will integrate data from clinical trials, long-running epidemiologic studies, clinical registries, and real-time health data acquired through wearable devices and technology. \"The Platform will harness the power of big data to revolutionize the way cardiovascular research is performed and speed the promise of precision cardiovascular medicine,\" said AHA CEO Nancy Brown . \"The AHA remains steadfast in its commitment to eliminate the tragic global burden cardiovascular disease places on individuals, families, healthcare systems, and entire nations by mapping scientific discovery to the dramatic advances in biomedical research and technology innovation.\" The Power of Cloud Technology AWS, a leading cloud services provider, provides the computational and analytic power needed to manage an information ecosystem of this magnitude. Cloud computing is already accelerating scientific progress throughout academia, industry and government, helping to forge new models of open science, collaboration and discovery. Through a cloud-based infrastructure, the Precision Medicine Platform will advance our community of researchers together to find solutions for patients. \"AHA and AWS bring unique strengths and complementary expertise to the Precision Medicine Data Marketplace with AWS offering the immense computational and analytical power necessary to manage the information ecosystem of this magnitude,\" said Teresa Carlson , Vice President Worldwide Public Sector, AWS, Inc. \"We are very excited to work with AHA to quickly bring resources and advancements to patients more rapidly and to make these scientific discoveries a reality.\" The Promise of Precision Medicine Platform Several initial healthcare and research organizations are leading the way as data contributors to the AHA Precision Medicine Platform including: AstraZeneca, Cedars Sinai Heart Institute, Dallas Heart Study, the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute, the International Stroke Genetics Consortium, and Stanford Cardiovascular Institute. \"AstraZeneca is pleased to work with the AHA, AWS and other groups on this important initiative. By contributing de-identified data from our clinical trials and bringing together - under one umbrella - the data, and the tools, this initiative will help scientists and clinicians advance our understanding of cardiovascular disease in a cost and time effective manner, to ultimately bring benefits to patients,\" said Fouzia Laghrissi Thode , V.P. GPPS Therapy Area, Cardiovascular & Metabolism, AstraZeneca. \"This platform will facilitate important collaborations that should help uncover new causal factors and targets for therapy.\" said James de Lemos , MD of the Dallas Heart Study. \"By making large numbers of data sources more easily available to researchers, this collaboration will accelerate the movement toward greater openness in clinical research,\" said DCRI Executive Director Eric Peterson , MD, MPH. \"It will also help speed the development of scientific discoveries into usable treatments for the patients who need them most.\" \"These findings could help stratify individuals, groups, and entire populations according to their risk of cardiovascular disease and likely response to treatments,\" said Joseph C. Wu , MD, PhD, Director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute. Driving Precision Medicine through Data Grants To spark collaboration, AHA is providing access to the Precision Medicine Platform through a series of grants. AWS is providing grant recipients free access to computational cloud storage and analysis as part of the AHA data grant portfolio. Grant submissions are in progress and the first round of recipients will be announced in April 2017 . More information on submission deadlines for the Data Grant Portfolio can be found at http://institute.heart.org . The Precision Medicine Platform will be available at precision.heart.org and is a marquee project of the AHA Institute for Precision Cardiovascular Medicine.

      "text": "Should you ignore the Trump dump of tech stocks? Yes. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon all suffered this week, but some think that’s short-sighted. Is the new U.S. president bad for Silicon Valley’s business? Carsten Koall / Getty Images There’s no question that stock of tech companies got hit this week on no real financial developments or performance issues. Except, of course, the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States. Yes, that . Apple shares were down in the five days from $110.03 to about $108.43. Google was down from $795 to $771.56; Facebook dropped from $123.21 to $119.04; Netflix dropped from $124.26 to $114.78; and Amazon was off from $771.60 to $739.01. Most Wall Street analysts pointed to the Trump win as the proximate cause of the drop, given his rocky history with tech and also Silicon Valley so far. That’s included: A call for a boycott of Apple due to its encryption fight with the government and also his contention that it should make its devices in the U.S.; an attack on Amazon over taxes and, really, founder and CEO Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the tough-on-Trump Washington Post ; and opposition to net neutrality regulations by the FCC , which have favored the internet powerhouses, and the possibility of their repeal. Add to that a hard line on immigration, as well as potentially isolationist trade policies and a myriad of tangles over tech-favored social issues like gay rights. And, most of all, just a fundamental disconnect between the new administration and Silicon Valley, which largely supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Of course there’s Peter Thiel , so Facebook (where he is a director) might be safe, along with Airbnb, Palantir, SoFi and other investments he has made in a myriad of tech startups. But most in Silicon Valley have no direct lines into the Trump administration, aside from tweeting congratulatory pleasantries at it in the vain hope of detente, so it will be a rough road for a while until the expected lobbying compromises are made in D.C. over the next year. And that is precisely what will happen. For all its vaunted liberal ideals of tolerance and meritocracy, tech is big business and it will find a way to live and thrive inside a Trump regime and make all the necessary compromises. There’s some good things they can get, too — all kinds of goodies for the rich, deregulation of the kind that benefits tech around employment, perhaps, and more. And a more business-friendly and free-spending administration, which will largely benefit banking, defense and infrastructure companies initially, will most certainly trickle down to tech in ways that might not seem clear right now. But government aid, obviously, is not the way that tech has thrived for so long. While it has used all the levers, most of Silicon Valley has been successful through creating innovative products and services that consumers and businesses use enthusiastically. Those that have not innovated have gotten dinged and those that have are doing well. That’s why the current stock sell-off is a short-term panic, rather than a real worry. Is it really likely that Trump will target Amazon relentlessly until it is in ruins? It makes for a compelling media story and Trump holds a grudge, but seems unlikely that this is what he wants to spend his time doing as president. As long as the company continues to improve its business in the ways that Wall Street likes, that will be all that matters, and any vindictive attacks on it by Trump will look bad for him and not Amazon. What investors will need to pay attention to is the overall market — it’s the economy, stupid, and as usual — and how issues with other countries like China and Europe develop. While there will be pressure to make more tech goods in this country, it’d be a small price to pay. They may feel bad on social media and wring their hands at the fresh daily horrors, but I predict total normalization by those in tech, who can pretzel with the best of them. And then it’s back to business as usual and the tech stocks will rise and fall based on that. recode_divider",

      "text": "Jimmy Nsubuga for Metro.co.uk Saturday 12 Nov 2016 11:29 am A driver holding an Amazon delivery (Picture: Getty) \nAmazon delivery drivers are forced to poo in bags because they work 11 hour plus shifts without taking breaks, a new documentary has claimed. \nDrivers who were employed by delivery companies also admitted they broke speed limits in order to deliver ‘up to 200 parcels’ every day, according to BBC Inside Out West . \nEven when they did manage to do this they sometimes got less than minimum wage due to working more than the legal limit of 11 hours, an undercover BBC reporter discovered after embedding himself with the AHC services agency. \nThe low wages were also apparently due to drivers having to pay other costs such as van hire and insurance. \nMORE: The Simpsons predicts Arnold Schwarzenegger will succeed Trump as President Parcels are prepared for dispatch at a Amazon warehouse (Picture: Getty Images) \nThe most disturbing claim to come out of the report was some workers felt it necessary to ‘defecate in bags’ as they could not afford to take toilet breaks if the wanted to be on time. \nFormer AHC services supervisor Cody Cooper said she was once forced to tell an employee to stop driving after he fell asleep behind the wheel. \n‘It was coming up to school time and there could [have been] a group of schoolchildren walking along… and he could have steered off,’ she told the BBC. \nDrivers who work for Amazon Logistics are self-employed, which means they don’t qualify for several employment rights, including holiday or sick pay. \nAHC Services, which is based in Oxford, said the BBC’s claims were from a year ago and the incidents were isolated. \n‘Since then we have made changes to the way our checks are carried out and taken a number of steps to improve our ways of working,’ a spokesperson said. \nThey added the firm was extremely serious about road safety. \nAmazon reiterated its commitment to ensuring safe and legal conditions for drivers and said it wanted them to be fairly paid. \nBut it could still face a grilling in parliament over the allegations, according to the BBC. \n‘We take this matter seriously and strive for continuous improvement, understanding that our progress depends on good execution and judgment of our employees and our delivery providers,’ it said in a statement. \n‘We recently contacted our delivery providers in the UK to underscore this joint commitment, as well as their contractual obligations to safety, fair compensation and treatment of drivers. \n‘Our delivery providers must abide by Amazon’s Supplier Code of Conduct and our more detailed Amazon Logistics contract. We investigate any allegation that a delivery provider is not meeting our expectations.’ \nThe undercover reporter was working from Amazon’s depot in Avonmouth, Bristol, for two weeks. \nThe report from BBC Inside Out West’s can be seen on BBC iPlayer. \n",

      "text": "Quick and Easy Monitoring of Amazon ELB \nMany high-volume applications and websites depend on Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to improve their scalability and fault tolerance. In addition to automatically routing traffic across instances and Availability Zones, Amazon ELB detects unhealthy instances and reroutes traffic to the healthy instances that remain. \nThe Loggly application pack for Classic ELB makes it easier for you to monitor what’s happening with Amazon ELB using log data. It automatically installs a dashboard in your Loggly account showing: ELB status codes over the last day Errors by client host over the last day Top error requests over the last day Average and 95th percentile backend processing times over the last day ELB Status Codes over the Last Day \nAmazon ELB reports errors as standard HTTP error codes, which can include malformed requests or server errors. If it generates an error, you may have a problem with your code, capacity, timeout settings, or more. You can see a list of error codes for Classic ELB here . Errors by Client Host over the Last Day \nThis chart can reveal the top client hosts that are getting errors from the server. If a particular host is generating too many errors, it may be due to improper requests, mismatched versions, or even misuse of the service. Top Error Requests over the Last Day \nThis chart shows the top requests that are generating ELB errors by URL and method. It reveals which resources are generating errors, such as webpages or API endpoints, and will help you determine if a significant number of errors are caused by a single page or endpoint, in which case you would want to do a deeper investigation. Average and 95th Percentile Backend Processing Times over the Last Day \nMonitoring these metrics can help you detect performance or capacity problems. Average values give you a quick read on how things are comparing to “normal,” while 95th percentile metrics take out the effect of outliers. (Read this post for more insight on why you can’t just use averages to measure performance.) Saved Searches for Amazon ELB Simplify Troubleshooting \nThe ELB application pack also includes saved searches for ELB-related error codes, large payloads, and slow processing times. Looking at this data is a handy way to understand what’s happening with your load balancing. \nYou can find these saved searches by clicking the star icon to the right of the search button. \nIn addition, you can quickly create alerts for any of of your saved searches. For example, you’d want to know right away if error codes or processing times were spiking. \nIf your application uses Amazon ELB, the ELB application pack is a quick way to up your monitoring game. And it only takes one click to get started! ",

      "text": "Average consumers are the best predictor of the economy. \nAmazon's 10-K shows its focus on the customer. \nIt show how consumer disposable income is highly predictive of the company's revenue generation. Oh snap! Tech is getting wrecked! Financials a booming, armageddon is upon us, and Trump really didn't play a role in any of this. Yes, you heard right. The market is made up of people who are fickle in nature. The underlying fundamentals and management have not changed at Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). It is funny, but there was a study my professor told me about where 4 groups of people were asked to predict the economy 10 years out. The groups consisted of CEOs, average joes, finance ministers, and another elite position. Well, you can probably guess which group was spot on. It was the average joes followed by the CEOs. The other two were aloof. I want to bring you attention to the two groups which were accurate in their forecasts and then think about who Amazon caters to. This will be the key to understanding where I am headed with this entry. Looking at the 10-Ks , we can see the following paragraph on customers. Despite being succinct, it is loaded with information. The most important parts of this paragraph are in bold. Low prices and quality are ingrained in Amazon's DNA, convenience, and with respect to the Amazon Prime memberships, it's less money, more value. These are all broad market segment and value-capturing propositions. \nConsumers \nWe serve consumers through our retail websites and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our websites to enable millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our websites directly and through our mobile websites and apps. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product pricing and shipping offers , and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use functionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, and timely customer service.

By the looks of things, I would say yes. Amazon is a basic necessities store. If the economy is that bad, I would expect to see a drop in the purchasing of basic goods and needs. It's really that simple. There is no need to perform hogwash analysis. Click to enlarge (Source: GuruFocus ) To strengthen this theory, I found a 10-year chart of US disposable income. It does appear to trend in the same direction as Amazon's revenues.

My dependent variable was Amazon's revenues and my independent variable was disposable income. Here are the results below. Summary Output",

The sound bar supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, has a total power output of 150W, and works across four audio channels. The SH6 is compatible with Dolby DTS, Dolby Digital, and DTS Digital Surround audio processing, and is also compatible with LG Music Flow systems. \nBuy Now: LG SH6 Sound Bar at Amazon UK for £209.99 What we said \nWe haven’t reviewed this particular model, but we reviewed the slightly less expensive LG SH7 Sound Bar, which we gave a 3.5/5 score. We praised the SH7 for its slim, discreet design, its exciting, powerful sound with rich bass, and its good range of features and streaming services. What owners say \nOn Amazon, the LG SH6 Sound Bar has a 4/5 score based on one user review. The user wrote: \n“I bought this because I didn’t want to have a separate sub-woofer taking up room next to the TV stand. Given that the sub-woofers are built in, I am impressed with the volume and breadth of the sound output. Personally, I like the industrial design, and it integrates well with the LG Music Flow system that we have installed throughout the house.” \nOn Currys, the LG SH6 Sound Bar has a 10/10 score based on one user review. The user wrote: \n“Fills the room with sound, and a good bass too. Only use it for the TV and never get anywhere near half power.\" \nYou may also like:",

      "text": "Buy from Amazon \nStrictly speaking, this isn't sword-and-sorcery -- there is little violent action, and the supernatural is confined to the presence of a single godlike entity. But the aura of the show is still very much the same. It takes place in an analogue of medieval Europe, where a wandering merchant finds himself partnered with a fox-god that's outlived her usefulness. Her heightened senses and his merchant's instincts allow the two of them to get the upper hand in most every deal they cut ... well, almost every deal. \nAside from the more generic fantasy aspects, the show's real charm is in the way it tackles economics -- yes, economics -- as an ongoing theme, and uses each of their encounters as a mini-lesson of sorts. It sounds deeply unlikely, but the result is consistently interesting in a way that just watching someone plow through legions of monsters isn't. Check Amazon rating » \ncontinue reading below our video Highest Paid Male Actors Ever Vision of Escaflowne. Image courtesy Pricegrabber Buy from Amazon \nA twist on the \"girl thrown into another world\" concept, with at least as many elements from mecha anime as from heroic fantasy, but enough of the latter that it still deserves mention here. High school student Hitomi is propelled into the world of Gaea, where a great war rages between the conquering empire of Zaibach and its neighboring territories. Hitomi finds she has psychic powers that are amplified by her presence in Gaea, and joins forces with Van Fanel -- a young man piloting a craft that's more like a dragon than a conventional fighting robot. \nThe story also muses about the way magic and science are often freely mistaken for each other (or the way one is used to masquerade as the other), but doesn't skimp on the swashbuckling action or a broad palette of quirky supporting characters. (Viva Merle the catgirl!) Further bonus points are awarded for the presence of the ever-excellent Yoko Kanno on the soundtrack. A much darker feature-length movie retelling ( Escaflowne: The Movie ) makes major changes to the characters and storyline to fit them into a 100-minute running time, and is best checked out after you've digested the TV series. Check Amazon rating » Utawarerumono. Image courtesy Pricegrabber Buy from Amazon \nSay it \"oo-ta-wa-re-roo-moh-noh.\" It means admirable things in Japanese, and it's the admittedly confusing and not-very-compelling title for a remarkable series. It's actually closest in spirit and concept to Guin Saga : a stranger with no memory and a mask he cannot remove finds himself dropped into the middle of a war between competing races. He soon becomes the commander of the people who took him in, but soon he (and the audience) discover that things are far more complicated and morally ambiguous than they might first appear. \nThe show's biggest flaw is the out-of-nowhere ending, which detours abruptly into science fiction for no particular good reason except to give us a way to provide an exterior set of motives for everything that's happened so far. But up until that point it's well worth it, and it grows in genuinely unexpected ways as it unfolds. Check Amazon rating »",
