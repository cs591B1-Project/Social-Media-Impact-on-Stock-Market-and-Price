      "title": "Microsoft releases Windows 10 Anniversary Update to Current Branch for Business",
      "text": "\nIt’s been almost 5 months since Microsoft released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update to consumers. Today, the company is releasing the Anniversary Update to the Current Branch for Business (CBB). In a blog post, Microsoft’s Michael Neihaus stated that the company has addressed nearly thousand issues reported by users, which is pretty huge. The software giant is releasing Windows 10 Build 14393.447 to CBB, and users in the CBB can now install the update on their machines.\nWindows 10 Anniversary Update brings a number of new features and enhancements for businesses, including some new security features such as Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP). WDATP allows businesses to identify and respond to advanced attacks on their network. The update brings several other improvements to the operating system, including improved information protection, identity protection, and much more . Of course, the update includes the usual consumer-focused features, such as support for extensions in Microsoft Edge, Universal Windows Platform improvements, Windows Hello integration in third-party apps, improvements to the Start Screen and Cortana, Linux subsystem on Windows, and a lot more. Once again, these are mostly consumer-focused, so businesses likely won’t be using any of the features at the moment.\nUsers in the Current Branch for Business should be able to get the Windows 10 Anniversary Update right now, and it’ll be coming to the Long Term Servicing Branch in the near-future.\n",

      "text": "Experiencing virtual reality — and gravity — in a Microsoft store. (Facebook screen shot via George Takei) The makers of virtual reality headsets and content may still be waiting for consumers to fall for the medium as a full-fledged entertainment option, but one guy in a viral Facebook video is ahead of the curve — at least when it comes to the falling part.\nPlenty of users have no doubt stumbled and probably even hit the deck while becoming disoriented inside of a VR world. Capturing video of that happening might even pass as more entertaining than what can be seen inside the headset.\nGeorge Takei , Facebook’s resident sharer of stuff that makes us laugh, posted a video credited to the video feed Jukin Media in which a man is seen trying out an Oculus headset inside a Microsoft store. The video has been viewed 8.5 million times.\n\nThe man is playing a game in which he is climbing some sort of cliff or mountain. He does a check of the ground to see how high up he is and as he’s reaching to climb higher, the man falls face first to the real-world floor. A Microsoft employee contains her laughter long enough to ask the man if he’s OK, which he says he is as he gets back to his feet.\nPerhaps the strangest part of the entire scene occurs in the background, as Facebook commenters point out on Takei’s page. Watch for two Microsoft workers who rise from behind a counter when they hear the crash and then descend again after assessing the situation.\nReality wins again.",

      "text": "| 0 Comments | 0 Share \nOn today’s Microsoft Mechanics, we look at the latest in intelligent Office app experiences spanning PowerPoint, Excel, Word, Outlook and the browser. Ben Walters presents how Office can bring in intelligence via the Microsoft Graph, Azure Machine Learning and Delve to save you time. \nBen kicks off his demonstration with PowerPoint Designer, a new way to automatically design slide layouts when importing pictures or other visual elements. Designer now also works with text-based lists to apply visual formats. Going beyond slide design and formatting, Ben also highlights PowerPoint QuickStarter, which uses the Microsoft Graph to pull in content ideas and photos, creating a great starting point for your presentations. \nIn Word, we take a look at Word Tap, a new feature that also uses intelligence with Delve to bring in recent content like charts and graphs. Within Word, Ben also shows how machine learning can also help improve writing by looking for word redundancies, jargon, gender-specific language and more. \nIn Excel, we explore the new Azure Machine Learning add-in to run text sentiment analysis, then use map charts to give a visual representation of data inserted via the Azure Machine Learning add-in. \nIn Outlook, we’re using intelligence and machine learning to help assess the importance of incoming email via the new Focused Inbox. The MyAnalytics add-in also helps track information about how your email is being read, reply rates and the timing of these activities. For Outlook Mobile, we’re applying intelligence to find important events like flight information using Action Cards; also scheduling calendar events is much easier on the phone using integrated free/busy information with meeting attendees. \nIn the browser, Office 365 not only uses the intelligence from Delve to surface important content you’ve been working on, but you can also customize the App Launcher to highlight the important apps to you and be directly linked to Office 365 capabilities using the intelligent Tell Me engine from Office 365 Help. \nWhile this is a glimpse of some the capabilities rolling out to Office via First Release and the Office Insider program, there is much more coming. Of course, to see all of this in action, you’ll want to check out today’s show. \n—Jeremy Chapman",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft released cumulative update KB3200970 for Windows 10 as a part of this month’s Patch Tuesday. The update caused a lot of problems to users who installed it. We already told you about t he most common problems . \nEver since users reported the issues, Microsoft has remained silent about possible workarounds. Well, until now. The company has recently spoken about installation issues on Lenovo laptops. Redmond explains in the KB page that a UEFI update was released by Lenovo, in order to address possible problems. \n“Some Lenovo servers do not start after this update is installed. Lenovo is aware of this problem and has released a UEFI update to address it. In the interim, Microsoft has changed the detection logic in the update to prevent additional customers from being affected.” \nLenovo also confirms the problem. However, according to the company, only devices running Windows Server 2016, 2012R2, or 2012 November update are affected. Lenovo also provided workaround instructions for the affected users. \nTo resolve the problem, you need to disable the Automatic Update, install Lenovo’s UEFI update, and then install the cumulative update, as well. Many problems remain unsolved \nMicrosoft and Lenovo addressed the installation issue on Lenovo’s laptops. However, as you can see from our report article, the update caused many more issues. Microsoft remained silent about all other problems on non-Lenovo computers, as they remained unsolved. \nSo, even though we have some feedback, the majority of users find it useless. The only thing affected users can do is wait for Microsoft to acknowledge these problems, or wait for another cumulative update. \nThe new cumulative update for Windows 10 will be released relatively soon, during December’s Patch Tuesday . Microsoft might decide to release a new update sooner, but it seems unlikely now. When the update gets released, we’ll see if the issues still persist. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Microsoft’s latest experimental Android app lets you easily copy and share text onscreen",
      "text": "Microsoft’s Garage division, which regularly pumps out experimental apps, today released a new Android app that could be useful to many people. It examines the raw text that’s displayed on the screen and makes it super simple to copy whichever regions of text you’re interested in and then do things with it — like share it in another app, email it, or make a Wunderlist task out of it.\nThis app, which goes by the name Clip Layer , might seem like a low-level utility — it’s just a clipboard, you can say. But it’s more sophisticated. It relies on Android’s Assist application programming interface (API) to detect visible text and then take action on it.\nGoogle’s own Google App for Android does this, in order to deliver Google Now On Tap , a feature that takes a look at what’s onscreen and then shows you cards about entities that Google recognizes, along with deep links to related content in apps. \nMicrosoft has even tapped the Assist API for its Cortana virtual assistant app on Android . But with that app, when you use the gesture to trigger the assistant — holding down on the home button, the Cortana homescreen pops up and gives you a shortcut to making a voice query.\nWith Clip Layer the implementation is different, and so are the results. After holding down the home button you’ll see very thin squares appear around text onscreen, and when you tap inside those squares, the contents will darken. You can check to see what the app has picked up by hitting the T in a green circle in the top right corner of the display. If you want, you can tap on other regions. Once you’ve got what you want, you can hit “copy,” “task,” “email,” and share” buttons at the bottom of the screen to take action on the text that the app has grabbed.\nThe app doesn’t work perfectly in the sense that it can simply not detect some text that’s onscreen.\nBut still, this app could have value because sometimes text is simply difficult to copy and then paste into another app, and with Clip Layer that type of thing is easier.\nThe person behind the app is Steve Won, who is a senior designer on the Microsoft Office team. Before Clip Layer, he worked on another Microsoft Garage app, the Hub Keyboard third-party virtual keyboard app, which has a button that lets you quickly copy text to the clipboard, among other things.\n“There’s been a lot of growth with smartphones and ecosystems, as there are more apps that come into stores, but the same problem keeps persisting: less apps able to talk with each other, as they’re designed to work independent of each other,” Won is quoted as saying in a blog post today from Athima Chansanchai, a writer at the Microsoft News Center. “But while the keyboard is focused on input and only shows up when the app allows input, Clip Layer has more coverage and works on any screen. Hub Keyboard was focused composing, and this one is focused on sharing and re-using what already exists.”\n",

      "title": "Julie’s gadget diary – Using the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (Day 1-3)",
      "text": "{ 0 comments } \nA few weeks ago I complained about the weight and bulk of the gear that I take with me when I travel. On my last trip to Florida, I took a 13″ laptop, 10″ tablet, my phone, various cords and AC adapters. Combine that gear with the weight of the bag that holds all of it and it was not fun lugging it through the airport from gate to gate. I in my gadget diary post I talked about how I wished I could make a tablet (iOS or Android) do everything I need while I’m away from home. When I got back home I ordered a 12.9″ iPad Pro with hopes that it would become my next travel buddy. No luck, I returned it to Apple. \nEach time I post about my travel gear experiences, I have a few people suggest that I should try a Microsoft Surface Pro 4. I finally listened and ordered one on Thanksgiving day to take advantage of a $429 discount on the SP4 256GB/i5 8GB RAM with the Type Cover. I received it this past Saturday and immediately noticed how slow it was browsing the web. I thought it might be defective but then I googled “surface pro 4 slow wifi” and found that this is a known issue with some WiFi routers . It appeared that the SP4 didn’t get along with my Amplifi router . I tried the registry edit that is supposed to fix the problem, but it didn’t help, so I switched back to my TP-Link Archer C7 router which did help but not enough to make me want to use the SP4. So ignored it all day Sunday. \nOn Monday I took the SP4 with me to my day job in order to take advantage of the faster broadband so I could install any needed OS updates. The updates seem to have fixed all the issues because when I took the SP4 back home that night, it worked like a champ. \nI also installed the Chrome browser, Photoshop and a few other tools to duplicate some of the tools I use on my MacBook Pro. I installed tools like AutoHotkey which lets me use macros to insert frequently typed text, Irfanview for batch renaming and resizing of images and Wondershare Filmora for editing video clips. And with that, I was ready to use the SP4 exclusively (at home) for the next couple of days to determine if I’ll keep it or return it. \nI spent Monday night using the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 on a desk, on my lap sitting on a couch, while reclining in my LazyBoy recliner and as a tablet with the Type Cover keyboard detached. Here are a few of my first impressions. Nice hardware that is light weight while still feeling like a quality device and not a cheap toy. Actually feels “ok” using it on my lap with the keyboard attached. The kickstand, not sure what Microsoft calls it, is really pretty cool. It opens and stays open at the exact angle I choose, so it feels stable perched on my thighs. I need to look up how to do a right mouse click when using the touchpad I’m a touchpad snob and tend to compare every touchpad that I try with the one on my MacBook Pro. Although the SP4’s touchpad is a little on the small side, it does work well enough that I don’t hate it. But I’m not exactly in love with it either. Tablet mode works well too. In the past, I’ve complained that Windows 10 isn’t finger friendly, but the SP4’s display is large enough that I didn’t have that much trouble tapping small onscreen buttons in the browser. Using the onscreen keyboard while in tablet mode is doable, but it takes up most of the screen. The Type Cover is very nice. I enjoyed touch typing on it and noticed almost no flex when using it on a desk or on my lap. The keys are nicely spaced and provide great tactile feedback. They even have a backlight which surprised me. \nThat’s all for now. I will post another update after I have a chance to put it through my normal work flow for a couple days. So far I like it a lot more than I thought I would, but I don’t know if it’s that much of an update over my Dell XPS 13″ , so it remains to be seen if I end up keeping it. Share this story",

Its latest such exclusive for Google’s mobile OS is called Clip Layer, and it’s designed to help people clip and save content from any app.\nSee also: Microsoft Garage releases Parchi, a simple and light notes app that uses hashtags October 22, 2015 The app comes from Microsoft’s experimental Garage division, which has previously released Android apps like Parchi , Sprightly and Kaizala . In the case of Clip Layer, Microsoft says the idea came from Steve Won, a senior designer with its Office team. Won, who previously released the Android-based Hub Keyboard for Android and iOS via the Garage division, said he was getting annoyed by the fact that some Android apps would not allow him to copy and paste their content. Also, he found that even if some apps did allow that to happen, the process of copying was simply too hard.\nHis solution turned into Clip Layer. When activated, the app puts a universal overlay over any Android screen. That overlay allows content on any Android app to be quickly selected and copied with just a tap to the clipboard. From there, it should be easy to share that content via email or other methods.\nIf you’re interested in trying it out, Clip Layer is now available to download for free from the Google Play Store.\nGet it at Google Play ",

      "text": "Microsoft today said that it has enhanced certain versions of its PowerPoint presentation-building program with real-time collaborative editing. \nThis feature came to Word on desktop last year. And before that it was available through Office Online. Microsoft said last year that real-time coauthoring would come to all of its desktop apps, and now Microsoft is executing on that commitment.\nAbove: Real-time collaboration in PowerPoint.\nImage Credit: Microsoft Just like in Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, this feature is lets you “see what others are typing as it happens on a given slide,” Microsoft Office corporate vice president Kirk Koenigsbauer wrote in a blog post .\nThe feature is live now in PowerPoint on Windows for people who subscribe to Office 365 and belong to the Office Insider program. In addition, it’s now available to everyone in PowerPoint Mobile on Windows tablets, Koenigsbauer wrote.\nAlso today Microsoft said it has started showing notifications for certain kinds of activity in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on Android and Windows Mobile for people in the Office Insider program. The feature will be coming to iOS in the next few weeks. Commercial customers will start seeing mobile notifications in the next few months.\nAdditionally Microsoft has begun to show a Shared With Me section in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on Macs, Windows desktops, Android, and iOS for Office 365 subscribers. The feature is designed to help users more quickly locate files that other people have recently shared with them.\n",

      "text": "Comments 0 Advertisement \nIf you are currently participating in the Microsoft Teams Preview program with Office 365 you are likely using the Windows desktop Teams app for that experience. \nIn my opinion the desktop app is the best way to experience the Microsoft Teams Preview however, it has one shortcoming in that it lacks the ability to disable it from automatically starting up when you start your computer up. \nI suspect this will be addressed in a future app update but in the meantime you can use the Start Up tab in the Windows Task Manager to disable the app from starting automatically. Disabling this capability does not impact the apps ability to be used on your system. \nTo do this just bring up Task Manager by searching for it on your system and then selecting the search result that lists the Task Manager desktop app. \nOnce that app is opened up select the Start Up tab. \nLook for Update.exe with the Microsoft Teams icon, highlighted in the screenshot above, and then select the Disable button in the lower right hand corner of the Task Manager window. \nAlternatively, you can right click on the Update.exe and select Disable from the Context menu. \nOnce you have disabled the Update.exe for Microsoft Teams you can exit Task Manager. \nIn the future Microsoft Teams will not automatically start up on your system but is still available to begin manually from the Start Menu. \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",

      "text": "Xbox One beats out PlayStation 4 in U.S. Black Friday sales Microsoft can notch another sales victory on its belt  at least for Black Friday. According to Adobe's annual Black Friday sales report (via VentureBeat ), the Xbox One took a sales lead over the PlayStation 4 on the holiday shopping day in the U.S., coming in fifth on the list the top-selling electronics. While the Xbox One came out ahead of the PlayStation 4 on Black Friday, it still landed behind iPads, Samsung 4k TVs, the MacBook Air, and LG TVs in the category of electronics. Interestingly, Cyber Monday sales saw a noticeable shift, according to Adobe's numbers, placing the PlayStation 4 as the top-selling product in electronics (just ahead of Xbox) for that day. Microsoft has enjoyed a surge in Xbox One sales over the past several months, bolstered by the strength of the Xbox One S and enticing bundle deals. In fact, October marked the fourth consecutive month that the Xbox One took the top sales spot in North America, according to NDP. Adobe's overall numbers might indicate a shift from this pattern, however: while Xbox may have won Black Friday, Adobe's number show PlayStation 4 as the top-selling console for the rest of November.",

      "text": "The Surface Studio all-in-one PC is now being shipped to the first lucky buyers, and this offered iFixIt the opportunity of performing its typical state-of-the-art teardown and let us know what’s inside Microsoft’s first such device in history. One of the surprising things under the case of the Surface Studio is the processor itself, as the Redmond-based software giant opted for an ARM chip on an Intel-powered configuration. While few people expected to see Microsoft going for this processor, it’s also confirmation that the firm still believes in ARM and continues to invest in it – rumor has it that several projects involving ARM chips are being developed at Microsoft, including an emulator that would make it possible for future Windows phones to run x86 apps. iFixIt also reveals that the Surface Studio’s base is easy to open and it hosts several modular components, including the SATA hard drive and the SSD, so you can replace any of them quite easily.

      "text": "Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Neil deGrasse Tyson, right, waves to onlookers at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday, Sept. 11, 2016, in Los Angeles. Neil deGrasse Tyson ’s plan to get Donald Trump ’s attention can only be described in one word: gripping.\nThe astrophysicist joked Friday he’d need to make a bold move to get the president-elect to engage in science talk. Like grabbing him by the crotch, for instance:\nWhen I meet President Trump, I may first grab his crotch -- to get his attention -- then discuss Science with him.\n— Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 18, 2016 Don’t worry, we’re pretty sure Tyson is joking. (The tweet is a clear reference to a recording released in October of the president-elect bragging about groping women by the genitals .)\n“When you’re a star,” Trump says in the audio (and to be clear, by “star” he means himself, not a celestial body), “they let you do it.”\nTyson has happily riffed on slogans Trump has popularized. Following the election last week, Tyson appeared on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and suggested a new mission for the country: “ make America smart again .”\nAlso on HuffPost Twitter Tears Into Mike Pence's Many Science Fails With #PenceScience 21 Twitter Tears Into Mike Pence's Many Science Fails With #PenceScience 1 of 21 Share this slide:\nE does not = mc2!\nIf E equaled mc2, then my name would be Mike Pmc2nce! #PenceScience\n— Randi Mayem Singer (@rmayemsinger) August 9, 2016 More: Donald Trump Neil Degrasse Tyson Suggest a correction Comments POLITICS 1.94 M 991 ",

      "text": "Microsoft tech support scam now also in ransomware variant   19:01   \nThe Microsoft scam now also has a variant where ransomware is used to force users to pay. Where the alleged authority of Microsoft employees was previously abused to call people at home, fake Microsoft employees are now used to convince victims to pay for ransomware. \nA new ransomware that abuses this was discovered by Malwarebytes. The antivirus vendor reports that infections take place through bundling with malicious software. \nThe ransomware is called “Vindows” after a typo in both the file extensions of the encrypted files, and in the ransom note. The note is shown after all files are encrypted and states, “this not microsoft vindows support we have locked your files with the zeus virus do one thing and call level 5 microsoft support technician at 1-844-609-3192 you will files back for a one time charge of $349.99”. \nWhen a victim calls the number in the note he is connected to a scammer in India that pretends to be a Microsoft employee. “They have no real intention of decrypting your files though as they simply want your money,” Malwarebytes writes on their blog. \nThe encryption used by the ransomware was not done properly, so Malwarebytes was able to create a free decryption tool that allows victims to get their data back without paying.

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone With More RAM, Larger HD Screen, More Apps Microsoft Surface Phone With More RAM, Larger HD Screen, More Apps \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio , but new devices won’t ship until “early 2017.” \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone Using Snapdragon, Windows 10 News – Report Microsoft Surface Phone Using Snapdragon, Windows 10 News – Report 1 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "Home Business Microsoft Surface Phone Rumors At Amazon Following Cyber Monday Microsoft Surface Phone Rumors At Amazon Following Cyber Monday Jennifer Hong Nov 29, 2016 Business Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Phone Rumors At Amazon Following Cyber Monday 1 \nShoppers are getting ready for Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology HP Elite X3 Technology: Microsoft Surface Phone That Spins Lumia Series Hardware HP Elite X3 Technology: Microsoft Surface Phone That Spins Lumia Series Hardware 3 \nIn our HP Elite X3 review, we take a look at a third-party surface phone while Microsoft stays committed to Windows 10 Mobile. But the company hasn’t released any new device in the last 6 months or so, making everyone believe that it’s ready to give up at least on the hardware side of its mobile push. \nWith rumors that Microsoft is also aiming to abandon the Lumia lineup, every new phone coming from a different company is catching everyone’s attention, and this is exactly what happened with the HP Elite X3. \nAnnounced with much fanfare earlier this year, the HP Elite X3 comes with specs that Windows Phone fans have until now only dreamed about, despite the Lumia 950 series, which also brought specs that were compelling to say the least. \nBut the HP Elite X3 arrives at a time when only few people still believe in Windows phones, so there’s no doubt that hardcore fans really need to give it a shot. \nThat’s exactly what we did, as we took the HP Elite X3 for a spin and used it for several weeks, including with Continuum, to see what this is all about. This time, we’re going to split the review into two parts, namely hardware and software, so read on to find more about this super-powerful Windows phone. \nHardware \nIn terms of hardware, there’s no way you’re not going to be pleased with the HP Elite X3, although there still are things that would need more improvements. But let’s take them one at a time and see what this is all about. \n#Display \nThe HP Elite X3 comes with a 5.96-inch display that you’ll absolutely love. It has a resolution of 1440×2560 pixels, with a pixel density of 494 ppi, and although it looks huge at first, it has major advantages. \nWith a screen-to-body ratio of 72.2 percent, the phone has plenty of screen space to work with, so it’s absolutely a pleasure to browse the web or watch movies. \n“BRILLIANT DISPLAY!” \nIt’s so awesome! Colors are vivid, and the contrast is excellent, much better than on the other Windows phones on the market. The phone also comes with features such as double tap to wake, which is kind of handy given its size, but it lacks Glance screen, and this is one very important setback. \nIt does have a LED notification light to compensate for the lack of Glance, but Windows 10 Mobile does not have advanced support for this feature, so you can’t configure it to blink when you have missed third-party notifications just yet. \nThe response time of the display is impressive to say the least and readability in direct sunlight is a bit above the average. \n#CPU, RAM, and storage \nThis phone comes with the most powerful Snapdragon processor at the moment, namely the 820, which is quad-core in the following configuration: 2 cores running at 2.15 GHz and 2 running at 1.6 GHz. Depending on the power you need, the more powerful cores kick in, giving the phone impressive performance figures. \nThe Elite X3 features 4 GB of RAM, which is pretty much the biggest amount of memory that you can find right now in the Windows phone world, and 64 GB of storage, obviously with microSD card support. \nThe aforementioned configuration makes the HP Elite X3 blazing fast 90 percent of the time, and the remaining 10 percent is lost only because of Windows 10 Mobile. \nThe phone barely gets hot when performing more demanding tasks, such as when watching videos, but even when it does, the cooling system is super-efficient. \nThe amount of storage that the device offers is not overwhelming, but it’s a good thing that it comes with microSD card support. This is something that Apple should borrow as well, although we all know that’s not going to happen.",

And before that it was available through Office Online. Microsoft said last year that real-time coauthoring would come to all of its desktop apps, and now Microsoft is executing on that commitment.\nJust like in Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, this feature lets you \"see what others are typing as it happens on a given slide,\" Microsoft Office corporate vice president Kirk Koenigsbauer wrote in a blog post .\nThe feature is live now in PowerPoint on Windows for people who subscribe to Office 365 and belong to the Office Insider program. In addition, it's now available to everyone in PowerPoint Mobile on Windows tablets, Koenigsbauer wrote.\nAlso today, Microsoft said it has started showing notifications for certain kinds of activity in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on Android and Windows Mobile for people in the Office Insider program. The feature will be coming to iOS in the next few weeks. Commercial customers will start seeing mobile notifications in the next few months.\nFor more about Microsoft, watch: \nAdditionally, Microsoft has begun to show a Shared With Me section in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on Macs, Windows desktops, Android, and iOS for Office 365 subscribers. The feature is designed to help users more quickly locate files that other people have recently shared with them.\nThis post was originally published on VentureBeat . All rights reserved. ",

      "text": "Learn More \nMicrosoft surprised everyone with its dramatic unveiling of the Surface Studio all-in-one aimed at creative professionals. The introduction video included animated exploded views of the machine’s interior, showing how its many-layered 28-inch high-resolution display is put together and highlighting the complexity of the base PC and its innovative hinge mechanism. \nPutting such a complex machine together takes some serious design that is perhaps best demonstrated by tearing the thing apart. In predictable fashion, that’s precisely what the repair experts at iFixit have done, and the effort revealed that the Surface Studio is relatively repairable and even somewhat capable of being upgraded despite its complex design. \nMore: Designer or scribbler, you’ll fall in love with Microsoft’s Surface Studio \nOverall, iFixit gives the Surface Studio a five out of ten for repairability. Compared to today’s thin-and-light notebooks, such as the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and the Surface Book , both of which received one out of ten scores, the Surface Studio is a repairman’s dream — although as we’ll see, some components aren’t repairable at all. \nTo begin with, the Surface Studio is rather hefty at 21 pounds, and as an AIO device, it takes some work to move it around. Apparently, the machine’s balance is excellent, as iFixit notes that transitioning the screen to its 20-degree orientation — a popular angle for drawing and drafting — is a matter of just a finger push. At the same time, the display assembly can be replaced as a single component and doesn’t require taking apart the screen or the machine’s base. \nOnce the iFixiteers attacked the base unit, they found the presence of Torx screws that allowed for easy access rather than glue that would make getting inside the base far more difficult. Inside, things are as complex as might be imagined when so much technology is jammed into such a tight space. The cooling assembly, made up of heat pipes and dual fans, looks sufficient to keep things cool, which is a positive. Overall, while many components are integrated, as expected, getting at them and replacing them shouldn’t be an issue for Microsoft repair staff. Sam Lionheart/iFixit \nOn a highly positive note, the machine’s assembly should make upgrading the storage a possibility. A standard and removable SanDisk 64GB Z400s M.2 SSD is one half of the equation, and a standard SATA drive is the other. Both can be replaced, which is a particularly good thing given that Microsoft put a SATA II and not SATA III drive into the unit, possible explaining the poor drive performance we noted in our review. Whether or not this unit can be replaced with a SATA III drive for improved performance remains to be seen. Sam Lionheart/iFixit \niFixit uncovered no other major surprises. The Surface Studio is not only an innovative machine that incorporates some components that are optimized for its creative professional market. It’s also a relatively easy machine to repair, and is to some degree capable of being upgraded for good measure. And, the hinge mechanism is a thing of beauty that iFixit rightly calls the “crown jewel” of the Surface Studio’s design. Also watch: Microsoft’s Reveal, the Surface Studio and updated Surface Book",

      "text": "Microsoft Garage's Clip Layer aims to solve Android's terrible copy-paste abiltiies Microsoft Garage's Clip Layer aims to solve Android's terrible copy-paste abiltiies Posted: Tags : Android - Android + Microsoft - Microsoft + Apps - Apps + If you've ever tried to copy/paste content such as text and images between two Android apps, then you're surely aware that the process is a bit unreliable at times. Recognizing this as a major setback for productivity-minded users, the Microsoft Garage experimental app studio has just launched an app that promises to streamline the process. Meet Microsoft's new Android app, Clip Layer.According to Microsoft, the idea for Clip Layer came from Steve Won, a senior designer in the Office team with close ties to the Microsoft Garage division. Won, who previously authored the Hub Keyboard app, says that he became frustrated that some Android apps do not allow the user to copy content. Even worse, when copying is allowed, the process is not very intuitive nor is it customizable. In an attempt to fix what Won perceived to be a limitation, he got the idea to create Clip Layer, an Android app aims to make it much easier to copy/paste content between apps. Clip Layer creates a universal overlay on top of any Android screen. All the user has to do is activate Clip Layer via the home button, select the content that needs to be copied, and then copy it to the clipboard. From this point on, the contents of the clipboard can be pasted in any app, such as email, IM, or social media. If this sounds like a solution to a problem you've encountered before, make sure to give Clip Layer a chance. It's completely free, so just head on over to the source link below and install it on your Android device.",

      "text": "Microsoft Brings Its Timeless Brand of Solitaire to Mobile by cards Solitaire Advertisement \nThere’s a lot of history behind Microsoft Solitaire Collection. It’s fair to say that, for a lot of people, a version of the card-laying single player game will have been one of their first video gaming experiences. \nAnd now you can pick it up for nothing on iOS and Android. And this isn’t just one game, it’s actually a bundle of five different versions of solitaire, each of them adding its own twist to the making-piles-of-cards formula. \nThere’s Klondike, which is the traditional version of the game. And on top of that you get the Spider, Freecell, Tripeaks and Pyramid variations of well. \nIf that’s not enough, Microsoft has added in Xbox Live Support that let you earn Achievements as you play, and daily challenges that are spread across all five games and offer four different difficulty settings every single day. You’ll earn badges and rewards for completing them. \nSolitaire is fairly defined as a classic card game, and while it might not have the thrills and action of the likes of Hearthstone, there’s still something cathartic about clearing a board on your lunch break. \nYou can pick up Microsoft Solitaire Collection right now on the App Store and the Google Play Store for absolutely nothing. Bargain.",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Phone rumors and news leaks",
      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nIt seemed inevitable that Microsoft would create a Surface Phone — not an official name — after it acquired Nokia. In fact, there was talk long before that too , but Microsoft has often denied those rumors and stuck with producing new Lumia phones. However, rumors and leaks regarding such a device have continued, suggesting it’s something the company may still be considering. Here’s everything we think we know about Microsoft’s Surface Phone project.\nMicrosoft may wait until late 2017 to release Surface Phone After the Surface Phone failed to make an appearance at Microsoft’s 2016 BUILD conference , two reports from Windows Central quoting sources close to the matter, said Microsoft could wait until early 2017 to release the new device. The site’s late April report states April 2017 is the current target for the new smartphone. The first report said that instead of one Surface Phone, Microsoft could release three models. Early plans for the Surface Phone release allegedly suggest that there will be a consumer model, a business model, and an “enthusiast” model, or a high-spec version for tech geeks. Details about possible specs for the devices or what the difference will be between the three models have yet to be released.\nThe rumored timing of the Surface Phone has recently been pushed out to late 2017 . This follows statements by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in November 2016 that provides a tiny bit of clarification to Microsoft’s official position on smartphones. Specifically, Nadella indicated that Microsoft does not want to simply compete with the industry leaders with a “me-too” device but rather wants to focus its efforts and develop the “ultimate” mobile devices. If one reads between the lines, it would seem that the Surface Phone will be a high-end smartphone that’s possibly aimed at providing very specific value to the business market, serving as a halo device for Microsoft’s long-term mobile strategy, or some combination of both.\nRedstone 2 and 3 to improve Windows 10 Mobile The Windows 10 ‘Redstone’ update, also known as the Windows 10 Anniversary update, came and went without any more information on the Surface Phone. The Anniversary Update provided a number of new features to smartphones, but nothing earth-shattering, and it will be the next two versions of the operating system that will focus on “innovation around mobile phones,” according to multiple sources speaking to Windows Central .\nRedstone 2 and Redstone 3 aren’t expected until early and late 2017, respectively, the latter of which fits in with the prospective Surface Phone launch date now being rumored. When Redstone 3 does arrive , the resulting Surface Phone will apparently be promoted as the most secure phone in the world and the best for productivity. Part of this may include native support for Win32 apps provided by an enhanced version of the Continuum PC-like environment created when a Windows 10 Mobile device is connected to an external display, keyboard, and mouse.\nThe Lumia 950 and 950 XL offers some compatibility with x86 apps through Continuum, but no way to use them natively. Making them run on the phone without the help of a more powerful and expensive machine, might be a killer feature for power users. However, it’s warned the feature may be dropped before launch, if the experience isn’t polished enough.\nMicrosoft’s intention, say the sources, is to make the future Surface phone a true alternative to a PC, using both this feature and Continuum.\nBenchmarks and high-end specs rumored, then quashed A phone running Windows 10 and the Edge browser was spotted on the HTML5test benchmarking website in late November 2015. According to PocketNow , the version of Windows 10 was old, and one which was never released outside of the company, while the Edge browser was also older than the existing versions. The rumor suggested the phone was in testing for some time, and was likely an abandoned Nokia-derived device.\nRelated: Microsoft Band 2 review\nMore recently, Intel rumors have been challenged by Intel’s scaling back its mobile SoC market . Now, it appears that Microsoft will be working to emulate the x86 environment in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile to provide support for full Windows desktop applications. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 SoC has been rumored to power the Surface Phone along with 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile. Two versions are alleged, including a 6GB RAM version with the version of Continuum supporting x86 applications and a 4GB RAM version without it.\nMicrosoft purchased surfacephone.com If you’re looking for a hint that Microsoft will introduce a Surface Phone sometime in the future, then look no further than one Reddit user’s discovery in late January 2016. It appears that Microsoft owns surfacephone.com , and the company even went as far as redirecting it to the main Surface website.\nRelated: Can a Surface Phone save Windows 10 Mobile?\nBefore you go jumping for joy, this is far from a confirmation that Microsoft is readying a Surface Phone. Often, companies like to stay out of legal trouble by registering domain names that correlate with a current product.\nView photos\nmicrosoft-windows-mobile-surface-phone-1 More We also need to point out that surfacephone.com was actually registered in May 2007, so it’s not like Microsoft recently purchased it to get ready for a new Surface Phone launch.\nFurthermore, Microsoft’s Surface page is within microsoft.com as in https://www.microsoft.com/surface/ . Microsoft isn’t even using surface.com for its current crop of Surface devices, and so why would the company use surfacephone.com for a Surface Phone if it gets released? And by the way, Microsoft registered surface.com back in 1994 and is redirecting it to you know where … its main Surface Web page.\nWhile this news doesn’t confirm a Surface Phone will exist some day, along with all of the other information being leaked it does give hope that the Redmond company is at least thinking about it.\nMicrosoft executive hints about a better phone Those looking for more slivers of information about the rumored Surface Mobile device may want to take note of what Microsoft’s Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela said on This Week in Tech’s Windows Weekly podcast in December 2015.\n“We need more breakthrough work … with Surface we had a bunch of early misfires, but that notion of a tablet that could replace your laptop — that notion of saying, ‘Hey, Apple wants to sell you an iPad and they want to sell you a Mac, we think there’s one device that exploits the seam between those two devices’ — we need some sort of spiritual equivalent on the phone side that doesn’t just feel like a phone for people who love Windows,” Capossela said on the podcast.\nRelated: Why you absolutely, by no means should even consider buying a Windows Phone\n“It has got to be a phone that’s sort of like ‘wow, that’s a real shocker,’ or ‘that’s a real breakthrough,’ and has got to make me pause before I buy my 17th iPhone, and we need time to actually go built that.”\nThe question arises around the 36-minute mark, after tech writer Mary Jo Foley expresses her dismay at the current Windows Phone environment. Capossela made no mention of whether this “breakthrough” phone will be a part of the Surface line, and this new information only reaffirms that the device is indeed being developed by the company.\nRumored change in mobile strategy as Panos Panay takes charge A report from Windows Central suggests that the Surface phone rumored earlier in the year has been canceled, in favor of a new Surface phone being built by the Surface team, led by Panos Panay. The old Surface Phone was apparently part of Nokia’s plans, which may have been scrapped when Panay took charge of the Devices division at Microsoft earlier this year.\nRelated: Everything you need to know about the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950XL\nThe phone was previously referred to as the ‘Panos Phone’ according to Windows Central’s sources, though it has recently changed to becoming the Surface Phone, hinting it may have shifted from a pet project to something more official. Panos Panay is in charge of the team that designed the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book , meaning we may see a smartphone with a similar design.\nMicrosoft Surface Book More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nRumors have spread about a Surface phone for years. In a WIRED profile on Microsoft’s Head of Devices Panos Panay last year, it’s mentioned that work was going ahead on, “a prototype of a new phone” at Microsoft’s HQ, indicating the firm is testing its own phones built internally. For now though, none of this is official, and everything could change again between now and the possible early 2017 release.\nOnly concepts give us a clue about design Unfortunately, we have no idea what any Surface Mobile phone will look like, but concept renders were created by Nadir Aslam earlier this year. While the final Surface Mobile phone might not look like these renders, they give us a good idea of its possible productivity attributes.\nThe Surface Phone remains far from official, but we’ll keep you updated here with news and rumors about the device.\nArticle originally published in November 2015. Andy Boxall, Julian Chokkattu, and Christian de Looper contributed to this report. Updated on 04-27-2016 by Andy Boxall: Added further rumors pointing to a 2017 release, and comments on how a future Windows 10 update will affect mobile for Microsoft. Updated on 11-28-2016 by Mark Coppock: Added recent information from Microsoft CEO Nadella about “ultimate mobile device,” possible Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, and x86-support in Windows 10 Mobile Continuum.\nSurface Phone could be the ultimate mobile device, but not till late 2017 Leaked images reveal the Microsoft Lumia 750, the phone that never was, and never will be Microsoft to reportedly end sales of Lumia by end of year",

      "text": "News \nRemember back in the early days of Android when it had copy and paste, and the iPhone didn't? Those were strange times. Copy and paste is just something you expect to be able to do now, but there are plenty of places in Android where the text isn't accessible. Microsoft's Clip Layer app aims to change that by binding a universal copy option to the home button. \nWhen you trigger Clip Layer, it reads all the text on your screen, making it accessible for copying. Simply tap the fields you want to copy—you can do as many as you like. Tap the text button in the upper right corner to see what you've selected, then copy it to the clipboard, email it, drop it into Wunderlist, or share the snippet to another app of your choice. It's not unlike Universal Copy , but Clip Layer seems to work much better. \nThere's one big caveat here: the Clip Layer app takes over as your assist trigger. That means long-pressing the home button launches Clip Layer and not the Google app. On most phones that just means you lose Now On Tap (AKA screen search). Yeah... that's no big loss. On the Pixel, you can no longer access Assistant. If that's a trade-off you want to make, Clip Layer is good at what it does.",

      "text": "Home Business   Discounts At Amazon Following Cyber Monday   Discounts At Amazon Following Cyber Monday Jennifer Hong Nov 29, 2016 Business Comments Off on   Discounts At Amazon Following Cyber Monday 1 \nShoppers are getting ready for Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy”button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology HP Elite X3 Supra:   That Spins Lumia Series Hardware HP Elite X3 Supra:   That Spins Lumia Series Hardware 3 \nIn our HP Elite X3 review, we take a look at a third-party surface phone while Microsoft stays committed to Windows 10 Mobile. But the company hasn’t released any new device in the last 6 months or so, making everyone believe that it’s ready to give up at least on the hardware side of its mobile push. \nWith rumors that Microsoft is also aiming to abandon the Lumia lineup, every new phone coming from a different company is catching everyone’s attention, and this is exactly what happened with the HP Elite X3. \nAnnounced with much fanfare earlier this year, the HP Elite X3 comes with specs that Windows Phone fans have until now only dreamed about, despite the Lumia 950 series, which also brought specs that were compelling to say the least. \nBut the HP Elite X3 arrives at a time when only few people still believe in Windows phones, so there’s no doubt that hardcore fans really need to give it a shot. \nThat’s exactly what we did, as we took the HP Elite X3 for a spin and used it for several weeks, including with Continuum, to see what this is all about. This time, we’re going to split the review into two parts, namely hardware and software, so read on to find more about this super-powerful Windows phone. \nHardware \nIn terms of hardware, there’s no way you’re not going to be pleased with the HP Elite X3, although there still are things that would need more improvements. But let’s take them one at a time and see what this is all about. \n#Display \nThe HP Elite X3 comes with a 5.96-inch display that you’ll absolutely love. It has a resolution of 1440×2560 pixels, with a pixel density of 494 ppi, and although it looks huge at first, it has major advantages. \nWith a screen-to-body ratio of 72.2 percent, the phone has plenty of screen space to work with, so it’s absolutely a pleasure to browse the web or watch movies. \n“BRILLIANT DISPLAY!” \nIt’s so awesome! Colors are vivid, and the contrast is excellent, much better than on the other Windows phones on the market. The phone also comes with features such as double tap to wake, which is kind of handy given its size, but it lacks Glance screen, and this is one very important setback. \nIt does have a LED notification light to compensate for the lack of Glance, but Windows 10 Mobile does not have advanced support for this feature, so you can’t configure it to blink when you have missed third-party notifications just yet. \nThe response time of the display is impressive to say the least and readability in direct sunlight is a bit above the average. \n#CPU, RAM, and storage \nThis phone comes with the most powerful Snapdragon processor at the moment, namely the 820, which is quad-core in the following configuration: 2 cores running at 2.15 GHz and 2 running at 1.6 GHz. Depending on the power you need, the more powerful cores kick in, giving the phone impressive performance figures. \nThe Elite X3 features 4 GB of RAM, which is pretty much the biggest amount of memory that you can find right now in the Windows phone world, and 64 GB of storage, obviously with microSD card support. \nThe aforementioned configuration makes the HP Elite X3 blazing fast 90 percent of the time, and the remaining 10 percent is lost only because of Windows 10 Mobile. \nThe phone barely gets hot when performing more demanding tasks, such as when watching videos, but even when it does, the cooling system is super-efficient. \nThe amount of storage that the device offers is not overwhelming, but it’s a good thing that it comes with microSD card support. This is something that Apple should borrow as well, although we all know that’s not going to happen.",

      "text": "Microsoft deems Windows 10 Anniversary Update enterprise-ready The version you're likely running right now, 14393.447, officially rolls out to the corporate crowd   Use   There was an error emailing this page. More like this The Windows 8.1 user's guide to navigating Windows 10 \nMichael Niehaus at Microsoft announced this morning that Win10 version 1607 is now a Current Branch for Business release. Specifically, the update released on Nov. 8 -- Build 14393.447 -- now takes its place on the list of builds that are stable enough for general deployment in enterprises. \nOddly, it hasn't yet been added to the official list of branches and builds, but it will likely appear soon. [ The essentials for Windows 10 installation: Download the Windows 10 Installation Superguide today. | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows Report newsletter . ] \nAs I explained last month : \nIt took months for Windows 10 Fall Update to stabilize; it's taken three months for Win10 Anniversary Update to stabilize. Your perception of \"stabilize\" might vary from mine by a few weeks, but there's still a significant lag between the initial release of a new official update and the point at which it has acceptably few bugs. During those intervening two or three months, Microsoft is using the public to beta test its product. \nThe announcement today makes it official: The Anniversary Update is ready for prime time, almost four months after its Aug. 2 release and three weeks after the 14393.447 build appeared. \nFor most of you, this official anointment doesn't mean much: If you're running Win10, you aren't controlled by a corporate update server, and you followed my advice last month to let loose the 1607 upgrade, you're already running the CBB build. If you checked the box in Win10 Pro version 1511 that says \"Defer feature updates\" (Start > Settings > Update & security > Windows Update > Advanced Options) you'll likely receive the upgrade to 1607 in the next few days. \nIt isn't clear to me what the Group Policy setting for deferring updates in version 1511 will do, but I suspect it'll work like the \"Defer feature updates\" box in the Settings app. (In Win10 Pro version 1511, type gpedit , hit Enter, navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update and Enable Defer Update.) In version 1607, the Group Policy has changed completely. \nFor admins, the crowning of 14393.447 as a CBB build is largely ceremonial. It tells you that Microsoft now gives version 1607 a corporate-worthy clean bill of health. The upgrade mechanism hasn't changed, although Microsoft will be rolling out the ISOs through the normal distribution routes in January. Per Niehaus: \nWe do expect to publish updated media to the Volume Licensing Service Center and to Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) in January for those customers that need it, but this is primarily just for convenience. \nThe shift is very much in keeping with Microsoft's original rollout plans : new versions of Win10 twice a year or so, with each update given a chance stew for a few months before it's anointed as CBB ready.

      "text": "Further update: Oblivion has now officially been added to Microsoft's Backwards Compatibility scheme. Fetch thine discs, breathe on them heavily, and give them the nurturing wipe of rejuvenation. Also joining the 360 to One party is Medal of Honor: Airborne, Astropop, and Trine 2. Update: If you thought the double whammy of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 being added to the backwards compatibility library in the same week of Black Friday discounts was too good to be true, then... it is. Despite the listings published on Microsoft's Xbox website yesterday, community manager 'Major Nelson' tweeted later that the Modern Warfare 3 listing was actually an 'error' in response to a frustrated fan. @SiNAR212 @XboxQwik @XboxP3 That is an error. It's being corrected. — / Larry Hryb / (@majornelson) November 18, 2016 That's not to say it won't be coming to the Xbox One in the near future, but it probably won't be in time for Black Friday. Meanwhile, news on Fable: Anniversary on Xbox One is non existent... Original story: Xbox 360 games The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 are probably... no, almost certainly coming to Xbox One Backwards Compatibility. How did this secret information come to light? Well, let's just say that absolutely no Bothan spies died bringing you this information. It was posted on the Xbox website, where both games are now listed under the backwards compatibility scheme. Ahem. On the official Xbox One Backwards Compatibility site, Modern Warfare 3 is currently the fourth-most popular choice of games to be added to the scheme with 111,576 votes. Oblivion isn't quite as popular, sitting at 14th with 52,711 votes, but the choice to bring the 2006 RPG to Xbox One is a tactical one. Skyrim currently sits at number two in the list, with 169,958 votes to bring it to Xbox One. There's just one problem: it ain't gonna happen. Doing so would hurt the sales of Bethesda's recent remaster of the more recent Elder Scrolls game in the form of Skyrim: Special Edition. The game was enormously popular, scooping up an estimated 22.7m+ sales, a large proportion of which were on Xbox 360, and as long as people are willing to pay, we can't see Microsoft, or Bethesda, prioritising accessibility of older versions. We'll bring you more when the news is officially announced. via Videogamer Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "November 29, 2016 Free online course: Analyzing big data with Microsoft R Server \nIf you're already familiar with R, but struggling with out-of-memory or performance problems when attempting to analyze large data sets, you might want to check out this new EdX course, Analyzing Big Data with Microsoft R Server , presented by my colleague Seth Mottaghinejad . In the course, you'll learn how to build models using the RevoScaleR package, and deploy those models to production environments like Spark and SQL Server. The course is self-paced with videos, tutorials and tests, and is free to audit. \n(By the way, if you don't already know R, you might want to check out the courses Introduction to R for Data Science and Programming in R for Data Science first.) \nThe RevoScaleR package isn't available on CRAN: it's included with Microsoft R Server and Microsoft R Client. You can download and use Microsoft R Client for free, which provides an installation of R with the RevoScaleR library built in and loaded when you start the session. An R IDE is also recommended: you can use R Tools for Visual Studio or RStudio . \nThe course is open now, and you can get started at EdX at the link below.",

Microsoft today said that it has enhanced certain versions of its PowerPoint presentation-building program with real-time collaborative editing. VentureBeat adds: This feature came to Word on desktop last year. And before that it was available through Office Online. Microsoft said last year that real-time coauthoring would come to all of its desktop apps, and now Microsoft is executing on that commitment. Just like in Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, this feature lets you \"see what others are typing as it happens on a given slide,\" Microsoft Office corporate vice president Kirk Koenigsbauer wrote in a blog post. The feature is live now in PowerPoint on Windows for people who subscribe to Office 365 and belong to the Office Insider program. In addition, it's now available to everyone in PowerPoint Mobile on Windows tablets, Koenigsbauer wrote.",

      "title": "7 Important Windows 10 Security Features You Really Need to Know About",
      "text": "Microsoft’s latest operating system has been receiving good reviews from its predecessors, especially giving an edge to Microsoft Windows 8x series. Windows 10 has a smooth and great feel to its system with the added support from Cortana, which is much like Microsoft’s Siri. Nevertheless, with all the additions that make your experience with Windows easy, they also have their drawbacks. The new operating system, by default, has to collect information on its users, something not very cool amongst its many users. However, there are ways to change these default settings and make Windows not as savvy and as cool as its initial default settings allow – meaning letting go of Cortana. So, if this step suits you, follow the settings and information written down below to help reduce Windows 10’s involvement in your personal life.\nControl Your Setup When you install the Windows 10 system on your machine, you will notice a few options in the initial setup to help you prevent Windows from getting too much information from you. The system lets you pick up the option for Express Settings, which allows Windows to set everything to its default settings. Instead of selecting the Express Settings , select Custom Settings. From here, you will be presented with options to choose settings and options that you want closed, such as blocking access to location information and your browser data.\nFurthermore, if you are not comfortable keeping your data in the cloud, then create a local account (or an offline account), that keeps your information offline without the need to connect to the Microsoft servers. You can do this by creating a new account, rather than going on and signing into your Microsoft account.\nThe downfall of creating an offline account is that you will have to continue on without reaping the benefits of One Drive and accessing your Xbox accounts, and will later have problems accessing them.\nThere is Nothing to Worry About If you have installed Windows 10 with Express Settings, and you’re now worried about privacy, you can still change the settings via the Control Panel options.\nLet us begin with the privacy options. Firstly, switch off the Advertising ID feature, which allows the applications and websites to customize the advertisement on your usage behaviour – meaning sharing the data of what you have been looking at with others.\nMicrosoft’s typing and writing skills checks your typing, so it can improve itself with the autocorrect option it has. There is no reason to deactivate this feature, unless you have a problem with Microsoft storing your data with their key loggers.\nThe Location Settings The location settings are up there with the more important privacy information. The reality is, only you should know where you’ve been, not your laptop.\nWith Windows 10, you can completely turn off the settings and its features used to track you. You can also clear your previous whereabouts data. However, if you switch this feature off, every time you want your weather updates or the maps, you’ll have to manually enter your zip code of where you are.\nThe Eyes & The Ears The camera and microphone settings have the same settings as the location data options. You have the option to completely deactivate both functions or tunnel them to another application that suits your needs.\nLooking at all Your Stuff Too much of anything is a bad thing, and the feature with Windows 10 that wants to know you better, is also bad. Cortana, your best friend on Windows, who can help you with almost anything, from reminding you about your appointments to checking out reviews, is your little helper. However, Microsoft is keeping track of your voice data. You can simply turn this feature off without hassle. All you need to do is go to Speech > Inking & Typing settings > Stop Getting to Know Me. Once there, you have the option to deactivate Cortana and its features.\nHowever, if you decide to keep Cortana active, then there are a few tweaks you can do to better suit your privacy needs, such as what do you want Cortana to see? The tweaks include data containing your personal information: pictures, your name, contacts, calendar settings and your messages. This information stays with Cortana and is stored on the Microsoft servers.\nTo fully remove your history from Cortana – and the operating system itself – you need to visit the Bing account settings via the web. Once there, simply delete your personal information and the information Cortana has on you, and you’re good to go.\nLimiting Those Apps in the Back Even though this isn’t directly related to security, it can save your personal information. Limiting the number of applications running in the background can spare you a lot of processing power and save any applications that exchange your information across servers. Thus, checking this feature matters, as many of the applications running in the background will be transferring your data across the internet, checking for updates and sending notifications across other synced devices, and they have a lot of activity – even when they’re in the silent mode. Limiting their access can be reached via your Privacy settings from the Control Panel.\nThe Wi-Fi Connection Better known as the Wi-Fi Sense, Windows 10 offers the most amazing feature that suggests wireless hotspots, allowing you to share them with your contacts. A part of joining those wireless networks automatically means your Skype contacts, friends on Facebook, and your Outlook information is up for grabs. Every contact on your list can access the printer, as well as other computers linked to your network.\nYou can change these settings by accessing the Advance Setting option in the Wi-Fi settings menu.\nWith all the tips and tricks in your hand, you can now control the information that Windows intends on sharing. However, it is important to tell you that by following these steps your Windows 10 experience will alter, taking away some of the functions you’ve probably come to rely on.\nSource: Wired , Download , BGR",

      "text": "Teardown Shows Microsoft Made Hardware Upgrades Impossible on Its All-in-One PC GO iFixIt teardown of the Surface Studio now live Nov 29, 2016 18:37 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: The Surface Studio all-in-one PC is now being shipped to the first lucky buyers, and this offered iFixIt the opportunity of performing its typical state-of-the-art teardown and let us know what’s inside Microsoft’s first such device in history. One of the surprising things under the case of the Surface Studio is the processor itself, as the Redmond-based software giant opted for an ARM chip on an Intel-powered configuration. While few people expected to see Microsoft going for this processor, it’s also confirmation that the firm still believes in ARM and continues to invest in it - rumor has it that several projects involving ARM chips are being developed at Microsoft, including an emulator that would make it possible for future Windows phones to run x86 apps. iFixIt also reveals that the Surface Studio’s base is easy to open and it hosts several modular components, including the SATA hard drive and the SSD, so you can replace any of them quite easily. This is one of the reasons the device received a repairability score of 5 points out of the maximum 10, the engineers explained. No hardware upgrades But it’s not all just milk and honey on the Surface Studio and there is something that’s likely to make some people think twice before ordering a certain configuration. It turns out that the device cannot be upgraded in terms of RAM, CPU, and GPU, as all of them are soldered to the board. This means that the configuration you choose is pretty much it, and if you decide to add more RAM or change the CPU at a later time, you won’t be able to do it. Furthermore, iFixIt says that there are parts that are embedded in the display, such as the speakers, which are very difficult to replace in case they break down. All in all, the Surface Studio got the same score as the new MacBook, but this doesn’t mean anything. You’re not supposed to break the device open on your own anyway, but those limited hardware upgrades should make you think twice when choosing your configuration. This is what you'll find in the Studio when opening it CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (2 Images)",

      "text": "  Microsoft’s new app tries to fix Android’s copy and paste problem by Napier Lopez — in Apps \n60 shares For an OS typically preferred by power-users, Android has an embarrassing amount of trouble with copy and paste. Sometimes it works just fine, but in other apps you can only copy entire huge swaths of text, or worse – nothing at all.\nMicrosoft’s new Clip Layer app wants to fix that by letting you copy pretty much any text on your screen. Hold down the home button, and it’ll analyze your display’s contents and let you copy text from areas normally inaccessible.\n\nI tried it out from a few minutes and it could copy most text other than images, though it glitched out while trying to copy text from websites a couple of times. It also defaults to copying entire paragraphs at a time, but you can then select which portion of the text you want to copy from a ‘T’ button on the upper right corner.\nThe main caveat is that you have to replace Google Now on Tap as your long-press Home button shortcut, but when was the last time you you used that anyway?? If you’re on a Pixel, losing the Assistant may be a bigger deal, but your mileage may vary.",

      "title": "Azure Stack in 6 Months, Says HPE Exec",
      "text": "The timeframe is finally tightening for the release of Microsoft’s long awaited data center operating platform, Azure Stack, based on the same platform that runs the company’s public cloud service — at least from the perspective of Microsoft’s partners. In remarks made during the Tuesday general session at the HPE Discover London 2016 conference, HPE Executive Vice President Antonio Neri [ pictured left ] told attendees that, if their organizations were to sign on to Microsoft’s ongoing preview program today, they would be ready when the limited release of the platform goes live on HPE servers in six months’ time.\n“The good news is, this is going to be available in the next six months,” said Neri. “But the reality is that they [organizations] don’t need to wait six months. They can start planning that journey today. So we’re already working with customers, already planning for that journey.”\nAzure Stack is intended to give organizations a platform for deploying new classes of so-called “cloud-native” applications on-premises, with the same tools and automation used to deploy them in the Azure public cloud. Azure Stack thus becomes a hybrid platform that gives Microsoft a chance to get back on par with OpenStack, the open source hybrid platform based on Linux.\nMicrosoft would have a few advantages at that time, some of them being obvious. Visual Studio — which for many organizations remains the leading, if not the only, software development suite — would have a direct line to an automated deployment pipeline that works for both cloud domains. And because its deployment and management tools have already been honed on the Azure public cloud, not only would they be familiar to many users, but likelier to be embraced by DevOps professionals who have yet to become enthused by OpenStack’s cobbled-together, frequently-changing, methods.\nOne not-so-obvious advantage is this: Microsoft’s increasingly friendlier relations with Docker Inc. are helping to ensure that no innovation in the field of containerization will be unveiled on a Linux platform first, before a Windows Server-based platform gets a crack at it.\nBut Azure Stack’s readiness for prime time has been under heavy scrutiny, as a result of Microsoft continually delaying its general release. When the platform was first announced in May 2015 , it was touted as being just around the corner. Suspicions of problems were confirmed in July, when the company officially stated it would delay general release until mid-2017, while in the meantime limiting initial releases of the platform to select servers, in joint marketing arrangements with HPE, Dell, and Lenovo.\n\nDuring a session at Microsoft’s Ignite conference in Atlanta in September, private cloud solution architect Spencer Shepler shared what passed for a timeline for the development tracks of Azure Stack’s single-node proof-of-concept and its multi-node integrated systems. What was missing from the timeline were times , except for a vague reference in the rightmost column referring to general availability in the middle of calendar year 2017.\nAn unmarked milestone pointed to the release of Technical Preview 3, sometime between now and then.\nMicrosoft veterans will recall that, historically, the company’s definition of the middle of a year has sometimes stretched forward into January .\nIn the meantime, the company is making good on its July pledge to let the world’s top 3 server makers unveil the platform first. At HPE Discover London, Microsoft Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie introduced a video showing what he described as Azure Stack’s management portal integrated with HPE’s OneView management suite, but which looked quite a bit more like Azure Stack than OneView.\nOne interesting technique the video showed was the ability to live-migrate a virtual machine from on-premises hardware to public Azure space, prior to shutting down that hardware for maintenance.\n“Azure Stack enables organizations to basically run an even richer set of Azure services within their own data centers,” said Guthrie [ pictured right in top image ]. “It provides a consistent development model, as well as management model and overall ecosystem, across both the public and the private cloud environments, so that you can build applications that leverage the richness of Azure, both from an infrastructure as well as a platform-as-a-service capability, and deploy them wherever it makes the most sense for your business.”\nWhich sounds nice, assuming it all gets delivered. HPE’s Neri told attendees that their organizations can take advantage of HPE’s early access to “the bits” of Azure Stack, by visiting their local HPE + Microsoft Innovation Center. Guthrie then followed up to tell the London-based audience that the Innovation Center nearest to them — at least, while Azure Stack remains in technical preview — is in Seattle.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone Using Snapdragon SoC, Windows 10 News Microsoft Surface Phone Using Snapdragon SoC, Windows 10 News 1 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

Sometimes it works just fine, but in other apps you can only copy entire huge swaths of text, or worse – nothing at all. Microsoft’s new Clip Layer app wants to fix that by letting you copy pretty much any text on your screen. Hold down the home button, and it’ll analyze your display’s contents and let you copy text from areas normally inaccessible. I tried it out from a few minutes and it could copy most text other than images, though it…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web\n\nOr just read more coverage about: Microsoft",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s last Lumia flagships are entering the last phase of their life cycle in UK, as the handsets go out of stock for the final time here.\nThe Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL have been in short supply in Europe for a while now, and in UK the Lumia 950 has been out of stock since October .\nNow after the Black Friday promotion which saw the Lumia 950 XL priced at only £289 that handset has also become “ Email me when available ” which is usually the prelude to the handset being marked as completely out of stock.\nThe Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL first became available around a year ago in November 2015 to an ambivalent reception from fans due to its high price and uninspiring design, and due to Microsoft’s already ongoing retrenchment of their mobile phone business which started in May 2015 was completely ignored by non-fans. Due to poor sales Microsoft held the first of many fire sales of the devices in April 2016 with the handsets apparently limping on to its anniversary in November this year before finally running out of steam in most of Europe, and likely in the rest of the world soon too.\nWindows Phone fans in most of the world are now faced with only the HP Elite X3 as a high-end and very expensive option, though USA does offer the Alcatel Idol 4S as an alternative on T-Mobile USA, with rumours of a Surface Phone coming some time in 2017 or 2018.\nDo our readers mourn the passing of these devices? Let us know below.\n",

      "text": "Dynamic Communities Announces GPUG Amplify Event Microsoft Dynamics GP User & Partner event to be held March 20-22 in Anaheim, CA November 29, 2016 02:57 PM EST Blog This \nTAMPA, Fla. , Nov. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Dynamic Communities, the supporting organization behind the official user group for Microsoft Dynamics® GP ( GPUG ) announces GPUG Amplify 2017 to be held March 20-22 at the Marriot in Anaheim, CA. \nGPUG Amplify is designed to improve attendee skills around reporting, leadership, and industry best practices. Attendees representing Dynamics end user organizations, partners, and ISVs benefit from access to Microsoft leaders, Microsoft MVPs, and other subject matter experts while exploring a wide range of solutions to optimize their Dynamics investment and experience a solid return on investment. Amplify was created for the thriving Microsoft Dynamics GP community and will include end-user educational training on the latest release for GP customers. New in 2017 are dedicated sales and marketing educational sessions for Dynamics Partners offered on Monday, March 20 . \n\"GPUG Amplify is very informative and the educational offerings are really well thought out. I was surprised that I didn't only walk away with new information, I also took away with me an experience that motivates me to execute and implement what I learned when I return to the office,\" said 2016 Amplify attendee, Eileen Morales , Controller for the Cardiovascular Research Foundation. \" I look forward to coming back in 2017. \" \nAttendees can save money by registering prior to the Early Bird registration deadline of January 25 th .

Join the thousands of fellow Dynamics users who participate in this rich online community for learning and networking: www.gpug.com/join . \nDynamic Communities is the business management organization that supports technology-centric user groups, like GPUG, and associations – providing necessary resources and business operations such as staff, systems and event production. Dynamic Communities is independent from Microsoft; however, the two organizations maintain an intentional close working relationship so that our members can provide a collective voice to Microsoft on user concerns, needs, and requests. \nJenna Knoblauch",

      "title": "Engineer Finds Microsoft Azure Cloud Flaw Posed RHEL Hacking Risk",
      "text": "A security engineer uncovers a vulnerability that would have given cyber-attackers root access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines. In terms of delivering public cloud services, an Azure customer recently taught Microsoft a lesson in running a tight ship. Ian Duffy, a software engineer at online retailer Zalando, had set out to create a secure, custom Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) machine image to be deployed on both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. During the process, he discovered a vulnerability that could have provided an attacker root access to virtual machines. Duffy managed to obtain \"administrator level access to all of the Microsoft Azure managed Red Hat Update Infrastructure that supplies all the packages for all Red Hat Enterprise Linux instances booted from the Azure marketplace,\" he wrote in a blog post detailing the flaw. In theory, an attacker could have tracked down the Red Hat Update Appliance that is responsible for managing and distributing RHEL updates for each Azure region and gain administrative access to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Appliance REST API. From there, it would have been possible to upload an altered package granting an attacker access to client virtual machines than ran the update.And attackers are always on the lookout for cloud vulnerabilities.Recently, security firm Rapid7 deployed honeypots on the major clouds, including AWS, Azure, Google, Rackspace and Soft layer. Dubbed the Project Heisenberg Cloud , the effort uncovered considerable scanning of port 443 (HTTPS) on Google's cloud and scanning for signs of the Mirai Internet of Things (IoT) botnet across all cloud providers. The Azure RHEL flaw is an example of the security gap that exists between private data centers and public clouds, said Roy Feintuch, CTO and co-founder of cloud security specialist Dome9 . He warns that organizations should be mindful of adapting on-premises IT systems for public cloud consumption. Feintuch told eWEEK that the \"vulnerability around how Microsoft Azure handles RHEL updates shows how things can go very wrong when private appliances meant for internal use become accessible to the public,\" via email. \"Well planned and executed access control is key to preventing such vulnerabilities and containing their impact.\" In short, don't take security for granted, advised Feintuch. \"Security needs to be designed under the assumption that software is susceptible to bugs and misconfigurations, and that private services exposed to the public will get hacked eventually,\" he continued. \"With the proper tools that allow organizations to visualize, evaluate and enforce the exposure level of each service they deploy, such risks can be mitigated.\" The RHEL flaw was quickly remedied after Duffy reported the issue to Microsoft Online Services Bug Bounty program. \"Microsoft agreed it was a vulnerability in their systems. Immediate action was taken to prevent public access to rhui-monitor.cloudapp.net ,\" the application that supplied file archives, including logs, configuration files and SSL certificates, of the affected servers. \"Additionally, they eventually prevented public access to the Red Hat Update Appliances and they claim to have rotated all secrets,\" he added.",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nIt seemed inevitable that Microsoft would create a Surface Phone — not an official name — after it acquired Nokia. In fact, there was talk long before that too , but Microsoft has often denied those rumors and stuck with producing new Lumia phones. However, rumors and leaks regarding such a device have continued, suggesting it’s something the company may still be considering. Here’s everything we think we know about Microsoft’s Surface Phone project.\nMicrosoft may wait until late 2017 to release Surface Phone After the Surface Phone failed to make an appearance at Microsoft’s 2016 BUILD conference , two reports from Windows Central quoting sources close to the matter, said Microsoft could wait until early 2017 to release the new device. The site’s late April report states April 2017 is the current target for the new smartphone. The first report said that instead of one Surface Phone, Microsoft could release three models. Early plans for the Surface Phone release allegedly suggest that there will be a consumer model, a business model, and an “enthusiast” model, or a high-spec version for tech geeks. Details about possible specs for the devices or what the difference will be between the three models have yet to be released.\nThe rumored timing of the Surface Phone has recently been pushed out to late 2017 . This follows statements by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in November 2016 that provides a tiny bit of clarification to Microsoft’s official position on smartphones. Specifically, Nadella indicated that Microsoft does not want to simply compete with the industry leaders with a “me-too” device but rather wants to focus its efforts and develop the “ultimate” mobile devices. If one reads between the lines, it would seem that the Surface Phone will be a high-end smartphone that’s possibly aimed at providing very specific value to the business market, serving as a halo device for Microsoft’s long-term mobile strategy, or some combination of both.\nRedstone 2 and 3 to improve Windows 10 Mobile The Windows 10 ‘Redstone’ update, also known as the Windows 10 Anniversary update, came and went without any more information on the Surface Phone. The Anniversary Update provided a number of new features to smartphones, but nothing earth-shattering, and it will be the next two versions of the operating system that will focus on “innovation around mobile phones,” according to multiple sources speaking to Windows Central .\nRedstone 2 and Redstone 3 aren’t expected until early and late 2017, respectively, the latter of which fits in with the prospective Surface Phone launch date now being rumored. When Redstone 3 does arrive , the resulting Surface Phone will apparently be promoted as the most secure phone in the world and the best for productivity. Part of this may include native support for Win32 apps provided by an enhanced version of the Continuum PC-like environment created when a Windows 10 Mobile device is connected to an external display, keyboard, and mouse.\nThe Lumia 950 and 950 XL offers some compatibility with x86 apps through Continuum, but no way to use them natively. Making them run on the phone without the help of a more powerful and expensive machine, might be a killer feature for power users. However, it’s warned the feature may be dropped before launch, if the experience isn’t polished enough.\nMicrosoft’s intention, say the sources, is to make the future Surface phone a true alternative to a PC, using both this feature and Continuum.\nBenchmarks and high-end specs rumored, then quashed A phone running Windows 10 and the Edge browser was spotted on the HTML5test benchmarking website in late November 2015. According to PocketNow , the version of Windows 10 was old, and one which was never released outside of the company, while the Edge browser was also older than the existing versions. The rumor suggested the phone was in testing for some time, and was likely an abandoned Nokia-derived device.\nRelated: Microsoft Band 2 review\nMore recently, Intel rumors have been challenged by Intel’s scaling back its mobile SoC market . Now, it appears that Microsoft will be working to emulate the x86 environment in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile to provide support for full Windows desktop applications. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 SoC has been rumored to power the Surface Phone along with 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile. Two versions are alleged, including a 6GB RAM version with the version of Continuum supporting x86 applications and a 4GB RAM version without it.\nRead More Microsoft purchased surfacephone.com If you’re looking for a hint that Microsoft will introduce a Surface Phone sometime in the future, then look no further than one Reddit user’s discovery in late January 2016. It appears that Microsoft owns surfacephone.com , and the company even went as far as redirecting it to the main Surface website.\nRelated: Can a Surface Phone save Windows 10 Mobile?\nBefore you go jumping for joy, this is far from a confirmation that Microsoft is readying a Surface Phone. Often, companies like to stay out of legal trouble by registering domain names that correlate with a current product.\nmicrosoft-windows-mobile-surface-phone-1 More We also need to point out that surfacephone.com was actually registered in May 2007, so it’s not like Microsoft recently purchased it to get ready for a new Surface Phone launch.\nFurthermore, Microsoft’s Surface page is within microsoft.com as in https://www.microsoft.com/surface/ . Microsoft isn’t even using surface.com for its current crop of Surface devices, and so why would the company use surfacephone.com for a Surface Phone if it gets released? And by the way, Microsoft registered surface.com back in 1994 and is redirecting it to you know where … its main Surface Web page.\nWhile this news doesn’t confirm a Surface Phone will exist some day, along with all of the other information being leaked it does give hope that the Redmond company is at least thinking about it.\nMicrosoft executive hints about a better phone Those looking for more slivers of information about the rumored Surface Mobile device may want to take note of what Microsoft’s Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela said on This Week in Tech’s Windows Weekly podcast in December 2015.\n“We need more breakthrough work … with Surface we had a bunch of early misfires, but that notion of a tablet that could replace your laptop — that notion of saying, ‘Hey, Apple wants to sell you an iPad and they want to sell you a Mac, we think there’s one device that exploits the seam between those two devices’ — we need some sort of spiritual equivalent on the phone side that doesn’t just feel like a phone for people who love Windows,” Capossela said on the podcast.\nRelated: Why you absolutely, by no means should even consider buying a Windows Phone\n“It has got to be a phone that’s sort of like ‘wow, that’s a real shocker,’ or ‘that’s a real breakthrough,’ and has got to make me pause before I buy my 17th iPhone, and we need time to actually go built that.”\nThe question arises around the 36-minute mark, after tech writer Mary Jo Foley expresses her dismay at the current Windows Phone environment. Capossela made no mention of whether this “breakthrough” phone will be a part of the Surface line, and this new information only reaffirms that the device is indeed being developed by the company.\nRumored change in mobile strategy as Panos Panay takes charge A report from Windows Central suggests that the Surface phone rumored earlier in the year has been canceled, in favor of a new Surface phone being built by the Surface team, led by Panos Panay. The old Surface Phone was apparently part of Nokia’s plans, which may have been scrapped when Panay took charge of the Devices division at Microsoft earlier this year.\nRelated: Everything you need to know about the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950XL\nThe phone was previously referred to as the ‘Panos Phone’ according to Windows Central’s sources, though it has recently changed to becoming the Surface Phone, hinting it may have shifted from a pet project to something more official. Panos Panay is in charge of the team that designed the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book , meaning we may see a smartphone with a similar design.\nMicrosoft Surface Book More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nRumors have spread about a Surface phone for years. In a WIRED profile on Microsoft’s Head of Devices Panos Panay last year, it’s mentioned that work was going ahead on, “a prototype of a new phone” at Microsoft’s HQ, indicating the firm is testing its own phones built internally. For now though, none of this is official, and everything could change again between now and the possible early 2017 release.\nOnly concepts give us a clue about design Unfortunately, we have no idea what any Surface Mobile phone will look like, but concept renders were created by Nadir Aslam earlier this year. While the final Surface Mobile phone might not look like these renders, they give us a good idea of its possible productivity attributes.\nThe Surface Phone remains far from official, but we’ll keep you updated here with news and rumors about the device.\nArticle originally published in November 2015. Andy Boxall, Julian Chokkattu, and Christian de Looper contributed to this report. Updated on 04-27-2016 by Andy Boxall: Added further rumors pointing to a 2017 release, and comments on how a future Windows 10 update will affect mobile for Microsoft. Updated on 11-28-2016 by Mark Coppock: Added recent information from Microsoft CEO Nadella about “ultimate mobile device,” possible Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, and x86-support in Windows 10 Mobile Continuum.\nSurface Phone could be the ultimate mobile device, but not till late 2017 Leaked images reveal the Microsoft Lumia 750, the phone that never was, and never will be Microsoft to reportedly end sales of Lumia by end of year",

      "text": "Despite Its Performance, Still No Reason To Buy Microsoft Nov.29.16 \nIn 2016, despite an overall market-beating record, I've missed the mark on a few individual calls. \nToday, I will talk about Microsoft - up 24% since my bearish article in June. \nAs the still-small Azure business picks up steam, the Street bets big on MSFT - but I continue to find shares overpriced. Yesterday, I wrote an article on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), the first report of a short series in which I look at my best- and worst-performing calls of the past 18 months and ask myself: are those stocks worth a shot now? As a quick recap, I have been up 11.0% since I started DM Martins Research in August 2015 through this year's Thanksgiving weekend, according to Tip Ranks , compared to the S&P 500's (NYSEARCA: SPY ) 5.3% - beating the benchmark by more than 100%. But not all my calls have played out favorably. The table below summarizes DM Martins' five best and five worst calls over the period. Click to enlarge (Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Seeking Alpha and Yahoo Finance) For my second article in the series, I turn my attention to Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) - a stock whose double-digit beat over the broad market benchmark I did not see coming. Click to enlarge (Image Credit: flickr.com) My initial views on Microsoft In June of this year, shortly after the LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) acquisition announcement, I wrote an article arguing that Microsoft had been \"betting big bucks on low earnings-producing assets (specifically referring to LinkedIn and the 650x forward multiple that Microsoft agreed to pay for that company), and its stock [looked] very expensive given the uncertainties and the company's low-growth profile.\" To be fair, I did not see major drawbacks with Microsoft as a business, and even stated, in September , that by combining \"inorganic growth with CEO Nadella's reported 'momentum' in cloud [...], the elephant [might] still be able to dance.\" I also liked Microsoft's low but double-digit growing dividend, and that future payment hikes seemed relatively safe given the company's low FCF payout of only 44%. But the bull argument quickly gave way to the bear case once I looked at valuations: \n\"I [believed] much of the upside [had] already been priced into the stock. MSFT's valuation [seemed] much more in line with that of Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) which has, in my view, many more opportunities to ignite sustainable growth in the fields of AI, VR and the other areas in which the company's 'moonshots' operate, than with mature, cash-cow names like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ). For a FY17 forward P/E multiple of 20.1x to be justifiable, given Microsoft's profile, I [believed] the Street [was] already betting on a good dose of top-line uplift, most likely from intelligent cloud and acquisitions like LinkedIn, as well as improvement in cloud margins, which dipped over 500 bps YOY in FY16 (GAAP basis).\" Ironically enough, after my June article, MSFT shares skyrocketed by +21% to close Cyber Monday trading at $60.61. Before I take another pass at my investment thesis, let me summarize the stock's performance during 2016 and then determine whether an investment in MSFT makes more sense to me today than it did earlier in the year. A quick look at the YTD performance of the stock MSFT spent most of the first half of the year trading sideways and ended June down -8% YTD, even as the broad market returned about +2.5% in 1H16. Click to enlarge (Source: Yahoo Finance) The quarter-long nose dive that started in early April was triggered by a worrying calendar 1Q16 earnings miss . Windows underperformed, held down by \"the worst quarterly PC numbers since 2007.\" But CEO Satya Nadella ensured that the company's move into the cloud was taking place at a fast pace. With calendar 2Q16 earnings being guided very conservatively, it wasn't hard for Microsoft to beat consensus EPS by 19% when the company reported on July 19th. That nudge was all the stock needed to shake off the bad taste left by the acquisition of LinkedIn announced in mid-June. As revenues of Microsoft's enterprise cloud platform (Azure) increased 102% YOY and Surface sales remained healthy, MSFT stock reached 52-week highs in August. The company seemed to be firm on its \"transition from traditional software sales models to an increasing focus on cloud platforms and services.\" Calendar 3Q16, reported in October , was more of the same - and the Street liked it. Azure was up +116% YOY, pushing intelligent cloud revenues to high-single digit YOY growth. Where do we stand today? It seems clear to me that MSFT is running on cloud fuel. The company's 2017 EPS consensus estimates have increased +12% since June of this year, in great part justifying the +22% stock run. The improved expectations happened even as the Personal Computing division (the company's largest, representing 47% of total net revenues) shrank -6% YOY in FY16 and another -2% in F1Q17. At the same time, the Intelligent Cloud segment rose 8%, propelled by the still small Azure business (the cloud compute, network, storage, database, and management platform that I estimate to represent less than 2% of Microsoft's total net revenues). The first problem I see, however, is that Microsoft's Azure business is a small fish in a pond infested with sharks. This is not to say the company cannot be competitive in this space - the young platform, made commercially available only in 2010, has been growing at a faster pace than possibly any other in the market and adding over 120,000 new client subscriptions per month. But Azure is in very good company, having to fight for market share with none other than Amazon, Google, IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL ), Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ), VMware (NYSE: VMW ), and other open source offerings. As a result, Azure is likely to suffer a rapidly declining rate of growth in the (not-so-near) future once it ceases to be a newcomer and becomes a more meaningful revenue generator. Pricing pressure is also likely as the cloud space becomes even more crowded. As Amazon's management team has argued recently regarding pricing: \nThe thing I can tell you about [AWS'] pricing is that [...] price reductions are a core part of our philosophy, of course. We had a price decrease in Q3, and that was our 52nd since we started this business. So we are comfortable with price decreases. Not only did we lower the prices of our products but we also create new services that are cheaper that customers can switch to.\" Lastly, one of my key arguments against owning MSFT originally remains intact: aggressive stock valuation. As the table below suggests, shares continue to be the most aggressively priced, on a PEG and net cash-adjusted PEG basis, among the top five technology names - a group that includes high-flyers like AMZN and FB. Click to enlarge (Source: Yahoo Finance, Market Watch and SEC filings) At nearly the same 21x forward multiple, I continue to find names like GOOG a more appealing, higher-GARP (growth at a reasonable price) play.

      "text": "Surface Phone may become a reality Nokia Lumia 950 pictured \nWith Microsoft’s successful Surface line growing, the company is reportedly ready to begin production on the rumored Surface phone next year. \nRumors of the Surface Phone reignited a few weeks ago when Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, spoke about Microsoft’s commitment to building “the ultimate mobile device.” This is followed up by the company’s manufacturing partner, Pegatron, reportedly being ready to begin production as early as next year. Aside from the production rumor, however, little else is known about what we can expect from the device. \nThere is still the elephant in the room, however, that it may be too late for Microsoft in the mobile phone game. With the Windows phone being pushed for years, going back to phones like the Blackjack and even the buy-in of Nokia’s mobile division, Microsoft’s attempts to enter the fray have been less than successful. Not only do Android and iOS hold the market share, next year marks the ten-year anniversary of the iPhone. If the rumors are true, Microsoft has a lot going against their Surface Phone. \nOn the flip side, if it is as functional and useful as a Surface Book or tablet, then Microsoft may have a shot. They just need something to stand out.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nCloud Chronicles is written by Network World Senior Writer Brandon Butler, who tracks the ins and outs of the cloud computing industry. Microsoft patches RHEL instances in Azure cloud A customer discovered the flaw, which could have allowed someone to gain root access to all RHEL VMs in Azure Network World | Nov 29, 2016 5:30 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry \n+ MORE AT NETWORK WORLD : How to compare costs between AWS, Azure and Google clouds + \nMicrosoft Azure uses a process in which all instances of the RHEL operating system check back to a centralized system to ensure it is up to date. The customer, Ian Duffy in Ireland, found that he was able to access that master copy of RHEL, which could have allowed him or anyone else to implant a security vulnerability into the master copy of the program that would have propagated throughout any Azure customer using the OS. \nMicrosoft has patched the vulnerability, which was specific to its implementation of RHEL, so RHEL and Azure customers do not need to do anything to ensure they’re systems are fixed. There are no reports of nefarious activity that resulted from this incident. For complete details on what happened, check out Network World sister-site security reporter Fahmida Rashid at InfoWorld who has a more in-depth break down . \nSecurity vendors jumped on the news, taking the opportunity to remind customers – and providers - of the need to control access to administrative controls when hosting software in the cloud. The incident shows “how things can go very wrong when private appliances meant for internal use become accessible to the public,” says Roy Feintuch, CTO and Co-founder of Dome9, a cloud security company. “Security needs to be designed under the assumption that software is susceptible to bugs and misconfigurations, and that private services exposed to the public will get hacked eventually. With the proper tools that allow organizations to visualize, evaluate and enforce the exposure level of each service they deploy, such risks can be mitigated.” To comment on this article and other Network World content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter stream .

      "title": "Microsoft's Surface Studio AIO is surprisingly easy to repair",
      "text": "on Nov 29, 2016, 6:00 PM TechSpot \nMicrosoft’s Surface Studio wasn’t supposed to arrive until December 15 but the Redmond-based company seemingly got into the holiday spirit a bit early. I say that because some of the first customers that placed pre-orders for the versatile all-in-one are receiving them ahead of schedule. \nAmong those to score a Surface Studio early was the team over at iFixit and we all know what that means… teardown time ! \nAfter a quick tour of the exterior, the teardown crew flipped the AIO over and removed the rubber feet hiding Torx screws. With some help from a suction cup, the clips let loose of the bottom panel and they were inside the machine… well, sort of. \nBefore digging any deeper, iFixit had to lift away the mid-frame which brought with it an attached speaker. With that out of the way, they were able to remove two Delta-branded brushless cooling fans and gain access to the meat and potatoes of the Surface Studio. \nIt’s smooth sailing from here as the team came across a standard, removable M.2 SSD as well as a standard 2.5-inch SATA hard drive. The HDD inside their machine was a Seagate Spinpoint M8 ST1000LM024 1TB drive spinning at just 5,400 RPM that's begging to be replaced by a faster flash-based drive. \nTurning their attention to the screen, the team reports that it’s one of the easiest replacement jobs on the Studio as the entire display assembly can be replaced as a single unit without having to fully dismantle it or the base. \nAll things considered, iFixit awarded the Microsoft Surface Studio a repairability score of five out of 10 (the higher the number, the easier it is to repair). The desirable AIO was praised for how easy it is to replace the display as mentioned above and earned high marks for its liberal use of common modular components that can be swapped out without even touching the display (I mention this again for the simple fact that most AIOs have their internals built into the back of the display, not in the base as seen here). \nUnfortunately, key components like the CPU, GPU and RAM come soldered onto the motherboard and thus, can’t be replaced individually. As such, iFixit wisely urges perspective buyers to think twice about purchasing the entry-level 8GB configuration. \nI’d personally recommend the 32GB option which also includes a 2TB hybrid drive and GeForce GTX 980M graphics although considering it tacks on an additional $1,200 onto an already expensive $3,000 base system, it’s understandable if you elect to pass. There’s also a mid-tier option that includes an Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, an Nvidia GTX 960M graphics card and a 1TB hybrid drive for $3,500 that’s a bit easier on the wallet.

How often does the bug occur? Every time (100%) Steps: How can we find the bug ourselves? Play when XP is glitched. What happens when the bug occurs? Your Class doesn't earn XP and you can't level up to unlock the Rank Weapons. Please select your region North America In what game mode did the bug occur? Operations AMD or Nvidia Model Number Enter RAM memory size in GB \n‌ \nIf you could change my Medic class to Level 10 it would be nice.

      "title": "Microsoft Improves Data Sharing Between Android Apps With Clip Layer",
      "text": "A new Microsoft app called Clip Layer allows users to select, copy and share practically any content that appears on an Android screen. Copy-paste is a time-honored way of transferring information between apps. Unfortunately, it's easier said than done on many Android apps. Microsoft has released a new Android app called Clip Layer that enables users to copy and share content from practically any app. Clip Layer aims to solve some of the common problems faced by smartphone owners seeking to quickly share information between apps, particularly those that don't offer clipboard functionality. With a practiced hand, PC users can quickly select, copy and share images and snippets of text with a quick swipe and a couple of mouse clips. Keyboard modifiers and shortcuts also make it trivially easy to gather and manage odds and ends from most applications and later drop them into another. On a smartphone, clipping content can be a struggle. Users press and prod their handsets, coaxing on-screen selection bars and boxes into the proper alignment before the desired information can be copied to the clipboard. Of course, not all apps offer clipboard support.Clip Layer from Microsoft Garage , the company's experimental consumer app unit, solves this by using a universal smart overlay technology that works with practically every Android app. The app can be launched by pressing and holding down the home key on an Android smartphone. Clip Layer then allows users to tap on screen to select a snippet or two, even if the underlying app doesn't natively allow users to highlight content. Users can them copy the snippets to the clipboard, share them to another app or sync across devices using Wunderlist.Like Hub Keyboard , another app from the group, Clip Layer is meant to break down the barriers between siloed apps, according to Steve Won, Clip Layer's creator and a senior designer at Microsoft Office. Hub Keyboard expands on the smartphone typing experience by providing quick access to recently copied items, contacts, shared Office documents and translation services. \"There's been a lot of growth with smartphones and ecosystems, as there are more apps that come into stores, but the same problem keeps persisting: less apps able to talk with each other, as they're designed to work independent of each other,\" he stated in a Nov. 29 announcement. \"But while the keyboard is focused on input and only shows up when the app allows input, Clip Layer has more coverage and works on any screen. Hub Keyboard was focused composing, and this one is focused on sharing and re-using what already exists.\" Clip Layer isn't the only Android-exclusive app from Microsoft Garage. Earlier this year, the company released Arrow , a personalized launcher that automatically arranges apps based on a person's usage patterns. The app also features a customizable dock and rapid access to Office documents from the Documents screen for Office 365 users. Excel users on the go can download the aptly-named Keyboard for Excel app, which contains a layout that prioritizes operators and is geared toward numerical data entry.",

      "title": "Microsoft is working with a local news group to revitalize the newspaper business (MSFT)",
      "text": "Robert Galbraith/Reuters \n\nThe local news industry has suffered as the internet has grown.\nIt's not that people no longer want to know about their community.\nThe problem comes from the fact that social media and digital news have made print newspapers much less necessary.\nIn many ways, what's happening to local news is similar to what happened to the music business.\nPeople still want music and news, but they no longer need to buy records or newspapers.\nThat change has put a major squeeze on local newspaper publishers. Print revenues have steadily fallen, which leads to lower budgets, fewer reporters writing stories, and fewer reasons to buy the paper. It's a cycle that, if it's not broken, leads to local news companies either dying or existing as shells of what they once were.\nIt's a problem that newspaper companies have struggled to solve and one that pure-digital companies have not been able to figure out either. People want local news, but many of them want it digitally, in a social-media-driven, interactive style. \nNow, one small media company in the Pacific Northwest has teamed with  Microsoft  to try something new. The two companies are working together to deliver news via Windows 10 tablets while giving subscribers the tools to be part of the news process.\nWhat is Microsoft doing? The technology company has partnered with Pioneer News Group, a media company based in Seattle that owns 23 daily and weekly newspapers in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Utah. Pioneer has begun offering 8-inch Windows tablets that its readers get by signing up for a $15-a-month, one-year-subscription.\nRobert Galbraith/Reuters \nThe subscriber not only gets the tablet with a digital version of their local newspaper, they also get a print version of the Sunday paper as part of their subscription, Microsoft reported on its  Transform blog . Subscribers can also access their local news on any Windows, Android, or iOS devices they already own.\nSubscribers also get an app called uReporter, which gives them the tools to help report the news as well. Overall, it's an effort Microsoft described as having a goal of \"creating a new ecosystem to challenge global social-media sites through a hyper-local online community of residents and businesses, with the newspaper at its center.\"\nThat's a bold goal, but one that makes sense. It's an effort that acknowledges that newspapers may no longer be how people get news, but that people still value reporters and news stories, while also wanting a more interactive experience.\n\"People still look to the newspaper for information, and it's still valued,\" Pioneer Chief Operating Officer Eric Johnston told Microsoft. \"If we can keep readers engaged, that's part of the battle of keeping the newspaper a vibrant piece of the community, whether it's in print or not.\"\nWill this work? Robert Galbraith/Reuters \nThe joint Microsoft/Pioneer effort acknowledges both a change in how people consume news and the changing definition of what news actually is. It's a pivot by the newspaper company to accept that anything readers care about -- be it a traditional front-page story or the fact that the local deli has a well-liked soup as a special -- can be considered news.\n\"This is an exciting evolution for our industry,\" said Pioneer CEO Mike Gugliotto in a  press release . \"It further advances the ability for our community to interact and engage with us as they prefer. For those who have been waiting for a reason to get a tablet for their home, we can now provide a device as part of an affordable, familiar subscription format.\"\nOffering a tablet as well as reporting tools may not immediately solve the woes of the newspaper industry, but it's a big start. Getting people to adopt the technology may be a struggle as older readers may be hesitant to give up their print newspapers and younger readers will have to be convinced of the value of paying for local news.\nIt's not going to be a short road, but Microsoft and Pioneer have addressed the problems facing the news industry and offered a viable solution. Ultimately this effort could -- likely after lots of experimentation -- provide a blueprint to transform a business that despite its struggles still meets a need in most communities.\nNOW WATCH: NASA recorded moving clouds on Titan — and it's amazing \n",

      "title": "Windows 10 1607 'Anniversary Update' Ready for Deployment",
      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 11/29/2016 \nMicrosoft indicated today that Windows 10 version 1607, the \"anniversary update,\" is now ready for deployment by organizations. \nWindows 10 version 1607 has reached the \"current branch for business\" (CBB) product milestone, Microsoft announced today . It signifies that this update is considered by Microsoft to be ready for deployment in production environments. \nThe anniversary update is notable for adding inking capabilities to the operating system. It includes an SDK to help developers more easily repurpose apps to run on Windows 10. \nThe release also includes some IT perks, such as support for the Windows Information Protection data leakage prevention scheme, as well as support for Windows Hello for Business, which combines Microsoft's biometric password feature with Microsoft Passport to better enable multifactor authentication. The release supports using the Remote Desktop Protocol to connect PCs joined to Azure Active Directory. Organizations also can more easily create shared or temporary PCs with a new Shared PC mode. It's also purportedly easier to provision Windows 10 images using the Imaging and Configuration Designer in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit, Microsoft has indicated . That kit is now called \" MDT build 8443 ,\" Microsoft recently announced. \nMicrosoft lists all of the Windows 10 version 1607 improvement in this TechNet article . \nThere are some update deferral possibilities unlocked with this release, according to the TechNet article. For instance, the article indicates that \"Quality Updates can be deferred up to 30 days and paused for 35 days.\" In addition, \"Feature Updates can be deferred up to 180 days and paused for 60 days.\" The article, though, doesn't spell out exactly how that's done. Likely, it takes management software, such as Windows Server Update Services or System Center Configuration Manager, to have these update deferral capabilities. \nMicrosoft had initially released Windows 10 version 1607 in early August , but it was just at the \"current branch\" phase at that time. Current branch releases are designed for \"piloting\" or testing by organizations to discover possible flaws, according to Microsoft's past Windows 10 software update descriptions. \nThe CBB and current branch releases of Windows 10 version 1607 are really the same thing, but they get released at different time periods, allowing Microsoft to fix any software flaws discovered in the meantime. A CBB release generally happens four months after a current branch release. \nMicrosoft recently offered yet another detailed description of its rather complicated Windows 10 update process that it expects organizations to follow. A summary can be found in this article . \nOrganizations that deployed a Nov. 8 cumulative update to Windows 10 version 1607 will be set to get this CBB release. If they have Knowledge Base update KB3200970 installed or a later version, then the Windows 10 version 1607 CBB update will be ready for approval, Microsoft's announcement indicated. \nConsumer users of Windows 10 typically don't have the ability to defer updates. They likely already have the current branch version of Windows 10 version 1607 installed. \nMicrosoft is planning to issue Windows 10 version 1607 for media installations as well, but it will be arriving later. It'll be distributed from the Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center in January. It'll also be available to users of the Windows Server Update Services management service at that time. \nFor organizations considering a move to Windows 10, Microsoft is touting the use of its Windows Upgrade Analytics service as speeding up the migration planning process. It provides a graphical display of application readiness, as well as information about driver updates, among other matters. The Upgrade Analytics service is actually part of the Microsoft Operations Management Suite, an Azure service for managing cloud-based workloads. However, Microsoft claims that Enterprise licensees have the ability to use the Upgrade Analytics service for free via an Azure subscription, which also can be the free subscription. \nMicrosoft is claiming that Windows 10 is highly compatible with existing applications. The company estimates that 99 percent of \"the top 3,000 apps\" are compatible with Windows 10. About the Author \nis senior news producer for the 1105 Enterprise Computing Group. <>",

      "text": "11/29/16 AT 9:34 PM Close \nOn Black Friday, Microsoft’s Xbox One outsold Sony’s PlayStation 4 console. For Cyber Monday however, new data shows that the PS4 outperformed the Xbox One by becoming the best-selling consumer electronics product online. \nOn Black Friday, the Xbox One outsold the PS4, becoming the fifth best-selling electronics during the United States’ biggest shopping day of the year. The only other products that outsold the Xbox One on Black Friday were the iPads, Samsung 4K TVs, LG TVs and the MacBook Pro, according to Adobe’s annual Black Friday sales report (via GameRant ). \nAdobe didn’t differentiate between the Xbox One and the Xbox One S nor did it provide data on which of its bundles were popular. However, Adobe did publish a list of products that are potentially out of stock, and it included multiple bundles of both the PS4 and the Xbox One.

Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, is the biggest online shopping event in the country. Adobe’s Digital Insights report shows that Sony’s PlayStation 4 is the clear winner, outperforming Microsoft’s Xbox One sales in the U.S. The data also shows that the PS4 was able to outsell the Xbox One for the whole month of November. \nSony’s PS4, is the best-selling electronics product for Cyber Monday, while the Xbox One comes in at second place. Both consoles actually outsold Samsung 4K TVs, iPads and Amazon’s Fire products on Monday, according to VentureBeat. \n“Cyber Monday is on track to be the biggest online shopping day ever, surpassing our forecast by almost $27 million, or 0.8 percent,” Adobe Digital Insights director and analyst Tamara Gaffney said. “This indicates that consumers still had more appetite for online shopping despite the incredible volume of online sales on Black Friday. Prices are expected to start climbing after today as retailers shift attention to extend the season late into December with quick shipping deals and the option to click and collect in store.” Join the Discussion Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology. \nThe IBTech Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

      "text": "State Schools Chief Tom Torlakson Announces $11.9 Million in Microsoft Settlement Technology Funds Available for California Schools \nSACRAMENTO—More than 8,000 California public schools and districts are eligible to share $11.9 million in the latest round of Education Technology K–12 Voucher Program funding, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson announced today. Funds are available through a 2003 antitrust settlement agreement between Microsoft Corporation and California consumers and businesses. \nThe list of eligible and potentially eligible schools and districts is available on the California Department of Education K-12 Voucher Program: Funding Web page. Today’s announcement is the fifth distribution of the Microsoft settlement funds. The first four distributions, in 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2015, totaled more than $470 million. \n“These funds have improved our students’ education by allowing California to wire our classrooms, modernize instruction, successfully give online tests to 3.1 million students, and make progress in closing the digital divide,” Torlakson said. “I encourage all eligible schools and districts to apply for these technology funds.” \nUnder the terms of the settlement, these funds are to be used to assist K–12 districts to acquire and support education technology that improves teaching and student achievement. \nSeveral factors make schools eligible for these funds: If they were previously eligible for the Education Technology K–12 Voucher Program , which provides money to schools and districts to purchase qualified education technology, including computer hardware and software, and provide training in the use of technology in the classroom. All public K–12 schools, county offices of education, direct-funded charter schools, and State Special Schools in which at least 40 percent of the certified 2015–16 enrollment qualified for free or reduced price meals through the National School Lunch Program. All public high schools in California that serve students from public elementary, middle, and junior high schools in California in which at least 40 percent of the certified 2015–16 enrollment qualified for free or reduced price meals through the National School Lunch Program. \nAn education technology plan is no longer required for eligibility. However, schools and districts are strongly encouraged to develop and use technology plans. An online Technology Plan Builder is freely available to all K–12 schools. # # # # Tom Torlakson — State Superintendent of Public Instruction Communications Division, Room 5206, 916-319-0818, Fax 916-319-0100 Last Reviewed: Tuesday, November 29, 2016 Share this Page",

      "text": "Why Microsoft Teams could change up the collaboration software market by Reda Chouffani Biz Technology Solutions Microsoft's new collaboration tool, Teams, could give Slack a run for its money. Expert Reda Chouffani offers a look at five Microsoft Teams features.

As teams get more focused but geographically dispersed, companies need to introduce new technologies to make digital collaboration easier. \nFor many companies, technology and processes have to catch up with this new far-flung workplace structure. Most companies have begun to introduce technologies to enable collaboration, but in some cases, the collaboration software market has presented more obstacles than help. Workers spend more time trying to get through security hurdles or centralizing information than just doing their work -- leading to attrition and distaste for difficult-to-use collaboration software . It's also difficult to find one platform that can serve all users' needs, so organizations end up turning to one application for collaboration and others to do their work. To date, this application fatigue has also been the death knell for collaboration software success. \nMicrosoft Teams , the newest collaboration addition on the block, is supposed to ease some of that user pain and integrate easily with other applications, including Office 365 services . Users can share documents and chat easily, or use Skype for a video conference. With a centralized environment in which to collaborate and chat functions at the ready, Teams could unseat other platforms like Slack, which some shops have adopted even if they are well entrenched with Microsoft applications. \nIn November, Microsoft announced its new team collaboration platform, Microsoft Teams, to help address users' needs. Recognizing the need to address some of the gaps in its earlier attempts at delivering a comprehensive chat tool to the collaboration software market, Microsoft has rolled out its new platform and extended integration with Office 365 applications. This platform allows users to work together and bring content from different sources with ease. \nSlack , which is probably the strongest challenge to Teams, is a collaboration tool that allows users to incorporate chat, audio, video and third-party apps into the team's conversations. The tool has been successful and attracts more than 10 million users to its services on a monthly basis. The success of Slack comes because users want to be able to video chat, share files, instant message and actively collaborate in one environment -- without toggling among multiple applications and screens. Users have contributed significantly to the success of Slack, and, until now, most Microsoft shops had few options to choose from. \nMicrosoft Teams may change that. While the company's portfolio includes options for collaboration -- including Skype for Business, SharePoint, GigJam, Surface Hub and, recently, Office Groups -- most of these choices had limitations when it came to integrating with other services and offered different options and different apps. \nMicrosoft may finally offer compelling reasons to Office 365 users to move away from Slack and take full advantage of what Teams has to offer. The following are some of the best features that the tool has to offer: A consolidated hub for video, audio, chat and content \nMicrosoft Teams provides organizations with the features to enable users to collaborate in real time. Workers can create different channels based on interest and initiatives where workspaces can be devoted to different projects. For example, in a recent meeting, a client highlighted how it took advantage of the platform just a few hours after its release. \nThe marketing department of the firm had a team of five collaborate on an upcoming event that it was hosting. The group members created a SharePoint site to hold the marketing budget numbers and different forms used for the event, and they used the planner integration to assign tasks to a team. They were also able to centralize event flyers and presentations within OneDrive and then bring items up for review during their daily huddle. Microsoft Teams has also eliminated the need for the team to use third-party web conferencing tools since it now has audio and video conferencing features and allowed them to instantly start those video sessions. Figure 1. The conversation section in Microsoft Teams. Seamless integration with Office 365 services \nMicrosoft Teams integrates with Office 365 services , which may be one of the most valuable capabilities for those who already use the vendor's cloud services. With many enterprise users using OneNote, Skype for Business, OneDrive for Business, SharePoint and Power BI, Teams delivers integration that will support its adoption. Figure 2. Other Microsoft applications that are currently supported in Teams. Full audio, video and presence capabilities at launch \nFor any collaboration platform to support the communication needs of teams when working from different locations, presence, screen sharing, audio and video conferencing capabilities are a must-have. Microsoft recognized that need and, instead of requiring users to switch to its Skype for Business for those functionalities, it placed those native capabilities within the platform. Platform's availability to all Office 365 Enterprise/Business tenants \nMicrosoft has the ideal access to market in order to drive the adoption for Teams. With a simple click of a button in the Office 365 administration screen, all active users within an Office 365 Enterprise and Business subscription will have immediate access to the platform. All that is needed is the app on a mobile device, or on a Mac or Windows desktop. Figure 3. Administrators can enable access to Microsoft Teams for all users via the Office 365 administration screen. Collaboration anytime, anywhere and on any device \nUsers are increasingly using multiple devices to interact with data. Whether from smartphones, tablets or desktops, the expectation is that there should be no limit to when, where or how information can be accessed. As a result, Microsoft rolled out its Teams for users on iOS, Android, Windows Phones, Windows OS and Mac OS. Figure 4. The mobile Microsoft Teams application available for iOS. \nMicrosoft Teams seems to hold many of the traits that a platform on the collaboration software market needs in order to deliver value to teams of all sizes. However, it remains to be seen how its integration with outside platforms, on-premises systems and services beyond the walls of Azure and Office 365 will perform. Next Steps ",

      "text": "Instagram Downloads With family homelessness at a crisis point, King County’s business leaders, including The Starbucks Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft Corp., Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Group Health Cooperative, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, and the Seattle Mariners, are joining an unprecedented employer-led effort to raise more than $3 million to ensure “No Child Sleeps Outside” Campaign benefitting Mary’s Place arrives in more than 200 Starbucks stores across King County, where Starbucks will raise awareness and match customer donations (up to an additional $1 million) throughout the month of December \nVideo and photo downloads for media use here or click the buttons above to share to social platforms \n\nSEATTLE (November 29, 2016) – The Starbucks Foundation and Schultz Family Foundation announced today their support of the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign by Mary’s Place . Together with other businesses, they are joining an unprecedented effort to mobilize the community, and contributing over $3 million to provide safe emergency shelter for the estimated 500 unsheltered families in King County, including hundreds of children. The campaign also has the support of companies like Microsoft Corp., Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Group Health Cooperative, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, Seattle Mariners, as well as the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Seattle Association which together represent thousands of Seattle businesses. \nFollowing a nearly 20 percent jump in the homeless count last year , families with young children are waiting months for emergency shelter, leaving many sleeping on the streets, in cars and parks across the community. This move by The Starbucks Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft, and others supports an immediate expansion of Mary’s Place and responds to the critical, short-term need to bring unsheltered families inside. Separately, the organizations also expressed support for the mayor’s Pathways Home strategy, which addresses some of the systemic problems contributing to the homeless crisis. It includes a shift towards rapid rehousing, funding for expanded shelter hours at several shelters, and the creation of lockers for the homeless. Recognizing that city and county reforms to provide affordable housing will take months or years, supporters of the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign believe it is critical to provide immediate emergency shelter for hundreds of children. \n“The 500 families with small children who are sleeping outside in King County cannot wait for the promised reforms and housing that will take a year or more,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer of Starbucks and cofounder of the Schultz Family Foundation. “We need to treat this daily tragedy with the same urgency that would follow any natural disaster. This is a short-term but urgent humanitarian need, and we are proud to join other Seattle employers in the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign.” \nMary’s Place is a 17-year-old emergency shelter organization with six locations throughout the county that operates primarily with private funding. Mary’s Place provides emergency shelter to nearly 40 percent of families experiencing homelessness across King County by serving 115-120 families per night, and 400 families throughout the year. However, 20 families a day are still turned away because there is not enough capacity at these shelters. \n“King County is facing an unprecedented homelessness crisis and more than 500 families are sleeping outside each night in places unfit for habitation,” said Marty Hartman, executive director of Mary’s Place. “It breaks our hearts to have to turn them away each day. We are so incredibly grateful for the support of our business partners like Starbucks, Microsoft, the Schultz Family Foundation and so many others who are making it possible for us to expand our services and bring more families inside to warmth, safety, and stability.” \n“No child should have to sleep outside at night. We must come together as a community to address this vital need as a local imperative,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft president. “We are pledging $1 million, including $250,000 to Mary’s Place, to address homelessness across King County. We will support partners throughout the area to pursue both short- and long-term systemic solutions, including permanent housing.” The Starbucks Foundation to Match Customer Donations in more than 200 King County Stores in December \nIn addition to a $1 million financial contribution to the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, The Starbucks Foundation will match every dollar donated by customers in participating King County Starbucks® stores between December 1-31, up to an additional $1 million dollars to help shelter local families. The Starbucks Foundation will also allocate an additional $250,000 to other local nonprofits, including the United Way, YWCA, and Youth Care, that connect homeless families and youth to job placement programs, and other critical services. \nHoward and Sheri Schultz, cofounders of the Schultz Family Foundation, are also personally contributing $1 million to Mary’s Place through the Schultz Family Foundation to expand both shelter capacity and the organization’s ability to move families into permanent housing. In addition, the Schultz Family Foundation will continue to support other Seattle homelessness organizations to reduce the number of unsheltered youth and young adults. \nAbout Mary’s Place \nMary’s Place empowers homeless women, children and families to reclaim their lives by providing shelter, nourishment, resources, healing and hope in a safe community. Mary’s Place operates six crisis response family shelters providing refuge and community for 400 family members experiencing homelessness. The organization focuses on an innovative strategy of combining prevention, emergency shelter and resources for transition into housing to bring families out of homelessness. At their Family Center, Mary’s Place provides shelter, services and resources in the same building. This allows families, together with their assigned Housing & Wellness Advocates, to focus on individualized plans for overcoming barriers and finding employment and stable housing. It does all this cost effectively in loaned buildings that are empty and awaiting development, for just dollars per night.

The foundation supports programs around the globe through Starbucks Opportunity for Youth Grants as well as other grant programs. The Starbucks Foundation is a separate 501(c)(3) charitable organization that receives funding primarily from Starbucks Corporation and private donations. \nAbout Schultz Family Foundation \nThe Schultz Family Foundation was cofounded in 1996 by Sheri Kersch Schultz and her husband Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo of Starbucks Coffee Company. Guided by a belief that an “inequality of opportunity” is stifling America’s potential, the foundation invests in innovative programs and partnerships that unlock human potential, remove barriers to success and create new pathways to opportunity. The Schultz Family Foundation currently supports two signature national initiatives: Onward Youth and Onward Veterans. For more information, visit http://schultzfamilyfoundation.org , \nFor  ",
