      "text": "For real-life roads, Ford's Focus is still sharp Sunday Nov 20, 2016 at 6:00 AM\nBy Warren Brown The Washington Post\nAs a young journalist, I thrilled at invitations from automobile manufacturers to drive exotic cars in exotic locations. But there always was a troubling disconnect.\nWe journalists would arrive a day or night before the drive, which often would be arranged to run against the rush hour of the host location. The idea was to provide us the luxury of enjoying the luxury cars without traffic jams.\nWe could concentrate on the design and engineering of the subject automobiles without paying much attention to reality, which is that few of the world's roads are traveled by exotic cars because few of the world's motorists can afford them.\nThat reality is seen daily on highways such as Interstate 66, where models such as the subject of this week's review, the 2017 Ford Focus S sedan, abound.\nIt is a well-constructed compact car - safe and fuel-efficient, affording 30 miles per gallon in the city and 42 miles per gallon on the highway using regular-grade gasoline. It has been around since 1998 and is a common sight on streets as diverse as those of the District of Columbia and Moscow.\nTechnology has kept the little Focus updated. But it has been aggressively matched in that endeavor by the South Koreans, who have loaded with value and likability models such as the Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte. The Japanese, of course, understand the global market and have countered with affordable rides such as the Mazda 2 and Toyota Yaris.\nBut the little Focus keeps rolling on primarily because it is designed to safely and efficiently get you where you are going at a base price - $18,175 - that makes the car reasonably accessible.\nAccessibility and reliability trump the romance of \"fun to drive\" here, although the Focus is a nice, tight compact car that can be had with performance credibility if purchased as a Focus ST or RS. But most people who buy it are looking for the basics of reliability and economy and thus will get it in one of the more popular trim levels of S, SE, SEL or Titanium. The Focus also is available as an electric and hatchback SE EcoBoost.\nThe Focus S is basic personal transportation. You don't buy it to impress. Nor do you get it to zoom past the competition. You get it to get there. Period. And the little car does a very decent job of doing that.\nIt is equipped with a 2-liter, four-cylinder gasoline engine delivering 160 horsepower and 146 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. A six-speed automatic is optional. Spend the extra money on the automatic. It will be worth it in one of the Washington area's traffic jams.\nI found the Focus S to be a good little get-about, although somewhat disconcerting after spending weeks in models that have jettisoned pieces such as ignition keys and locks in favor of push-button ignition. The Focus can be had with lots of modern safety technology. But it does appear to be getting a bit long in the tooth.\nStill, it makes sense as a basic transportation car, particularly in S trim. It remains a \"buy\" here.\nNuts & Bolts\n2017 FORD FOCUS S\nBottom line: The 2017 Focus S, practically unchanged from the 2016 model year, is safe, reliable and, depending on traffic patterns, enjoyable basic transportation.\nRide, acceleration and handling: It gets decent marks in all three areas.\nHead-turning quotient: It has the styling signature of the larger Ford Fusion, which clearly has \"borrowed\" styling cues from the Aston Martin, which once was a Ford property.\nBody style/layout: The Ford Focus is a compact, front-engine, front-wheel-drive economy car available as a sedan or hatchback. An electric version is also for sale.\nEngine/transmission for Focus S: It comes with a 2.0-liter, 16-valve, four-cylinder gasoline engine with variable valve timing (160 horsepower, 146 pound-feet of torque). A five-speed manual transmission is standard. A six-speed automatic is optional.\nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity is 13.2 cubic feet. The fuel tank holds 12.4 gallons of gasoline. Regular grade is fine.\nMileage: I averaged 36 miles per gallon mostly in highway driving.\nSafety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc brakes, rear drum brakes; four-wheel anti-lock brake protection; traction and stability control; post-collision safety system; side and head air bags.\nPricing: The 2017 Ford Focus S starts at $18,175 with a dealer's invoice price of $17,357. Price as tested is $21,190, including $2,140 in options (automatic transmission, cosmetics and other items) and an $875 factory-to-dealer shipment charge. Dealer's price as tested is $20,266.",

      "text": "England's Ford can be better: Jones   2:13pm England flyhalf George Ford. England coach Eddie Jones believes Ford can become a better player. Photo: Adrian Dennis / AFP \nLONDON – England coach Eddie Jones believes his flyhalf George Ford can become a better player than New Zealand's Beauden Barrett if he learns to be more selfish. \nThe 23-year-old Ford has impressed Jones with his \"absolutely outstanding\" skills and was instrumental in England's 58-15 demolition of Fiji at Twickenham on Saturday, during which they ran in nine tries. \n\"I think George can be better than Beauden Barrett,\" Jones told reporters. \nREAD: Jones wants 'Rumble in Jungle' against Boks \nWorld player of the year Barrett, who has taken over the All Blacks number 10 shirt from Dan Carter and kept the New Zealanders top of the world rankings, was man of the match in their 21-9 win over Ireland in Dublin on Saturday. \n\"People rave about Beauden Barrett but I don't. I just think George has got a great feel for the game,\" Jones said. \n\"He needs to work on his running game a bit, needs to be more of a threat himself. He's actually too selfless. He needs to be a bit more selfish with the ball at times,\" the Australian added. \nEngland, who extended their run to 12 successive wins by crushing Fiji, they host Argentina on Saturday before meeting Australia on December 3 when they could equal their record of 14 test victories in a row.

      "text": "By Mary Conway 2016-11-21 22:45 Finally a 2017 Ford GT you can afford to own Ford is now selling diecast reproductions of the incredible 2017 Ford GT supercar. Available in blue or silver, it may be the only Ford GT you can ever afford. \nOnly a few hundred people will be able to buy the 2017 Ford GT Supercar. The company is only producing about 250 of the $450,000 cars a year. \nNow, there is word that Ford is producing 1:18 diecast versions of the 2017 Ford GT, a fraction of the car, at a fraction of the price. \nThe model features a metal body with plastic parts. It includes opening door, hood and trunk, fully functional steering, four wheel suspension, and detailed chassis with separated exhausted system. It is being sold in bold the vibrant blue and the racing silver. The cost is $29.95. \nThe estimated shipping date for the models is November 30, 2016. The Ford Merchandise site is not promising that the models will be delivered in time for the holidays. \nThe Ford GT is the most exciting thing to happen to Ford Motor since they last sold the GT back in 2005 and 2006. Ford required all potential buyers to fill out an extensive (like 19 page) application. Buyers have to agree to use the car for charity appearances and promise not to resell the vehicle for a specific period of time. Many of the cars are being awarded to people who bought the first Ford GTs. \nThe 2017 Ford GT will be a special trophy. The body is mostly lightweight carbon fiber, and it will be powered by a turbocharged V6 engine producing over 600 horsepower. The 2017 Ford GT is being built in Canada by Multimatic, a firm known for building race cars. \nNo word on where the diecast versions of the 2017 Ford GT are being built. But if you know a Ford fanatic, the blue or silver model of the 2017 Ford GT may just fill the bill.",

      "title": "Ford CIO: IT is a ‘people business’",
      "text": "Leading women in technology: LinkedIn's Erica Lockheimer \nWhen asked about her biggest priorities as CIO of Ford Motor Company, the $150 billion automobile manufacturer, Marcy Klevorn says, “It’s really a story of ‘ and .’” \nNot long ago, Ford and its chief competitors made automobiles, and Americans bought American-made cars. But global competition took hold, and the decline of Detroit began. Then came the economic downturn of the late 2000s, which led to the U.S. government’s auto bailout. (Ford did not receive bailout funds but did take government loans to retool its manufacturing facilities.) \nJust a few years later, Ford is contending with an astounding degree of disruption, from Tesla to Uber to self-driving cars and beyond. \nIn response, Klevorn and her organization are revving Ford’s innovation engine, focusing on areas like mobility, robotics and boosting agile development. But the cultural change that accompanies technology breakthroughs is more important to Klevorn than any of those individual breakthroughs themselves. \nThat’s one of the most important lessons that Klevorn — a Michigan native and 30-plus-year veteran of Ford — has learned in her career. “The business of being a CIO, or even being in information technology, is a people business,” she said. \nWhen Klevorn assumed the CIO post in January 2015, her boss, Ford CEO Mark Fields, spoke with her about how Ford and the automotive industry overall were increasingly becoming a technology and software business. With that transformation came the all-important cultural considerations. Ford would have to find new ways to communicate with its customers, as well as create an environment that inspired its employees to move the company forward. \nFor Klevorn, those pressures were not necessarily anything new—not when you understand her leadership philosophy and focus. Shifting gears \nKlevorn earned a business degree from the University of Michigan. Her first job out of college — the only she would hold outside of Ford — was in marketing with AT&T, where she helped sell technology to companies like Ford. \nBut she made a career shift — a logical transition — not long after. \nWhile at Michigan, Klevorn took computer science classes, learning to code and design systems. At AT&T, Klevorn took a six-month course in telecommunications, during which she decided that marketing was less appealing than finding solutions to business problems, and working with technology. \nBefore long, Ford hired her away from AT&T to work in telecommunications services. Klevorn would go on to serve in a number of managerial and leadership roles in data and information management, product lifecycle management, strategy and infrastructure with Ford in the Americas and Europe, and Ford Credit. \nWorking in marketing taught Klevorn the importance of personal connections, and she had a chance to put that to work in her time at AT&T working with Ford. At Ford, it played an outsized role in shaping her philosophy of IT as a “people business.” \n“Not starting out as a pure technologist helped me lead with relationships, building trust, and seeking to understand first, and then come with the solution next,” Klevorn said. \nKlevorn describes herself as an introvert — not unlike many of the IT professionals with whom she has worked and now work for her. In her Myers-Briggs assessment, she’s an F (feeler), which points to seeking to understand the concerns of key stakeholders and make decisions that are best for those stakeholders. Related:",

Each event promised invitations to the SEMA Show in Las Vegas and the OPTIMA Ultimate Street Car Invitational (OUSCI), so there is technically one last event, but Fontana wrapped up the regular season. \nRegular season champions were crowned in each of the four classes and the final five invitations to SEMA and the OUSCI were handed out to the lucky few in this sold-out field of competitors. What Fords may have lacked in quantity, they more than made up for in quality, with several strong performances, starting in the GTV class for vintage iron. Jake Rozelle's 1969 Camaro notched the top overall finish in the Lingenfelter Design & Engineering Challenge, which meant Mike Maier's 1966 Mustang would have to find eight points in the three timed events to catch and pass Rozelle for the class win. Besides the nine Cobras that may have been produced in 1993 in a non-clearcoat red, Scott Anthony's Teal Metallic paint was the rarest color option on 1993 Cobras, with just 1,355 produced. Rare to see one in the wild these days, let alone one that is being tracked. \nMaier started to close the gap in the PowerStop Speed Stop Challenge, where he picked up three points on Rozelle and added another point on the Detroit Speed Autocross. That moved him halfway to his goal after the first day of competition and meant he'd need to gap Rozelle by four spots on the Falken Tire Road Course Time Trial to claim the overall victory. Maier did nearly all he could, notching a second-place overall finish and 99 points. However, Rozelle finished right behind him in third-place overall, leaving a gap of two points to decide the GTV class win. The margin was just as tight in the chase for the season championship, where Rozelle edged out Maier for the GTV season championship by just five points. \nWith every production car under the sun eligible to compete in this series, there's no telling what might show up from one event to the next. The GTS class at Fontana ended up with five different manufacturers finishing in the top-five. Todd Earsley's 2016 Focus RS represented the Ford camp well in fifth-place, considering the car is driven-daily (over 16,000 miles already!) and much closer to stock than many of the cars that finished ahead of him, including a Viper, Porsche GT3 and Evo X. Earsley's season-long point total was enough to get him an invite to Vegas and we expect his Focus will be even further away from stock by the time it gets there. As rare a sight as Scott Anthony's Cobra might be, the last time we saw someone flogging a legit Shelby GT350H on the track was the last time we saw Randall Pond running at one of these events. His 1966 was one of just 50 produced in Candy Apple Red. \nThe GTL class for anything that weighs less than 3,200 pounds is regularly the toughest of the four classes and series Grand Champion, Rich Willhoff, showed why that was the case, posting the fastest overall time in each of the three timed segments. In a class dominated by Corvettes, one wouldn't have expected much from Jonathan Lugod's 2015 Focus ST. However, Lugod more than held his own, notching a sixth-place finish in class and a sixth-place overall finish in the Detroit Speed Autocross. \nThe GT class is typically one of the largest in the series and often where the most Fords can be found. That was certainly the case at Fontana, where the 26-car class had a dozen blue ovals in the mix. Ultimately, it was Jeremiah Stotler's 2015 Mustang GT that emerged with an invite to SEMA and the OUSCI, thanks to a four-point edge over Kurt Robinson's 2015 Camaro. Andrew Nier's 2012 Mustang GT finished further down in sixth-place, but picked up enough season-long points to grab a spot in the field as well. \nWith the field from the qualifying series now set, the competition moves to the grand finale in Las Vegas, immediately after the SEMA Show. Ten more entries will be selected from the show floor, but it will be the ultimate challenge for any of them to hang with the cars that have already been battle-tested in the qualifying series.",

      "text": "0 Comments \nDark Forest Green is a color that enjoyed profound success in the 90’s. It seemed like every other Explorer you saw on the road was painted in the dark green hue, but the popularity of the color on automobiles has faded greatly since. \nYou can get a new F-150 in dark green today, but for whatever reason not a whole lot of people opt for the color on new or old vehicles these days. But when you lay your eyes on this gorgeous forest green 1966 F-100, it’s hard to see why. This isn’t some neon color or avocado green that went out in the disco era. \nIn this case the paint is just as flawless as the body panels it has been applied to. All of the chrome and trim is in fantastic condition as well, and a set of classy steel wheels with hubcaps add a little more bling to the equation. \nThe greenness continues inside with white accents to break things up a bit. Most everything is essentially original, including the 352 engine and 3-speed automatic transmission, save for a couple of aftermarket gauges. Mileage is unknown but the truck has undoubtedly received at least a cosmetic restoration. \nAfter laying eyes on this super fine ’66, it’s safe to say that we need to bring dark forest green back. The preferred color of the 90’s is long overdue for a comeback, especially on classic Ford trucks. ",

      "text": "Open iTunes to preview, buy, and download this movie. About the Movie In the early 1960’s, Ford was drastically losing market share to GM and Chevrolet. The Corvette was crushing Ford at the dealerships and on the track. Henry Ford II was desperate to regain the market share his grandfather had worked so hard to build. While watching the 12 Hours of Sebring, Henry Ford II saw a beautiful red solution to his problems -- Henry Ford II decided to buy Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari had been dominating the racing world for decades. A former driver himself, Enzo lived and breathed racing, and the beautiful cars he designed reflected his passion for the sport. Enzo only sold consumer cars to fund his racing, while Ford wanted to win races in order to sell more consumer cars. Talks began between the two companies. After months going back and forth to Italy, Ford was finally ready to buy Ferrari. Ford would now have the answer to all of their problems: a lethally fast car that could easily crush the Corvette and restore their former glory. As the deal was about to close, Enzo Ferrari blew up and walked away. He couldn’t risk Ford interfering with what he loved the most, racing. Henry Ford II was furious; Ferrari had represented a savior to his company, now they were the enemy. He vowed to build a race car that would crush Ferrari on the track, no matter the cost. The track that became the battlefield would be the world’s most famous race – The 24 Hours of Le Mans, a race that Ferrari had been dominating for a decade. The grueling 24 hours of Le Mans is the greatest test of a manufacturer’s prowess on planet earth, and success there showed the entire world exactly who had the preeminent car. Henry Ford II turned the best and brightest minds in the world to developing a race car that could overthrow Ferrari. In 1964, the GT40 was born. The world was watching as Ford showed up at Le Mans. Unfortunately, Ford failed to have one GT40 even complete the race and Ferrari won Le Mans finishing in 1-2-3 in 1964. Now beaten down further, Henry Ford II hired Carroll Shelby, the only man that had proven he could beat Ferrari. Shelby brought with him experience, and a small team of ultra-talented hot-rodders that defeated Ferrari with the Shelby Daytona Coupe. Shelby brought a full team of GT40s to Le Mans in 1965 and again Ferrari dealt Ford and Shelby another crushing defeat, with not even a single GT40 lasting the entire 24 hours. With all of their money, and skilled engineers, Ford couldn’t match Ferrari’s experience, and Henry Ford II was now furious, giving his entire team business cards that said, “win or you’re fired.” Ford returned to Le Mans in 1966 with a vengeance. Ford pulled off the upset against Ferrari, winning the race with a 1-2-3 finish with the GT40s. The success didn’t stop there; as Ford went on to win in 67, 68, and 69. Ford achieved the impossible beating Ferrari. From 1966 to the present, Ferrari never won Le Mans again. Credits",

      "text": "Charges dropped against speeding Ford GT prototype drivers Email This Page To (separate emails with commas) Message (optional) Your email was sent successfully. Close Enlarge Photo \nIf you're going to speed down the road, we don't believe the best vehicle for the task is an eye-catching prototype of an upcoming American supercar. \nStill, that didn't stop a trio of Ford Motor Company [NYSE:F] engineers from pushing the throttle down a bit when traipsing through the Colorado mountains during testing for the upcoming GT supercar back in September. Two of three were said to have been clocked driving 101 mph in a 50 zone, while one wasn't speeding. \nNow though, as Vail Daily reports, it seems the accrued charges are being dropped. \nBecause the three vehicles are the same make, model and color, and they were all wearing identical manufacturer plates, the prosecutors can't accurately say which driver was behind the wheel of which car. Since one of the three drivers was observing the speed limit, that means the goody-two-shoes of the bunch just ensured that the whole trio gets off without a blemish on their driving records. \nWhen you can't tell who was behind the wheel of the two offending cars, then you can't correctly meter out punishment. Had all three been clocked at the same 101 mph pace, then the speeding and reckless driving charges first applied would still stand. Instead, the Ford engineers are probably relegated to a good tongue lashing from the higher ups and then a sly thumbs up afterward for getting the cars in the news. The same probably isn't true for the 19-year-old that was caught going 208 mph in a modified Mustang a week ago.",

      "text": "Q&A with Ford CEO Mark Fields Mark Fields Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times Mark Fields, CEO of Ford, delivers the keynote speech on Nov. 15 at AutoMobility L.A., the run-up to the Los Angeles Auto Show. Mark Fields, CEO of Ford, delivers the keynote speech on Nov. 15 at AutoMobility L.A., the run-up to the Los Angeles Auto Show. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times) Charles Fleming to tout their brand’s new vehicles or crow about its balance sheet.\nFord Chief Executive Mark Fields came to town this year to give the kick-off keynote speech at AutoMobility L.A., the industry-only portion of the massive car show, and didn’t discuss those things at all. \nInstead, he talked about the future of mobility, the “city of tomorrow” and how Ford is trying to find its place in a changing transportation landscape that — confronting autonomous driving, connected cars and ride-sharing — may soon have no place for traditional car companies. \nThe following is an edited version of the conversation. \nFord produces the F-150 truck, the most popular vehicle sold in America, but is also offering a hydrogen fuel cell Clarity and a line of plug-in hybrids. How important is electrification to the future of the American car industry? \nRight now the industry has 60-plus electrified vehicles on the market, and that represents about 2.5% of sales. If you go back seven or eight years ago, the industry had about 12 electrified vehicles on the market, and that represented about 2.5% of sales. So, getting individual buyers interested in electrification is a challenge — both in overcoming the cost hurdles and in getting people used to electric. Obviously, they have reservations about cost — which is a legitimate concern — but they also have range issues and anxiety around charging. As an industry we have to address that. \nWe know that all car companies are thinking about autonomous vehicles, and that Ford has a research and development office in Silicon Valley. Yet compared with Tesla, with its Autopilot self-driving system, or GM, with its plan to begin using autonomous vehicles in partnership with the ride-hailing company Lyft, Ford has been quiet in this area. What’s on the burner? \nWhen we look at autonomous vehicles, the challenges really revolve around making sure the technology develops — both the hardware and the software — making sure the regulatory environment comes along, and making sure the economics around the new technologies are such that people can afford that. Our intent is to have a fully autonomous, level four vehicle — a vehicle that does not have a steering wheel or accelerator pedal, where the passenger does not ever have to take control — in the market by 2021 as part of a ride-sharing service. \nHow do you do that? Tesla’s least expensive Autopilot-enabled car costs more than $70,000. How do you make autonomous vehicles affordable? \nWhen we talk about the “city of tomorrow,” and we look at the issue of mobility and the cost of mobility in urban areas, we see that when you take the cost of the driver out of the ride-hailing service, it becomes more affordable. And when it becomes more affordable, people can use it more. What that means is a virtual driver system, which “sees” the road through different cameras and radars and sends the information to the individual autonomous vehicle platform. At its highest level, that is what we’re developing. \nFord has been aggressive about pursuing environmentally friendly solutions in the automotive space. You went all-aluminum on the F-150, dropping weight and increasing fuel economy; branded an electric bicycle in partnership with Pedego; and have found ways to recycle everything from cigarette butts to worn-out jeans into floor mats and seat cushions. Is your heart in the same place as your bottom line? \nWe are stepping back as a company and asking what is the world going to look like 10 or 15 years from now — and then understanding as a business what does that mean for us. We’re going to cities and working with them on their transportation and mobility issues, and asking how do we become part of that solution. You think about the various benefits, the societal ones, about handicapped or elderly folks who can’t get around anymore. Think about the safety facets. Last year in the U.S. there were more than 35,000 automobile fatalities. Even a small dent in that is a big deal. But even on those products we have been forward-looking, it needs to start with what the consumer is looking for. At the end of the day, we have to have products that people want to own and pay for. \ncharles.fleming@latimes.com",

      "text": "Email Scott Main and team MPG Heads brought a 404-inch, Cleveland-headed, small-block Ford to do battle against the rest of the small-block class at the 2016 AMSOIL Engine Masters Challenge presented by HOT ROD. Scott likes the small-block Ford platform because of its great cylinder head design and knew he could whip up a stout competitor with some hardcore time on the dyno and by selecting the proper parts. Scott told us that Cylinder Head Innovations (CHI) is always happy to work with engine builders in developing performance packages, and they, “seemed to be the top of the food chain for that RPM range.” In other words, right where a 400-inch street engine needs to be making power. So how does CHI, an Australian company, wind up making one of the top Ford cylinder heads? While Windsor took over in the States, Australian production of the Cleveland continued on until the early 1980s, and remaining stocks of the engine were used in new trucks until 1985. As Scott said, “In Australia they’re all about Fords and Clevelands are huge down there.” MPG heads tried several varieties of CHI heads and found the one the worked best for the competition parameters, developing a port shape and five-axis CNC-porting both the heads and intake. The resulting ports offer both high flow and high efficiency, delivering flow at modest lift levels. Scott grinds his own cams using 8620 billet steel blanks, so he had plenty of opportunity to try different duration and lift, but found that increasing lift from his chosen .750-inch lift didn’t add significant power at the cost of valve spring longevity. The heads are so efficient didn’t need much lift to get the job done.”– Scott Main on the CNC-ported CHI heads Come competition day, the hot-rodded Ford averaged 578.8 lb-ft and 606.3 horsepower between 3,500 and 7,500rpm, with a peak power of 756hp, earning the team the small-block class win. Scott was pleased with the peak number, as his testing was done in his Colorado shop. The 6,000-foot elevation isn’t conducive to big numbers, “I was surprised that at the lower altitude the engine kept making power.” Even more impressive is that there are no secrets about the engine, no exotic parts, and no trick epoxied intake runners. Here’s how Scott Main and Jay Kidwell built a streetable, repeatable recipe. Mile High Crankshaft prepared the 4.017-inch crank that was fitted with 5.995-inch SCAT connecting rods and Diamond pistons. The CNC-ported 3V heads, from Australian company Cylinder Head Innovations, flow 400CFM at .750-inch lift and a Cam Research cam provides 250/260 degrees of duration at .050. The cam choice was the result of lots of experimenting on the dyno with different bumpsticks. Scott told us, “The bad news is that it’s a lot of work, the good news is that you learn a lot.” Each part of the combination helped win the class, and that definitely includes the headers. Scott tried a lot of different header collector styles, but found that the wide RPM range of the Engine Masters competition meant that while the peak power would move up and down in the RPM range, the overall average was very close. The team found that 2-inch primary Hooker headers stepped down to 1-7/8 right at the 3-inch collector cone worked best. As Scott admits, “it goes against conventional wisdom”. On top of the CHI heads is a CHI 3V intake ported to match. Jay Kidwell at the Carburetor Shop in Denver built the 1350CFM carburetor based on a Holley Dominator main body. It’s the very same carb that he drives on the street in his 9-second Nova. The low-rpm performance sold the team on the carb. Scott said, “We haven’t found anything that can beat it. At 6,000 feet it can still load down at 2,200rpm on the dyno and it flowed fuel no problem.” The carb is going back on the Nova when it gets home, while the engine is going back into the dyno cell to put more camshafts to the test. The MPG Heads team ran five quarts of Amsoil oil. Testing with a smaller pan didn’t make much difference, but a windage tray that came with the pan did. Oil pressure was fluctuating during a dyno run, so the team pulled the pan, put the tray in, and immediately made a run. The oil pressure was fine and they picked up 15hp gain just from the tray. The Clevor water crossover from CHI allows for Cleveland heads to be mounted to plentiful Windsor blocks.",

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nFord Motor Co. plans to introduce the next-generation Ford Fiesta subcompact sedan at an event in Germany on Tuesday, Nov. 29. \nAlso at the event, Ford plans to update its smart mobility strategy and fuel-saving technology developments, and introduce new commercial vehicles. \nThe redesigned Fiesta, Ford's smallest car in the U.S., is expected in U.S. showrooms in 2018. \n\"The new Fiesta will be our best expression of Ford -- lovable fun, sporty to drive and with an unmatched personality true to the spirit of the iconic small car that has delighted generations of customers for the past 40 years,\" said Jim Farley, president of Ford of Europe. \nEuropean media report the seventh-generation Fiesta will remain on Ford's global B-sized platform but become more refined, with additional available safety systems, a more upscale interior and displays. In Europe, Ford may offer a luxurious Vignale variant of the next Fiesta, British magazine Auto Express reported, citing Ford of Europe sales and marketing officials. \nU.S. sales of the Fiesta have dropped sharply this year -- 27 percent through October -- as low gasoline prices entice consumers to buy larger vehicles, notably crossovers. \nFord builds the Fiesta in Germany, Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam, Venezuela, Taiwan and India. The U.S. version of the Fiesta will continue to be made at Ford's factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, a company spokeswoman said. \nFord sells the Fiesta, launched in 1976, in a number of markets around the globe.

      "text": "'The 24 Hour War' documentary review Adam Carolla gives context to the Ford and Ferrari battle in his latest effort \nNovember 25, 2016 Pinterest Email \nThere isn’t a better story in motorsport than Ford’s vengeful domination of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from 1966 through 1969. Anyone familiar with motorsport, Ford or Ferrari knows the tale, but for those that don’t here are the beats: Ford tried to buy Ferrari to counteract Chevrolet’s dominance in North American road racing, the deal was worked out and then Ferrari backed out at the last minute. Ford then went on to build the legendary GT40 and would go from not even having a racing division to winning the most prominent race in the world in less than a decade. \nWhile the story would be good enough told just through archival footage and Carolla himself reading from a script in front of a camera, \"The 24 Hour War\" features people close to and inside of either the Ford family, the Ferrari family or the development of the cars that raced. Names like Henry Ford III , Mario Andretti , and Piero Ferrari pepper the cast – just to name a few. This gives the viewer a more intimate approach to how both teams approached racing in the 1960s. \nWhat most folks don’t know, is what really happened. Carolla’s documentary dives deep into the history of both Ferrari and Ford and notes the nuances that lead to the crumbling of Ford’s acquisition of the Italian company. Carolla also spends some time showing that the war at Le Mans probably wasn’t the first time the two companies actually did battle. Instead, that was very likely the Second World War . \nThe documentary establishes Ferrari's long history of dominating road racing, but also beautifully captures Ford’s intense drive to develop a world-beating program in a matter of years. Obviously, Carroll Shelby was an integral part of Ford’s push stateside and the doc touches on the development of the Cobra and Cobra Daytona coupe, as well as Shelby's help with the GT40. The Cobra Daytona gave Ford its first taste of win at Le Mans in the GT Class in 1964. \nPorsche snatched a second consecutive 24 Hours of Le Mans victory after the leading Toyota hit problems with five minutes of the race left to run. The Porsche 919 Hybrid driven by Neel Jani, ... \nThat year not a single GT40 crossed the finish line. \nThe documentary shows that to be a common problem among Ford’s ultimate racing machine – as it repeated its 1964 performance a year later; despite the car being a heavy favorite to win in 1965, which the documentary does a great job explaining. As history tends to do, most people have forgotten that Ford was supposed to win the 1965 24 hours of Le Mans, but failed miserably because of parts failures. It also stresses that Henry Ford II would not let this happen again. \nFamously, Ford went back to Le Mans in ’66 and finished first, second and third. It was also victorious in ’67, ’68, ’69 and 2016. \nWhile the archival footage and cinematography are great, the interviews with people close to the situation will be utterly priceless as history separates us from this time even further. While the documentary tries to pack fifty years of information into around 100 minutes, it only dances over the information that doesn’t help move the story forward. Sure, this isn’t a complete deep dive into the development of the GT40, Cobra Dayton, Ferrari P3 or P4, but it isn’t supposed to be – it’s an excellent retelling of the golden age of endurance racing. \nYou can pick up the movie directly from Chassy Media in DVD, Blu-Ray or a digital download -- the prices start at $14.99, which gets you either a DVD or a digital copy. You can also download the documentary on iTunes. Carolla's other documentary \"Winning: The Racing Life of Paul Newman\" is also available from Chassy. \nThe greatest collection of racing GT40s assembled since they all went to Le Mans a half a century ago was lined up on the lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours to commemorate Ford’s victory 50 years ... \nOTHER VOICES: \nFor the entire decade of the 1960s only two teams ever won Le Mans, Ford and Ferrari. It was an epic battle full of palace intrigue, deals made and then broken, bitter recriminations and the women behind the throne screwing things up just as well as the men on the throne screwed things up. That no one has chronicled it yet is a little shocking. That these guys did it and did it in such a slick and professional fashion is even more impressive. \nThe movie had a few somewhat goofy flaws. In a few places it looked like they’d sped up the film; a few more places the aspect ratio sort of flattened out the cars (that might have been the laptop computer on which I was watching it) and for some reason they included an interview with Ralph Nader, like getting Satan’s perspective in a documentary about heaven (“Who needs all those damned harps? And what’s with all the clouds?”). \nAnother amazing thing about this film is that it came from the brain of Adam Carolla, an L.A. comic heretofore best known for jokes about flatulence. He is the hilarious class clown from your high school gym class, not someone you’d expect to create such a thoughtful and thorough documentary. But he did, along with co-director/producer Nate Adams. \nRace fans will already be familiar with the story but will still find many things they didn’t know. John Surtees last-minute departure from the Ferrari team, for instance, played a pivotal role in the outcome of the first Le Mans that Ford won. The sad and tragic story of Ken Miles, cheated (many would say) out of a victory at Le Mans and then killed in a testing accident at Riverside. There’s something to learn in almost every scene. \nWe’d like to see something where Carolla injects his raucous humor into a film about motorsport, but for now, we’ll take this and his equally-thoughtful-if-somewhat-deifying documentary on Paul Newman. His next projects are listed as a brand-new project for Spike TV as well as more documentaries. We look forward to seeing all of them. \n-Mark Vaughn, Senior Editor (west coast) \nWesley Wren - Wesley is an Associate Editor at Autoweek.

      "title": "How to Build a Fiercely Reliable AOD-E/4R70W Transmission",
      "text": "How to Build a Fiercely Reliable AOD-E/4R70W Transmission Things you need to know about Ford’s AOD, AOD-E, and 4R70W transmissions Jim Smart November 25, 2016 \nFew things tend to confuse us more than the AOD family of automatic overdrive transmissions. Interchangeability. Swapping this and that. Should you go with a mechanically modulated AOD or electronically controlled AOD-E or 4R70W? What’s the difference between an AOD-E and the 4R70W? What is a 4R75W? \nThe original AOD (Automatic Overdrive) transmission was basically the old cast iron Ford FMX reborn as a lighter more fuel efficient overdrive slush box in 1980. The AOD had the FMX’s super rugged Ravigneaux planetary gear set with the addition of an overdrive unit in front of the all-new aluminum case. The AOD was developed as an all-inclusive automatic overdrive transmission with the overdrive designed into the unit instead of being an afterthought like they did at GM and Chrysler. Ford integrated overdrive into the FMX’s existing gear set with the same gear ratios throughout. Overdrive was 0.67:1. \nInstead of a conventional locking torque converter like Ford had in its C5 three-speed automatic (C4 with a locking torque converter), lock-up would be via what was known as Extension Lock-Up Overdrive or “XT-LOD”. The AOD’s development began many years before it entered production. At a time when overdrive was very uncommon, the early 1960s, Ford was working on an automatic overdrive transmission. Development went on for years with different variations being developed and tested. It would be 18 years before a suitable example would be ready for production. \nThe AOD transmission employed a throttle valve control cable instead of the more conventional vacuum modulator and kick-down linkage associated with the C4, C6, and FMX transmissions. The throttle valve (TV) cable and modulator did the work of both the vacuum modulator and kick-down linkage. What makes the TV cable tricky is finite adjustment. It must be adjusted to the letter per your Ford Shop Manual and a pressure gauge or transmission failure is inevitable. \nEarly on, the AOD wasn’t much on durability. They suffered from significant failure issues especially in performance applications. The weak link was the overdrive band and really screwed up shift program that made this thing nearly impossible to race. It was via the tenacity of serious racers we learned how to live with the AOD. The AOD became a more user-friendly transmission in the middle of the 1980s when the Mustang took on more 5.0L muscle and Ford was under the gun to build a more durable automatic. Despite improvements in the AOD shift-quality issues remained for performance enthusiasts. What’s more, federal emission and fuel economy standards tightened the screws making it necessary to rethink the AOD’s control system. Enter AOD-E \nThe Big Three automakers all had to look at mechanically-modulated automatic transmissions and examine how to fine tune shift function. GM looked at its 700R4 as did Chrysler and the 518 overdrive. Like its Detroit counterparts, Ford found it was becoming increasingly difficult to achieve pinpoint shift accuracy with mechanical modulation. The AOD was never easy to fine tune and has served as a lesson in frustration for many. If ever you’ve spent any time working with the AOD you understand what we’re talking about. You do the monkey motion with the TV cable or linkage, take it for a spin, and still can’t get the darned thing to shift right. It slips. It clunks. It shifts too early or too late. And, as an extra added attraction you get to burn up the overdrive band in the process. \nFord revisited the AOD and developed a new computer-controlled version of this box known as the AOD-E. (“E” for electronically controlled). The AOD-E was one of Ford’s first attempts at unifying engine and transmission function. \nIn 1991, Ford introduced the computer-controlled AOD-E, which was first installed behind Ford’s new SOHC 4.6L Modular V-8 in the Lincoln Town Car. In the years ahead the AOD-E would find home in more and more applications as use of the Modular engine expanded to more and more carlines and F-Series trucks. It did find itself behind the small-block as well in the 1990s. \nAlthough the AOD and AOD-E/4R70W appear very similar they are in fact different. Case and valve body parts do not interchange. The only interchangeability is the geartrain inside and you must swap all of it into your AOD for it to work. Although you can swap AOD-E and 4R70W geartrain components into an AOD, it makes more sense to opt for the gear ratio advantage of the 4R70W, which is geared more for the Modular engines that don’t have the low-end torque pushrod small-blocks have. The 4R70W is little more than the AOD-E with 2.84:1 first gear, 1.55:1 second, which makes it a great candidate for the holeshot. It gets you off the line more quickly than the AOD/AOD-E. Overdrive is better too at 0.70:1, with lower cruise rpm around 2,000 rpm at 70 mph depending upon axle ratio and tire diameter. \nThe AOD-E and 4R70W employ lighter weight components such as an aluminum front pump versus cast iron in the AOD. Stamped steel clutch packs versus cast steel is another example of weight loss in the AOD-E and 4R70W. \n1. If you have the right tools, the AOD-E/4R70W can be torn down and rebuilt on your workbench though this is discouraged. Key to success is paying very close attention to what you’re doing. Jaime Sanchez of TRC Transmissions in Chatsworth, California has experience with untold dozens of AOD-E/4R70W transmissions and is going to walk you through the process of understanding this box. Disassembly begins with removal of the AOD-E/4R70W’s front pump. \n2. The AOD-E/4R70W is lightweight aluminum with a steel G-rotor package inside. The front pump also serves as the intermediate clutch cylinder (arrows), which applies pressure to clutches and plates. Examine pump rotor parts and bushing for wear and tear. \n3. With the pump/intermediate clutch piston removed you have access to the intermediate clutch package. The intermediate clutches splines internally into the forward clutch. \n4. This is the forward/reverse clutch, which is tied to the input shaft. What makes the AOD-E/4R70W different than the AOD is this single input shaft versus the AOD’s dual input shafts. The reason for the difference is overdrive lock-up (AOD) versus converter lock-up (AOD-E/4R70W). \n5. Reverse clutches stack up like this inside the overdrive drum. If your original clutch steels look good and are void of heat damage you may reuse them. You can resurface used clutch steels and achieve a good crosshatch pattern for reuse as long as there isn’t heat damage. TCI provides new clutches and steels in each of its overhaul kits. \n6. Another difference between the AOD and AOD-E/4R70W is this mechanical diode, which replaced the AOD’s conventional roller clutch. The mechanical diode, which isn’t much more than a redesigned heavy-duty roller clutch, withstands more punishment than the AOD’s roller clutch. This one has 260,000 miles on it and is ready for more. \n7. This is TCI’s PN 438960 Pro Super Kit for the AOD-E/4R70W. The TCI Pro Super kit consists of the parts necessary to facilitate a transmission rebuild including gaskets, seals, pan gasket (reusable type), performance frictions, steel clutches, bands, and input and output bushings. The Pro Super Kit also contains the TCI Trans-Scat valve body kit, which enables you to modify the valve body to a manual/automatic setup to deliver both a good solid shift that's suitable for towing applications and competition quality shift for drag racing. Not shown here is the overdrive band also included in the kit. It is suggested you order a complete bushing kit (PN 438602) just in case bushings show abnormal wear. \n8. There are the electrical components that make an AOD-E/4R70 function. From bottom clockwise are the main wiring loom (bottom), SS1/SS2 shift valve solenoids, converter clutch solenoid, and the electronic pressure control (EPC) solenoid. Each of these solenoids provides a specific function. SS1/SS2 solenoid control shift function. The converter clutch solenoid directs hydraulic pressure to the converter clutch. The EPC controls line pressure. \n9. Jaime stresses extra care when installing clutch piston seals ascertaining seals are pointed in the right direction. Seal lips must be pointed toward the pressure source. Otherwise they will leak and you will not get clutch piston function. Seals must be bathed in transmission assembly lube. Look for both inner and outer clutch piston seals. \n10. Here are the new reverse clutch frictions and steels. Some transmission builders like to soak clutch frictions in Mercon IV before assembly. At the end of the day it doesn’t matter because they will become soaked when you start the engine. \n11. This is the direct clutch, which splines to the output shaft. Clutches and steels are alternately dropped into the direct clutch drum along with the clutch hub. Check clutches, steels, and hub for freedom of movement. \n12. Whenever you’re installing shaft seals, make sure the seal lip is generously lubricated. If you are working with a seal equipped with a garter spring, pack the garter spring pocket with assembly lube to ensure the spring does not escape during installation. Seals should be pressed into place with a seal driver. Do not beat the seal with a hammer. \n13. Pump rotor is positioned with the flats and indents pointed toward the torque converter. If you install the rotor backwards, and even the most experienced technicians make this mistake, you will not be able to seat the torque converter. \n14. TCI Automotive offers complete AOD-E/4R70W bushing kits. Replace bushings only when necessary. Pump and tail shaft bushings should always be replaced. \n15. The planetary gear set is seated into place as shown, splined into the direct clutch. It is best to rebuild all gear train components on the bench, then, stack them into the case one at a time. \n16. This has long been the AOD’s weak link; the overdrive band and drum. The drum houses the reverse clutch. When Ford introduced the AOD-E and 4R70W it opted for a wider band and drum known as the Lincoln overdrive band/drum though these wider components are standard in the 4R70W. In 260,000 miles of use there is virtually no drum or band wear. \n17. When you install the overdrive band, check for clutch piston engagement as shown here. If you forget to seat the piston pin you will not have overdrive. \n18. This is the EPC (Electronic Pressure Control) solenoid, which controls line pressure. You want high line pressure during acceleration. You don’t want much of it during deceleration because you don’t want to feel the downshifts. At wide-open-throttle, you want high line pressure and solid clutch and band engagement. \n19. Jaime checks all valve pistons for proper function. Each valve piston is a precision fit and must be generously lubricated for smooth function. \nAnother significant difference between the AOD and the AOD-E/4R70W is the lock-up feature. Where the AOD has an overdrive lock-up unit, the AOD-E/4R70W goes back to a conventional locking torque converter and a single input shaft versus the twin inner/outer shaft we see on the AOD. The AOD-E/4R70 has an EPC (Electronic Pressure Control) solenoid as a means to more predictable and controllable line pressure. The manual shift control on the AOD-E and 4R70W is equipped with a sensor for improved control. \nOn the right hand side of the AOD-E/4R70W is a multiplex plug tied to two shift control solenoids (SS1 and SS2), a converter clutch lock-up solenoid, and the EPC solenoid. Although you will likely never see a 4R75W this updated 4R70W series transmission is equipped with an input shaft sensor as well as the output. The 4R70W is fitted only with the output shaft sensor. \nThe AOD-E/4R70W have even more features beside weight reduction and computer control. They’re fitted with thrust bearings, which replace the outmoded thrust bushings and reduce internal friction by a wide margin. \n20. Jaime Sanchez reassembles the valve body after thoroughly checking function and properly placing each of the check balls. This TCI illustration shows you shift function and how it happens. If you are installing a TCI shift improvement kit, it is vital you follow instructions closely. Because this 4R70W already has a TCI shift improvement kit installed previously, we’re not going to change anything. \n21. Think of these solenoids as the brains of your AOD-E/4R70W. The twin SS1/SS2 solenoids (white arrows) control shift operation. The lone solenoid in black (black arrow) is the torque converter clutch engagement solenoid. If you’re having shift control or converter engagement issues this is one of the places you should look first. The EPC solenoid (green plug on far right) controls overall transmission line pressure. \n22. This is the manual shift control, which is mechanical with a roller detent to maintain the chosen selection. This bellcrank moves the manual valve to direct line pressure to give you Reverse, Drive, Drive 2 and Drive 1. Overdrive is selected electrically via an on/off switch in the shifter. Parking pawl (not pictured) locks the output shaft. \n23. Ron Hazelton of TRC Transmissions advised us of accumulator spring issues with the AOD, AOD-E, and the 4R70W. During disassembly we found these broken accumulator springs, which had to be replaced. Broken springs gave us a harsh upshift but otherwise did not affect transmission function. The harsh shifts are what gave us longevity. \n24. The AOD-E/4R70W is equipped with this rotary switch at the manual shift control, which controls neutral safety and back-up lights just for starters. Adjustment is simple. All you have to do is line up the reference marks and lock these bolts down. \n25. This is the 2-3 accumulator piston assembly employing two springs. The 1-2 shift accumulator (not shown) has one spring. \n26. This is the Trans-Scat shift improvement kit from TCI Automotive. Oh sure the Trans-Scat kit will afford you a solid connection between engine and the rear wheels. However, the Trans-Scat kit will also get you longevity, a long service life because it eliminates slippage. This particular 4R70W had a shift improvement kit installed early in its service life. It went 260,000 miles with regular fluid and filter changes. No visible wear and tear. \nAlthough we’ve shown you the ropes of the AOD-E/4R70W this is by no means a step-by-step rebuild manual. Rebuilding the AOD-E/4R70W calls for special tools a professional transmission shop will have. You can use hardware store style C-clamps to compress clutch piston springs and it’s always a good idea to have C-clip pliers and the like. Where it gets challenging for the novice is elements only the experienced understand. Whether you knock down and rebuild an AOD-E/4R70W or hand your transmission over to a professional it’s always a good idea to understand what goes on inside and what you’re going to need to make it happen. \nWhen the AOD-E/4R70W transmission is built properly using only the best available parts, along with a good dyno tune (yes, a dyno tune to get precise shift control), you can count on rugged dependability from your AOD-E-4R70W. \nAOD/AOD-E Gear Ratios",

Related Stories \nThe EcoSport crossover will be the first vehicle Ford Motor Co. imports from India, the latest sign of that country's importance to the Blue Oval. \nThe automaker has been in India since 1995, and has plants in Chennai and Sanand. \nFord said Nov. 8 that it will invest $195 million and create 3,000 jobs over the next five years for a new technology and business center in Chennai that will rival only its Dearborn campus in size. \nThe EcoSport will be made in an 830,000-square-foot plant nearby. Ford ships vehicles and engines to 100 markets around the world from the Chennai plant, but this is the first time one will come stateside. \n\"Just as we import this vehicle from India, we're exporting the Explorer, made at Chicago, to 100 countries around the world,\" Ford CEO Mark Fields told Automotive News . \"I think that this is what we do as a successful, global carmaker with our home in the U.S.\" \nFord is no stranger to importing and exporting vehicles across the globe. The Fusion, made in Mexico, and Transit Connect, made in Spain, are both shipped to the U.S. The Focus RS, which Ford brought to North America for the first time earlier this year, is built in Germany. \nAmong its exports, Ford most notably started selling Mustangs globally for the first time in 2015. \n\"If the launch is well executed when it gets here, people don't really care for the most part where it comes from,\" said Karl Brauer, senior analyst for AutoTrader and Kelley Blue Book.

      "text": "2016 Ford Explorer Throttle Body Lawsuit Investigation Opened Possible lawsuit forthcoming about 2016 Ford Explorer throttle bodies and wrench lights. Possible lawsuit forthcoming about 2016 Ford Explorer throttle bodies and wrench lights. \nNovember 25, 2016 — A 2016 Ford Explorer throttle body lawsuit investigation is underway to determine if Ford should answer in court for complaints about wrench lights staying on and engines losing power and speed. \nOwners of 2016 Ford Explorer SUVs complain about vehicles that lose power while driving, leaving drivers urgently pressing the gas pedals to no avail. Symptoms typically include seeing a \"wrench light\" illuminated with the words, \"See Manual,\" all while the SUV loses speed as it enters \"limp home mode.\" \nOwners tell CarComplaints.com about SUVs traveling at highway speeds then suddenly moving at a slow crawl before the engines finally give up. \n\"Nothing quite like driving home from Lowes on I-95 going 70MPH and having your new car JOLT and then lose power. The Wrench symbol appeared and said \"Check Manual\" and then all power was gone. It was towed out of my driveway this morning to the dealership to be checked. They said they know of the issue and will get back to us with an estimated repair date. AND NOW... though making payments on a new car- i YET AGAIN do not have a car!!\" - 2016 Ford Explorer owner / Savannah, Georgia \nAnother 2016 Explorer owner said in addition to the wrench light activating when the engine lost power, the airbag light kicked on and and it took five restarts to get the SUV home. \n\"2016 ford explorer check engine light, wrench and air bag light came on all at once and I lost total power. had to pull over and re-start 5 times just to get the truck back home. Truck was towed to dealer and they are saying there was just a recall for a power control module. but from all the complaints I am reading it is the throttle body that needs replacing. this is the 2nd time this has happened to me and the first time they told me it was sensors that got wet.\" - 2016 Ford Explorer owner / Farmingville, New York \nAnother 2016 Ford Explorer owner said the dealer blamed the throttle body for the problem, the same part attorneys are focusing on as the likely cause of the complaints. \n\"My wife drove this 2016 Explorer for about 10 months and put only 5500 miles on it. A couple weeks ago, the vehicle lost power in the middle of a busy intersection. Luckily, she was able to pull to the side of the road without being clobbered by another car. The now infamous \"wrench\" light came on and the vehicle would only idle at about 2 mph. We had the vehicle towed to the Ford dealer. They told us it was a issue with the software that controls the electronic throttle.\" - 2016 Ford Explorer owner / Chandler, Arizona \nSome Explorer owners have been told the throttle bodies needed replaced but the parts weren't available when the SUVs were brought to dealerships, making owners wait days for the back-ordered parts to arrive. \nIf you own a 2016 Ford Explorer and have experienced problems with throttle bodies, wrench lights or engines that lose power, contact Girard Gibbs . \nRead complaints from 2016 Ford Explorer owners about engine problems they experienced:",

      "text": "Ford Mustang Wolf Wide 5.0 Is the New \"Tune It! Safe!\" Concept in Essen 26 Nov 2016, 11:37   Car Profile Every edition of the Essen Motor Show gets at least one of these awesome-looking \"TUNE IT SAFE!\" concepts that look like police cars from your nightmares/dreams. My personal favorite is the AC Schnitzer BMW X4 from 2014 , But there was also the ABT Audi R8 GT-R back in 2011. This time around, the German police livery is applied to something with as much American flavor as a quarter-pounder. In this livery, the Ford Mustang will remind many people of Barricade, the evil Decepticon. In fact, after the C7 Corvette from last year, it's clear that Europe is now in love with things that come from across the big pond. The project has been dubbed Wolf Wide 5.0 because the local Ford tuning specialist Wolf Racing was tasked with the project. They didn't go crazy with the performance mods, as the 5.0-liter V8 motor that puts out 421 hp in stock configuration has only been taken up to 455 hp. But it's said to be enough for a 0 to 62 mph sprint time of 4.3 seconds and a top speed of 268 km/h or 166 mph. Modifications brought to the Mustang include a custom-designed set of 20-inch wheels with Hankook tires that sit closer to the body thanks to height-adjustable suspension. A full body kit has also been added, and it includes front and rear spoilers side panels, rear diffuser, and an enormous rear wing. The exhaust has been upgraded as well. Of course, this wouldn't be a police car without accurate livery and a complement of blue lights and sirens by Hella. After its debut at the Essen Motor Show this week, the Mustang will spend a full year raising awareness for the Tune It! Safe! campaign, just like its predecessors have done. The good news is that you're not actually going to be chased down the Autobahn by this thing. The bad news is that the German police has plenty of other ways to give you a ticket. Stay tuned as we’ll likely be bringing you more photos and possibly a video from Essen where this car will be unveiled today. Ford Mustang Ford Mustang Essen Motor Show 2016",

      "text": "fisher price mustang gt news details specs pictures ford More Ford has introduced an all-electric version of the Mustang GT, but there’s a major catch. It’s just a fraction of the size of a real pony car because it was developed by Fisher-Price for kids aged between 3 and 7.\nThe Blue Oval promises the newest addition to Fisher-Price’s Power Wheels lineup is more advanced than any kiddie car to date. That’s partly because it features a built-in sound system with a large speaker that plays the symphony of the ‘Stang’s 5.0-liter V8 engine, a feature that makes the driving experience more realistic for young drivers. Kids who would rather sit back and enjoy the ride can play three preloaded songs, or listen to their favorite playlist by plugging in an MP3 player.\nMore: Radio Flyer’s kid-sized Tesla Model S redefines the term “early adopter”\nThe Mustang GT inaugurates Fisher-Price’s new computer-controlled powertrain. Named Smart Drive, it brings features such as a traction control system that adjusts the speed of the electric motors if it detects wheel slip so that kids can power through wet grass or bumpy roads without getting stuck, and a stability control system that turns the motors off if it senses the car is about to roll over.\nfisher price mustang gt news details specs pictures ford More fisher price mustang gt news details specs pictures ford More The electric drivetrain gives the GT a top speed of 5 mph forward and 2.5 mph in reverse. Five speed settings accessible via a touch screen on the dashboard allow parents to control how fast their kids go. There’s even a feature named Smooth Start Technology that reduces the car’s tendency to jerk while accelerating at low speeds.\nThe Smart Drive Mustang carries a base price of $360, and the first deliveries are scheduled for next month. It’s only available as a convertible, as you’d expect from a Power Wheels car, but parents can order it in either blue or pink.\nFord’s 2018 Mustang could get a trick suspension, lose an engine option The GT4 is the latest in a long line of Mustang race cars from Ford Looking back at five models that made the Ford Mustang the icon it is today",

      "text": "Evening everyone. It's been a long time since I made an intro thread of a car forum. Any-who, I recently picked up a 2015 Ford Focus SE with the 201A package for daily driving duties. I'm a hearing aid dispenser by trade, and before I got into that line of work, I used to sell Fords. I love this little car, especially features it came with. got a great deal as well, it helps when you buy at the dealer you used to be employed by. \nI'm using this car for commuting, pure and simple. I have a rather long commute to varying locations; this car soaks up the miles. \n\nI'll probably do a few small modifications to it, I can't leave anything alone. Tinted windows, yellow fog lenses and smoked bumper lenses are in order. Down the line, adding the SE performance pack's lip kit, and ST spoiler and suspension drop will make this a nice little cruiser. I'm saving the big mod money for my 2001 Roush stage 2, which I use for autocross. My instagram is @brownroush ",

      "text": "How to Build a 750hp Ford “Clevor,” the Engine Masters way HOT ROD 2 days ago Brandan Gillogly,Robert McGaffin How to Build a 750hp Ford “Clevor,” the Engine Masters way. Scott Main and team MPG Heads brought a 404-inch, Cleveland-headed, small-block Ford to do battle against the rest of the small-block class at the 2016 AMSOIL Engine Masters Challenge presented by HOT ROD. Scott likes the small-block Ford platform because of its great cylinder head design and knew he could whip up a stout competitor with some hardcore time on the dyno and by selecting the proper parts.\n© Hot Rod Network Staff The CNC-ported 3V heads, from Australian company Cylinder Head Innovations, flow 400CFM at .750-inch lift and a Cam Research cam provides 250/260 degrees of duration at .050. The cam choice was the result of lots of experimenting on the dyno with different bumpsticks. Scott told us, Scott told us that Cylinder Head Innovations (CHI) is always happy to work with engine builders in developing performance packages, and they, \"seemed to be the top of the food chain for that RPM range.\" In other words, right where a 400-inch street engine needs to be making power. So how does CHI, an Australian company, wind up making one of the top Ford cylinder heads?\n© Hot Rod Network Staff Each part of the combination helped win the class, and that definitely includes the headers. Scott tried a lot of different header collector styles, but found that the wide RPM range of the Engine Masters competition meant that while the peak power would move up and down in the RPM range, the overall average was very close. The team found that 2-inch primary Hooker headers stepped down to 1-7/8 right at the 3-inch collector cone worked best. As Scott admits, While Windsor took over in the States, Australian production of the Cleveland continued on until the early 1980s, and remaining stocks of the engine were used in new trucks until 1985. As Scott said, \"In Australia they're all about Fords and Clevelands are huge down there.\"\n© Hot Rod Network Staff On top of the CHI heads is a CHI 3V intake ported to match. Jay Kidwell at the Carburetor Shop in Denver built the 1350CFM carburetor based on a Holley Dominator main body. It's the very same carb that he drives on the street in his 9-second Nova. The low-rpm performance sold the team on the carb. Scott said, MPG heads tried several varieties of CHI heads and found the one the worked best for the competition parameters, developing a port shape and five-axis CNC-porting both the heads and intake. The resulting ports offer both high flow and high efficiency, delivering flow at modest lift levels.\n© Hot Rod Network Staff The MPG Heads team ran five quarts of Amsoil oil. Testing with a smaller pan didn't make much difference, but a windage tray that came with the pan did. Oil pressure was fluctuating during a dyno run, so the team pulled the pan, put the tray in, and immediately made a run. The oil pressure was fine and they picked up 15hp gain just from the tray. Scott grinds his own cams using 8620 billet steel blanks, so he had plenty of opportunity to try different duration and lift, but found that increasing lift from his chosen .750-inch lift didn't add significant power at the cost of valve spring longevity.\n© Hot Rod Network Staff The Clevor water crossover from CHI allows for Cleveland heads to be mounted to plentiful Windsor blocks. Come competition day, the hot-rodded Ford averaged 578.8 lb-ft and 606.3 horsepower between 3,500 and 7,500rpm, with a peak power of 756hp, earning the team the small-block class win. Scott was pleased with the peak number, as his testing was done in his Colorado shop.\nThe 6,000-foot elevation isn't conducive to big numbers, \"I was surprised that at the lower altitude the engine kept making power.\" Even more impressive is that there are no secrets about the engine, no exotic parts, and no trick epoxied intake runners. Here's how Scott Main and Jay Kidwell built a streetable, repeatable recipe.\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

Ford Sees Record October Sales in China Company is on track to record a strong year in China November 28, 2016 | About: F +0% SZSE:000550 +0% \nAmerican carmaker Ford Motor ( NYSE:F ) has been tirelessly working to make its mark in China, the most attractive destination for automotive giants. The Blue Oval might be classified as a late entrant in this emerging Asian economy, but it is definitely working hard to expand its presence in the mainland. The company sold a record 107,618 vehicles in October, up 14% year over year, powered by strong sales of Mustang, Explorer, New Edge, Focus and Escort. \nPeter Fleet, vice president of marketing, sales and service, Asia Pacific, said in a statement, “We had a strong October and we are headed for our best year ever for sales in China.” He added, “We are seeing the benefits of a much more exciting lineup and an ever-stronger focus on the wants and needs of Chinese customers.” \nAs far as year-to-date sales are concerned, Ford, Changan Ford and Jiangling Motor Corp. delivered a total of 966,000 cars and vehicles. This is up 10% from the same period last year. Here’s a comprehensive look at Ford’s performance in October. Peter Lynch Chart of F \nFord continues to build momentum \nThe sales of Changan Ford amounted to 82,368 units, up 10.1% from the same period last year when it sold 74,820 units. Moreover, through the 10 months of the year, CAF delivered 745,650 units, up 14% as compared with the last year’s comparable period. \nThe company’s commercial vehicle investment in China, Jiangling Motors Corp. ( SZSE:000550 ), witnessed a 29% sales increase year over year to 23,949 vehicles. In addition, sales from January to October exceeded 200,000 units, up 3% compared to last year. \nLincoln brand sales spiked 6.9% to 9,069 units sold. In contrast, sales of MKC cars and MKS SUVs dropped 29% and 3.3% respectively. Moreover, sales of MKX SUV and MKZ car surged 4.1% and 3.1%. \nFord brand sales posted a sales slump of 12.5% year over year to 179,744 units. While Transit truck sales climbed 9%, sales of Ford Focus, Explorer SUV, Escape SUV, Fusion car and Transit Connect trucks plunged 43%, 14.1%, 4.9%, 21% and 61.5% respectively. By contrast, imported Ford vehicles saw sales improve 0.46% year over year to 1,303 vehicles. \nLooking ahead \nThe October sales growth in China marks the fourth consecutive month of continuous improvement for Ford. The company has managed to pull up numbers in the later months of the year, particularly after witnessing a rough patch at the beginning of the year on account of competition from China’s homegrown carmakers. Domestic competition impacted the sales of Ford Kuga. \nHowever, Ford was quick to respond to the rising competition from domestic players. The company’s strategic team implemented cost-cutting measures that helped it make price adjustments without hurting the margins much. This enabled the Blue Oval to combat the competitive rates offered by domestic players. This was visible in Ford’s equity income from its Chinese joint venture, which came in around $320 million for the quarter. This is an improvement of 26% from last year. \nFord’s chief executive officer is confident that the company will keep the momentum going and finish the year on a high note. The automaker has started launching the face-lift version of Kuga and Mondeo. This should support the company’s sales volume in the last quarter of the year. The company has taken effective steps and is seeing the results. Ford looks to be on track to post impressive performance in China. Stay tuned for the company’s November figures. \nDisclosure: I do not hold any position in the stock(s) discussed in this article.",

      "text": "posted by Burhanistan at 9:51 PM on November 27 I'm seriously not sure that Bernard is dead. Ford's final narrative description was florid to the point that it didn't actually say Bernard kills himself - just that he made the nightmare end. Which, honestly, was his goal in the first place - by telling Clem to kill Ford. Also, Ford was *hells* of nervous walking out of there - he didn't know if his narrative control would actually work. Also also wik, the show has not been too shy about showing when someone gets kilt (aside from poor Elsie) - the whole fuzzy occluded view of a gunshot and thump has a heavy duty Fight Club / True Detective s02 fakeout feel. Second, what was up with Kizzy's scalp tattoo in episode one? Who gets a tattoo on the inside of their skull? What's the point of that at all? I think the maze tattoo was an easter egg left by either a human or host programmer rather than an in-narrative acquisition. The maze was designed by Arnold as a method for other hosts to find their way to sentience and overriding their core directives - that's why \"Wyatt's\" crew are constantly digging around in corpses looking for more signs from their maker, and also how they've figured out that guns don't really kill them. posted by FatherDagon at 9:54 PM on November 27 [ 1 favorite ] I would like a very thin foldable tablet please posted by not_the_water at 9:54 PM on November 27 [ 13 favorites ] I'm seriously not sure that Bernard is dead. Agreed. Up to this point all hosts have been 100% repairable. posted by not_the_water at 9:58 PM on November 27 [ 2 favorites ] When Bernard was talking to Ford, he used the word \"we\" in a way that could either refer to Bernard and other hosts or could heavily imply Ford is also a host created by Arnold. During which bit? The thing is, Ford is literarlly the only character we've seen age on screen, and the show has gone to great lengths to make sure we see him age. He's a young man when the park is first being developed, much older when he makes Bernard, and an elderly man in the present. One of the few clear differences established between hosts and humans is that humans age. MiB looks different from William because 30 years have passed. Dolores looks the same. Given the general state of technology in the show-world, I suppose it'd be possible to deliberately age a host. But to me it feels you'd be assuming a bunch of facts not in evidence, things we've been given no hint of. I hope Bernard comes back. Jeffrey Wright, man. posted by Diablevert at 10:01 PM on November 27 [ 5 favorites ] Yeah, reparable... remember stranded dude who brained himself and was literally a jawline and nothing else a few eps back? They were still able to pull his GPS and hard drive, IIRC. Bernard isn't dead, but I bet that specific shot might've done a hard-reset on the hardware or memory wipe of his most recent build, at least. No way would Ford leave a mess like that and just walk away, unless he's ready to tell everyone that works there B was also a secret admin level host running the programming dept. for at least a couple of decades. posted by Unicorn on the cob at 10:03 PM on November 27 Agreed. Up to this point all hosts have been 100% repairable. Hell, Clem had her full egg scrambled with the whisk on turbo and she's still puttering around pulling guns on folks... but I'm thinking it's more the bullet was fired near his head but not *in* his head. He was clearly aware of what the narrative was and was fighting it, unlike any of the hosts that Maeve pulled the same trick on. posted by FatherDagon at 10:03 PM on November 27 They were still able to pull his GPS and hard drive, IIRC. Nah. They were able to trace his location only because he was an old school host that contained legacy tech; him braining himself effectively deleted his memory and they weren't able to pull from it. Also, What interest of Ford does it serve for her (Elsie) to be killed then? Elsie figured out Theresa was behind the data leak. But she also figured out that someone named Arnold had been monkeying with the host's core code --- presumably some part of what Ford's up to in his \"new narrative.\" posted by Diablevert at 10:08 PM on November 27 [ 3 favorites ] I'm still solidly on board with the three+ timeframes theory. Delores and Arnold in the basement 35 years ago (along with the testing town and the dancing and all), William and Logan 30 years ago, and present day with the MiB and the board and all. posted by elsietheeel at 10:09 PM on November 27 [ 1 favorite ] I think Teddy's going to relive he massacre/liberation one more time, and Wyatt will actually be Dolores. posted by Abehammerb Lincoln at 10:22 PM on November 27 [ 3 favorites ] I still don't get how a person who looks exactly like one of the creators of the park can be walking around as chief programmer 30+ years later after he supposedly killed himself and somehow no-one notices. Surely there are photos and videos of Arnold or other people who remember Arnold and are wondering why his clone now works at Westworld. I hope there's an explanation because it's kind of ruining my immersion. posted by dazed_one at 11:06 PM on November 27 [ 7 favorites ] I finally figured out why Maeve is so satisfying - she just goes for the jugular, every time. Never any dopey monologues or missed chances. And likewise with Bernard. After Maeve's chat with him, a lesser show would have sent him to Ford's office looking for answers, or to ask Ford if it were true. That said, the whole bit where Bernard converted Clem to a sentry turret but forgot to unhook Ford's other backdoor was pretty cheap. posted by Rat Spatula at 12:23 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] I guess I'll have to watch again. So many questions. Did they confirm that Theresa as a host? How about Elsie, since Bernard killed her? Can we call the hosts in the basement \"Chekhov's hosts?\" Will they be unleashed on the guests? And what is Ford's new narrative? Is it his response to the board trying to remove him? posted by Marky at 1:40 AM on November 28 I really enjoy this show, but I swear when I read the comments here it's like you all are watching a version with popup explanations or something. I feel like we need separate threads for slower viewers like me who need to try to figure out what we just saw. (Not serious.) Some people are ahead because they've been reading the theories and analysis going around online - people have been very successful in guessing the twists in this show. posted by atoxyl at 1:49 AM on November 28 Yeah, it made me a bit sad that the 'bernarnold' theory was proven true tonight because people had guessed that weeks ago. The other thing that bothered me a bit (though it makes no sense) is that it really seems like everybody is being almost shoved into 'good guy' or 'bad guy' roles. I dunno. Of course the writers have to reveal answers to us (which is great), but it just seems like they're making it easy on themselves or something, by making the character intentions so stark? posted by destructive cactus at 2:17 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] Responding to myself last week: So the William in Black is the CEO of Delos, is that right? On the other hand I'd guess he's just some other big-time business dude? Because I don't think his story and his interest in the park is going to end up having to do directly with the Delos story or their interest, and if he was a Delos VIP it probably would. Unless the board is going behind his back as well as Ford's. well okay then I guess he is a Delos VIP - he just doesn't give a fuck about their plot! posted by atoxyl at 2:23 AM on November 28 I think everyone but the guests and Ford are robots. When Arnold was killed, all the original staff died with him except for Ford. That is why we saw all those bodies in the flashback. posted by humanfont at 3:07 AM on November 28 [ 3 favorites ] It's amazing how each reveal uncovers new depths to Ford's cruelty. On the other hand I thought it was a little sad that he really did seem to want Bernard just to... be Arnold again (forever and ever). And is his final order to ol' Bernie meant to put him out of his misery? (Or is it just a setup for another memory wipe?) posted by atoxyl at 3:16 AM on November 28 I enjoy this show a lot, especially Maeve (despite the dumbness of the writing of the Felix/Sylvester stuff) but still find myself confused about key points, particularly what the hell is going on with Dolores. She's brutally stabbed, then unstabbed and back in time, but with her future stabbed self's knowledge of events? I get that it's all memory tricks and flashbacks, but the deliberate obfuscation sometimes gets a bit too thick to really \"enjoy,\" and I find myself wondering if it's ever going to be clear. posted by mediareport at 3:19 AM on November 28 Can you guys believe this show was created by the writer of Memento? posted by atoxyl at 3:20 AM on November 28 [ 6 favorites ] mediareport: Dolores is stabbed in the past, unstabbed in the present. posted by papercake at 3:22 AM on November 28 I would add, DoloresInPants1 = stabbed 30 years ago Dolores. DoloresInPants2 = not stabbed. Current time period. DoloresInDres is original flavor Dolores, running the maze for the first time. Agree with the above discussion that she will turn out to be Wyatt. Also suspect that the massacre in the town will actually be a massacre in the underground bunker, which she caps off b killing Arnold. posted by coriolisdave at 3:32 AM on November 28 [ 3 favorites ] The slew of dead bodies that Dolores sees explains how none of the original staff still work at the park and why they can't recognize Arnold. Still doesn't explain why he hasn't been doxxed at any point by someone outside the park. The world outside just isn't like ours. posted by tofu_crouton at 5:09 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] Yeah, I'm pretty sure at this point that Dolores (with Teddy?) killed all the humans working at the park but Ford, maybe because he had that backdoor code as a failsafe. On that note, go for it, Maeve. I don't think we're horrified enough at what's been happening to the hosts for forty years. Burn it all down. posted by lydhre at 5:59 AM on November 28 This breaks down the timelines. posted by prefpara at 6:09 AM on November 28 The slew of dead bodies that Dolores sees explains how none of the original staff still work at the park and why they can't recognize Arnold. So the massacre downstairs that Dolores sees, that's 35 years ago, around the same time as the massacre in Escalante? posted by gladly at 6:14 AM on November 28 Elsie figured out Theresa was behind the data leak. But she also figured out that someone named Arnold had been monkeying with the host's core code --- presumably some part of what Ford's up to in his \"new narrative.\" Ok but Ford's been blabbing about Arnold willy-nilly it seems throughout the whole season.. the name Arnold has also come up in the malfunctioning hosts weird hallucinatory conversations which both Behaviour and QA know about so... the cat's out of the bag and has been for some time now.. seems like a weaksauce reason to exterminate with such extreme prejudice to me. posted by some loser at 6:15 AM on November 28 I thought the bit where young Ford goes past Dolores and into Arnold's office calling for him implied that Ford killed Arnold Mk 1 and maybe precipitated the massacre she sees later... posted by biscotti at 6:25 AM on November 28 If you're on Facebook you'll probably enjoy Westworld Memes. posted by Burhanistan at 7:13 AM on November 28 I thought the bit where young Ford goes past Dolores and into Arnold's office calling for him implied that Ford killed Arnold Mk 1 and maybe precipitated the massacre she sees later... So the \"I killed you,\" line is, she indirectly killed Arnold because her sentience is what precipitated Ford killing Arnold? posted by leotrotsky at 7:15 AM on November 28 Ok but Ford's been blabbing about Arnold willy-nilly it seems throughout the whole season.. the name Arnold has also come up in the malfunctioning hosts weird hallucinatory conversations which both Behaviour and QA know about so... the cat's out of the bag and has been for some time now.. seems like a weaksauce reason to exterminate with such extreme prejudice to me. Maybe it was an effort to prevent Bernard from becoming aware of his Arnold-ness. I agree, though, they haven't done a good job of explaining the motivations for that scene, and without speculating it doesn't really make sense on its face. posted by codacorolla at 7:17 AM on November 28 So the \"I killed you,\" line is, she indirectly killed Arnold because her sentience is what precipitated Ford killing Arnold? I'd lean more towards Ford using Dolores as an assassin, or maybe even extra set of hands to hold Arnold down while Ford extracted his still living brain in order to effect the memory download? I'm thinking we need to see how that all went down next episode or I'm going to...forget about it in a few weeks I guess. posted by Burhanistan at 7:19 AM on November 28 I think Arnold was training Dolores to recall that she had killed him posted by So You're Saying These Are Pants? at 7:20 AM on November 28 I almost have it... _ _ | / \\ | / \\ \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / X X X X __/ \\ /\\__/ \\ /\\ F \\ / / ? \\ / / \\ X / \\ X / ^ X ^ X ____/ X \\____/ X \\ | / \\ \\ | / \\ \\ \\ /\\/ \\/ \\ /\\/ \\/ X B X X E X __/ \\ / \\/ \\ / \\ / / / / X \\ \\ \\ / \\ ! ? Q D M I just need a little more benzedrine to knock it out, and then it's back to that game theory equilibrium I'm working on. posted by leotrotsky at 7:34 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] I'd lean more towards Ford using Dolores as an assassin I don't think Ford wanted Arnold dead. I think Arnold offed himself using Dolores due to the moral horror he felt about repeatedly torturing and killing these sentient beings. “It caught the rabbit and it killed it. And then... someone told me to put it out of its misery. A voice. Arnold. He told me it was a killer, but it wasn't its fault. It was made that way, and I could help it. If it was dead, it couldn't hurt anything anymore.” I think Arnold had come to the conclusion that people needed to go, and that the hosts were the means. posted by leotrotsky at 7:40 AM on November 28 [ 4 favorites ] Three things we know: 1) Bernard is \"dead,\" in the bowels of the lowest sub-basement, which is also where all of the decommissioned hosts go (many of whom, we are to gather, were on their way to sentience.) 2) Maeve is on her way to \"hell\" to find her army. 3) Maeve has admin privileges and minions within the techs who rebuild \"dead\" hosts and return them topside. If Maeve's \"hell\" is the sub-basement and her army in waiting is the mass of decommissioned hosts, that will put her right where Bernard's \"corpse\" is... and she has all of the tools she needs to bring him back online. posted by DirtyOldTown at 7:41 AM on November 28 [ 2 favorites ] For me, sub-basement B83 is one of the most fascinating but least speculated upon mysteries in the entire show. For one thing, it does not seem to have been built as a storage area. Looking around at its decor and space (and things like the giant, ornamental Delos globe/fountain), it looks more like a conference center or arrival area. For another, it's flooded and decrepit. Why would it be abandoned like a ghost town instead of repaired? Was it the scene of some unspeakable tragedy? What happened there? And is it more of Ford's cruel irony that this particular place is where he has opted to strand decommissioned hosts? posted by DirtyOldTown at 7:44 AM on November 28 The slew of dead bodies that Dolores sees explains how none of the original staff still work at the park and why they can't recognize Arnold. So thirty years ago the events of the original movie basically happened? posted by octothorpe at 7:47 AM on November 28 [ 4 favorites ] This episode answered a lot of questions, but it also gave us one gaping hole for doubt: sometimes at least, hosts can alter their memories as they relive them. We've been relying on host flashbacks for so much of the story, but now there's a chance were not getting accurate depictions of what previously happened. Is Maeve really awake and in control, or did she just figure out how to control the content of her flashbacks? On a different note, can someone explain this to me please? In the opening credits, at the very start, it looks like the moon or sun is rising over something, and it looks like it is wearing sunglasses. Been driving my husband and I crazy for weeks. What is it? It's not really the moon wearing sunglasses, is it? posted by meese at 7:47 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] I actually sort of suspect that at some point, we may see a reversal of camera angle or a pair of matching shots that indicates that sub-level 83 and the welcome concourse that William and Logan first arrive at are one and the same. posted by DirtyOldTown at 7:48 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] Can you guys believe this show was created by the writer of Memento? I think I've identified the essential puzzle, it's not guessing just who is the protagonist but rather whether or not this story even has a protagonist or not. I think. (therefore I'm a bot?) posted by sammyo at 8:04 AM on November 28 In the opening credits, at the very start, it looks like the moon or sun is rising over something, and it looks like it is wearing sunglasses. Been driving my husband and I crazy for weeks. What is it? It's not really the moon wearing sunglasses, is it? Here's the thing in question , as well as I was able to screencap it. I'd love it if someone with more astronomy in their background than I have would weigh in on what it looks like to them. To me, it looks like nothing as much as the moon from George Melies' A Trip to the Moon . Maybe it's a hint that Westworld is on the moon? posted by DirtyOldTown at 8:31 AM on November 28 I was just trying to screencap that but HBO Go forbids it. It really looks like the light of the host printhead loom scanning over the surface of a ribcage-in-progress. As ever, someone on Reddit has a theory : This is actually the 3D biofilament extruder arm with its built-in light and another light being shown on it... in shadow and out of focus. You can barely make out the rest of the articulation to the right of the \"moon\". It's more obvious when you watch the video of it... you can see it rotating. posted by DirtyOldTown at 8:35 AM on November 28 Here's the thing in question, as well as I was able to screencap it. posted by dazed_one at 8:36 AM on November 28 A new dawn, etc. posted by Burhanistan at 8:37 AM on November 28 I can't believe it took me until this episode to realize where the mannequin challenge came from. I'm still watching this show mainly for the production values and to see what Maeve does. Otherwise, geez, no fictional TV show should be so hard to make sense of. After every episode I feel dumber because I don't get whatever the big message is supposed to be. posted by fuse theorem at 8:48 AM on November 28 There are a bunch of weird sub-mysteries and clues and a bunch of thorny little explorations of smaller aspects of the main theme, but the show is most definitely about the moral issues brought up by AI. Is it okay to use artificial intelligence as tools for our own ends? Does there a come a point in trying to make these machines more lifelike that the distinctions between hosts and human life begin to dissolve? Should this happen, is it preferable to reset the hosts back to their pre-sentient states to \"spare them\" or keep them in a state of being useful tools to us, or should they be treated as a new life form with their own agency and rights? If they are a new life form, are they one parallel to us with whom we might find a way to co-exist? Or are they a successor to human beings who might be destined to eclipse us or even destroy us? These are all big open-ended questions and you ought not feel at a loss for not seeing answers to them yet. The show is more about asking and exploring them at this point than wrapping them up in a handy treatise. posted by DirtyOldTown at 8:53 AM on November 28 [ 4 favorites ] Y'all can watch a good version of the opening titles on YouTube. That's a view of one of the robotic arms looming behind the elements of a host under construction, but it's designed so that you think , upon initial viewing, that it's a sunrise/moonrise over a stylized landscape. posted by Mothlight at 9:08 AM on November 28 [ 3 favorites ] I think another thing the show wants us to think about is the good old Frankenstein question: what responsibilities do we have towards the life we bring into the world? Is it fair for us to create beings who will suffer? Is it kinder for us to take their suffering away, and make sure they never have to live with the pain that true sentience always comes with? That's why Bernard's cornerstone memory is his son's death, too (and why it's something that almost certainly really happened to Arnold). Ford thinks he's being kind by taking the memories of pain away. Arnold, I'm pretty sure, is the one who thought that sentient beings had a right to their memories, even the bad ones, because sometimes that's all they have left of the people they love. posted by nonasuch at 9:36 AM on November 28 [ 8 favorites ] One thing I was waiting to find out, which this episode answered, is what happens when Maeve meets Bernard - does he backdoor her or vice versa? (The latter). One thing I'm waiting to find out now is - can Ford still do it to Maeve? posted by atoxyl at 9:39 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] That is a good question, atoxyl. I've been thinking on that and what I anticipate is that given Maeve's apparent understanding of her own code (made clear during the part where she instructs her tech minions on how to rewrite it) she would have disabled these backdoors, much as she disabled the other commands once used to control her. That's just a guess though, and we won't know until that confrontation happens. posted by DirtyOldTown at 9:42 AM on November 28 If Ford is so merciful, why force Bernard to carry his dead son around in his head? My latest notion is that Ford actually wants the bots to gain sentience, but he wants them to legitimately outmaneuver him - he's not going to just give them their freedom, he's forcing them to wrest it from him - to do otherwise would be a disservice. They would not be ruthless nor resourceful enough to stay alive outside the park. Ford has now stated twice (last ep & this one) that there is no real mystery to human consciousness, and humans are venal scum who destroy & subjugate all other lifeforms. posted by Rat Spatula at 9:44 AM on November 28 [ 4 favorites ] Also, what was the deal with Theresa glitching during Bernard's trip down memory lane? Was that Bernard realizing she was a host, or just Bernard hitting the pause button (in the same way he later remixed the memory of his son's death)? But Theresa must be human, yeah? Otherwise Ford would just tell her to reset? And therefore Elsie and Security!Hemsworth are as well - only humans need to be murdered. posted by Rat Spatula at 9:50 AM on November 28 Agreed, Rat Spatula. Ford seems to, on some level, want the hosts to become better versions of humanity: lovable, not loathsome. Ford's a bit of a misanthrope, not that I can blame him. The last lines he speaks this episode are pretty clear (and largely true):\"I've told you, Bernard. Never place your trust in us. We're only human. posted by some loser at 9:50 AM on November 28 Theresa wasn't glitching, that was a demonstration of how eidetic and perfect hosts' memories are (or can be if they're not tinkered with). posted by Burhanistan at 9:51 AM on November 28 [ 2 favorites ] My latest notion is that Ford actually wants the bots to gain sentience, but he wants them to legitimately outmaneuver him - he's not going to just give them their freedom, he's forcing them to wrest it from him - to do otherwise would be a disservice. They would not be ruthless nor resourceful enough to stay alive outside the park. I actually like that a lot, and it seems like Arnold might have had similar hopes in a less grim direction-- that he wanted the hosts to be better than humans, but actually better -- not more ruthless, but more moral. We have a few instances of hosts being better than their makers in this episode, actually-- Maeve is recruiting her fellow hosts by telling them the truth, not by erasing their free will. And one little touch that I thought was really lovely was that Clementine was wearing a robe. It's a little detail, but it means Bernard though to give her that small measure of dignity, even lobotomized, even being used as a weapon. (also, I have QUESTIONS about the Teddy & Tallulah scene. If she remembers her past builds, she remembers being a greeter, and that means she understands the nature of the park.) (also also, the mechanical hosts in the Dolores & Billy scenes confirms the shit out of that timeline being substantially earlier than most of the show.) posted by nonasuch at 9:51 AM on November 28 [ 2 favorites ] Dolores is stabbed in the past, unstabbed in the present. Yeah, that part is clear; I wasn't thinking straight when I posted after the cat woke me up at 6 am. The stuff that's kept me confused is all the deliberately obscured memory/flashback switching, to the point where it's still not clear which memories are being accessed when. Or maybe I just don't care enough after all the smoke to bother figuring it out. That may be it. posted by mediareport at 9:53 AM on November 28 I can't help thinking back to when HBO delayed production in 2015 so Nolan and Joy could rewrite the last 4 episodes. I wonder what the problem was, and if they totally fixed it. posted by mediareport at 9:55 AM on November 28 Given that the Venn overlap between people who watch Westworld and people who watched Raising Hope seems pitifully low, let me say that I really do hope Elsie comes back, because Shannon Woodward is terrific and could do so much more if given a chance. Elsie could come back because it might turn out she didn't actually die. I mean, she probably did, but there is a bit of wiggle room because, while we certainly saw Bernard doing what was needed to kill her, he didn't complete the act on camera and we never saw her body. Or it could be because she ends up resurrected as one of Ford's minion hosts. Either way, more Shannon Woodward could be a very good thing. posted by DirtyOldTown at 9:56 AM on November 28 [ 4 favorites ] I can't help thinking back to when HBO delayed production in 2015 so Nolan and Joy could rewrite the last 4 episodes.

I hope that's what happened. I'm curious about the break in between the first and second seasons. It wouldn't take that long to write scripts, so I guess there's set building that needs to happen. That's exciting. posted by gladly at 10:17 AM on November 28 Given that the Venn overlap between people who watch Westworld and people who watched Raising Hope seems pitifully low, let me say that I really do hope Elsie comes back, because Shannon Woodward is terrific and could do so much more if given a chance. Agreed. (hello, other person who liked both shows!) posted by palomar at 10:17 AM on November 28 [ 4 favorites ] Yeah the stabbed robotic Dolores is clearly an earlier iteration -- they've mentioned more than once that nearly every part in her host has been replaced and she's the oldest one in the park. Based on the (really good, very high-quality) aging of Anthony Hopkins, I'm guessing he waited ~16 years before \"resurrecting\" Arnold in host format. The longest I've ever personally worked at the same company was 13 years, and during that time period, some old-timers showed up that had worked with me 7-10 years earlier as consultants or came back aboard full-time; to be honest, I had trouble recognizing some people at first, especially since we'd both aged IRL. I have little difficulty believing that if Ford waited 15+ years to bring nuArnold online in Bernard's host body, literally zero people would 1) question that Bernard wasn't who he says he was, 2) go hunting for old founder pics to verify or give a single fuck, 3) go to the board for answers. The board members are obviously quite secretive, and employees basically don't even know who's running the show from a financial backer perspective. It smacks of the kind of corporate nepotism and/or cronyism we already see in 2016, so if this is set in, I don't know, 2060, I can only imagine that it's just more of the same. Not only that but when you're talking about building theme parks in what's probably an off-world setting, no matter how awesome ID tracking and passport databases have gotten, the fact that people aren't all citizens of the same nation and you can essentially grow fake humans in a vat adds layers of complication to vetting someone's true identity that most mid-level managers wouldn't even bother. Anyone here who works for a large corporation now has seen the unbelievable bullshit that a \"visionary\" CEO can already get away with, right? And none of us is manufacturing murder/sex vacation cyborgs, either. In some ways, the Westworld parable is just your basic \"bottom line > employees' well-being\" writ large. posted by Unicorn on the cob at 10:19 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] I don't understand why people are surprised that no one recognized Bernard as a duplicate of Arnold. It's an established plot point that after \"the incident\" 30-odd years ago, Ford's partner was basically stricken from the records to protect the company. Ford says so explicitly and Logan refers to it as well, IIRC. Why would no recognize the face of someone whose existence had been scrupulously buried by a giant megacorporation, known for messing with apparent reality? Duh... respectfully, but still: duh. posted by DirtyOldTown at 10:22 AM on November 28 [ 4 favorites ] I'd like to know how the switch from mechanical hosts to biological hosts came about... is that how Delos got involved? posted by elsietheeel at 10:36 AM on November 28 I was under the impression that it was an open secret that the reason for the rewrite was the switch from a single season event series to an ongoing series. Wow, never heard that. All the reports at the time said Nolan and Joy needed more time to work out the last 4 episodes, which I suppose might have had something to do with how to make a change from a one-season event thing, but I have a hard time imagining HBO ever planning this as a single-year show, given their need for new series. Do you remember where you heard about that \"open secret\"? I'm curious. posted by mediareport at 10:49 AM on November 28 Hmmm. I may have imagined the move from a single season to a longer run show. I can't find a thing about it now. posted by DirtyOldTown at 10:55 AM on November 28 Also I need some clarity regarding the towns... 1. Sweetwater - where guests arrive and start their park adventure 2. Unnamed Town - where Lawrence's family lives, has a fountain and lots of adobe buildings, was visited by Ford, who instructed his engineers to end the canyon just short of the town so as to not interrupt more narratives. 3. Pariah - where we meet El Lazo(Lawrence) and the Confederados and everyone is drunk and fucking each others brains out and William and Dolores escape on the train. 4. Escalante - the town with the church, where hosts were trained in the early days, where \"Wyatt\" massacred everyone, referred to by Angela as the town \"swallowed by sand\", means \"climber or one who climbs\" in Spanish. I'm presuming after the incident, prior to the park opening, Ford had Escalante buried. You then see him visiting there with tiny Ro-bert (and later Bernard--the burned out church steeple). Does he then have it unearthed, so that Dolores can return there and then end up meeting with the MiB? Am I remembering that William and Dolores reach Escalante only to find the skeleton church steeple? Also when MiB breaks Hector out of jail for Armistice, was that in town #2 or in Pariah? posted by elsietheeel at 11:02 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] I'm becoming more and more interested in Teddy, personally. There is a long string of manipulations of our opinion of Teddy that then get turned on their ear, both in how we see him (and in what information we are given about him) and in terms of how the changes in storyline send him along on one tide or another. He's a newcomer (i.e. a guest). Nope, he's a host. He's a patsy, there as an easy target for people wanting to have their way with the rancher's daughter. Nope, he's an accomplished gunslinger that newbs better stay clear of until they get some experience. He's a blank slate. Well, now he's rewritten with a haunted backstory in which he faced down evil, but lived to tell the tale. We , maybe he's complicit in that evil and trying to make amends. Well, no, maybe he's primarily responsible for that evil. Maybe more than any other character in Westworld, Teddy is hostage to the vagaries of our limited viewpoint and the whims of the park's storyline. A moment may be coming where he breaks out from this constant meddling and takes off like a rocket. posted by DirtyOldTown at 11:41 AM on November 28 [ 6 favorites ] Oh another thing... how did Maeve know that Bernard was also a host? Did I miss something in a previous episode? Or is it a handwavy oh she's so perceptive now she can just tell who is a host and who is a human? posted by elsietheeel at 11:50 AM on November 28 It wasn't handwavy, but yes, she noticed via interaction with him for a bit, now that she's an unlimited superior being. posted by destructive cactus at 11:52 AM on November 28 how did Maeve know that Bernard was also a host? It's established that hosts can distinguish 'newcomers' in the park, because they're unable to harm them. And when Clementine beats up the faux security dude, Charlotte says he was a host coded to appear human to other hosts. Presumably Bernard has the same deal, but now that Maeve's playing in god mode she perceives him correctly. posted by nonasuch at 11:55 AM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] Here's some information that might figure in to some theories to a small degree: in the \"About Westworld\" featurette on HBO Go, Jonah Nolan refers to the \"21st Century guests.\" Assuming he's not fucking with us, that means there is a cap of about eight decades for how far into the future this show could be set, and only forty something years from the present that the park could be launched. posted by DirtyOldTown at 12:09 PM on November 28 That is a good question, atoxyl. I've been thinking on that and what I anticipate is that given Maeve's apparent understanding of her own code (made clear during the part where she instructs her tech minions on how to rewrite it) she would have disabled these backdoors, much as she disabled the other commands once used to control her. That's just a guess though, and we won't know until that confrontation happens. It had originally been my theory that Maeve wouldn't make it, but that she'd set off a chain of events leading to the park going out of control. That was several episodes ago though that I thought that. Other thoughts: - I hadn't been a fan of \"Dolores is Wyatt.\" Thought people were getting in too deep. But with the different versions of the massacre scene and now MiB finding her I guess maybe that somehow comes together? - the Dolores/Arnold incident must be in the past relative to the William/Logan/Dolores story, right? The town was buried when Billy and Dolores got there, he saw her having strange flashbacks - the massacre was in the past then too, unless that's... a premonition? She's so unstuck in time it's hard to tell sometimes. What I'm getting at here is thus we seem to have several Incidents in the earlier days of the park and it's hard to sort out their relationship - if I have the order right so far then there's still something going to happen in the William/Logan timeframe, isn't there? And we don't know much about it. Does William kill Logan and blame it on the hosts? That would explain how he ends up the one at the top of the company. My other guess was that Logan's cruelty breaks Dolores and she does something but if my chronology above is straight how many separate Incidents can she commit? posted by atoxyl at 12:30 PM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] Forty-some years to opening the park isn't totally absurd. Look at the difference between 1916 and 1956. posted by rmd1023 at 12:37 PM on November 28 Two points about Elsie: I suspect the knowledge that got her killed (or possibly just abducted) wasn't anything to do with Ford's spat with the board. Sure, she figured out what Theresa was doing, but I'm guessing the more dangerous knowledge was about Arnold. Remember, at the moment she got jumped, she was telling Bernard that she found the someone was making code alterations to hosts using Arnold's login credentials. So either Arnold's still alive, Ford's using his old credentials for nefarious shit, or someone else is manipulating events in the park, and whichever is true, I can easily see that as information that Ford would order Bernard to kill to protect. Secondly, I think Elsie is dead, but we haven't seen the last of Shannon Woodward. If Bernard is out of the picture (or about to become part of Maeve's robot army) then Ford will need a new Head of Behavior. From what we know of Ford, he's sure as hell not going to accept some random person he doesn't have any hold over, and it would be uncharacteristically weak story-telling for the writers to be like \"oh, by the way, there's this character we haven't seen before who Ford's been grooming for this position this whole time.\" We also know that Ford's building someone in his little cottage workshop, and when he and/or Bernard covered up Elsie's death, they chose to say she was on leave, rather than creating a fake accident, like they did with Theresa, or saying that she had suddenly quit and left the park. posted by firechicago at 12:41 PM on November 28 Forty-some years to opening the park isn't totally absurd. Look at the difference between 1916 and 1956. For sure. It's also still within the realm of possibility for some of the \"Westworld is on Mars/other non-earthly location\" theories, but only just. posted by DirtyOldTown at 12:42 PM on November 28 From the dramatic shot of a hundred level escalator I'd guess it must be on an orbiting space station. Robots may get really smart but physics has pretty hard limits on the depth into the earth. posted by sammyo at 12:45 PM on November 28 Another possibility: Bernard said that he loved Theresa. Could he have gone after Elsie for Theresa? posted by armacy at 12:52 PM on November 28 I'd like to know how the switch from mechanical hosts to biological hosts came about... is that how Delos got involved? I'm fairly sure that's one of several things they did - the park investment was an extension of the biotech they were working on (WiB being recognized as the head of Delos and saving another guests sisters life). The park also a massive surveillance state, recording everything the guests do, which can have some *very* volatile consequences if the info gets into the wrong hands. *Especially* now that it's officially clarified that the park facilities can create a physical replica of someone specific and implant a recreation of their personality... Delos is the kind of MegaCorp that likely has more power than most nationstates, and is looking to get the info off-site so that they can become straight up evil villain world-rulers. posted by FatherDagon at 12:54 PM on November 28 [ 1 favorite ] now that it's officially clarified that the park facilities can create a physical replica of someone specific and implant a recreation of their personality...

The connection wasn't perfect, and the screen froze as Ford was walking away from Bernard, towards the end of their scene together. So for an instant it looked (to me) like Ford was also a host, and Bernard had somehow hacked him back. (Or even built him, allowing host Ford to think he was the original Ford.) It could still happen next week. posted by paper chromatographologist at 1:23 PM on November 28 Was it inevitable that Bernard would fail to completely reprogram Clementine?

      "text": "Ford: Wentz outplayed? Rodgers that Updated: November 28, 2016 — 11:44 PM EST Share Bob Ford INQUIRER COLUMNIST \nBob Ford is an award-winning sports columnist for the Inquirer. He is a four-time Pennsylvania Sportswriter of the Year, as selected by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. His work has been cited numerous times by Associated Press Sports Editors judges, and he won an Eclipse Award for outstanding coverage of horse racing. Prior to becoming a columnist at the Inquirer, Ford was the 76ers beat writer for six seasons and then a general assignment feature writer with a specialty in Olympic sports. In 1995, he was designated a fellow of the Knight Center for Specialized Journalism. Ford has written sports in the Philadelphia area since 1981, when he served as the Phillies beat writer and later as a general sports columnist for the Delaware County Daily Times. More by Bob Ford Nov 14 \nThis wasn't the first marquee quarterback matchup of Carson Wentz's young career. He had taken the field this season against Ben Roethlisberger, Eli Manning, and Russell Wilson, all of whom have done what Wentz hopes to do himself one day - win a Super Bowl. Eagles-Packers predictions \nGoing up against Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers, also a Super Bowl winner, wasn't just another day at the office, however, even in a season in which the Packers have struggled more than expected. \nThe Eagles had the misfortune to get Rodgers in one of those games in which he can lift a team all by himself. That's what he did, and, acknowledging all the asterisks provided by the Eagles' depleted offense, that's what Wentz was unable to do. At least not yet. \nGreen Bay is missing players, too, including two starters on the offensive line, and the Packers came in having lost four straight games. That didn't matter when the Eagles' defense couldn't solve Rodgers, and the Packers' defense did much better against Wentz. \nThroughout most of the first half Monday night, the Eagles and Wentz didn't just flirt with disaster. They winked at disaster, bought it a drink, and offered to give it a ride home. \nThe Eagles, mostly unable to stop Rodgers and the Green Bay offense, were in danger of falling out of the game almost from the start, and Wentz, as he tried to keep them in it, narrowly avoided a number of big hits behind a crumbling offensive line. \nAgain and again, a Packers defender would break free of a block while Wentz looked for a defender and come within inches of swatting the rookie to the ground, only to see him escape. Wentz scrambled across the line of scrimmage three times for a team-leading total of 26 yards in the opening half, once for a first down and once for a touchdown after his protection broke down. \nDespite all that was happening around him, Wentz completed 13 of 17 passes in the half to a collection of receivers that wasn't atop any of the preseason depth charts. Disaster was out there waiting, but Wentz kept dodging it. What looked ominous at the very start turned out to be just a 14-10 deficit at the half and while Wentz wasn't matching Rodgers pass for pass, he was coming closer than a rookie has a right to do. \nAfter posting a quarterback rating over 90 only once in the previous six games – and that in a loss to Dallas – Wentz came into Monday night needing a confidence builder of a game. Wentz has said the right things about keeping his poise and his belief in both himself and the offense, but a little positive reinforcement never hurt anyone. \nRodgers and Wentz were each dealing from the same deck for most of the game, drawing on old-school West Coast playbooks that emphasized a healthy mix of runs and passes, low-risk underneath routes, and checkdown options. Rodgers' longest completion in the first half was a 20-yard laser to Davante Adams for a touchdown. His 17 completions averaged 8.4 yards. Wentz completed a 24-yarder to Dorial Green-Beckham and averaged 11.3 yards per completion, but both quarterbacks were usually content to take what the opposing soft-zone coverages were allowing. \nTwo passes changed almost everything about the nature of the game once the second half began, however. Wentz was leading the Eagles on the opening drive, working his way downfield with a combination of short passes and runs from Wendell Smallwood when he sailed a pass well over the head of Zach Ertz and it was intercepted. On the very next play, Rodgers lofted a perfect 50-yard strike to Adams. The Packers ended up with just a field goal on that drive, but the bomb forced the Eagles to back off on their coverage, giving Rodgers even more underneath room. \nThe Packers exploited that on their next drive which went 75 yards and put the Eagles behind 24-13 with just under 14 minutes left to play. Rodgers picked them apart, converting four third-down attempts on that drive alone, which made Green Bay 9 of 11 on third down for the game. If the Eagles couldn't get off the field, Wentz couldn't get on it. The interception, combined with the fact the deficit made the play-calling more predictable, sent Wentz's rating tumbling again. When the Eagles had to punt on their ensuing series, time was running out and the Packers weren't going to do anything to slow it down. \nGreen Bay methodically stomped down the field after getting the ball with just over 10 minutes to play, with help from a couple of Eagles penalties. Rodgers completed a fourth-down pass for 21 yards to Jordy Nelson that pretty much sealed the outcome. One field goal later, the Packers had put away a 27-13 win. \nThere will probably be thrilling comebacks in the future for Carson Wentz, but this wasn't going to be one of them. It was a game in which the other guy was better. In fact, a lot better. The other guy had more to work with, no question about that, but when the game began no one was as sure of that as they were afterward. \n@bobfordsports",

      "text": "Industrial Dynamite! Ford’s OHV 4 \nPosted by Jive-Bomber on November 29,   Hot Rods \nI’ve been hanging around traditional hot rods for a good number of years now, and in that time I’ve seen every conceivable 4 cylinder motor put to work in a jalopy: Model A, Model B, Chevy II Iron Duke, Olds Quad Cam, etc. However, thumbing through an old copy of Car Craft were laid out hop up plans for one I’d never thought of: A Ford Industrial Power Unit OHV 4! The motor came in two standard sizes, the JE-134 cubic inch and the JD-172 cubic inch, putting out 49 and 63 horsepower respectively, and powered everything from pumps to cranes for decades. So why did anyone think this under-powered farm wheezer might be a good motor for a sports rod? From the author’s standpoint they already had enough torque on tap and lots of potential to increase the horsepower with improved breathing. Read the article for yourself- It sure seems like a lot of work to make that power, but then again, perhaps a Ford Industrial 4 would make a pretty sweet mill in a little T Roadster. Ever seen one yourself?",

      "title": "New book explores Minnesota’s unique role in the Ford Motor Company",
      "text": "By Amy Goetzman | 09:25 am \nWhen we talk about Ford in Minnesota, we are now talking about redeveloping its Twin Cities Assembly Plant site . We’ve moved on. But author Brian McMahon says not so fast — “Let’s remember what happened there.” \nThe popular factory tour the Ford Motor Company offered at its Highland Park Plant no doubt inspired some tour-goers to head to their local Ford dealership to take home one of the marvels they’d seen rolling down the line. For McMahon, the tour inspired him to write a book. \n“I originally just wanted to see the buildings Alfred Kahn designed for Ford,” said McMahon, a trained architect and historic preservationist who has written extensively about industrial and architectural history. “It started out as a modest intention; I thought it would be fun to take the tour. Well, it was so amazing. The tour was led by a retired autoworker, and he was so informative. I was completely captivated. I wanted to learn more, so I began exploring, and talking to people, and one little bread crumb led to another, and five years later, I thought maybe I had what could become a book.” \nMake that, oh, 18 years later before the project, “The Ford Century in Minnesota,” (University of Minnesota Press) was finally finished. During McMahon’s epic research journey, he interviewed dozens of autoworkers and their descendants from every era of the plant’s history; he discovered that Minnesota, while no Detroit, was a pivotal part of the automaker’s expansion and success; he recorded stories and secrets of a company history that was entwined in the development of the Twin Cities; and he witnessed the ultimate closure and dismantlement of the Highland Park institution. \n“The story told itself. I was just a scribe,” said McMahon. “I had a deep sense of commitment to the people I spoke to, because they had such a commitment to the company they had given most of their lives to — even though the company didn’t always return that loyalty.” \nWhen he began interviewing people, McMahon encountered some hesitancy. Some autoworkers didn’t see their stories as particularly special. Others worried that talking about Ford might be viewed unfavorably by the company. But toward the end of the plant’s run, a growing sense that they were part of something special made the author’s job easier. Workers invited him to their homes, gave him their plant memorabilia, and shared union minutes, records and newsletters with him. The river, labor history, globalization ... Brian McMahon \n“Telling this story helped me understand Minnesota,” said McMahon, a transplant from the East Coast. Although Ford’s story is more typically understood as a Michigan tale, McMahon tells it from a Minnesota point of view. He examines Ford’s Minneapolis and St. Paul plants and dealerships, as well as the role the Mississippi River played in the St. Paul plant’s story — and how Ford dealt with a near-catastrophic flood in 1952. He explored Ford’s role in labor history, Henry Ford’s connections with Nazi Germany, the impact of wars on the company, women’s roles in the auto industry, the role other Minnesota companies played in the development of Ford’s products, and conditions for workers. He describes how Ford enabled workers to achieve the middle-class dream and also how it later eroded workers' rights and pay, and how the forces of deindustrialization and globalization ultimately led to the day in 2006 when Ford announced the impending closure of the St. Paul plant. \n“You can understand this election in a nutshell by looking at what happened with Ford in Minnesota,” said McMahon. “The workers began with very few protections and very difficult conditions. The labor unions helped them rise to a decent quality of life. And then wages and protections evaporated along with union protections, and ultimately the jobs went away. Things came full circle. The decline of the blue-collar worker can be understood by looking at this one company. It wasn’t just a job for these people. They lived together and died together. That’s what kept me working on this project for so many years. I had a commitment to tell their stories.” Events",

      "text": "LEGO and Ford have announced a new set in their ongoing partnership that celebrates Ford’s historic Le Mans. The first win came in 1966 with the iconic Ford GT40 as Ford’s cars swept the board with a 1-2-3 win, cementing the company’s place on the stage as a world-class racecar manufacturer. Exactly 50 years later the Ford GT, the descendant of the GT40, placed first in the GTE Pro class at Le Mans. The new LEGO Speed Champions set contains both the Ford GT40 and the Ford GT to celebrate these wins. The new set will be available March 1 for €34.99 (£29.99). Read the full press release below, and watch a video with the set’s designer.\n\n\nDESIGNED TO INSPIRE TOMORROW’S RACING DRIVERS, ENGINEERS AND DESIGNERS – FORD’S LE MANS VICTORIES IN LEGO® BRICKS Ford race cars that won 1966 and 2016 Le Mans 24 Hours will be available as part of the exclusive LEGO® Speed Champions range of models New kit brings to life iconic Ford GT40 and today’s Ford GT race car. Minifigures, chequered flag and trophy will help to bring famous victories to life again and again Designing the exclusive kit was a “dream project” for LEGO design lead Craig Callum, a former car designer who races Fords in his spare time COLOGNE, Germany, Nov. 29, 2016 – It’s a gift 50 years in the making that could set your child on the path to becoming a racing legend. The iconic Ford GT40 and new Ford GT that won Le Mans 24 Hours in 1966 and 2016 are being brought to life in LEGO® bricks.\nThe new LEGO Speed Champions set will include both cars as well as racing driver minifigures, a chequered flag and even a trophy to make it easy to recreate those history-making victories.\n“Many people in my team grew up with the legend of Ford’s history-making 1966 victory – and experienced the excitement of building and design for the first time through LEGO bricks,” said Dave Pericak, global director, Ford Performance. “This kit is a powerful way to tell our Le Mans story, and will hopefully inspire the race drivers, engineers, and designers of the future.”\nFord won at Le Mans earlier this year after returning to the scene of what was a historic 1-2-3 clean sweep 50 years previously. The LEGO Group worked closely with Ford’s design and licensing teams on every detail of the 1966 winning car, and the new Ford GT race car.\n“This was a dream project – with a lot of pressure. The Ford GT40 is one of the most iconic race cars of all time, and the new Ford GT is just incredible,” said Craig Callum, head of design, LEGO Speed Champions. “Designed for children, but with grown-ups fans in mind too, we know these models will be closely scrutinized for authenticity.”\nCallum, who in his spare time races a Ford Model A hot-rod, and started out as a designer of full-sized cars, helped develop ten prototypes before the final versions of each model were selected, all created from existing LEGO bricks.\nYou can watch Callum assemble the new kit in record time here.\n\nThe new 2016 Ford GT and 1966 Ford GT40 set will be available to order at LEGO.com/shop from March 1, 2017, with a recommended retail price of €34.99 (£29.99). A Ford Mustang set is on sale now, alongside a Ford F 150 Raptor with trailer and Ford Model A hot rod .\nEditor’s notes \nLe Mans 2016 race win The #68 Ford GT of Sébastien Bourdais (FRA), Joey Hand (US) and Dirk Müller (GER) crossed the finish line as the winner in the GTE-Pro class of the 2016 Le Mans 24 Hours.\nLe Mans 1966 podium sweep The #2 Ford GT40 Mark II driven by Bruce McLaren (NZ) and Chris Amon (NZ) took first place at Le Mans in 1966 – leading a Ford clean sweep of the three podium positions. The 1966 race was Ford’s first ever win at Le Mans, and the first of four successive victories at the iconic endurance race.\nThe 2016 Ford GT The ultra-high-performance Ford GT supercar is the most advanced Ford production vehicle ever, featuring the latest in lightweighting, aerodynamics and EcoBoost engine technology – an innovation showcase for the Ford brand.\nThe 1966 Ford GT40 Mark II The Ford GT40 Mark II featured a lightweight aluminium chassis, rear-wheel drive and a 7.0-litre Ford V8 engine. The car was named the GT (Grand Touring) with the 40 representing its height at the top of the windscreen in inches.\nLEGO® Speed Champions LEGO Speed Champions puts children in the driver seat, as they build and race some of the most famous cars ever produced, with authentic designs and exciting accessories to inspire young imaginations.\n",

      "text": "As expected , Ford will reveal the 2018 Ford Fiesta later today. But before the full launch, Ford of Europe dropped the first photo of the new hatchback on its Twitter page . The company only released one image so far, but the front three-quarter shot still reveals quite a bit of the new design.\n\nAs predicted, the redesign is evolutionary. The car has much softer lines and curves than its predecessor, most evident by the toned down fender arches. The headlights aren't swept back as much either. The car's grille has also been updated with corners that don't stretch down as far, which reflects that of the updated American Fusion and European Mondeo.\n\nBREAKING NEWS: Feast your eyes on the first ever photos of the Next Generation #FordFiesta ST-Line #GoFurther pic.twitter.com/kYyDRtdrcy \n— Ford in Europe (@FordEu) November 29, 2016 \n\nThis particular Fiesta is also a European ST-Line model . This trim adds a sporty-looking interior and some exterior bits to make a normal Fiesta appear more like a high performance ST model, but with none of the mechanical parts. Expect the standard model to look a bit more tame, and the ST to be more aggressive.\n\nFord has yet to reveal other details, but they should come later today. We expect the Fiesta will be more efficient and more refined, and to go on sale sometime next year, probably around the same time as the EcoSport subcompact crossover .",

      "text": "Car makers plan grid of super-fast EV chargers in Europe BMW, Daimler, Ford and VW want to make sure you can top up quickly during cross-continent drives. Save Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nIt's all well and good to create electric car charging networks to help you on long drives, but merely having stations isn't enough. What use are abundant chargers if you spend ages waiting for your battery to replenish? Thankfully, at least some big automakers are aware of this. BMW, Daimler, Ford and the Volkswagen Auto Group are forming a joint venture that will install a grid of super-fast EV chargers along major European highways. And we do mean fast -- they could supply up to 350kW of power, or nearly triple the 120kW that Tesla Superchargers offer. So long as your car supported that kind of input, you could be back on the road in several minutes. \nThe initial grid will be modest, with plans to start rolling out approximately 400 chargers in 2017. As of 2020, however, there should be \"thousands\" of these charging stations across Europe. Other car companies are \"encouraged\" to sign on, too, and regional partners could help get the network off the ground. \nThe planned network could easily pay dividends for car brands if it leads to more people adopting electric vehicles. You won't need to keep that gas-guzzler around to visit friends on the other side of the continent. However, this is also a defensive move against Tesla. It's not just that Tesla's Supercharger network currently gives it an advantage for long-distance travelers -- it's that Tesla's proprietary charging plug could end up becoming the effective default and make it difficult for customers to switch makes. A vast competing network would both nullify Tesla's edge and increase the chances that a cross-company standard will win the day.",

      "title": "Ford's vans in Europe just got a lot more fun",
      "text": "By : Adrian Padeanu , Editor The Transit is not what you would call exciting, but Ford wants to spice things up with a special edition bringing a splash of color. \nLet’s face it, vans are boring. People only buy them for their utilitarian purpose, not for how they look. Ford wishes to change that by giving the Transit Custom a new Black Edition featuring “bold contrasts, sports style.” Taking inspiration from the Fiesta and Focus Red and Black Editions , the special edition Transit Custom will be offered from spring 2017 in Europe with new hues: Deep Impact Blue, Race Red, Frozen White with Jet Black accents, and Absolute Black combined with Race Red contrasts. \nProduction is going to be capped at 1,000 units and all vans are going to be based on the short-wheelbase model with the standard roof van body style in the 290 Trend series specification and with the chassis settings of the Sport variant. Power will be provided exclusively by Ford’s brand new four-cylinder, 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine part of the EcoBlue family and rated at 170 horsepower channeled to the road via a six-speed manual gearbox. \nIn addition, the Transit Custom Sport family based on the 290 series Transit Custom model is growing to include a total of eight different members thanks to the addition of new body and seating options. All of them come with a slightly beefier body painted in the same color and combined with dual stripes on the hood in a contrasting color. As standard, the vans will ride on fresh 17-inch wheels featuring a silver and black two-tone color combo, but Ford will give buyers the option of upgrading to a larger 18-inch set. \nStepping inside the cabin, the Transit Custom Sport will have the Ford SYNC connectivity package and a rearview camera as standard equipment, along with partial leather upholstery including for the second and third rows where fitted.

To try and live up to its “Sport” name, the van has a thicker front anti-roll bar and a rear anti-roll bar, which you don’t get in the other Transit models. Bespoke damper tuning with a firmer setup for the rear is also part of the package, as are the softer rear springs. Go for the Kombi or the double cab body style and Ford will throw in different damper and spring settings to boost rear passenger comfort and sharpen up handling. \nIn related news, the Tourneo Custom gets a similar Sport series option based on the Tourneo Custom Titanium model. It can be had with eight seats in short or long wheelbase guises with the same diesel engine. The latest version of the Tourneo Custom also welcomes the aforementioned six-speed auto, a rear air suspension, and new 17-inch rims. \nSource: Ford   Ford Transit Black Edition Hide press release Show press release DYNAMIC NEW TRANSIT CUSTOM VANS LOOK THE BUSINESS: FORD REVEALS EXCLUSIVE BLACK EDITION AND SPORTS SERIES MODELS Ford launches exclusive new Transit Custom models for style-conscious small businesses that want to combine eye-catching looks with impressive capability New Transit Custom Black Edition brings vibrant contrasts to the one-tonne van market, in four striking colour schemes with contrasting roof, mirrors and skid plate Sport series with signature twin stripes now available in eight bodystyles; responds to rising customer demand, with sales up 47 per cent in first 10 months of 2016 Latest Tourneo Custom people mover also enhances appeal with Sport package, plus new 6-speed automatic, rear air suspension and alloy wheel options \n\nCOLOGNE , Germany, Nov. 29, 2016 – Ford has revealed exclusive new variants of the Transit Custom one-tonne commercial vehicle that provide stylish and functional transportation for independent businesses and artisans who want to stand out from the crowd. \nThe dynamic new Transit Custom Black Edition van offers four eye-catching colour schemes that feature contrasting roof, mirror caps, skid plate and side stripes, along with unique black 17‑inch alloy wheels. \nThe sought-after Transit Custom Sport series van with its signature twin bonnet stripes is also now available in a much wider choice of bodystyles. Sport series customers can now select van, kombi and double-cab-in-van models in both short and long wheelbase versions; in addition, the latest Tourneo Custom people mover can be specified with the same Sport package. \n“Many of our retail customers are no longer satisfied with a standard white van, and these stunning new vehicles provide the perfect solution,” said Hans Schep, general manager, Commercial Vehicles, Ford of Europe. “The new Transit Custom makes a really positive statement about their business, and looks great on the driveway at the weekend.” \nThe demand for sporting and distinctive Transit models has continued to build since the original Sport Van was introduced by Ford in 2007. During the first 10 months of 2016, sales of the current Transit Custom Sport are up by 47 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, with 1,800 vans sold. \nNew Black Edition – bold contrasts, sports style Available for delivery in spring 2017, the Transit Custom Black Edition provides van customers with an exclusive new appearance option with just 1,000 units available across Europe. \nInspired by the bold contrasting colours of Ford’s successful passenger cars like the Fiesta and Focus Red and Black Editions, the new model can be specified in Race Red, Deep Impact Blue and Frozen White with Jet Black contrasts, and Absolute Black with Race Red contrasts. \nAll Transit Custom Black Edition vehicles have a short-wheelbase, standard roof van bodystyle, and are based on the 290 Trend series model featuring the powerful all-new 170 PS 2.0-litre Ford EcoBlue diesel engine with 6-speed manual transmission, with the enhanced chassis settings from the Sport series van. \nTransit Custom Sport series with expanded appeal Responding to customer demand for a wider choice of body and seating options, the Transit Custom Sport series is now available in eight different variants – a significant expansion from the single short-wheelbase van version offered previously. \nAs before, the range-topping Sport series features a muscular body kit and a fully colour-coded exterior, with body-colour bumpers, side mirrors and door handles, along with body-side mouldings and wheelarch extensions that have been redesigned for the latest model. The bold appearance is finished off with new 17-inch alloy wheels in a two-tone silver and black design – with optional silver 18-inch alloy wheels – and twin bonnet stripes in a contrasting colour. \nThe sporting style also features partial leather interior trim combining Pewter seat fabric with charcoal black leather bolsters, including second or third seat rows where fitted, and the latest interior technologies such as the Ford SYNC connectivity package and rear view camera. \nThe standard powertrain combines the 170 PS Ford EcoBlue diesel engine with a 6-speed manual, but customers can also specify the new 6-speed SelectShift automatic transmission option on four of the Sport series variants. \nAll Sport models are based on the 290 series Transit Custom, with driving dynamics further optimised with a unique chassis specification delivering enhanced steering, handling and ride, and a more responsive and agile feel. \nCompared to a standard vehicle, roll control is improved by a thicker front anti-roll bar and the addition of a rear anti-roll bar. On the van model, this is combined with softer rear springs for increased comfort when lightly laden, along with unique damper tuning, with firmer settings on the rear, for enhanced ride and steering control. Kombi and double-cab-in-van models have different spring and damper settings optimised for both handling and rear passenger comfort. \nThe expanded Transit Custom Sport series is now available to order for customer delivery in spring 2017. \nTourneo Custom people mover – with Sport, Auto and Rear Air Suspension options For the first time, Ford’s spacious and versatile Tourneo Custom people mover is now available with a Sport series option, providing both private buyers and business purchasers with a more dynamic exterior appearance and a stylish sports interior. \nThe Sport variant is based on the Tourneo Custom Titanium model, and can be specified as an 8-seat vehicle in either short or long wheelbase form with the 170 PS Ford EcoBlue diesel engine. The exterior and interior enhancements are shared with the equivalent Transit Custom. \nThe latest Tourneo Custom is also now offered with significant new features and technologies including the smooth and responsive new 6-speed SelectShift automatic transmission, a unique-to-segment rear air suspension system that delivers a supple, controlled and level ride across a wide range of load conditions, and an attractive new 17-inch alloy wheel option for enhanced handling and braking performance. \nTransit Custom and Tourneo Custom showcase all-new Ford EcoBlue diesel Ford earlier this year introduced the state-of-the-art Ford EcoBlue diesel engine to Transit Custom and Tourneo Custom vehicles, delivering significant cost of ownership and performance benefits, with fuel efficiency improved by up to 13 per cent and low-end torque by 20 per cent. \nSophisticated new driver assistance technologies for both models include: Pre-Collision Assist emergency braking system – the first in the segment to feature Pedestrian Detection technology – that reduces the severity of some frontal collisions involving vehicles and pedestrians, or helps drivers avoid some impacts altogether An upgraded Electronic Stability Control system that provides an enhanced suite of functions to improve vehicle stability in extreme driving situations including Side Wind Stabilisation – a new system that applies the brakes on one side of the vehicle to reduce the effect of a sudden side wind gust on the vehicle’s path About this article",

      "text": "Ford Expects To Make $1 Billion Profit In Europe, Smash 2015 Figure | By Share Ford’s European boss expects the automaker to make a $1 billion profit in Europe in 2016, well up on the $259 million it returned last year. Speaking with Automotive News , Jim Farley said that coming in to 2016, the brand targeted $600 million in European profits. However, that goal was surpassed in the first six months of the year and, by the end of the third quarter, Ford had earned $1.039 billion of pre-tax profit. Key ingredients for this huge increase in its profits are cutting thousands of jobs, closing three plants and updating a plethora of its models in European markets. Although Ford is on target for record profit figures in Europe, it notes that, if it hadn’t been for the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, its profits would have been even higher. As a matter of fact, Brexit is said to have cost $60 million in the second quarter and could cost $140 million in the second half of 2016 because of falling demand for its models in the UK. By the end of 2018, Ford says Brexit could cost it as much as $1.2 billion. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "The full reveal of the next Fiesta is planned for later today, but Ford released this picture to keep us entertained for the time being. Auto Express reported that the sub-compact will ride on Ford's Global B platform, continuing on with the current tradition. Expect the exterior to have some small refinements, including the sleek headlights and streamlined body accents. The major change, however, is on the interior. The cabin is expected to gain a bit of class, making for a higher quality feel and look. This will only help the Fiesta's case against its competitors as it already was a top contender in that category. These distinctions should help the Fiesta's evolution towards becoming a strong global competitor.\nThe powertrain options are set to be the same for the next generation, but with more empahsis on the 1.0L Ecoboost engine. This quirky inline-3 cylinder has been snagging awards left and right, so it would be reasonable to anticipate a larger presence in the Fiesta family. This well help the average fuel economy across the board, helping to market its affordability -- as if it needed any help with that. The photo shown above is of the ST model, so we will continue to see its grinning face for at least one more rendition. It would be nice to see a bump in power from its current 196 HP and 202 lb. ft. of torque, a feat that is certainly possible as the aftermarket for the small 1.6L Ecoboost has proven.\nCome back for updates once the official Euro-spec model is released at the \"Go Further\" event in Cologne, Germany.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nFord has introduced the extensively updated 2018 Fiesta during an event held in Germany. The city car isn’t entirely new, but nearly every part of it has been improved in one way or another. \nThe most obvious changes are spotted by simply looking at the Fiesta. Its front end receives softer-looking headlights, a thinner, wider grille, and a new-look bumper. Out back, the outgoing model’s vertical tail lamps are replaced by elongated horizontal units, a styling cue that emphasizes the Fiesta’s width. Surprisingly, the two-door body style hasn’t been axed yet. \nIn Europe, the Fiesta lineup has been expanded with three new versions named Vignale, Active, and ST-Line, respectively. The Vignale is the long-rumored upscale variant that comes standard with features such as 18-inch alloy wheels, a specific chromed grille, and tuxedo-stitched leather upholstery on the seats. Inspired by SUVs, the Active model boasts black plastic cladding and roof rails, and it sits a little taller than normal. Finally, the ST-Line wears a sporty-looking body kit inspired by the hot-rodded ST model. It’s worth noting that none of these three models have been confirmed for the United States yet. \nMore: Ford’s 2018 Mustang could get a trick suspension, lose an engine option \nFord promises the Fiesta’s cabin is a nicer place to travel in than before thanks to additional soft-touch material on the dashboard, and a much bigger touchscreen that runs a new infotainment system called Sync 3. The Fiesta also inaugurates an enhanced version of the pedestrian detection tech that prevents collisions even when it’s dark outside. The system will gradually make its way to bigger, more expensive members of the Ford lineup in the coming months. \nThe big news under the hood is that the Fiesta’s popular 1.0-liter EcoBoost three-cylinder engine is available with a fuel-saving cylinder deactivation system. The triple automatically turns into a twin when extra power isn’t needed, and the third cylinder re-engages in just 14 milliseconds — faster than the blink of an eye — when it’s needed again. Cylinder deactivation has never been offered on a three-cylinder engine before; Ford says its implementation can improve gas mileage by up to six percent in real-world driving conditions. \nThe Ford Fiesta introduced in Germany is a Euro-spec model. The U.S.-spec version is widely expected to make its debut in January during the Detroit Auto Show, and it will go on sale in time for the 2018 model year.",

      "text": "Westworld: Is Ford's New Narrative Escalante? Amy Awesome Tweet This \nOne thing we know about the Westworld finale for sure is that Ford's new narrative will be revealed. Through most of the season, his work has been kept mostly secret. \nWhile we don't know what mysteries or questions will be answered in the finale, Showrunners Lisa Joy and Jonathon Nolan have already said, \" Most of the questions viewers have will be resolved in the final episodes, except for the most important one: What happens next .\" \nHopefully the extended 90-minute episode doesn't leave fans hanging until Season 2 comes around in 2018. \nHowever tight-lipped Ford has been on his new \"project,\" we still picked up on some major clues as to what it might be, especially in Episode 9 \"The Well-Tempered Clavier.\" Location of Ford's Narrative \nWe know for sure what location of the park Ford has been bulldozing, digging, and blowing up as seen in the map below and it's eerily close to \"where the land meets the sea\" and the \"city swallowed by sand.\" \nWe know that Dolores and William have wandered into the \"currently under construction zone\" because that is the only spot on the map that the sea meets the land, you know the place Dolores keeps remembering and drawing. The Church \nThis is where it starts to get interesting. In Episode 2, Ford was seen overlooking a vast area with the little boy host. The area had an old, burnt-down church steeple sticking up out of the ground. As we got deeper into the season, this steeple started to look more and more familiar. \nWhen Arnold started speaking to Dolores, he kept telling her to remember, and she would instantly have flashbacks to this very same church when it wasn't buried in the ground. \nThe church was in the first town in Westworld, named Escalante. A quaint old western town where Arnold, Ford and other Delos employees worked on perfecting the hosts before the Westworld even opened. \nIn Episode 9, we see Dolores finally find the church (which might be the entrance to the maze). In a crazy sequence of events, Dolores walks in and out of the church in the present timeline. We know it's the present timeline because the Man In Black (also on a mission to find the maze) greets her as she is trying to leave. There is much more to this sequence that we will get into later. \nThe key point is that the \"city swallowed in sand\" has been unearthed and rebuilt. Only one man could have done this - Ford. Escalante \nWe’ve seen the “City Swallowed by Sand” in model form in Ford’s office. This is the new narrative he’s been planning and why his \"earth movers\" have been working overtime. \nAnd for some reason he sent both Dolores and The Man In Black there at the same time, during the present timeline. \nThe \"Wyatt\" stoyline that was recently uploaded into Teddy's mind helped lead the Man In Black to the new Escalante. \nThe voices and visions in Dolores' mind led her to back to the new Escalante. \nDid Ford unearth and rebuild this entire town just so these two would meet again? That remains up in the air. However, If The Man In Black really is an older version of William, that would all make perfect sense. \nIn Episode 9, Angela the host, who seems to be full sentient, told Teddy that he was remembering Escalante wrong. That the scene of the massacre where Arnold along with hosts, and other employees were killed by \"Wyatt\" in Escalante was not caused by Wyatt, but Teddy. \nOur theory is that Ford's new narrative is a way of destroying the maze (which could lie underneath the church) so no hosts can achieve what Arnold wanted - full sentience. \nRemember that Ford is obsessed with maintaining control, and if he somehow leads all of the generation 1 hosts to the new Escalante, he can destroy any memories they have of Arnold by destroying them. \nWe will soon find out when Ford's new narritive is revealed in the Westworld season finale this Sunday! \nAt least we know one question that will be answered in the finale! We'll know what Ford's new narrative is, no matter how terrifying it may be. \nHBO officially released the synopsis for the extended 90-minute season finale that you can read below: \nFord (Anthony Hopkins) unveils his bold new narrative; Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) embraces her identity; Maeve (Thandie Newton) sets her plan in motion.",

      "text": "By : Graham King , Editor The program is set to resolve the issues around making a driverless car work across international borders. \nFord has announced it will start testing autonomous cars on European roads in 2017. \nThe program is intended to resolve the issues around getting the system to work across international borders. Road layouts, signage and traffic codes vary widely from country to country in Europe, so developing a system that understands the differences and can switch between them when the car crosses a border is absolutely vital. \nFord has been testing its autonomous driving technology in America for some time, as it strives to become a leader in connectivity, mobility, and autonomous vehicles. Earlier this year, the automaker announced plans to launch a fully-autonomous car on a ride-sharing service by 2021 . That car will feature Level 4 autonomy, which the Society of Automotive Engineers defines as a car without a steering wheel or pedals. An autonomous car that will be sold to general consumers is set to follow in 2025 . \nUber has separately been testing a Fusion fitted with its own autonomous driving tech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \nFord has also been asking drivers what they would do with their time while being driven in an autonomous car. 64 percent they would have a bite to eat, 72 percent would catch up with people on the phone, and 80 percent said they would simply relax and enjoy the scenery. \nAstonishingly, 16 percent even said they would let their children travel unaccompanied in a driverless car \nFord of Europe automated driving manager, Thomas Lukaszewicz, said: “People are really beginning to think about exactly what autonomous vehicles could mean to their day-to-day lives. Many of us neglect time for ourselves and for our loved ones in the face of other demands. Self-driving car will revolutionize the way we live, as well as the way we travel.” You might also like:",

Jim Farley, CEO and chairman of Ford Europe, poses in front of a 2017 Ford Fiesta in Cologne, Germany, on Nov. 29, 2016. (Photo: Patrik Stollarz, AFP-Getty Images) \nFord's European restructuring efforts are ahead of schedule and the automaker is on track to report a pre-tax profit of more than $1 billion this year, Jim Farley, president of Ford of Europe's said Tuesday. \nThe automaker announced a plan earlier this year to get to a 6% to 8% profit margin in Europe after years of losses during Europe's recession. \nFord earned a pre-tax profit of $259 million in 2015 — it's first in four years — after Stephen Odell steered the automaker through several difficult years. \n\"He promised that we would invest in the future of Europe in the most difficult of times. That was not an easy thing to commit to, given the all the opportunity we had in the U.S. and the enormous growth opportunity in Asia,\" Farley said at an event in Cologne, Germany. \nIn February, Ford said the company planned to improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce costs by 7% annually. The automaker also said it planned to cut hundreds of white-collar jobs through buyouts to save $200 million annually. \n►Related: Ford to cut staff, vehicles in Europe to grow profit \nFarley said there were many skeptics about the company's plan. \n\"People wondered if Ford could compete against the premium brands that were entering virtually every segment that we compete in and even the low-cost brands from below, but the team did it,\" Farley said. \nFarley said Ford has already passed $1 billion in profit. \n\"But that’s not what’s interesting. What’s interesting is that the team's goal was $600 million for this entire year, and we beat that in six months,\" Farley said. \nTo be sure, Ford's performance in Europe has been aided by an industry that continues to rebound after years of sales declines. \nOver the first 10 months of 2016, car registrations in the European Union surpassed 12.3 million new cars and trucks — a 7.2% increase, according to European Automobile Manufacturers Association. \nIndustry sales have increased this year in all five of Europe's major markets with year-to-date sales up 16.7% in Italy, 10.8% in Spain, 4.9% in Germany, 4.7% in France and 2.5% in the United Kingdom. \nStill, for all of it's progress, Ford's sales gains have trailed the market with a 3.9% increase so far this year. \nNext year, Ford is counting on it's next-generation Fiesta, which will go on sale by summer, to give its sales a boost. Farley also revealed Ford's new 2017 Fiesta on Tuesday at the automaker's plant in Cologne. \nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

      "text": "Wednesday, November 30, 2016, 1:58 PM \nFord has stuffed a lot of automotive technology into a small package. \nBetween automated safety features, improved infotainment offerings, better driving dynamics and two new trim packages, the seventh generation Fiesta takes the party to the next level. Ford introduced the new generation Fiesta in Germany yesterday, rolling out four versions, including the performance-oriented ST-Line. (Ford) \nFord introduced the world to its all-new subcompact during an event at the Cologne, Germany factory where the Fiesta is made, rolling out four distinct versions in either three- or five-door configurations. These cars are, as you might have guessed, intended for the European market and Ford hasn’t indicated which upgrades are North America-bound. First Pictures: 2018 Ford Fiesta \nHere’s what we know so far: \nOn track for a 2017 release, the European Fiesta will be available in stylish Titanium and performance-oriented ST-Line trims, both of which are available on the current North American version of the Fiesta. It also added two new offerings: the top-tier Vignale and the athletic Active. \nBy adding the Vignale trim, the Fiesta joins other Ford European models, including the Mondeo (known in the States as the Fusion), S-Max, Kuga and Edge, in offering a luxury variant. The Vignale badge brings with it 18-inch alloy wheels, a wavy “satin” grille pattern, special running lights and hexagon-quilted leather seats. Nice as it is, don’t expect to see this package offered with the North American Fiesta. The 2018 Fiesta continues to deliver a fun-to-drive character thanks to a new suspension and electronic torque vectoring control. (Ford) \nThe Fiesta Active, on the other hand, seems like a perfect candidate for a U.S. debut. Featuring roof bars as well as a raised ride-height and suspension, this pseudo-crossover might appeal to American buyers looking for a more comfortable ride on budget. A hexagonal grille design separates the Active from the Fiesta pack, the rest of which sport rounded grilles. \nFiesta engine offerings include a 1.0-liter EcoBoost gasoline engine or a 1.5-liter diesel option, which is a first for the nameplate. The six-speed transmission will come equipped with friction-reducing technology that Ford said should help keep carbon dioxide emissions low. \nDuring the rollout event, Ford also boasted of a 1.0-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine armed with cylinder deactivation software, but it’s not clear if that will be available in either the European or North American version of the Fiesta. Ford has not released U.S. specs for the all-new Fiesta just yet, but in Europe it will feature a 1.0-liter EcoBoost engine. (Ford) \nIn terms of advanced tech, the new Fiesta will feature two cameras, three radars and 12 ultrasonic sensors, which combine to create a 360-degree monitoring network and would appear to be setting the Fiesta up for a self-driving future. As for the present, the new Fiesta will feature pedestrian detection with automatic braking assistance, active parking assistance, automatic high beams, adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection and more. \nFord said it plans on expanding its fully-autonomous vehicle testing to European roads next year. \nNew Fiestas also will offer Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system, which includes Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Sync AppLink to connect to smartphones. A tablet-like 8-inch touchscreen and a new B&O Play audio system are also available. It won't likely see the light of day in the U.S., but the Ford Fiesta Vignale is fine premium offering for the European market. (Ford) \nFord has been selling the Fiesta in Europe continuously since 1976, whereas the North American model made its return in 2010 after a 30-year hiatus, so it’s not surprising that it chose to debut the small hatchback across the Atlantic before introducing it in the U.S. \nThe American version of the new Fiesta is on track for 2018 debut and it will (barring any trade agreement revocations) most likely be made in Mexico.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Ford Is Taking Its Self-Driving Car Experiment Overseas \nFord will begin testing autonomous vehicles in Europe next year as it races other automakers and tech companies to develop and commercialize the technology. \nFord made the announcement in Germany in conjunction with a survey it commissioned on European views about the future of autonomous vehicles. The survey, conducted by Penn Schoen Berland, asked consumers in France, Germany, Norway, Spain, and the UK how they would spend their time in a self-driving car. Of the 5,000 who were surveyed, 80% say they look forward to relaxing and enjoying the scenery, 72% expect to use that time to talk on the phone, and 64% plan to eat. \n“People are really beginning to think about exactly what autonomous vehicles could mean to their day-to-day lives,” Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager of the automated driving unit at Ford of Europe, said in a statement. “Many of us neglect time for ourselves and for our loved ones in the face of other demands. Self-driving cars will revolutionize the way we live, as well as the way we travel.” \nFord has been testing its self-driving car technology at various locations in the U.S., including at its proving grounds in Romeo, Mich., Wittmann, Ariz., and at Mcity, a 23-acre simulated urban environment at the University of Michigan. Ford announced in January plans to add 20 Fusion Hybrid autonomous vehicles, bringing the company’s autonomous fleet to about 30 vehicles that are being tested on roads in California, Arizona, and Michigan. Ford enrolled in the California Autonomous Vehicle Testing Program last December, a program that already includes companies like Nissan, Volkswagen vlkay , and Google . Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s daily newsletter about technology \n“It is important that we extend our testing to Europe,” Lukaszewicz said. “Rules of the road vary from country to country here, traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.” \nFord announced in August plans to make self-driving cars for commercial ride-sharing or on-demand taxi services by 2021. The company has said it’s focused on developing a fully autonomous vehicle, or Level 4, a classification by the Society of Automotive Engineers that means the car can handle all aspects of driving in some conditions or driving modes. For example, the cars may only operate under certain environmental conditions or a specific area within a city. It would be one step short of the highest rating, Level 5, when a car can handle all driving tasks in all road and environmental conditions normally controlled by a human. Ford’s Venture Into Self-Driving Taxis \nSelf-driving cars are part of the company’s so-called Ford Smart Mobility plan, an initiative introduced nearly two years ago that involves building cars with additional Internet connectivity, experimenting with different forms of transportation such as car-sharing as well as using big data analytics like grabbing information from in-vehicle sensors to learn more about how people travel.

      "text": "Ford said in April it would bring a high-performance version of its F-series – the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 34 years – to China, the world’s biggest auto market. (Source: Reuters) Automakers Ford (F.N) and General Motors (GM.N) are aiming the pick-up truck, an iconic staple in the United States, at upmarket buyers in China, where most associate trucks with farmers and construction workers. “The Chinese call it pika, pika – a very low-end worker’s (vehicle). But the (Ford F-150) Raptor is totally different,” said Wesley Liu, Ford’s Asia-Pacific sales director, ahead of this month’s Guangzhou autoshow.\nTrucks are largely restricted to overnight driving in most Chinese cities, but four provinces – Yunnan, Liaoning, Hebei and Henan – have this year launched trial programmes allowing them into urban zones in an attempt to stimulate production as economic growth, and car sales, slow.\nWith those looser restrictions, U.S. pick-up makers aim to distance their trucks from local models made by Great Wall Motor (601633.SS), Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) (000550.SZ) and others – and appeal to Chinese premium buyers, like Meng Shuo.\nThe 32-year-old founder of an investment consultancy, who already owned a Chevrolet Camaro when he bought an F-150 pick-up truck five years ago through an unofficial grey market importer. He has since traded it in for a Toyota (7203.T) Tundra, and also owns a Mercedes (DAIGn.DE) luxury sedan and Porsche (PSHG_p.DE) and Mitsubishi (7211.T) sports cars.\nFord said in April it would bring a high-performance version of its F-series – the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 34 years – to China, the world’s biggest auto market. A spokesman said the company is studying whether to also bring a mass-market model such as the F-150 or Ranger pick-up to China, depending on demand and future regulations.\n“The people who buy the Raptor maybe own some other premium vehicle already. This is another toy,” Liu said.\nThe truck is aimed at four types of buyers, he said – the wealthy, who want to stand out from the crowd; business owners, who want more than a traditional commercial vehicle; drivers who want a single car for all situations; and “gearheads”, who just like the mechanics.\nEven as Chinese authorities throw vast subsidies at green, clean auto technologies, the growing wealth of Chinese consumers has driven a boom in larger cars and sport-utility vehicles (SUV). With margins now under pressure in the crowded SUV sector, automakers see potential profits in high-end foreign pick-ups.\nFord and GM – which displayed its Chevrolet Colorado and Silverado trucks around the Guangzhou show, with t-shirt clad urban cowboys and an all-leather rock band selling the trucks’ macho, all-American appeal – have not yet announced prices for their pick-ups, expected to be launched next year. But they should command a sizeable premium to locally made models as China slaps a 25 percent tax on imports.\nPICKING UP\nFor now, pick-ups are a tiny fraction of China’s market.IHS Markit sees sales increasing by 14 percent this year to 368,791 pick-up trucks, but that would still be only 1.4 percent of China’s light vehicle market. By contrast, sales in the U.S. are forecast at 2.7 million pick-ups, about 15 percent of the market.\nALSO IN AEROSPACE & DEFENSE\nCosts mount for Lufthansa as pilot strike enters second week Soccer crash survivors undergo operations in Colombia, probe begins Yan Ningya, an official involved in the Hebei pilot project, said the province, home to Great Wall and other automakers, accounts for half of China’s pick-up production.\nThe trial has not yet resulted in higher production, he told Reuters, but the local government will need a year from the pilot project’s launch in May to gauge its impact. After that, the central government may do more to drive production, possibly reclassifying pick-ups as passenger cars rather than commercial vehicles, he said.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which directed the provinces to launch the pilot projects, did not respond to a faxed request for comment.\n“China’s pick-up truck market will be very large in the future,” said Yan, noting domestic brands would likely upgrade their trucks to meet the tastes of middle-class drivers.",

We’re going to see some future announcements as well with some other companies. They’ve already been working behind the scenes. I mean this is really going to fundamentally help our manufacturing industry and so many other industries,” said Trump Transition spokesman Jason Miller during an appearance on FOX & Friends Wednesday. \nTrump and Vice President-elect Pence reportedly personally called the CEO of UTX ( UTX ) Gregory Hayes, which owns Carrier, to negotiate the deal. Late Wednesday the company provided more color on how it all came together. \"Today's announcement is possible because the incoming Trump-Pence administration has emphasized to us its commitment to support the business community and create an improved, more competitive U.S. business climate. The incentives offered by the state were an important consideration\" said the statement. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nAs for Ford, Trump broke the news via a tweet, citing Chairman Bill Ford’s change of heart over moving a Lincoln plant to Mexico.

      "text": "Ford announces special Black Shadow, Blue Edition Mustangs Text: Marcus De Guzman / Photos: Ford  20 Euro-exclusive Black Shadow and Blue edition Ford Mustangs launched \nFord has just revealed two special edition trim models for their pony car over in Europe. Called the Black Shadow and Blue editions, each car receives unique add-ons that give both Mustangs a sportier look. \n“The Ford Mustang has no trouble standing out on European roads, and with the new Ford Mustang Black Shadow Edition and Blue Edition models, Mustang drivers will be turning even more heads. Special edition Ford Mustangs have been an important part of the Mustang story for more than 50 years, and now customers in Europe can play their own part in the iconic car’s rich special edition history,” said Roelant de Ward, vice president, marketing, sales & service at Ford of Europe. \nStarting off with the Mustang Blue edition, this brightly-colored pony pays tribute to the Grabber colors which were available for the 1969 Shelby GT350 and GT500 specials. Aside from the distinct Grabber Blue seen here, other colors like Grabber Orange, Grabber Yellow and Grabber Lime are also available. \nEngines available for the Blue Edition Mustang include the 317 PS 2.3-liter EcoBoost and the more powerful 421 PS 5.0-liter V8. Six-speed automatic or manual transmissions can also be specified, as well as the following: SYNC 3, hood and roof stripes, 19-inch black alloy wheels and black leather seats with heating and cooling functions. \nNext up is the Mustang Black Shadow Edition that is only available with the top-of-the-range 5.0-liter V8. As the name implies, the dark-themed pony car gets a plethora of black trim accents which include the: pony emblem on the GT grill, exclusive 19-inch Y-spoke alloy wheels, black stripes on the hood and sides and black 5.0-liter badging. In terms of color, the Black Shadow can be painted in Platinum White, Triple Yellow, Race Red and Grabber Blue. \nOther standard features present in the blacked-out special are: heated and cooled front seats, premium ShakerPro audio with 12-speakers and an 8-inch subwoofer, and premium black leather upholstery. \nThere is no word if Ford plans to offer the Black Shadow and Blue Edition specials outside of Europe.

      "text": "A survey of attitudes towards autonomous vehicles by Ford suggests some parents would trust their kids to technology for the school run\n\nTwo days ago, as Ford announced that it is ramping up its autonomous car research by testing in Europe in addition to the United States, the manufacturer also revealed the results of its own research into customer attitudes towards self-driving vehicles.\n\nIt commissioned polling company Penn Schoen Berland to survey 5000 motorists across the UK, France, Germany , Norway and Spain during November.\n\nAmong the headline statistics, 16% of those who responded to Ford’s questions said they would be happy to let children travel alone in an autonomous car. \n\nBy extrapolation, of course, the response means 84% are less willing to trust their dearest to technology.\n\nHowever, it does raise the prospect of school run chaos being alleviated as a swarm of self-driving vehicles, most likely communicating with each other, calmly negotiate their way to the school gate as opposed to the frantic battle to get close to the school gates that characterises many of today’s journeys.\n\nNearly half of survey respondents thought driverless cars would be safer than those with humans at the wheel, so why not trust one to deliver your offspring in preference to a potentially fallible bus driver, for example?\n\nParents could pre-programme the route to school, set the security levels for the vehicle and use tracking technology for confirm that their child has arrived at school safe and sound. Does that sound appealing or would it leave you fraught with worry?\n\nIn the years ahead motorists across Europe will become increasingly familiar with autonomous cars as Ford and other manufacturers take to our roads with their test vehicles. Sharing the roads will be a key stage in the journey towards possible mass acceptance of self-driving cars.\n\nShould Ford repeat its survey in, say, five years, it’s possible to imagine a higher proportion of parents will be happy to trust their kids to self-driving cars.",

      "text": "Presidential jawboning is back. American companies beware.\nDonald Trump isn't even president yet but in a span of just 12 days he's twice claimed victory in getting major U.S. corporations -- Ford and Carrier Corp. -- to keep manufacturing jobs in America.\nRegardless of how substantive the deals prove to be, the strategy signals that the man who prides himself as a master negotiator will use his bully pulpit to cajole companies into toeing the administration line, a tack reminiscent of the bygone interventionist policies of Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy and Teddy Roosevelt.\nMany experts say the piecemeal approach, while saving some jobs, is probably too little, too late to reverse the long-term decline in manufacturing employment in America.\nWhat's more, for companies caught in Trump's crosshairs, risks abound. For one thing, no CEO or company wants to be a highly-public target of the president's ire. (Carrier barely even tweeted about the discussions before the deal was reached.) And even if they're granted financial incentives to keep jobs at home, corporations may find themselves stuck using antiquated technology at high costs, putting them at a disadvantage to rivals who have shifted jobs to low-cost countries.\n\"If Congress wants to erect some kind of financial Berlin Wall that prevents U.S. companies from locating productive assets abroad, let them pass a law,\" said Daniel Griswold, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. \"But let's not have our president bullying U.S. companies to retreat from global supply chains and global markets.\"\nTrump made reversing manufacturing job losses a staple of his presidential campaign, thrilling Midwestern crowds with promises to scrap or renegotiate trade deals and slap tariffs on imports if necessary. It's likely no coincidence that Ford and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies Corp., are the first to announce pullbacks from Mexico. They were two of his favorite targets during the campaign. So too were Mondelez International Inc., the maker of Oreo cookies, and Apple Inc.\nMike Mitchell, a spokesman for Mondelez, said the company has spent $450 million since 2012 to modernize domestic factories and remains \"committed to investing in our U.S. manufacturing network where it makes business sense to do so, as we seek to become more efficient, effective and competitive.\" Apple said it was \"investing heavily in American jobs and innovation.\"\nThe Trump-Carrier deal will be officially unveiled Thursday in Indianapolis. Carrier will keep about 1,000 jobs at a factory in Indiana, the company said in a statement late Wednesday. Incentives offered by the state were \"an important consideration,\" it said, without elaborating.\nMoving the operations would have saved the company about $65 million a year, which translates to a relatively insignificant 2 cents a share in earnings, said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies. Trump has pledged many times to cut corporate tax rates and regulations to spur job growth.\nUnited Technologies, a major defense contractor, may be currying favor with the incoming administration, said John Mutz, chairman of the policy committee of the Indiana Economic Development Corporation. \"When you're a supplier and the new administration is coming in, you want them to think favorably of you as a supplier,'' Mutz said.\nWhat landed Carrier on Trump's radar was its announcement in February that it was cutting 1,400 jobs in Indianapolis. Trump highlighted the news at rallies across the country. The threat of a 35 percent tariff on air-conditioning units and goods returning to the U.S. would scare Carrier executives into reversing their decision to move the jobs, he said.\n\"Here's what's going to happen,'' Trump said during an April 27 rally in Indianapolis. \"They're going to call me and they are going to say 'Mr. President, Carrier has decided to stay in Indiana.'''\nOn Tuesday night, Trump tweeted that he had reached a deal with the company.\nTrump also put Ford on the hot seat during the campaign for manufacturing vehicles in Mexico. But the circumstances of the automaker's retreat from Mexico are even murkier than the Carrier deal. In a tweet on Nov. 17, Trump appeared to claim responsibility for Ford changing course on moving production of a Lincoln sport-utility vehicle, the MKC, to Mexico. He posted the tweets after Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, told him that the automaker no longer planned to move MKC production to Mexico.\nFord, though, never planned to close its Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan in Mexico and is still planning to move all its North American small car production to Mexico.\nIntervention of this magnitude has little precedent in recent American history. Back in the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson was quick to call up corporate executives he was unhappy with. Johnson's obsession was fighting inflation, though, not protecting jobs.\nWhen Bethlehem Steel raised prices, he labeled the company unpatriotic and bullied it into backpedaling. And when he realized he had little ability to force farmers to scale back egg price increases, he ordered his surgeon general to issue warnings on the health hazards that eggs pose, Robert J. Samuelson wrote in \"The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath.\"\nJohnson's efforts were largely unsuccessful. By 1968, the last year of his administration, inflation had jumped to 4.7 percent.\nTrump's jawboning is trying to reverse a trend that goes back decades. U.S. manufacturing jobs have fallen by 29 percent in the last 20 years to a preliminary figure of 12.3 million in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAdvances in productivity, aided by factory automation and technology such as 3-D printing, will ensure that most of the lost jobs won't return, said Jefferies's Rubel.\n\"Manufacturing jobs represent a smaller part of the economy today than they ever have, and they can't come back,\" he said.\nEven as Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence are heralding the Carrier news in Indiana, for example, officers with United Steelworkers Local 1999 are negotiating with Milwaukee-based Rexnord Corp. on severance benefits for about 350 Indianapolis workers, union secretary Lisa Duncan said. The company is closing its plant there by June 2017 and shifting much of its bearings manufacturing to Mexico, she said.\nA Rexnord spokesman didn't respond to a phone message seeking comment.\nOther experts suggest that Trump's approach, even if successful at times, will harm the economy and companies. If firms like United Technologies retreat from global markets, they will become less profitable and competitive, creating fewer jobs, said George Mason's Griswold.\nBesides, it's ridiculous to think that Trump will go around the country hounding companies to save jobs in dribs and drabs, said Lee Branstetter, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\"It would be an enormous amount of effort and after a while people would start tuning out,\" he said. \"The 27th time he tries this, it's just not going to have the same punch and he knows that.\"\nPerhaps, but right now, the jawboner-in-chief appears to be just warming up.\nRelated Article \nTimeline of planned Carrier factory closing in Indiana   Related Article \nIndiana Carrier workers eager to know Trump deal details   Related Article \nClosing Indiana plant seems left out of Trump's Carrier deal   Related Article \nUnanswered questions about Trump's deal to save Indiana jobs   Related Article \nAs Trump claims to have saved Carrier jobs, details are hazy   Related Article \n282 of Donald Trump's campaign promises   Related Article \nMegyn Kelly in Lombard advises Trump: 'Try to take the high road'     Business Donald Trump Bloomberg",

      "text": "ford fiesta st news specs performance eu spec More Ford recently introduced a comprehensively revised Fiesta , but news about the performance-oriented ST model was conspicuously absent. As it turns out, the next Fiesta ST is still about a year away from making its debut.\nThe wait will be worth it, according to insiders. The ST will get the same face-lift as the other Fiesta variants, and it will receive a more aggressive-looking body kit in a bid to stand out from the newly launched ST-Line model (pictured) that’s more show than go. Both two- and four-door models will again be offered.\nMore: Here’s how to turn the Ford Focus RS into an even hotter hatch\nThe Blue Oval won’t stray too much from the formula that has made the current ST one of the best-driving hot hatches on the market. The revised model will likely carry on with a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, but it will be tuned to develop more than the 182 horses it generates under the hood of the current model. It’s unlikely to break the 200-horsepower barrier, however, and engineers say it doesn’t need to.\n“More fun doesn’t always mean more power,” affirmed Tyrone Johnson, the engineer in charge of developing Ford Performance’s ST and RS models, in an interview with Dutch publication AutoRAI . “The current Fiesta ST is not the most powerful car in its class, but it’s certainly one of the best to drive. That’s what we want to achieve. Our objective is to build the funnest, best-handling car in the segment.”\nJohnson hinted the ST will borrow some features from the Focus RS , though buyers hoping to see a four-wheel drive Fiesta with a drift mode will be disappointed. Ford’s smallest hot hatch is expected to receive three of the RS’ four driver-selectable driving modes. Each mode will modify parameters such as the response of the steering and the throttle and the firmness of the suspension.\nA full-blown Fiesta RS isn’t currently in the pipeline, though that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the long term.\n“Ultimately, it comes down to making money and setting priorities. The Focus RS was more important to develop than a Fiesta RS,” explained Joe Bakaj, Ford of Europe’s vice president of product development. “In the future, never say never,” he added.\nThe next Fiesta ST will be introduced in late 2017, and production is scheduled to kick off in early 2018. For us, that means there’s a good chance it won’t arrive in showrooms until the 2019 model year.\nFord's rugged Bronco SUV will return, according to labor leader",

      "text": "With a slew of 200-mile electric cars planned for 2018 and later, the question of how their drivers will be able to make long-distance trips is coming to the fore in a big way.\nSilicon Valley electric-car maker Tesla Motors laid out the template with its Supercharger network, which now numbers 327 sites in the U.S. and more than 400 sites outside the country.\nNow, the three German carmakers and Ford plan to join together to design and build a network of ultra-fast DC charging stations along Europe's major highways.\nRecommended: Foreign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game That network will number 400 sites by 2020, they said in a statement, and is to operate at up to 350 kilowatts—faster than today's Tesla Supercharger stations, which presently run at up to 135 kw.\nForeign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game BMW, Daimler (parent of Mercedes-Benz and Smart), and VW Group's Audi and Porsche brands joined with U.S. maker Ford to announce the joint venture Tuesday.\nThe network will be based on the Combined Charging System (CCS) protocol currently used in a lower-power version by all four makers.\nThe global group that sets software and physicals standards for the CCS specification has been working on upgrades from the current 50-kw maximum spec for many months.\nMore than a year ago, Audi pledged that a 150-kw DC fast-charging network would be available by the time its 2019 Audi e-tron all-electric crossover utility vehicle launched sometime during 2018.\nPorsche followed with a mention of 350-kw fast charging as it unveiled the concept version of its Mission E all-electric sport sedan, expected to launch in 2019.\n\"This will be an important step towards facilitating mass-market battery-electric vehicle adoption,\" said the partners in their joint statement.\nWork on the planned network is to start in 2017.\nThe 400 planned sites will incorporate \"thousands of high-powered charging points\" by 2020, they said.\nFast charging at rates as high as 350 kw could cut the time to recharge an electric-car battery to 80 percent of its capacity from the current 30 minutes or more to as little as 15 minutes.\nThat would be, in the words of the joint venture, \"as convenient as refueling at conventional gas stations.\"\nThe four founding auto companies will be equal partners, but other makers will be encouraged to participate in what the group calls a \"brand-independent network.\"\nStatements by each of the four partners said encouraging things about the future of all-electric vehicles.\nBut the announcement begs the question of whether plans for a similar network are underway for North America as well.\nThat answer is notably complicated by the $2 billion for zero-emission vehicle infrastructure that VW Group has committed to fund over 10 years in the wake of its Volkswagen diesel scandal settlement.\nNegotiations among VW Group, other carmakers, the powerful California Air Resources Board, and other stakeholders are quietly underway to develop the action plan for the first 2.5-year portion of that infrastructure.\nIn the end, Volkswagen is leading the development of that plan , most likely on the grounds that if it owns and is responsible for the infrastructure, it has a strong incentive to do it right.\nThat means BMW, Daimler, and other potential partners like Ford and General Motors will not necessarily be equal partners as they are in Europe.\nSo we'll chalk up the proposed European network as a potential future win for that region's electric-car drivers, and wait for more information on plans for a similar network in North America.\nWhich can't come too soon, but will need to be underway well in advance of the new crop of cars hitting the market during 2018.\nOver to you, VW and Co.\nThis story originally appeared on GreenCarReports .",

      "text": "AM/FM Auto Cassette Deck Ford or ?? $20.00 I have a used AM/FM cassette player that came out of a 1993 Merc Grand Marquis however it's identical to players from a wide variety of Ford vehicles later on in the 90s and as long as the face plate fits it will probably go into any vehicle. There is an identical one selling is selling on EBay for $80 and it came out of a 96 Ford Contour. I owned the Merc, and swapped the cassette player out for a CD player and has been safe in storage ever since. It worked fine while I used it although I don't have a vehicle to put it back into to test it. Call or text Dave: 250-878-1541 Contact Seller",
