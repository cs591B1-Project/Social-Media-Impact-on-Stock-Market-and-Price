      "text": "Familiarize yourself with Microsoft SCVMM features and uses by Ryann Burnett Site Editor With Microsoft SCVMM, you can leverage templates and profiles, deploy a Hyper-V cluster and create a database backup plan, among many other virtual environment management tasks.

Start by familiarizing yourself with some of the SCVMM basics, including templates and profiles, Hyper-V cluster deployment and the ever-essential database backup plan. Also, get a feel for what features are included in Microsoft SCVMM 2016. With these five quick links, you'll have a better understanding of the product and its uses. Get to know Microsoft SCVMM templates and profiles \nWith Microsoft SCVMM, you have the ability to easily create templates and profiles , which ensure consistency and eliminate the need for manual configuration. The main difference between the two is the objects to which they apply. For example, templates apply to VMs, while profiles apply to hardware allocation and applications. Templates and profiles are typically used together, but each type has a specific use case. Types of templates include Service Deployment Configurations, Service Templates and VM Templates; types of profiles include application profiles, capability profiles, guest OS profiles, hardware profiles, physical computer profiles and SQL Server profiles. Deploy a Hyper-V cluster through SCVMM \nIf you need to deploy a Hyper-V cluster, Microsoft SCVMM should be your first choice, as it offers great functionality and ease-of-use. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the requirements for doing so beforehand, though. For instance, Hyper-V nodes will only run on a supported Windows OS, and they should be available in the same host group. Also, you need to enable multipath I/O so each Hyper-V node is allowed access to Fibre Channel and iSCSI storage devices. Once you have the correct conditions, classify storage and then create and allocate logical units, which will allow you to display shared storage disks from the Create Cluster Wizard. Then you can define network and failover settings. Create an SCVMM database backup plan \nTo start, back up the SQL Server Database, since Microsoft SCVMM uses it to store its configuration information. You can do so by using either SCVMM Console or SCVMM PowerShell. Next, use the Windows Server Backup tool to take a system state backup of Windows OS when the SCVMM Server is installed. Library servers that hold file data aren't backed up as part of the SCVMM database process , so you'll need to identify them and use production backup methods. Finally, export vital configuration information from the SCVMM Server using PowerShell cmdlets. It's also recommended that you back up virtualization hosts, VMs deployed on the virtualization hosts, VM VHD and VHDX files and VM configuration files. New features in Microsoft SCVMM 2016 \nThere are substantial improvements to computing, storage and networking in SCVMM 2016, but the release also includes new features that eliminate service interruption for minor VM operational tasks. You will now have the ability to increase or decrease static memory, to enable Dynamic Memory and to hot add or remove virtual network interface cards for running VMs without any downtime. Before you perform any of these operations -- which are carried out using PowerShell cmdlets -- make sure VMs are running on Windows Server 2016 Hyper-V host. Also, it's important to note that Dynamic Memory-enabled VMs can't be used for dynamic memory management. Features Microsoft SCVMM 2016 doesn't include \nDespite the fact that that App Controller is a user-friendly component for managing virtualized workloads in private and cloud environments, it isn't included in SCVMM 2016. A potential reason behind this decision is that App Controller only provides infrastructure as a service (IaaS), while Windows Azure Pack (WAP) provides platform as a service and software as a service in addition to IaaS. For customers, this might be a tough pill to swallow, as WAP installation takes a lot of work and managing the environment requires more IT resources. Although not as significant a change, Microsoft has also removed Server App-V via VMM from SCVMM 2016. Next Steps",

The new build is available on both Windows 10 PC and Mobile , and Insiders can download it right now. This release updates Windows 10 versions 14393.447 or 14393.448 for PC and Mobile. \nMicrosoft released the new build in form of a cumulative update. Changelog is still unavailable, so we assume the new build only addressed some known bugs. The update is dubbed KB3201845 on Microsoft’s knowledge base website. \nWe’re not surprised with the fact that there’s no changelog. Microsoft rarely releases update notes for cumulative updates. However, if the company decides to release the changelog, it should arrive in a few days. If Microsoft makes the changelog available to public, it will probably appear in Windows 10’s Feedback Hub. As soon as we have more info, we’ll get you updated. \nThe cumulative update is for now only available to Insiders on the Release Preview ring. Those on the Production ring (non-Insiders) should receive the update in a few weeks, during December’s Patch Tuesday . Although we don’t know what changes the new update brings, we certainly hope it will resolve at least some of the known issues caused by previous cumulative updates for Windows 10. \nIn case you’ve already installed build 14393.479, let us know in the comments if you’ve noticed any changes. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

As with all of HP's 'x360' devices, the screen can be adjusted into any position that you want, offering four modes: notebook, tablet, stand, and tent. \nThe company is promising student-friendly features, \"including an optional active pen to make math, art, note-taking in OneNote or highlighting in Microsoft Edge easier than ever.\" It also includes the Take a Test app, which should help teachers to create test-taking environments. \nThe device is available with different specs, including either an Intel Celeron or Pentium processor, 8GB RAM, and between 64GB and 256GB of internal storage. As one would expect, it ships with Windows 10; while it's offered in Home and Pro, HP recommends Pro for schools. \nIt's also designed to pass MIL-STD 810G testing, which means that it's salt-, fog-, humidity-, transport shock-, thermal shock-resistant, and more. According to Microsoft, HP dropped hundreds of PCs from a distance of 29.5-inches, which is about the height of a desk in a school. \nThe device uses dual cameras, so they can be used in any mode, it offers up to 11 hours of battery life, and includes USB 3.1 Type C.",

      "text": "By James Marshall Updated February 21, 2016 . \nMicrosoft Word 2003 or 2007 can identify certain types of data in a document, such as an address or phone number, and apply a smart tag to it. The smart tag is indicated by a purple underline of the identified data text, and it allows you to use additional features related to the tagged text.If you place your mouse pointer over the text, a small box labeled with an “i” appears. Clicking on this box will open a menu of possible smart tag actions that Word can perform based on the data. For example, a smart tagged address gives you the option to add the address to your Outlook contacts. This saves you from having to select and copy the address, open Outlook, and then follow the process of creating a new contact. Disabling Smart Tags \nSome users find smart tags can get in the way of work. As a solution, smart tags may be disabled selectively, or they may be disabled entirely. \nTo turn off a smart tag, follow these steps: Hold your mouse pointer over the smart tag text. \ncontinue reading below our video Choosing the Best Smartphone for YOU When the Smart Tag button appears, click it. Click Remove this Smart Tag from the menu. If you want to remove all instances of that Smart Tag from your document, instead move your mouse down to the Stop recognizing… menu item and select as Smart Tag from the secondary menu. \nTo disable Smart Tags entirely, follow these steps: \nWord 2003",

      "text": "The latest usage share reports are in and they don't give Microsoft many reasons to rejoice when it comes to the company's core products Windows 10, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.\nWindows 10 performed considerably well this month, considering that the operating system's usage share rise stopped dead in its tracks when the free for all offer expired.\nIn the past two months, according to Net Market Share , , Windows 10 went down from an all-high of 22.99% to 22.59% (August to October).\nIt is only in this month that the operating system managed to gain a noticeable share, jumping up to 23.72% from 22.59%.\nIf you compare the December 2016 stats to those of January 2016, you will notice that Windows 10 doubled its usage share in that time.\nWhile the usage share of all other versions of Windows fell in the year, the drops were not as dramatic as Microsoft may have hoped them to be.\nWindows XP, the aging no-longer-supported operating system fell from 11.42% to 8.63, Windows 7 fell from 52.47% to 47.17%, and windows 8.1 from 10.40% to 8.01%.\nMost users cling to their operating system and it seems unlikely that they will upgrade to Windows 10 in masses anytime soon.\n\nIf you look at the statistics of StatCounter , you see a similar picture. Windows 10's usage share rose from 24.81% to 26.2% in November. Windows XP and 8.1 remained fairly stable, while Windows 7 managed to rise as well by 1.05% to 40.02%.\nTo be fair, this looks a lot like a recording issue more than anything else as the number of unknown devices dropped by more than 1% in November while all other operating system versions remained fairly stable.\nThe January to December comparison paints the same picture that Net Market Share revealed. Windows 10 managed to nearly double its usage share in 2016, while all other versions of Windows fell a bit but not extremely.\nIE and Edge So what about Internet Explorer and Edge? Internet Explorer continued its fall. The browser fell from a usage share of 43.82% in January 2016 to 21.66% in December 2016.\nThe browser's usage share halved in that time. While Microsoft may have hoped that its Edge browser would gain the bulk of the share, that is apparently not the case.\nEdge continues to go nowhere this year. While it managed to jump from 3.07% to 5.21% this year, this is nothing to brag about considering that Microsoft is pushing the browser quite aggressively on Windows 10.\nThe past six months have been extremely telling, with Edge rising a mere 0.12% in that time.\nStatCounter's statistics tell a different story this time. The service recorded Internet Explorer's usage share at 15.95% in January 2016, and at 9.66% in November 2016. That's not even half of what Net Market Share recorded for the browser.\nThe situation is even more grim for Edge which StatCounter saw at 1.82% in January, and at 3.19% in November 2016.\nClosing Words It is too early to tell if Windows 10 will make sizeable gains in the coming months, or if things will slow down to a crawl again. It is almost certain that the coming months won't change a thing for Internet Explorer's downfall, and Edge's continuance in the position it is in right now.\nNow You : Where do you think will Windows 10, Edge and Internet Explorer be at the end of 2017?\nGhacks needs you.

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Dial Teardown Shows Intricate Guts And Tough Repairability",
      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Thursday, December 01, 2016 Microsoft Surface Dial Teardown Shows Intricate Guts And Tough Repairability We saw in a teardown analysis earlier this week how difficult it is to perform at-home repairs and upgrades on Microsoft's recently announced Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, which comes with several core components soldered to the motherboard, but what about the hockey puck shaped Surface Dial accessory that goes along with it? Don't hold your breath hoping that it's any less difficult to work on. About the only thing that can be done on the Surface Dial without a bucket of courage and years of experience is swap out the pair of AAA batteries as needed. The rubber bottom protecting the battery compartment is held on with magnets and pops off with ease—there's no annoying adhesive holding it in place or even plastic clips that can sometimes to be a nuisance. Digging any deeper presents a challenge. The experienced repair folks at iFixIt described in their teardown log how difficult it was popping the mid-frame out of the Surface Dial chassis, which required the use of a metal spudger. \"Some aggressive prying led to aggressive snapping which led to aggressive... well, let's just say the mid-frame didn't come out without a fight,\" the repair gurus noted. Four evenly placed magnets can be seen underneath the mid-frame. They're the same ones that pull and hold the cover in place, as well as give the Surface Dial added grip to the Surface Studio's display. With the mid-frame removed, the interior electronics come into sight. This is also where things get decidedly more tricky. The board inside the Surface Dial spins but doesn't pop out. Ah, but there's a trick. There's a single access hole that needs to be lined up with each of the T6 screws holding the body to the silver cover. Once those are removed, the guts start to spill out from the outer casing. There are still pieces to disassemble at that point, at least for a full teardown, and it takes some patience and a steady hand. However, most people probably won't get that far. For one, the components most likely to fail can't be replaced without likely damaging the device. And if the haptic motor goes out, it's a tough swap—it's \"cemented down with some spectacularly tough glue.\" For those reasons and more, the Surface Dial earned itself a mediocre 4 out 10 Repairability Score.",

      "text": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella questioned by shareholders on mobile strategy Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella questioned by shareholders on mobile strategy Posted: Tags : Microsoft - Microsoft + At its annual shareholder meeting, which was held on November 30th, Microsoft had to answer multiple questions regarding the company's future ambitions regarding mobile devices. The conference began with the announcement “Please silence all Windows Phones and other devices” - words which in any other circumstance would sound comical. However, as this was an exclusive Microsoft event, there were a lot of fans of Windows Mobile present, and some of them expressed a genuine concern in relation to Microsoft's apparent mobile retraction.Nowadays, the software giant has limited it's handset production to a smaller number of premium devices, a fact that prompted a shareholder who claimed to use his Windows Phone device for “18 hours a day” to ask Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella “Can you calm me down… and tell me what your vision is for mobile?” after hearing that the company could potentially be “stepping away from mobile.” Nadella's response indicated that focus is currently shifted towards bringing innovation to the market: We think about mobility broadly. In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device. That said, we’re not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices. What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated on Windows Phone is on manageability. It’s security, it’s Continuum capability — that is, the ability to have a phone that can act like a PC. So we’re going to double-down on those points of differentiation. He hailed the HP Elite x3 as a Windows 10 phone that successfully follows this approach and his reply reconfirmed the company's ambition to build the “ ultimate mobile device ”.Dana Vance, a longtime shareholder, avid Windows Phone admirer and owner of a Microsoft Band questioned Nadella about the company's vision for it's consumer devices, after citing reports that indicated that the Band project has been suspended indefinitely . Vance also mentioned that he was surprised to receive an e-mail, which stated that the Microsoft Pix and Outlook apps were available for Android and iPhone but not for Windows Phone. In response, Satya Nadella declared that the company is “not stepping away” from supporting Windows Phone users, but insisted that Microsoft software must also be available to other mobile platforms: We will keep looking at different forms and different functions that we can bring to mobile devices, while also supporting our software across a variety of devices. So that’s the approach you will see us take. We are not stepping away from supporting our Windows Phone users. But at the same time we are recognizing that there are other platforms in mobile that have higher share, and we want to make sure that our software is available to them.",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Q. In Windows 10, how do you change the name Cortana calls you when you talk to her? A. If Cortana , Microsoft ’s digital assistant, is calling you by the wrong name (or mispronouncing your name) during your verbal exchanges, you can correct the situation in a few easy steps. In the latest version of Windows 10, start by clicking into the Cortana box in the task bar and selecting the Notebook icon on the edge of the Cortana window; it’s the third icon from the top. You can also just say “Hey, Cortana, open your Notebook settings .” When the Notebook menu opens, select About Me from the list. On the next screen, click the Change My Name button. Photo If you open the Cortana Notebook settings and click the Change My Name button, you can tell the software how to address you. Credit The New York Times On the next screen, under “What would you like me to call you?” type in the name you would prefer to be called. Click the Enter button. You can hear how the program will pronounce your name by selecting the “Hear how I’ll say it” button on the next screen. After you hear the sample, click either the Sounds Good button or the button labeled That’s Wrong. You can give Cortana a sample of the correct pronunciation by saying it aloud. (If the software is still butchering your name, try typing in a phonetic spelling instead.) Once you have accepted Cortana’s rendition, the program should address you that way in all your future interactions. The Notebook area is where Cortana keeps the settings for displaying other information about you and your life. Depending on what you choose to enable in the Notebook, you can have the Cortana home screen show the weather forecast based on your location, current traffic in your area, local news and sports headlines, your calendar schedule and more. \nPersonal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to .

Office 2016 is still available as a stand alone install that is licensed to each device through your normal licensing channels or you can subscribe to Office 365 and get the latest updates to the entire suite of software plus additional services such as OneDrive for Business and the new Microsoft Teams. \nWhichever path you choose, Microsoft has recently updated their series of Quick Starts for Office 2016 guides that can be very valuable tools in helping your users through the migration from an older software suite like Office 2007 to the more modern and collaborative software in Office 2016 and Office 365. \nThe updated guides are available in several formats including Microsoft Sway, PDF and browser based as shown below. \nOnline Versions",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 6 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft is bringing its popular Halo franchise to TV - but not in the way you might expect. Microsoft Studios' 343 Industries has teamed up with Pilgrim Media Group to develop a new 'reality series' focusing on the game in the context of eSports and competitive gaming. \n\"We continue to be blown away by the sheer excitement surrounding e-sports; the scope and buzz are growing every day,\" said Pilgrim's Craig Piligian. \"E-sports and Halo fans are exceedingly passionate about gaming and devoted to their favorite titles and franchises - they are exactly the kind of audience we want to produce for.\" \nThe new show is part of wider efforts to develop content around the growing eSports industry, which is estimated to be worth $1 billion by 2018. \nPilgrim partnered with media giant Lionsgate and eSports specialist ESL this year to focus on generating more of this content, and with Halo 's popularity in the competitive gaming space, it seems like a good fit for a show of this kind. The Halo World Championship and Halo Championship Series have gained a strong following among gamers and fans in North America and Europe. \nMicrosoft's Kiki Wolfkill, head of Halo Transmedia and Entertainment at 343 Industries, said: \nWe're thrilled to be partnering with Pilgrim on developing a reality series that will bring the intensity and extreme competition of Halo 5: Guardians eSports to a television audience. There is no better partner than Pilgrim to give our fans insights into the world of Halo eSports. \nBut there are few details available about the new show so far. The exact format of the series hasn't yet been revealed, nor has a planned broadcast date or TV network been announced. It's possible that the series may not be shown on 'traditional' broadcast TV, given the increasing popularity of streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video.",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft today added two more games to the Xbox One Backward Compatibility list, adding Haunted House and Injustice: Gods Among Us . \nThe list is closing in on its next milestone of 300 titles, as today's additions put it at 297. Its last milestone was on September 15, when Microsoft announced that it had 250 backward compatible games . Four games were added on Tuesday , so if the company keeps its usual pace, we should see a total of over 300 next week. \nHaunted House ($4.99) \nEnter the Haunted House, if you dare. Atari’s classic groundbreaking game is back with more chills, cool new unlockables and plenty of spooky new enemies. Discover hidden secrets, mystical tombs, and new towers and catacombs, as you follow your grandfather’s footsteps on an epic adventure, searching for the magical urn that will lead you to his whereabouts. But beware – danger lurks behind every corner! Are you brave enough for the task, or are you afraid of the dark depths of The Haunted House? \nInjustice: Gods Among Us ($19.99) \nWhat if our greatest heroes became our greatest threat? Injustice: Gods Among Us introduces a bold new franchise to the fighting game genre from NetherRealm Studios, creators of Mortal Kombat. Featuring DC Comics icons such as Batman, The Joker, Green Lantern, The Flash, Superman and Wonder Woman, the latest title from the award-winning studio presents a deep original story. Heroes and villains will engage in epic battles on a massive scale in a world where the line between good and evil has been blurred. \nOf course, today is the first of the month, which can only mean one thing. It's time for this month's Games with Gold , which like backward compatibility, is a great way to grab fun games on the cheap. \nAs of today, you can grab Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition (Xbox One) and Outland (Xbox 360) for absolutely free, as long as you're an Xbox Live Gold member and you claim them within the specified dates. You've also got until the 15th to get Murdered: Soul Suspect (Xbox One), which was part of last month's Games with Gold . Tags",

      "title": "Windows Phone-loving shareholders question Microsoft’s mobile strategy",
      "text": "At its annual shareholder meeting yesterday, some Microsoft shareholders were more than a little concerned about the company's mobile strategy, or if it even had one, reports GeekWire .\nThe meeting, which started with a request to \"silence all Windows Phones and devices,\" gives the company's owners a rare opportunity to grill CEO Satya Nadella, and among the audience were some dedicated Windows Phone fans. One such Windows Phone-using shareholder, Dana Vance, expressed his surprise that Microsoft had released apps such as its Pix photo app and Outlook apps for Android and iPhone, but not its own platform. Vance is also an owner of the Band fitness wearable, and he alluded to claims that development of the device has been halted. With Microsoft appearing to downplay these two consumer-facing devices, he asked Nadella to explain the company's plans for consumer devices.\nIn response, Nadella gave the same kind of reply as he's given a number of times; the kind of reply that arguably prompted these questions in the first place. \"When we control things silicon-up, that's how we will integrate those experiences,\" Nadella said. Microsoft will \"build devices that are unique and differentiated with our software capability on top of it—whether it's Surface or Surface Studio or HoloLens or the phone—and also make our software applications available on Android and iOS and other platforms. That's what I think is needed in order for Microsoft to help you as a user get the most out of our innovation.\" Per Geekwire, Nadella did also say that the Windows camera and mail apps would include features found in the apps for other platforms, but it's not clear when this will happen, or whether Microsoft's Windows apps will persistently trail behind its non-Windows apps.\nA second shareholder who claimed to use his Windows Phone \"18 hours a day\" said that he'd heard the company is \"stepping away from mobile\" and so asked Nadella, \"Can you calm me down... and tell me what your vision is for mobile?\"\nNadella's answer was that the company would continue to focus on areas of differentiation; manageability, security, and the Continuum feature that enables a phone to be used to run PC-like apps (an ability that is set to be expanded in 2017):\nYes. So, our overall approach again to the previous question is we think about mobility broadly. In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device. That said we are not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices.\nWhat we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated in Windows phone is its manageability, its security, its continuing capability that is the ability to have a phone that in fact can even act like a PC. So, we are going to double down on those points of differentiation. In fact, the HP X3, which came out recently, is perhaps a great example of a differentiated device built using the Windows phone platform and that sort of points for the direction. We will keep looking at different forms, different functions that we can bring to mobile devices, while also supporting our software across a variety of devices. So, that’s the approach you will see us take.\nWe are not stepping away from supporting our Windows phone users. But at the same time, we are recognizing that there are other platforms in mobile that have higher share and we want to make sure that our software is available on that.\nNadella has made similar comments throughout the year. While on the one hand the concept of \"the phone as the PC\" continues to inspire people —and may be an area that Microsoft can offer considerable value —it doesn't do much for Redmond's platform right now, and it has little obvious appeal to the all-important consumer market. As such, it's unlikely that this answer provides the satisfaction that the dying breed of Windows Phone fans is hoping for.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has just made its Swiftkey keyboard more attractive to casual users. In a new backend update to the app, users on the iPhone and Android can now get Swiftkey’s many themes for the price of free.\nSwiftkey offers dozens of themes on Android and just under a score of them on the iPhone and iPad. While the app previously charged consumers from the price of £0.79/$1 to purchase these themes, with Microsoft now funding the small group, it no longer needs to use in-app purchases to fund the app. Aside from that, Microsoft’s new Word Flow keyboard is also free on iOS, with theme support included, so Swiftkey is just going along with the program.\nAside from that, Swiftkey’s machine learning features and research into natural language processes and artificial intelligence make the data from Swiftkey users valuable enough that it being a free product would improve its overall value proposition.\nThat’s not all the changes Microsoft has made to Swiftkey as of recent. The firm also added new clipboard functionality, allowing users of the app to be able to switch store pieces of data easily on the app so they could access it on the fly during conversations.\nSwiftkey has been improving steadily and still remains on of the best keyboards you can get for your iPhone or Android.\nYou can download Swiftkey from the App Store and the Play Store. \n",

      "text": "\nEarlier this year, Microsoft launched a new program called the Cloud Storage Partner Program for Office on the iPhone and Office Online. The Cloud Storage Partner Program (CSPP) essentially allows third-party cloud storage providers to integrate their service into Office apps, including Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Microsoft says:\nIt’s easy to add a cloud storage provider from the Add a place menu in the latest versions of Word, Exceland PowerPoint on Android. Then you can edit and share your documents stored with that provider as easily as you do with those stored on OneDrive. You can also launch Word, Excel or PowerPoint directly from the cloud storage provider’s app to edit your files, with changes automatically saved back to the cloud.\nA couple of Microsoft’s close partners have already added integration for the Office over the past couple of months, including Dropbox, Box, Egnyte, and more. The company says it’ll add integration for Citrix ShareFile, Edmodo and Learnium soon.\n",

      "text": "Hitman Forza Horizon 3 \nMicrosoft’s strategy for HDR support on the Xbox One S varies drastically from that of Sony. The latter company launched the budget-priced PlayStation 4 “Slim,” as well as the PlayStation 4 Pro with high-dynamic range support out of the box. Original PlayStation 4 systems were also given HDR support via a software update. Older, first-party games like Infamous: Second Son and third-party releases such as Call of Duty: Black Ops III , Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor , and The Last of Us: Remastered were also recently patched to support the technology. \nMore: Here’s every current and upcoming game you’ll want to play in 4K HDR on the PS4 Pro \nThough Microsoft has only announced HDR support for a few of its titles, the feature is all but guaranteed for future first-party releases. The last three Microsoft-published games — Gears of War 4 , Forza Horizon 3 , and ReCore — all support HDR, and with the launch of the 4K-ready Scorpio console next year, it would be downright silly for games such as Halo Wars 2 and Crackdown to skip out on the enhanced visuals afforded by HDR. \nWe expect the list of support games to grow substantially in the future. Be sure to check back as we update this page with more HDR-supported games as they’re announced. Also watch: ",

      "text": "\nToday, Microsoft released a pretty major update for Windows 10 to Insiders in the Fast Ring. The update, build 14977, introduces a new feature and some other improvements. Unlike most of the recent builds, the latest build is only available for Mobile devices which is pretty interesting.\nThe new build only includes one new feature, and that’s support for EPUB books in Microsoft Edge. This feature was added to Windows 10 PC a few weeks ago, and it’s now on Edge for Mobile as well. For those who don’t know, this feature allows you to view .EPUB files right from Edge on your Windows 10 Mobile device. Microsoft Edge lets you change the font size, font family and there’s also three different themes for the EPUB reader. Additionally, the feature also lets you bookmark certain parts of an EPUB file, which is also very nice.\nMicrosoft will not release a new PC build this week due to a blocking bug which causes some apps to break after updating to a new build.\nIf you are a Windows Insider in the Fast Ring, you should be able to install Windows 10 Build 14977 from Windows Update in the Settings app.",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIt's been two weeks since Microsoft released Windows 10 for PCs build 14971 - due to last week's Thanksgiving holiday in the United States - and today, the company has released build 14977 for Mobile to the Fast ring. \nIn fact, it's been over three weeks since a build was released for phones. Build 14965 was made available on November 9 , and it was even offered to the Slow ring on the 16th . Due to some bugs, 14971 was never made available for Mobile, and of course, last week was a holiday week. \nHere's what's new: \nRead EPUB books in Microsoft Edge on your phone: In addition to being able to read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format on your PC with Microsoft Edge – you can also read unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge on your phone! When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. As you read, you can leave bookmarks. To navigate through an e-book, you can use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser. And you can also search for words or phrases and use Cortana to define specific words. \nYou can download and read unprotected e-books from places like Feedbooks, Project Gutenberg, Free eBooks (requires sign-up), ePubBooks (requires sign-up), Open Library and even our own Microsoft Press. Try out reading an e-book in Microsoft Edge on your phone and let us know what you think! \nWhile there isn't a whole lot in the way of new features, Windows phone users are sure to apprecate a Mobile-only build, as those are rare. If a Fast ring build is only made available for one, it's usually PCs. \nAs for PC users, you'll just have to wait until next week, as Fast ring builds tend to be released weekly, while Slow ring builds are monthly.

      "title": "Here are the fixes, improvements, and known issues in Windows 10 Mobile build 14977",
      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 3 seconds ago \nToday, Microsoft released the rare Windows 10 Mobile-only Fast ring build, 14977 . The one big feature that it included is the ability to read EPUB documents in the Edge browser, a feature that was made available to Fast ring PCs with build 14971 . \nWhile the build is light on major new features, it does contain a list of fixes, improvements, and known issues. Here's what got fixed and improved in Windows 10 Mobile build 14977: \nWe’ve changed the rendering technology used for many types of UWP app content, so please provide feedback through the Feedback Hub if you notice any new visual glitches in UWP apps. \nAlarms sent by 3rd party alarm apps will now break through Cortana’s Quiet Hours – we appreciate all the app developers who logged feedback requesting this, keep it coming! \nWe’ve removed the top-level option in Notification Settings to disable alarms on the lock screen – alarm reliability is a top priority for us, and we’ve found this setting was frequently enabled accidentally, without awareness that it would stop alarms from waking the phone when the phone was locked. For those who still wish to enable this setting, it’s will continue to be available under the per-app notification settings. \nNotifications from Settings can now be customized or disabled – option is available under Settings > System > Notifications > Settings \nWe have enabled OAuth support for Yahoo Mail accounts. This will improve sync reliability for those accounts, and provide a secure experience while browsing your email. \nWe fixed an issue where disconnecting and reconnecting a wired headset while watching a video might result the audio no longer working. \nWe fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where certain music apps would unexpectedly stop playing music after a single song. \nWe fixed an issue where closing a tab in Microsoft Edge, exiting the app, and then relaunching it would sometimes result in Edge opening to a blank page with the closed tab’s web address in the URL bar. \nWe fixed an issue where the Start Settings page wasn’t rendering when opened on external screen while using Continuum. \nWe’ve made a number of translation improvements, including, for French (France and Canada) speakers, fixing a grammatical error in the “Don’t Forget!” text seen when shutting down the phone so it now says “N’oubliez pas”, and for Chinese speakers, fixing an issue where the option to clear the Chinese Input Method Editor’s input history was displaying in English rather than Chinese. If you see any other translations that aren’t as you’d expect, please log feedback – we’re listening! \nWe fixed an issue where, if the setting to show notifications above lock had been turned off, booting the device and immediately checking the Action Center while the phone was locked could result in the Action Center not displaying any notifications after the phone had been unlocked. \nWe fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where the Camera app might not appear after using the hardware camera button while the screen was off or while on the Glance screen. \nWe fixed an issue where Bangla (Bangladesh) keyboard text prediction might stop working after entering character followed by a vowel mark. \nHere are the known issues: \nPlease avoid attempting to install new languages, keyboards, and speech packs on your phone. There is a chance these downloads may get stuck and not finish downloading. If you have existing languages, keyboards, and speech packs installed – they will carry over when you update to new builds. You can use Windows Device Recovery Tool to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, install any languages, keyboards, and speech packs you need and then update to the latest build in the Fast ring as a workaround. \nWindows 10 phones with 8GB of internal storage such as the Lumia 550 and 650 will likely receive an 0x800700b7 error when attempting to update to this build. \nSystem related notification toasts (e.g. Bluetooth, USB/Autoplay, etc.) do not work. \nAs you can see, some of these are major known issues. For example, some phones might throw an error when upgrading, an issue for which there is no workarounds. Language packs may be a big deal to you, but you can always roll back to an earlier build with the Windows Device Recovery Tool, install the language pack, and upgrade again. This was an issue in earlier builds as well. \nTo install Windows 10 Mobile build 14977, head over to Settings -> Update & security -> Phone update -> Check for updates. If you're not on the Fast ring, go to the Windows Insider Program tab, tap Get started, and when your phone reboots, go back and make sure that it's set to the Fast ring. Tags",

      "text": "Box has updated its Microsoft partnership with a feature enabling you to easily access files from the cloud-based file storage service onto the mobile versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. This comes months after Box was named to Microsoft’s Cloud Storage Partner Program (CSPP), which has expanded today to Android devices.\nStarting today, you can select Box as the default cloud service in Office for Android. When enabled, easily access, edit, or create content from the native mobile apps. This means that you can take that spreadsheet and fill in some missing details before saving it back to Box. Additionally, you can assign tasks to collaborators, complete a PowerPoint, and more. No longer will you have to save files from Box into Google Drive or another cloud service just to open it up in Office for Android.\nAfter years of poking fun at Microsoft, in 2013 Box struck a partnership with the software technology company. Among the integrations include generating shareable links for email attachments and a beta program for Box’s tie-in with Office 365 on desktop. It previously let you create and edit Office Online files, but today as promised , it has brought these features to mobile apps.\n",

They're easier for browsing the web, playing games, and pretty much everything. Big phones often have a tendency to cost a lot of money though, and this aspect of them isn't nearly as great as their large, gorgeous displays. Black Friday and Cyber Monday might be over, but that doesn't mean it's too late to save some cash on a new smartphone. Amazon is currently selling the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL at a discounted price, allowing you to score a large phone for under $100. The Lumia 640 XL boasts a massive 5.7-inch display with an IPS panel and resolution of 1280 x 720, and Gorilla Glass 3 helps to ensure that the screen doesn't get easily littered with scratches and blemishes. A 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor and 1GB of RAM keep Windows 10 Mobile chugging along, and expandable memory up to 256GB via microSD card should mean that you've always got plenty of storage. When it comes time to take some pictures, a 13MP camera on the back and 5MP camera up front should be perfectly serviceable for Instagram posts, and a large 3000 mAh battery means you won't have to be constantly looking for a wall outlet to charge the phone. The specs here may not be fantastic, but the Lumia 640 XL is a perfectly serviceable handset for someone looking to do simple tasks, such as making calls, texting, and light Internet browsing, on a large screen. While the Lumia 640 XL normally costs $99.99, Amazon is currently selling it for just $69.99. That's a savings of $30, making an already cheap phone even more affordable. Do note that this is the AT&T model of the phone, so if you're with another carrier, you're going to want to look elsewhere.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s Power BI app has been available on Windows 10, Android and iOS for a little while now. And today, the company is releasing Power BI for Android tablets. The initial release of the app is a preview, which means that it’ll have some rough edges and early issues. Power BI for Android tablets will offer a similar experience if you have previously used the Windows 10 app in your PC. However, the general look and feel of the app match Power BI on any other platform, including the Web. Here are some of the features of the app:\nFamiliar and consistent Power BI experience: The new app for Android tablets combines the familiar look of our Power BI apps with a touch-friendly experience designed for Android tablets. Like our other apps, dashboards and reports render beautifully and you can interact with them using touch. Within the reports, you can slice and dice your data, drill through data hierarchy, and even filter to focus on specific data. Stay connected to your data anywhere, anytime: Set data-driven alerts to stay on top of your most important metrics directly on your tablet. Data alerts are fully synchronized across all platforms so all your alerts will now be available in your Android tablet. The Android tablet also supports offline capabilities so you can still access your data even when you’re traveling or have limited connectivity. Find what you need quickly: For quicker access to your data, you can flag your favorite dashboards right in the app. Alternatively, use search in the app to access your most recently viewed items and find other dashboards, reports, and groups available to you across the app. You can also scan a QR codewith the scanner in Power BI on your tablet to get directly to any dashboard tile or report. Microsoft has also released a video, where the company provided a closer look at the app:\nIf you own an Android tablet, you can get Power BI on it from the Google Play Store here. \n",

      "title": "Microsoft shareholders express fear that the company is abandoning mobile",
      "text": "(credit: Microsoft)\nAt its annual shareholder meeting yesterday, some Microsoft shareholders were more than a little concerned about the company's mobile strategy, or if it even had one, reports GeekWire .\nThe meeting, which started with a request to \"silence all Windows Phones and devices,\" gives the company's owners a rare opportunity to grill CEO Satya Nadella, and among the audience were some dedicated Windows Phone fans. One such Windows Phone-using shareholder, Dana Vance, expressed his surprise that Microsoft had released apps such as its Pix photo app and Outlook apps for Android and iPhone, but not its own platform. Vance is also an owner of the Band fitness wearable, and he alluded to claims that development of the device has been halted. With Microsoft appearing to downplay these two consumer-facing devices, he asked Nadella to explain the company's plans for consumer devices.\nIn response, Nadella gave the same kind of reply as he's given a number of times; the kind of reply that arguably prompted these questions in the first place. \"When we control things silicon-up, that's how we will integrate those experiences,\" Nadella said. Microsoft will \"build devices that are unique and differentiated with our software capability on top of it—whether it's Surface or Surface Studio or HoloLens or the phone—and also make our software applications available on Android and iOS and other platforms. That's what I think is needed in order for Microsoft to help you as a user get the most out of our innovation.\" Per Geekwire, Nadella did also say that the Windows camera and mail apps would include features found in the apps for other platforms, but it's not clear when this will happen, or whether Microsoft's Windows apps will persistently trail behind its non-Windows apps.\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft releases a new Windows 10 Creators Update build to Windows Phone Insiders Ahead of next week's WinHEC China event, Microsoft has released a new Windows 10 Mobile test build for Fast Ring phone Insiders, 14977. | Topic: Windows 10 \nAfter several weeks of no new Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update test builds, Microsoft released on December 1 a new Fast Ring build for Windows Phone Insiders. \nWindows 10 Creators Update (a k a \"Redstone 2\") Build 14977 adds very little in the new features department. But it does include a bunch of fixes. \n(Microsoft officials said there is no new PC test build today due to an unspecified \"blocking bug.\") \nBuild 14977 adds the ability to read EPUB file-formatted e-books in Microsoft Edge. It also includes a change in the rendering technology used for many types of Universal Windows Platform apps, as well as some other relatively minor tweaks around OAuth, notifications customizations and more. \nOn the known issues front , Windows 10 phone users with 8 GB of internal storage -- like the Lumia 550 and 650 -- will receive errors when attempting to update to this build. System related notification toasts don't work. And testers should avoid attempting to install new languages, keyboards and speech packs with this build, Microsoft officials warned. \nThe Windows 10 Creators Update is expected to be released to mainstream users in the Spring of 2017. The internal ship target for delivery is March 2017 , sources have said. \nNext week at WinHEC in Shenzen, China , Microsoft is expected to talk to its OEM partners more about features coming in future releases of Windows 10, including the Creators Update. More information on Microsoft's planned addition of the Windows Holographic shell to the Creators Update is likely. I wouldn't be too surprised if OEMs also hear more about \"Cobalt,\" Microsoft's planned x86 on ARM emulation technology , at WinHEC next week, too, even though that feature isn't expected to debut in Windows 10 before Fall 2017.

REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo More By Paola Totaro\nLONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Two multi-national tech companies previously questioned over labour and workforce conditions have won a new global award for turning the spotlight onto their own supply chains to eradicate modern day slavery from their operations.\nThe inaugural Thomson Reuters Foundation Stop Slavery Award was conferred on U.S. technology company Hewlett Packard Enterprise and NXP Semiconductors, the world's largest chip supplier to the automotive industry.\nThe award, designed by Turner Prize winning sculptor Anish Kapoor, aims to recognise businesses that submit their labour practices to scrutiny and excel in efforts to investigate human rights abuses and clean up their supply chain.\nThe winners were chosen from a shortlist of 10 companies employing thousands of people in sectors ranging from electronics to retail to mining and included Apple, Tesco and global seafood producer Thai Union.\n\"As some of the biggest companies in the world, we have a particular responsibility to eradicate forced labour from our supply chains,\" Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman said in a video message as the award was announced late Wednesday at Trust Women, an annual trafficking and women's rights conference.\n\"I believe we need a combination of teamwork between individual corporations, governments, investors and other stakeholders to tackle the root causes of forced labour. Together I know we can.\"\nThe award to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, for transparency and response to challenge, recognised the company's commitment to seek expert input to scrutinize its supply chains and to share this information.\nMEDIA SPOTLIGHT\nIn 2011 Hewlett Packard, which has a workforce of about 315,000, recognised a growing risk for forced labour among foreign migrant workers, particularly in Southeast Asia, so hosted a series of anti-trafficking workshops with suppliers and labour agencies in the region.\nOrganisers of the award said it was interesting that all of the short-listed companies had received media attention highlighting modern slavery risks related to their business operations or supply chains.\nThe short-list was selected after companies completed a detailed questionnaire, designed in partnership with human rights specialists at multi-national law firm Baker & McKenzie, giving significant detail of their operations.\nThe criteria were developed using a combination of existing standards, including the UK Modern Slavery Act and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, as well as other global best practice standards.\nAn independent specialist assessed the company submissions on the strength of anti-trafficking policies already in place as well as their ability to identify and respond to problems.\nJudges chose Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors, which employs 45,000 people in 35 countries, to win the award for policy and implementation, largely due to its robust internal practices and programmes.\nNXP's Chief Executive Richard Clemmer said the company's anti-slavery work began five years ago when a customer helped uncover evidence that recruitment companies were charging fees or holding families hostage for money to secure jobs at NXP.\n\"These were issues different to what the term 'slavery' usually means to people but we were able to eradicate it,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe company established an accountability system which requires its board of directors and CEO to sign off on all human trafficking policies and activities and this is backed up by global training protocols.\nIt also identifies vulnerable worker populations and conducts targeted training. In 2016, they retrained over 300 suppliers in Malaysia.\n\"This is the way we ensure we are good global citizens and that anyone we do business with follows the same high standards that we do,\" Clemmer said.\n\"We have a complete team that goes out to audit and train procurement organisations to establish the right principles and processes with suppliers. We train so that working conditions are safe and healthy.\"\n(Reporting by Paola Totaro, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights and climate change.

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nEarlier this week, the legendary iFixit team took an intimate look at Microsoft's Surface Studio, disassembling the new all-in-one desktop PC , and revealing a rather unexpected discovery . Now, it has turned its attentions to another of Microsoft's newest devices: the Surface Dial interaction tool, which was unveiled alongside the Studio in October . \nDescribed by Microsoft as \"a new tool for the creative process\", the $99.99 Dial works best with the Surface Studio, allowing users to interact with interface elements directly on the PC's 28-inch display by pushing down or rotating the Dial. The Dial can also be used with other Windows 10 devices, albeit with different levels of support. \nAs ever, iFixit has meticulously deconstructed the Surface Dial, piece by piece, to reveal its inner workings. But even before they really got into it, they were pleasantly surprised to note that the battery bay is extremely easy for users to access, under the 'sticky rubber foot' of the device, which is held in place by magnets. \nThey also complimented Microsoft on \"the Dial's solid construction\", although that did make it a bit of a challenge to dismantle it. \"Some aggressive prying led to aggressive snapping which led to aggressive... well, let's just say the midframe didn't come out with a fight,\" iFixit explained. \nIndeed, that tight construction, and the methods Microsoft used to assemble all of the components have resulted in a fairly low iFixit Repairability Score of 4 out of 10: \"While it is durable, and repairs are unlikely, the components most likely to fail can't be replaced without damaging the device.\" \nTo see all of the Surface Dial's innards - including a close-up look at its Nordic Semiconductor nRF52832 Bluetooth Low Energy SoC, and haptic vibration motor - check out the full iFixit post here . \nSource and teardown images: iFixit via OnMSFT Tags",

      "text": "12/01/16 AT 1:38 PM Close \nTightening up on the artificial intelligence race against Microsoft and Google, Amazon revealed new AI services, at the AWS re:Invent 2016 conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. \nThe services will help customers develop applications hosted on AWS that recognize images, add text-to-speech and implement technology from Amazon’s Alexa’s. \nHere are the three services introduced yesterday at the event: \nAmazon Rekognition \nAmazon Rekognition is a service that recognizes images. With Rekognition, developers can create applications that detect objects, scenes, and faces in images. It can also be used to search and compare faces. Rekognition also detect smiles, frowns and if a person has glasses, among other things. \n“It can pick out an image you ask for, of a woman, a car, a steering wheel and from that can search for images of women driving a car,” said AWS chief executive Andy Jassy about the new service. \nThe service can go through a batch of millions of images or in real-time. \nAmazon Polly \nAmazon Polly turns text into life-like speech, letting developers create applications that talk. The technology behind Polly synthesizes speech that sounds like a human’s voice. \nFor example, if you type a question about the temperature in “Wa.” or “Wash.,” Polly will know that you are referring to the state of Washington and say the name of the state rather than just “Wa.” \nCustomers across the world can choose a voice from 47 lifelike voices in 24 languages that the service offers. The interactive service offers quick responses, the ability to cache and save Polly’s speech audio to replay offline or redistribute. Related Stories Microsoft To Work With Elon Musk's OpenAI \nAmazon Lex \nAmazon Lex is the technology inside Alexa, which is in Echo devices. The service provides automatic speech recognition (ASR) for turning speech to text, and natural language understanding (NLU), which recognizes the intent of the text. Amazon Lex is a service that lets developers build natural, conversational interactions in voice and text for their business. \nFor example, say Lex is used at a pizza company, if customers asks “I’d like to order a pizza,” developers can automate a response like “What toppings would you like?” The service can even provide a more personal interaction with customers by including responses like, “Okay Andy, would you like your typical pizza for $9.95,” Jassy explained. \nAmazon Polly is available now. Customers can go online and start testing out Rekognition, while those interested in Amazon Lex can sign up for the preview program .

      "text": "Dec 1, 2016 12:38pm Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella \nAnxious shareholders pressed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on the company’s strategy for mobile devices and services this week at an annual shareholders meeting. \n“I have heard that you are stepping away from mobile,” one shareholder said during a conference call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript . “Can you calm me down and tell me where your future—what your vision is for mobile?” \n“So, our overall approach again to the previous question is we think about mobility broadly,” Nadella responded. “In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device. That said we are not stepping away or back from our focus on mobile devices.” \nNadella also conceded Windows minuscule share of the market for mobile operating systems, as GeekWire noted , saying it’s important that Microsoft support more popular platforms. \nMicrosoft hasn’t been a major player in the mobile OS market in many years, of course, but Windows appears to be sliding toward oblivion in some major markets. Kantar Worldpanel ComTech recently reported that its market share in China has dwindled from 2.3 percent to just .1 percent over the last year, for instance, and in Germany it plunged from 10.5 percent to 4 percent. \nThe company announced plans in July to slash 2,850 more jobs across its phone-manufacturing business and worldwide sales force as it continued to retreat from the market. \nThat retreat has come as Microsoft has increasingly focused on providing software and services to users across hardware platforms and operating systems rather. That may be a wise strategy in a market where no OS provider has emerged to threaten Android and iOS. But as Nadella suggested when he addressed another question at this week’s conference, companies that build their own devices from the ground up—including the operating system—have an advantage over those that make devices running other platforms. \n“When we control things silicon-up, that’s how we will integrate those experiences,” he said. “But when we are on other people’s platform because that’s the basic construct that we have… we will not only build for you devices that are unique and differentiated with our software capability on top of it, whether it’s Surface or Surface Studio or HoloLens or the phone, and also make our software applications available on Android and iOS and other platforms.” Read more on",

      "text": "Home Business Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Still Finding ‘Microsoft’ Sales Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Still Finding ‘Microsoft’ Sales Jennifer Hong Dec 01, 2016 Business Comments Off on Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Still Finding ‘Microsoft’ Sales 2 \nShoppers are still finding deals after Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Surface Phone, Snapdragon 835, ‘Microsoft Quad’ HD Display Windows Surface Phone, Snapdragon 835, ‘Microsoft Quad’ HD Display 2 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Windows Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Windows Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "text": "There’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Studio; ‘Windows 10’ Orders To Ship Next Year – Report Microsoft Surface Studio; ‘Windows 10’ Orders To Ship Next Year – Report Michael Stevens Dec 01, 2016 Technology Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Studio; ‘Windows 10’ Orders To Ship Next Year – Report Like \nMicrosoft said it is shipping Surface Studio orders earlier than expected, as the company originally planned to ship units in mid-December. But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio , but new devices won’t ship until 2017. \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "There are still some features in Google AdWords that do not apply to Microsoft Bing Ads. As an Elite Bing Ads partner, Jeremy Hull, iProspect vp of products and services solutions, has been working with Bing to get those added to give advertisers an easier transition to port campaign from one search advertising platform to another.\nIt's all about being an Elite Bing Ads partner, especially as the industry heads into 2017, Hull said. What's next for advertisers? For starters, it's less about mobile and more about mobility. It's more about voice interactions, rather than voice search.\nHull sees some emerging trends born from opportunities and excitement, while others are born from nervousness.\nThe ones that more often arise from opportunities and excitement live on the back of the cliche about moving beyond the last-click model to understand how technology like chatbots, cross device targeting and visual assistants support digital advertising and the consumer's decision process to make a purchase.  \nAdvertisers also continue to focus on is what's next. \"We're at an inflection point where tech and consumer adoption have people behaving in new ways,\" Hull said.\nVoice search, digital assistants and chatbots are included in that list. \"Mobile caught everyone off guard,\" he said. \"Not because they didn't treat it as a big deal, but because they didn't treat it as a brand new way of consumers interacting with brands.\"\nIt forces advertisers to challenge their agency partners to tell them what it means and how they should prepare for the shift.\nHull said iProspect is telling advertisers to be sure to structure their data properly. Have it readable, available and ready to use. Build responses to what people ask most often. Don't start with the message the advertiser wants to convey, but rather answer the questions consumers want to know. Then build good content.\n\"It's not the traditional story, but there's a little more sense of urgency from advertisers to have answers,\" he said, suggesting that there is greater importance in ensuring that landing pages translate into answers to questions rather than jumping into the sale.",

The build comes with some known issues and one of these issues is quite severe. If you have a device with 8 GB internal storage like Lumia 550 and Lumia 650, you may not be able to install it. Read other known issues below. Windows 10 Mobile Build 14977 Known Issues: Please avoid attempting to install new languages, keyboards, and speech packs on your phone. There is a chance these downloads may get stuck and not finish downloading. If you have existing languages, keyboards, and speech packs installed – they will carry over when you update to new builds. You can use Windows Device Recovery Tool to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, install any languages, keyboards, and speech packs you need and then update to the latest build in the Fast ring as a workaround.

      "text": "December 1, 2016 0 Microsoft has now pushed Windows 10 Mobile Build 14977 to Insiders in Fast Ring. The build is the the latest preview build for Creators update that Microsoft will push as the next major update to everyone running Anniversary update. You can read what the build brings in terms of changes, fixes and improvements in the official changelog below. Windows 10 Mobile Build 14977 Changelog: Read EPUB books in Microsoft Edge on your phone: In addition to being able to read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format on your PC with Microsoft Edge – you can also read unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge on your phone! When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. As you read, you can leave bookmarks. To navigate through an e-book, you can use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser. And you can also search for words or phrases and use Cortana to define specific words. You can download and read unprotected e-books from places like Feedbooks , Project Gutenberg , Free eBooks (requires sign-up), ePubBooks (requires sign-up), Open Library and even our own Microsoft Press . Try out reading an e-book in Microsoft Edge on your phone and let us know what you think! Other changes, improvements, and fixes for Mobile: We’ve changed the rendering technology used for many types of UWP app content, so please provide feedback through the Feedback Hub if you notice any new visual glitches in UWP apps. Alarms sent by 3rd party alarm apps will now break through Cortana’s Quiet Hours – we appreciate all the app developers who logged feedback requesting this, keep it coming! We’ve removed the top-level option in Notification Settings to disable alarms on the lock screen – alarm reliability is a top priority for us, and we’ve found this setting was frequently enabled accidentally, without awareness that it would stop alarms from waking the phone when the phone was locked. For those who still wish to enable this setting, it’s will continue to be available under the per-app notification settings. Notifications from Settings can now be customized or disabled – option is available under Settings > System > Notifications > Settings We have enabled OAuth support for Yahoo Mail accounts. This will improve sync reliability for those accounts, and provide a secure experience while browsing your email. We fixed an issue where disconnecting and reconnecting a wired headset while watching a video might result the audio no longer working. We fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where certain music apps would unexpectedly stop playing music after a single song. We fixed an issue where closing a tab in Microsoft Edge, exiting the app, and then relaunching it would sometimes result in Edge opening to a blank page with the closed tab’s web address in the URL bar. We fixed an issue where the Start Settings page wasn’t rendering when opened on external screen while using Continuum. We’ve made a number of translation improvements, including, for French (France and Canada) speakers, fixing a grammatical error in the “Don’t Forget!” text seen when shutting down the phone so it now says “N’oubliez pas”, and for Chinese speakers, fixing an issue where the option to clear the Chinese Input Method Editor’s input history was displaying in English rather than Chinese. If you see any other translations that aren’t as you’d expect, please log feedback – we’re listening! We fixed an issue where, if the setting to show notifications above lock had been turned off, booting the device and immediately checking the Action Center while the phone was locked could result in the Action Center not displaying any notifications after the phone had been unlocked. We fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where the Camera app might not appear after using the hardware camera button while the screen was off or while on the Glance screen. We fixed an issue where Bangla (Bangladesh) keyboard text prediction might stop working after entering character followed by a vowel mark. Related ",

      "title": "Microsoft Rolls Out New Office 365 CRM App for Small Businesses | News & Opinion",
      "text": "Microsoft is giving small to midsize businesses (SMBs) a new sales and marketing tool with the release of Outlook Customer Manager , a customer relationship management (CRM) application within the Microsoft Outlook email client. Available through the \"Customer Manager\" tab in the toolbar, Outlook Customer Manager is an automated organizational tool designed to surface emails, events, documents, tasks, and other interactions to help business users more effectively manage customer relationships.\nOutlook Customer Manager essentially turns Outlook into a smart sales inbox. When you click on the tab in the Outlook 2016 toolbar, it brings up a timeline view of automatically organized sales information including calls, deadlines, deals, emails, files, meetings, notes, and tasks related to specific customers. The app exists entirely within Microsoft Office 365 . According to Microsoft, the information in the timeline is gathered from email, calendar, and call log data pulled from various Office 365 apps.\nUsing Outlook Customer Manager, users can also set up reminders to respond to a customer interaction, and associate tasks with a contact, company, or deal. Plus, you can also organize deals in a few different ways. A Microsoft spokesperson provided PCMag with some additional insight, pointing out that you can share specific customer information with a team and use a feature called Focused list, which details particularly important customers and deals. \n\n\"The information in the timeline is automatically gathered from the email, calendar, and call log data from the Office 365 environment,\" said the Microsoft spokesperson. \"Outlook Customer Manager helps you stay on top of opportunities and commitments by surfacing timely reminders, letting you associate tasks with a contact, company or deal, and listing deals by stage, close dates, priority, and amount. To help you prioritize your time, the system automatically presents a Focused list of your most important customers and deals.\" \nThe app is currently rolling out to Business Premium subscribers at no extra cost and will be generally available in early 2017. Microsoft is also working to enable full mobile access to Outlook Customer Manager, and has already released a dedicated iOS app that includes meeting information, notetaking, and mobile scanning for business cards.\nWhat about Dynamics?\nOutlook Customer Manager gives SMBs a light CRM app within Microsoft's email client, but Microsoft also has a standalone CRM app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 . The company has a full-blown enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution as well with Microsoft Dynamics GP , which incorporates CRM along with general ledger, sales, human resources (HR), and accounting and finance features.\nMicrosoft describes Outlook Customer Manager as a lighter CRM app within Office 365 for SMBs that aren't necessarily large enough to employ an entire sales team. The app is geared toward helping entrepreneurs and small business users who are conducting lead acquisition and customer outreach themselves; it gives them an easy, built-in way to manage information and stay on top of interactions. Dynamics 365, on the other hand, is a more heavy-duty CRM platform that provides deeper customer information and financial data as businesses scale up and expand their sales and marketing operations.\n\"Outlook Customer Manager is designed for small businesses that want to stay on top their customer and deal information,\" said the Microsoft spokesperson. \" Natively built into Outlook, it is simple to get started with and easy to use as a first customer management tool for small businesses. As their needs grow, business can move to Dynamics 365 for sales to take advantage of enhanced customer information, sales process consistency and efficiency, and deeper financial and customer insights.\" \nHow CRM is Getting Smarter \nOutlook Customer Manager is indicative of a larger trend around using machine learning and automated workflows to better organize and surface customer data. The new Salesforce Einstein artificial intelligence (AI) platform bakes in deep learning and predictive analytics throughout the Salesforce CRM cloud, and we've already seen other CRM players begin to implement these kinds of smart email and predictive sales analytics features as well.\n\nThe major redesign to Zoho CRM came with a new product called SalesInbox, which offers a dedicated mail client for salespeople that uses contextual CRM data to surface relevant emails. Other CRM players have also implemented similar features in the past year, with Pipedrive CRM adding smart email and Base CRM integrating intelligent sales forecasting and email sentiment analysis using predictive analytics data.\nWe're seeing advances in machine learning and business intelligence (BI) across a host of business use cases. Through Outlook Customer Manager, Microsoft is using this kind of data automation to make it easier for small businesses without a dedicated sales team to efficiently manage customer relationships. As we head into 2017, the role AI and data automation in CRM will only grow as businesses look for smarter, more efficient ways to manage interactions, engage leads, and convert them into loyal customers.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Studio; ‘Windows 10’ Orders To Ship In 2017 – Report Microsoft Surface Studio; ‘Windows 10’ Orders To Ship In 2017 – Report Michael Stevens Dec 01, 2016 Technology Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Studio; ‘Windows 10’ Orders To Ship In 2017 – Report Like \nMicrosoft said it is shipping Surface Studio orders earlier than expected, as the company originally planned to ship units in mid-December. But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio , but new devices won’t ship until 2017. \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "News \nThird-party cloud storage platforms like Dropbox and Box have been available in desktop versions of Microsoft Office for a few years, but the mobile versions have been much more limited. Oh, they supported OneDrive, but who uses that? Starting today, you have new storage options and a few more on on the way. \nGo ahead and update your Word, Excel, or PowerPoint app and behold the new cloud options: Dropbox, Box, Egnyte, and Tencent. Microsoft will soon add support for Citrix ShareFile, Edmodo, and Learnium. To add one of the new cloud platforms to your app, go into the \"Open\" menu and tap \"Add a place.\" You will directed either to an embedded browser or the service's app (if installed) to register the Office app. \nAfter adding a new cloud service, it shows up in the \"Open\" menu alongside local files and OneDrive. You can save, open, and delete files. However, you can't manage folders (at least not right now).",

      "text": "December 01, 2016 at 08:16 AM EST Wilkinson Healthcare launches ecommerce site following deployment of Microsoft Dynamics NAV \nNew web shop, developed by The NAV People, provides incontinence and stoma customers with a direct and discreet service tailored to their needs NEWBURY, BERKSHIRE, UNITED KINGDOM, December 1,   Medical appliance wholesaler, Wilkinson Healthcare, has selected Microsoft Dynamics NAV from The NAV People to support all central business functions and provide a flexible and scalable platform giving the company a progression path as its operations grow. Dynamics NAV has helped to contain headcount costs by eliminating the need for manual order entry of approximately 650 orders daily and radically improved the level of visibility across the company, delivering real-time data on number of orders, stock levels and invoicing. Additionally, the increased functionality provided by Microsoft Dynamics NAV has enabled Wilkinson Healthcare to develop a new channel to market. The recently launched web shop offers people affected by incontinence or who have a stoma a direct and discreet facility to service their needs. Wilkinson Healthcare supplies stoma, continence and wound care products to UK Dispensing Alliance Contractors and the 9,500 pharmacies within the UK pharmacy network. The company holds approximately 4,500 lines of stock at any one time and receives between 500 and 800 orders daily. The prescription line items are sent to Wilkinson Healthcare via an interface developed by The NAV People, which integrates the pharmacy wholesalers system with Dynamics NAV. As soon as the warehouse team at Wilkinson Healthcare pick and pack the items, a notification is sent via the system confirming the order fulfilment. Accurate visibility of stock is vital; Dynamics NAV is used to keep track of stock levels and interfaces with the wholesaler’s system to provide real-time notifications every 15 minutes. By integrating the systems, Wilkinson Healthcare has significantly capped headcount costs by eliminating the need for manual order entry of hundreds of orders each day. Also by integrating the web shop into Dynamics NAV the company has created a single repository of information that has streamlined operations. Russ Melrose, Interim MD and IT Director at Wilkinson Healthcare comments: ‘The NAV People took the time to understand our requirements and delivered the solution not only within budget but also in the tightest of timescales. We are a small company with a high order throughput; the solution underpins our business and enables us to be incredibly efficient. The Dynamics NAV solution has put us on the path to optimisation, enabling us to further improve our business processes and providing the functionality in which to do this ourselves.’ Ian Humphries, Managing & Product Director at The NAV People commented; ‘The key objective for Wilkinson Healthcare was a solution that had the flexibility to scale with their growth plans. By deploying Microsoft Dynamics with the nHancement workflow module created by The NAV People, the company has the functionality and flexibility to create dashboards and make changes, without the services of a developer. This level of autonomy has put Wilkinson Healthcare in the driving seat of their IT business environment.’ A full case study is available: www.thenavpeople.com/casestudies/wilkinson-healthcare-ltd -ends- NOTES TO EDITORS About Wilkinson Healthcare Wilkinson Healthcare Ltd was established as an independent company in 2014,and since inception has helped people to understand more about the largely taboo subject of stoma and incontinence care.

      "text": "  Windows Phone users give Microsoft CEO an earful The few Windows Phone users left said they want a promise of commitment, which Satya Nadella gave them  28   A Windows Phone smartphone on show at Computex 2015 in Taipei Credit: Martyn Williams Related What is Wi-Fi beamforming and MU-MIMO? \nAfter spending $7 billion for the Nokia smartphone business, Microsoft has a dying platform on its hands, and shareholders want answers from CEO Satya Nadella. \nRather than push the Lumia line, Microsoft has cut back its smartphone hardware to a smaller number of devices, markets and carriers. And the company has made more of an effort to get its own apps on iOS and Android rather than its own platform. \nNeedless to say, Microsoft shareholders wanted to know why. GeekWire reports shareholders at the annual meeting gave Nadella an earful over it. One shareholder wanted to know why the nifty Microsoft Pix app (it is very nice) is only on iPhone and Android and not on Windows Phone. The same is true for Microsoft Outlook. + Also on Network World: IDC predicts the collapse   by 2020 + \nThe shareholder asked Nadella to explain the company’s vision for its consumer devices. Nadella responded by saying Microsoft’s Windows camera and mail apps will include the same features as in Microsoft’s apps for other platforms. \n\"When we control things silicon-up, that’s how we will integrate those experiences,\" Nadella said. The company will build devices \"that are unique and differentiated with our software capability on top of it\" while making its software applications available on Android and iOS and other platforms. \nAnother shareholder said he uses his Windows Phone \"18 hours a day\" and that he's heard rumors Microsoft is \"stepping away from mobile.\" He asked, \"Can you calm me down … and tell me what your vision is for mobile?\" \nNadella said Microsoft is not stepping away or back from its focus on its mobile devices. \n\"What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation,” he said. “If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated on Windows Phone is on manageability. It’s security, it’s Continuum capability—that is, the ability to have a phone that can act like a PC. So we’re going to double-down on those points of differentiation.\" \nNadella cited the HP Elite x3 phone, which is quite powerful and well-reviewed , as an example of a Windows 10 phone that follows this strategy. \n\"We will keep looking at different forms and different functions that we can bring to mobile devices, while also supporting our software across a variety of devices,\" he said.

      "text": "  Joe Belfiore returns to Microsoft to put more ads in Windows 10 The head   initiative has a new mission  00   \nJoe Belfiore, former head   intitiative, returned to Microsoft to run the consumer-focused Windows Shell. The top 5 features of Windows 10 \nJoe Belfiore, the executive previously leading the Windows Phone charge (or what there was of it), has returned to Microsoft after a year-long trip around the world. And his new mission is to put more ads in Windows 10. \nAbout a year ago, Belfiore announced he was taking a one-year sabbatical to sail around the world with his kids in a program called Semester At Sea, an educational cruise program run by the University of Virginia. The cruise went around the world, making stops at every continent except Antarctica. \nAt the time, I said it was a bad sign for Windows Phone when its top guy was leaving for a year, and I haven't exactly been proven wrong on that one, have I? Well, he returned to Microsoft last month with a new position. \nAccording to Paul Thurrott , Belfiore will now handle the consumer-focused Windows Shell, reporting directly to Terry Myerson. His objective is to find new ways to make money with the OS, which means a lot of annoyance for us. \nMicrosoft doesn't make much off its traditional Windows licensing model, and it made nothing for a year when it was giving away Windows 10. The solution, as we have already seen, is advertising directly in Windows. And it looks like Belfiore will be looking at new ways to add more advertising. \nAdvertising in Windows comes from native advertisements and \"sponsored\" content. Microsoft has been doing it since Windows 10 shipped and has no intention of stopping. And unlike the apps that block the spying in Windows 10, there's no blocking Windows ads. \nThe ads can be a little obnoxious, too. One ad that popped up while using Chrome encouraged users to switch to the Edge browser , which nearly no one has done . Edge has a paltry market share, far lower than Windows 10, while Chrome only grows. \nGiven the sorry state of Windows Phone, there probably wasn't much for Belfiore to return to after all. I don't object to the ads in the OS so long as they don't get obnoxious. It's the same reason I use Adblock Plus. I don't object to websites running advertising; it pays my salary here. But when ads get really intrusive, in your face and slow down the site load, I draw the line. The last thing I want is for that to happen in my OS as well, and I'm sure most of you feel the same way.  ",

      "title": "My Dissent from Professor Kerr's Opinion on the Consequences of the Microsoft Ireland Case",
      "text": "My Dissent from Professor Kerr's Opinion on the Consequences of the Microsoft Ireland Case By Albert Gidari on December 1, 2016 at 10:05 am \nIn his November 29, 2016, Volokh Conspiracy post , Professor Orin Kerr raised some important points about the unintended or unanticipated consequences of the so-called Microsoft Ireland case . In that case, the Second Circuit decided that a search warrant issued pursuant to section 2703 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) had no extraterritorial effect and could not be used to compel the disclosure of user content stored by Microsoft in Ireland. Professor Kerr thinks the court said much more than that. He concludes that none of ECPA's restrictions apply to data stored outside the U.S., so providers actually are free to \"voluntarily\" disclose content to anyone as a result of the decision, including, oddly enough, to the very U.S. law enforcement agents seeking the content with the warrant at issue in the case! As I told Professor Kerr in a lengthy Twitter exchange, I respectfully dissent. \nBut first, to Professor Kerr's main point in his posting, he's absolutely right that the case has had some unanticipated consequences for the the Department of Justice (DoJ). Not all providers \"know\" at any given time where data is stored in their distributed, global data networks. If a provider doesn't \"know,\" does the benefit of the doubt go to DoJ in fulfilling the warrant? No. As DoJ makes clear in its petition for hearing filed last month with the Second Circuit, providers are not guessing or taking the risk of producing content in such cases. That leaves DoJ with insurmountable procedural hurdles to obtain evidence. \nIf DoJ knows where the data centers are located, they could pursue production through mutual legal assistance procedures in that country, assuming that eventually Ireland for example will order Microsoft's Irish subsidiary/data center to produce the email for delivery to the US. But as DoJ notes in its petition, some providers only have a U.S. access point for production even if the data is stored in a non-U.S. data center, so DoJ would end up back at the original provider in the U.S. and hit a stone wall. That is, local data center personnel don't have access to global email storage for a U.S. provided service by the parent entity, nor would they have the ability to determine whether email was stored on local servers at all. The Second Circuit may have thought the data storage and services world was tidy and that providers engineered networks like Microsoft where, based on a user's self-selected, unverified choice of country of residence, the content was plainly stored on Ireland's servers. They were, at best, uninformed, and now DoJ has raised these consequences in an effort to convince the Second Circuit that they got it wrong in the first place. But as Professor Kerr notes in his post, the court's conclusion about the reach of the warrant and the resulting framework is not irrational regardless of the consequences. \nNow, to my disagreement with Professor Kerr. His surprise at the unanticipated consequences of the decision comes from his understanding that the court decided ECPA lacked extraterritorial effect so if data is stored outside the U.S., none of ECPA's prohibitions on disclosure of content have any effect. He therefore expected that U.S. providers would, or at least could, \"voluntarily\" disclose content to U.S. law enforcement on domestic warrants because, as he reads the opinion, ECPA does not cover content stored outside the U.S. He anticipates that DoJ eventually will challenge providers who don't \"volunteer\" to add in non-U.S. stored content in response to domestic warrants, presumably because he believes that a court can compel a voluntary act. (One court has so held, in Negro v. Superior Court , the court held that a subpoena to the provider could compel disclosure of content where a user had validly consented to the production, consent being an exception to the prohibition on disclosure of content.) \nBut the Second Circuit made no such broad pronouncement about the applicability of ECPA to data stored outside the U.S. The decision is quite limited to the ability of the government to use the Rule 41 search warrant exception to compel such disclosures. Here's what the court said at pages 32-33, having first found that section 2703's warrant provision was not intended to apply extraterritorially: \nThis conclusion does not resolve the merits of this appeal, however, because \"it is a rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all contact with the territory of the United States.\" Morrison, 561 U.S. at 266. When we find that a law does not contemplate or permit extraterritorial application, we generally must then determine whether the case at issue involves such a prohibited application. Id at 266– 67. As we recently observed in Mastafa v. Chevron Corp., \"An evaluation of the presumption's application to a particular case is essentially an inquiry into whether the domestic contacts are sufficient to avoid triggering the presumption at all.\" 770 F.3d 170, 182 (2d Cir. 2014). \nIn making this second‐stage determination, we first look to the \"territorial events or relationships\" that are the \"focus\" of the relevant statutory provision. Id. at 183 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). If the domestic contacts presented by the case fall within the \"focus\" of the statutory provision or are \"the objects of the statute's solicitude,\" then the application of the provision is not unlawfully extraterritorial. Morrison, 561 U.S. at 267. If the domestic contacts are merely secondary, however, to the statutory \"focus,\" then the provision's application to the case is extraterritorial and precluded. \n…. \n[W]e conclude that the relevant provisions of the SCA focus on protecting the privacy of the content of a user's stored electronic communications. Although the SCA also prescribes methods under which the government may obtain access to that content for law enforcement purposes, it does so in the context of a primary emphasis on protecting user content ― the \"object[] of the statute's solicitude.\" Morrison, 561 U.S. at 267. \nThe court goes on to make clear that the focus of ECPA is the protection of user content, and that it is therefore proper to view the warrant requirement as consistent with protection of communications. That is, statutory analysis supports the conclusion that Congress meant to apply all the substantive and procedural baggage that comes with issuance, execution and use of a Rule 41 warrant when it permitted compelled disclosure under section 2703 using \"the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\" Where data is stored outside the U.S., law enforcement will have to follow whatever laws and procedures exist to obtain production regardless of the degree of difficulty, just as other countries must follow those procedures when seeking content from U.S. providers where the provider and data are in the U.S. \nNothing in the Second Circuit's opinion suggests that the Section 2702 prohibition on provider disclosure of content in other than the delineated exceptions (now including only content stored in the US in response to a search warrant) doesn't apply to non-U.S. users or their content stored outside the U.S. To the contrary, the Ninth Circuit decided in another Microsoft case in 2011, Suzlon Energy Ltd. v. Microsoft , that ECPA emphatically applied to the content of a non-U.S. user and that a subpoena for its production, without regard to where the data was stored, was not one of the enumerated exceptions that permitted disclosure. Section 2702 is plain on its face - a provider of an electronic communications service is prohibited from disclosing the content of ANY of its users absent an applicable, limited exception. Prior to the Second Circuit case, most U.S. providers, subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, understood ECPA warrants to be one such exception regardless of where the data was stored. Warrants still are an exception, but limited now only to data stored in the U.S. where the warrant can be so executed. \nThere is no \"voluntary\" disclosure of foreign-stored content exception for U.S. providers in ECPA, and personally, I know of no U.S. provider that has read ECPA to permit it after the Second Circuit case. Thus, I dissent from Professor Kerr's conclusions. \nAs a footnote to the discussion, providers always have understood ECPA to be a domestic statute without extraterritorial effect. If a provider had a non-U.S. operating subsidiary that stored its users' content locally in that country for bona fide reasons, the U.S. entity would not be liable under ECPA if that subsidiary complied with local law to produce in response to legal process. See Zheng v. Yahoo! Inc. , 2009 W.L. 4430297 (2009). So ECPA plainly is, and remains, a blocking statute for U.S. providers subject to U.S. jurisdiction. To protect user privacy from compelled production in countries where civil liberties may be less honored, many U.S. providers maintain the separation between corporate parent/U.S. provider and local sales or other operating subsidiaries without access to parent company data. The danger of the Microsoft Ireland case is data localization demands, such as under Russia's new law, or assertions of extraterritorial reach of surveillance powers to compel U.S. providers to comply with local requirements. The latter is evident in the U.K.'s \"snooper charter\" and ironically, in a case Microsoft is defending in Belgium against compelled disclosure of Skype communications as reported here . It is worth pointing out these investigative gymnastics would be unnecessary if non-U.S. data could be voluntarily disclosed to investigators in other countries at the whim of U.S. providers. They shouldn't get the wrong idea, having read Professor Kerr's posting. Focus Areas:",

      "text": "Microsoft Rolls Out New Office 365 CRM App for Small Businesses Microsoft Rolls Out New Office 365 CRM App for Small Businesses 10 Comments New Outlook Customer Manager app automates and organizes sales and customer data within Outlook for small business users. \nMicrosoft is giving small to midsize businesses (SMBs) a new sales and marketing tool with the release of Outlook Customer Manager , a customer relationship management (CRM) application within the Microsoft Outlook email client. Available through the \"Customer Manager\" tab in the toolbar, Outlook Customer Manager is an automated organizational tool designed to surface emails, events, documents, tasks, and other interactions to help business users more effectively manage customer relationships. \nOutlook Customer Manager essentially turns Outlook into a smart sales inbox. When you click on the tab in the Outlook 2016 toolbar, it brings up a timeline view of automatically organized sales information including calls, deadlines, deals, emails, files, meetings, notes, and tasks related to specific customers. The app exists entirely within Microsoft Office 365 . According to Microsoft, the information in the timeline is gathered from email, calendar, and call log data pulled from various Office 365 apps. \nUsing Outlook Customer Manager, users can also set up reminders to respond to a customer interaction, and associate tasks with a contact, company, or deal. Plus, you can also organize deals in a few different ways. A Microsoft spokesperson provided PCMag with some additional insight, pointing out that you can share specific customer information with a team and use a feature called Focused list, which details particularly important customers and deals. \n\"The information in the timeline is automatically gathered from the email, calendar, and call log data from the Office 365 environment,\" said the Microsoft spokesperson. \"Outlook Customer Manager helps you stay on top of opportunities and commitments by surfacing timely reminders, letting you associate tasks with a contact, company or deal, and listing deals by stage, close dates, priority, and amount. To help you prioritize your time, the system automatically presents a Focused list of your most important customers and deals.\" \nThe app is currently rolling out to Business Premium subscribers at no extra cost and will be generally available in early 2017. Microsoft is also working to enable full mobile access to Outlook Customer Manager, and has already released a dedicated iOS app that includes meeting information, notetaking, and mobile scanning for business cards. \nWhat about Dynamics? Outlook Customer Manager gives SMBs a light CRM app within Microsoft's email client, but Microsoft also has a standalone CRM app in Microsoft Dynamics 365 . The company has a full-blown enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution as well with Microsoft Dynamics GP , which incorporates CRM along with general ledger, sales, human resources (HR), and accounting and finance features. \nMicrosoft describes Outlook Customer Manager as a lighter CRM app within Office 365 for SMBs that aren't necessarily large enough to employ an entire sales team. The app is geared toward helping entrepreneurs and small business users who are conducting lead acquisition and customer outreach themselves; it gives them an easy, built-in way to manage information and stay on top of interactions. Dynamics 365, on the other hand, is a more heavy-duty CRM platform that provides deeper customer information and financial data as businesses scale up and expand their sales and marketing operations. \n\"Outlook Customer Manager is designed for small businesses that want to stay on top their customer and deal information,\" said the Microsoft spokesperson. \" Natively built into Outlook, it is simple to get started with and easy to use as a first customer management tool for small businesses. As their needs grow, business can move to Dynamics 365 for sales to take advantage of enhanced customer information, sales process consistency and efficiency, and deeper financial and customer insights.\" \nHow CRM is Getting Smarter Outlook Customer Manager is indicative of a larger trend around using machine learning and automated workflows to better organize and surface customer data. The new Salesforce Einstein artificial intelligence (AI) platform bakes in deep learning and predictive analytics throughout the Salesforce CRM cloud, and we've already seen other CRM players begin to implement these kinds of smart email and predictive sales analytics features as well. \nThe major redesign to Zoho CRM came with a new product called SalesInbox, which offers a dedicated mail client for salespeople that uses contextual CRM data to surface relevant emails. Other CRM players have also implemented similar features in the past year, with Pipedrive CRM adding smart email and Base CRM integrating intelligent sales forecasting and email sentiment analysis using predictive analytics data. \nWe're seeing advances in machine learning and business intelligence (BI) across a host of business use cases. Through Outlook Customer Manager, Microsoft is using this kind of data automation to make it easier for small businesses without a dedicated sales team to efficiently manage customer relationships. As we head into 2017, the role AI and data automation in CRM will only grow as businesses look for smarter, more efficient ways to manage interactions, engage leads, and convert them into loyal customers.

      "text": "Home Business Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Still Finding ‘Microsoft’ Discounts Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Still Finding ‘Microsoft’ Discounts Jennifer Hong Dec 01, 2016 Business Comments Off on Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Still Finding ‘Microsoft’ Discounts 2 \nShoppers are still finding deals after Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Surface Phone, Snapdragon 835, ‘Microsoft Quad’ Display Windows Surface Phone, Snapdragon 835, ‘Microsoft Quad’ Display 2 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Windows Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Windows Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "title": "Office 365 users seeing warnings that their OneDrive storage will be cut to 1TB on March 1",
      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 15 minutes ago \nBack in late October of 2014, Microsoft made a bold promise. The company said that all Office 365 subscribers would have unlimited OneDrive storage bundled into their subscriptions . After rolling out unlimited storage to some users and expanded storage to others, the firm announced in November 2015 that it would be breaking that promise , citing users that \"abused\" their unlimited storage... by using it for unlimited storage. \nMicrosoft said that Office 365 customers would have at least a year before the changes took effect, and it's been almost 13 months. First spotted by one of Paul Thurrott's readers , customers are now seeing a warning that their storage will be slashed to 1TB beginning on March 1. \nIndeed, we're seeing it in our accounts as well, and we've reached out to Microsoft to confirm that all Office 365 customers have the same date, but at the moment, it certainly seems like it. \nClearly, this is something that we all knew was coming down the pipeline eventually, but surely no one was looking forward to this day. \nBack in May, we published an article detailing some helpful workarounds for storage limits , as well as other issues that you might be having with the service. For example, if you have Office 365 Home, you can give 1TB of OneDrive storage to each of five Microsoft accounts (including the primary account), and then you can link them all through a third-party app. There are also other cloud storage solutions that still offer unlimited storage, and at reasonable prices. \nIt's not entirely clear why Microsoft doesn't allow Office 365 Home users to divide up the combined 5TB of storage how they wish; for example, one person could theoretically use 4TB if they needed more than everyone else, and the other four could get 250MB. Still, adding other accounts to an Office 365 Home subscription is probably your best option to weather the storm. Tags",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Thursday, December 01, 2016 Microsoft Gives Businesses All-Clear For Windows 10 Anniversary Update Over the summer, Microsoft began pushing out the Windows 10 Anniversary Update to consumer PCs (and the Xbox One ). While Regular Joes might not mind putting up with bleeding edge software and a few bugs here and there, businesses and those that use Windows 10 in mission critical situations aren’t very keen on taking chances with new updates.\nThankfully, Microsoft has just declared that after months of testing by its various customers — including enterprise deployments — that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (aka Windows 10 1607) has been certified as a Current Branch for Business (CBB). \n“Businesses are seeing significant value, enhanced security and improved productivity with Windows 10 today,” said Microsoft’s Michael Niehaus. “With the Windows 10 1607 Current Branch for Business declaration, now is the time to accelerate your Windows 10 deployment.” \nMicrosoft will start pushing the Anniversary Update for PCs that are on the CBB track via Windows Update, Windows Update for Business, and Windows Server Update Services beginning in January. Relevant media will also be available for download from Microsoft’s Volume Licensing Service Center . \nMicrosoft is increasingly pushing Windows 10 and “Windows as a Service” to its business and enterprise customers, citing improved security and thus fewer headaches for IT departments. Microsoft is also claiming that PCs running Windows 10 are 58 percent less likely to get infected by ransomware compared to those still clinging to Windows 7 . \nWith the Windows 10 Anniversary Update now given the all clear for the CBB track, it will be quite a while before the upcoming Creators Update is able to hold the same distinction. The Windows 10 Creators Update is on track for release in Spring 2017 for consumers, and we can expect to tack on at least another quarter before it hits the CBB branch.",

      "title": "Microsoft's Surface Dial isn't quite as easy to repair as the Surface Studio, teardown reveals",
      "text": "on Dec 1, 2016, 2:45 PM TechSpot \nMicrosoft’s Surface Studio was one of the worst kept secrets in technology in the latter half of 2016 (and also the recent victim of an iFixit teardown ). The optional Surface Dial accessory, however, took virtually everyone by surprise (in a good way). \nMany were also surprised (again, in a good way) by how easy it is to repair the all-in-one. Will the Surface Dial follow in the footsteps of its companion and prove to be equally as easy to dissect and repair? For that answer, we once again turn to iFixit. \nJumping right in , the team found that the rubber foot on the bottom of the Surface Dial is held in place by magnets and thus, comes off without a fight. It is here that you’ll find two AAA batteries and a sync button (this explains why it’s so easy to get the cover off). \nGoing deeper, however, requires a bit more work (and some tools). \nAfter struggling to get the mid-frame / battery compartment out, the team found a single access hole as part of the spinning mechanism that must be used to remove a few screws that separate the body from the silver cover. \nOnly after the fact did they find a plugged hole under the battery compartment that would have made removal a bit easier. As such, they recommend drilling through the plug to remove the screws that separate the body. \nBack on track, they get the internals separated from the outer casing and have to pop the bearing apart to advance further. The team encounters springy posts that help even out the pressure when you press down on the Surface Dial, a pancake vibration motor for force feedback and a microswitch responsible for its click functionality. Also of note is the component responsible for the “spinny” function which iFixit says looks very similar to the sensor inside the Nest thermostat . \nOverall, iFixit awarded the Surface Dial a repairability score of four out of 10 (the higher the number, the easier it is to repair) which is one point less than the Surface Studio. \niFixit praised the dial for its easy-to-remove bottom panel that makes swapping batteries and syncing a breeze. The team noted that while the accessory is durable, repairs are unlikely as most of the components that would probably fail can’t be replaced without damaging other parts. \nThe vibrating motor responsible for haptic feedback, for example, is firmly held in place with strong glue. Without a repair guide and enough courage to drill your way into the main compartment, you won’t even get the chance to service anything. \nGiven its sub-$100 price tag, your best bet is to either try and replace a faulty dial under warranty or simply buy a new one.

      "text": "Today’s topics include Microsoft's efforts to introduce a new smartphone in 2017, why Cisco's Talos research group decided to extend security flaw disclosure timelines, Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s demonstration of memory-driven computing and Microsoft's latest Azure Cloud update that supports disaster-recovery for Windows Server 2016. \nMicrosoft may not have enjoyed much success recently with its Windows Mobile operating system, but the software giant refuses to give up on the smartphone market. \nWindows is clinging to a scant 0.4 percent of the smartphone OS market, according to Gartner's latest analysis. Microsoft's mobile OS ran on fewer than 1.5 million of the total 373 million smartphones sold worldwide in the third quarter of 2016. \nHowever, instead of throwing in the towel, news leaks suggest that Microsoft is making a renewed push to challenge the galaxy of Android devices and Apple iPhones that currently dominate the smartphone market. Nokia Power User mobile news website is reporting that Microsoft is readying a late-2017 Surface Phone launch. \nCisco's Talos security research group is changing its policies for responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. This will provide impacted vendors with more time to fix issues. Previously, Cisco had a responsible disclosure timeline of 60 days. However, after publicly announcing a vulnerability, it is now extending the public disclosure timeline out to 90 days. \n\"Basically at the end of the day, our goal is to protect our customers and the vulnerability research we do is one of the ways we accomplish that objective,\" Earl Carter, a threat researcher at Cisco, told eWEEK . \nAs to why Cisco is extending its responsible disclosure timeline now, Carter explained that over the past year, Cisco Talos' own research has revealed that the overall average time to patch for vulnerabilities is 78 days. \nHP has been working for more than two years on a new project called The Machine, a bold move to re-imagine data center architecture by putting memory, instead of processors, into the forefront. \nThe IT provider successfully demonstrated Memory-Driven Computing at its Discover London conference on November 28. \nThis concept puts memory at the center of the computing platform to realize performance and efficiency gains not possible today. SAP, Oracle and others have used this approach to run database systems, but no one yet has demonstrated it running a server—until now. \nCustomers of Microsoft's cloud-based disaster recovery offering can now recover Windows Server 2016 workloads to Azure or another data center, the company announced on November 28. \n\"Customers can now use Azure Site Recovery to replicate, protect (or migrate) their Hyper-V virtual machines hosted on a Windows Server 2016 to Azure or to a secondary site,\" a Microsoft program manager wrote. \nAzure Site Recovery is offering support for protection and replication of virtual machines deployed. For example, Azure Site Recovery now supports replicating Hyper-V sites containing Windows Server 2016 hosts to Azure from local Hyper-V virtual machines. \nThe company plans to extend support to Hyper-V sites with Windows Server 2012 R2 hosts in a future update. \nThanks for watching.

      "text": "What is Wi-Fi beamforming and MU-MIMO? \nApple said it took \"courage\" to remove the audio jack port from the iPhone 7 and replace it with wireless audio. Microsoft hasn't yet mustered the courage to cut the aging port. \nMicrosoft has retained the headphone jack as a minimum hardware requirement for Windows 10 Mobile smartphones. The company declined to comment if it would make the headphone jack an optional port. \nThe headphone jack port isn't a requirement for other Windows devices, including laptops, desktops, tablets, or IoT devices. NEWSLETTERS: Get the latest tech news sent directly to your in-box \nApple gave several reasons for removing the port, saying it was old technology, and it blocked the integration of newer technologies in the already compact iPhone 7. \nBefore Apple, Android phone makers like LeEco and Lenovo also cut headset jacks from some mobile devices to move on from legacy technology. \nWindows Mobile phone makers could still include wireless audio alongside headphone jacks. But the phone makers will lose opportunities to make devices thinner and experiment with new technologies to replace the headset jack. \nBeyond wireless audio, there's a big push to make the USB-C port the replacement to headphone jacks. Pushing audio through USB-C port and removing audio jacks will allow smartphones to be thinner. \nIt's important to move on to newer technologies, but Microsoft's hesitance to remove the headphone jack requirement has technical and financial merits, said Bob O'Donnell, principal analyst at Technalysis Research. \nThere was a user backlash when Apple removed headphone jacks from the iPhone 7. People were upset at being forced with the extra cost of buying a wireless headset. Moreover, the wireless headsets have to be charged. \nThe quality of wireless audio isn't as reliable as it is on headphone jacks, O'Donnell said. Apple has, however, developed a special wireless audio chip that delivers audio from the iPhone 7 to the AirPod using three separate communications protocols. That ensures continued high-quality audio streaming. \nMicrosoft still sells Windows phones but has been cryptic about their future. Other Windows phone makers include HP, Acer, Alcatel, and Lenovo. \nSmartphones with Windows have been taken a beating at the hands of iOS and Android. Shipments of Windows phones totaled 1.48 million in the third quarter of 2016, plunging from 5.87 million units in the same quarter a year ago. \nThe market share for Windows Mobile reached a rock-bottom 0.4 percent during the second quarter, declining from 1.7 percent a year ago, according to a report released by Gartner last month. By comparison, Android's market share was 87.8 percent, and iOS's share was 11.5 percent during the third quarter.

      "title": "Microsoft MVP Discloses Windows In-Place Upgrade Security Flaw",
      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 12/01/2016 \nA Microsoft Most Valuable Professional this week disclosed a current security flaw that's associated with Windows in-place upgrades. \nSami Laiho, a Windows MVP since 2011 and a Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert on client and server, indicated in a blog post that the Microsoft Product Group has verified this flaw, which lets end users or IT pros suspend BitLocker encryption during Windows in-place upgrades. The suspension provides a means to access to a system's hard disk during the upgrade process. The flaw could allow someone to elevate their privileges on a machine. \nMoreover, no special hacking tools are required to exploit this software flaw. It's possible to gain such access by simply hitting Shift + F10 during the upgrade process, which provides the user with a command prompt for access. \nLaiho specifically indicated that the flaw is associated with \"feature\" updates. He's likely referring to the major operating system upgrades that Microsoft now releases about twice per year with Windows 10, rather than Windows 10 monthly updates. For instance, the recently finalized Window 10 \"anniversary update\" might be thought of as an OS feature upgrade release. \nThe in-place upgrade flaw could be exploited by a user internally, who can just wait for next Windows 10 feature upgrade to come around. It could also be exploited externally by someone with remote access to a computer, Laiho explained. \nThe Shift + F10 flaw theoretically was available with earlier Windows client releases than just Windows 10, Laiho admitted, in the comments section of his blog post. However, the practice of organizations performing in-place upgrades has tended to be more of a mainstream phenomenon associated with the management of Windows 10 clients. \nLaiho initially thought that users of System Center Configuration Manager and Windows Server Update Services management products might not have this Shift + F10 client upgrade flaw. However, in his comments, he admitted that those users may not have any special protections. \nThe Microsoft Product Group is working on delivering a fix for the flaw, Laiho stated, although no timeline was specified. In the meantime, Laiho said that he's sticking with recommending the use of the Windows 10 long-term servicing branch approach for his customers until issues like this one get ironed out. In comments added to his blog post, he also suggested that he's only planning to move to Windows 10 current branch for business in 2018, which is when he expects Microsoft to have addressed some issues that he didn't name. \nLaiho's advocacy of using the long-term servicing branch of Windows 10 goes against Microsoft's current suggestions for business users of the client operating system. Microsoft has repeatedly emphasized that organizations should use the current branch for business Windows 10 update approach, which delivers frequent feature upgrades to the OS. Microsoft restated that view earlier this month in a Web presentation about Windows 10 servicing . \nMicrosoft's recommendations likely have a strong influence on IT departments worldwide. Consequently, Laiho's contrary stance to those recommendations concerning the use of the long-term servicing branch of Windows 10 constitutes a bold step for a Microsoft MVP to take. \nThe long-term servicing branch gets monthly security updates but no feature upgrades during its product lifespan. It's like the old service-pack model seen with Window 7 clients. However, Microsoft sees its use as just being appropriate for shop-floor machines, medical devices or nuclear power plants, or any device that can't tolerate frequent updates. Organizations needing to run Microsoft Office should stick with current branch for business model, Microsoft officials have said. Microsoft omits frequently updated Windows 10 applications, such as Cortana and the Microsoft Edge browser, for users following the long-term servicing branch update model.

      "text": "Stay on target iFixit Tears Down The Cadillac of MacBooks With The MacBook Pro 15\" Late 2016 MacBook Pro 13\" Touch Bar Gets a Teardown by iFixit The Microsoft Surface Studio is an impressive piece of technology, especially for anyone who’s ever wanted a desktop version of the tablet rather than having to hunker down like a vagabond and using it while walking around. iFixit took the machine to task and gave it a proper teardown , as iFixit is wont to do.\nInside the package a good amount of powerful tech was found waiting, such as a 6th-Generation Intel Core i5 or i7 CPU with 8 GB, 16 GB, and 32 GB RAM, 1 TB and 2 TB hybrid storage options, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M GPU (paired with 2 GB GDDR5) or GTX 980M (paired with 4 GB GDDR5).\nThat’s enough to pique my interest, that’s for sure, and those are just some of the innards. The monitor is pretty fantastic, too: a 28-inch adjustable PixelSense Display with 4500 x 3000 resolution (192 DPI)—supporting sRGB, DCI-P3, and Vivid color profiles, plus 10-point multi-touch. It’s a powerful package, and its weight supports the idea, too: it’s a whopping 21 lbs.\nFor the techies interested in what kind of connections there are, it rocks four USB 3.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet jack and power inlet, SD card slot and 3.5 mm audio jack, and Mini DisplayPort. On the inside, of course, which is probably what everyone’s the most interested in, is a strip of air vents and rubber feet. Once you pull those things off and work your way inside you can access exhaust fans, the machine’s hybrid storage, and on board memory.\nThere’s an impressive heat sink with a powerful bit of cooling power, and a SATA hard drive connector within as well. It’s all pretty standard, except for the way you have to remove the RAM, CPU, and GPU. They’re soldered directly to the board, and you can’t upgrade them. Other components can be difficult to replace as well.\nIt looks like the Microsoft Surface Studio does a good job overall of acting as a desktop replacement from the Surface line, but its overall repairability factor of 5 may make some buyers hesitant.",

      "text": "Following extensive feedback from corporate customers, the feature-packed and security-focused upgrade is cleared for large-scale business PC deployments. After its release for general use this past summer, Microsoft has slapped the Current Branch for Business label on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The Current Branch for Business designation is awarded about four months after the Current Branch of Windows is publicly released. Windows 10 Anniversary Update, or build Windows 10 version 1607, was officially launched on Aug. 2nd . \"This is an important milestone and signifies that this version has been validated by customers, OEMs and partners giving organizations the confidence to further accelerate deployments at scale,\" commented Michael Niehaus, director of product marketing for Windows 10 deployment, in a Nov. 29 blog post . \"To reach this milestone, we have addressed nearly a thousand items of feedback from all types of customers, including enterprises performing pilot deployments,\" he continued, assuring customers that the upgraded operating system is now ready for their demanding business workloads. Enhanced security is another reason to organizations to deploy the operating system, said Niehaus. Windows 10 Anniversary Update includes several security enhancements , including an early-warning system of sorts for Edge and Internet Explorer users called SmartScreen, a hardened environment for Windows Hello biometric data and an improved Windows Defender malware scanner.Bolstered by Microsoft's machine-learning research, the company's cloud enables its security researchers to detect and block malware faster, often in mere minutes. As a result, Windows 10 is 58 percent less susceptible to ransomware than its predecessor, according to Niehause.Ransomware has many an IT security professional on edge. This form of malware typically strikes after an unwitting user falls for a phishing email containing malicious links or file attachments. After successfully infecting a system, ransomware seeks out files on both local and shared network drives, encrypting them in the process. Attackers then demand that victims pay up, typically in bitcoin, to regain access (the \"ransom\" part of ransomware). Just after the Thanksgiving holiday last week, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (MUNI) was hit by a ransomware attack affecting its ticket systems and fare gates (systems responsible for safety and primary operations were unaffected). According to Kaspersky Lab's most recent IT Threat Evolution report, ransomware attacks more than doubled in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the previous quarter (821,865 Kaspersky users were attacked in Q3). Meanwhile, Microsoft is already working on Anniversary Update's successor. The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update (code-named Redstone 2), which is expected to arrive by spring 2017, will feature new apps and capabilities aimed at creative professionals. It will include a basic 3D modeling app called Paint 3D and software components to enable virtual- and augmented-reality experiences on off-the-shelf Windows PCs. Business users can look forward to adding some 3D flair to their Office content. The update will enable users to embed 3D models into their Word documents, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations, allowing for visuals and advanced 3D animations that appear to leap off the screen.",

      "text": "There are still some features in Google AdWords that do not apply to Microsoft Bing Ads. As an Elite Bing Ads partner, Jeremy Hull, iProspect vp of products and services solutions, has been working with Bing to get those added to give advertisers an easier transition to port campaign from one search advertising platform to another.\nIt's all about being an Elite Bing Ads partner, especially as the industry heads into 2017, Hull said. What's next for advertisers? For starters, it's less about mobile and more about mobility. It's more about voice interactions, rather than voice search.\nHull sees some emerging trends born from opportunities and excitement, while others are born from nervousness.\nThe ones that more often arise from opportunities and excitement live on the back of the cliche about moving beyond the last-click model to understand how technology like chatbots, cross device targeting and visual assistants support digital advertising and the consumer's decision process to make a purchase.  \nAdvertisers also continue to focus on is what's next. \"We're at an inflection point where tech and consumer adoption have people behaving in new ways,\" Hull said.\nVoice search, digital assistants and chatbots are included in that list. \"Mobile caught everyone off guard,\" he said. \"Not because they didn't treat it as a big deal, but because they didn't treat it as a brand new way of consumers interacting with brands.\"\nIt forces advertisers to challenge their agency partners to tell them what it means and how they should prepare for the shift.\nHull said iProspect is telling advertisers to be sure to structure their data properly. Have it readable, available and ready to use. Build responses to what people ask most often. Don't start with the message the advertiser wants to convey, but rather answer the questions consumers want to know. Then build good content.\n\"It's not the traditional story, but there's a little more sense of urgency from advertisers to have answers,\" he said, suggesting that there is greater importance in ensuring that landing pages translate into answers to questions rather than jumping into the sale.",

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- European Union antitrust authorities are likely to clear Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp. by Tuesday with conditions attached, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's competition regulator, has to decide by Dec. 6 whether to clear the deal or open an in-depth investigation into the merger. The commission is unlikely to open a probe, the people said.\nThe deal would be conditional on the implementation of concessions Microsoft offered the EU in November, though there may be some minor changes to those commitments, one of the people said.\nAs part of its remedy package, Microsoft offered to allow rival professional social networks to continue to have access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter. Microsoft's Outlook provides email and calendar management.\nMicrosoft's pledge would for example allow the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business-professionals network XING, in an Outlook calendar entry.\nIn addition, Microsoft has also vowed to allow computer manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices. In an earlier EU review, Microsoft had to take steps after antitrust regulators in 2004 condemned it for bundling products into its Windows software.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June and aims to close the transaction this year. The acquisition has already been cleared in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and South Africa. The company said in June that it didn't require regulatory approval in Japan, South Korea or China.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\nDecember 01, 2016 13:55 ET (18:55 ",

      "title": "Microsoft, Intel, IBM Push Back on China Cybersecurity Rules",
      "text": "By Eva Dou\nBEIJING--Tough new Chinese cybersecurity rules are providing a rare, behind-the-scenes look at a regulatory skirmish between U.S. technology companies and Beijing.\nChina is moving to require software companies, network-equipment makers and other technology suppliers to disclose their proprietary source code, the core intellectual property running their software, to prove their products can't be compromised by hackers.\nTech companies are loath to offer up their source code, saying this will heighten the risk of their code falling into the hands of rivals or malefactors--and may not guarantee it is hack-proof. Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are among those filing objections.\n\"Sharing source code in itself can't prove the capability to be secure and controllable,\" Microsoft wrote in comments released by a government cybersecurity committee in November. \"It only proves there is source code.\"\nIntel said a rule forcing chip makers to disclose the details of their products \"would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products.\"\nThe comments were made in a discussion log made public by Technical Committee 260, the national cybersecurity standards maker, as it released technical parameters of its omnibus cybersecurity law adopted Nov. 7.\nThe committee is rolling out standards for operating systems, microprocessors, office software and other products to comply with the regulations when they go into force in June 2017.\nChinese authorities have said these measures are necessary to guard against foreign espionage tools being embedded in software used here. They frequently cite claims by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that such back doors were routinely built into U.S. technology products sold overseas.\nMicrosoft, Intel and IBM were the largest U.S. firms to respond to the draft regulations, joining dozens of Chinese companies, government agencies and security experts.\nThe three U.S. tech giants declined to comment beyond their written statements. All three have multiple China ventures with local partners and are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy. As such, their written comments, made in Chinese, offer a rare glimpse into how they parry over regulations with Beijing authorities.\nAmong other things, tech companies are bristling at the level of detail they would be forced to disclose to have their proprietary technologies rated \"secure and controllable.\"\nMicrosoft wrote that it believed allowing visitors to view code at its new \"Transparency Center\" in Beijing should suffice, rather than having to \"share source code.\" Technical Committee 260 staffers disagreed, maintaining the original wording and marking the comment \"not accepted.\"\nMicrosoft and Intel also raised questions over one security standard that gives a higher ranking to products whose development and delivery can't be disrupted by \"politics,\" with Intel requesting clarification.\nThat complaint was marked \"partially accepted,\" although political consideration is still in the most recent draft.\nIBM said that distinctions should be made between computing services for commercial use, versus services for government applications.\n\"Computing rooms used purely for commercial cloud computing purposes shouldn't have to be located within China's borders,\" wrote IBM.\nIn a written response, Technical Committee 260 staffers said that many sectors touch upon social stability and the public interest. \"It's not only a pure commercial question.\"\nJeremie Waterman, senior director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said there is \"deep concern about the IP disclosure requirements.\" But it isn't clear what recourse U.S. tech companies might have.\nDespite any objections, U.S. firms are unlikely to leave China over the cybersecurity requirements because of the importance of the mammoth Chinese market, said James Gong, a senior associate at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who works with western clients in navigating Chinese law.\n\"I don't think they will pull out,\" said Mr. Gong. \"I haven't heard of any company that has decided to leave.\"\nChina has long had cybersecurity standards that weren't vigorously enforced--but that is likely to change when the nationwide cybersecurity law goes into effect next summer, he said.\nBeijing maintains that its security rules apply to domestic and foreign companies equally. When China passed the cybersecurity law last month, a spokesman for the internet regulator said foreigners who thought the law would favor domestic firms had a \"misunderstanding, a biased view.\"\nBut in Technical Committee 260's discussions, certain government officials argued for the standards to be drafted to favor domestic companies.\n\"The big trend is called shifting to domestic production,\" wrote Guo Qiquan, chief engineer at the China Ministry of Public Security's Network Security Bureau, in a suggestion that the committee marked \"approved.\" \"But it can't be written that way, so one calls it independent and controllable.\"\nYang Jie, Rachael King and Don Clark contributed to this article.\nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com\nDecember 01, 2016 05:33 ET (10:33 ",

      "text": "BEIJING—Tough new Chinese cybersecurity rules are providing a rare, behind-the-scenes look at a regulatory skirmish between U.S. technology companies and Beijing.\nChina is moving to require software companies, network-equipment makers and other technology suppliers to disclose their proprietary source code, the core intellectual property running their software, to prove their products can't be compromised by hackers.\nTech companies are loath to offer up their source code, saying this will heighten the risk of their code falling into the hands of rivals or malefactors—and may not guarantee it is hack-proof. Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are among those filing objections.\n\"Sharing source code in itself can't prove the capability to be secure and controllable,\" Microsoft wrote in comments released by a government cybersecurity committee in November. \"It only proves there is source code.\"\nIntel said a rule forcing chip makers to disclose the details of their products \"would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products.\"\nThe comments were made in a discussion log made public by Technical Committee 260, the national cybersecurity standards maker, as it released technical parameters of its omnibus cybersecurity law adopted Nov. 7.\nThe committee is rolling out standards for operating systems, microprocessors, office software and other products to comply with the regulations when they go into force in June 2017.\nChinese authorities have said these measures are necessary to guard against foreign espionage tools being embedded in software used here. They frequently cite claims by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that such back doors were routinely built into U.S. technology products sold overseas.\nMicrosoft, Intel and IBM were the largest U.S. firms to respond to the draft regulations, joining dozens of Chinese companies, government agencies and security experts.\nThe three U.S. tech giants declined to comment beyond their written statements. All three have multiple China ventures with local partners and are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy. As such, their written comments, made in Chinese, offer a rare glimpse into how they parry over regulations with Beijing authorities.\nAmong other things, tech companies are bristling at the level of detail they would be forced to disclose to have their proprietary technologies rated \"secure and controllable.\"\nMicrosoft wrote that it believed allowing visitors to view code at its new \"Transparency Center\" in Beijing should suffice, rather than having to \"share source code.\" Technical Committee 260 staffers disagreed, maintaining the original wording and marking the comment \"not accepted.\"\nMicrosoft and Intel also raised questions over one security standard that gives a higher ranking to products whose development and delivery can't be disrupted by \"politics,\" with Intel requesting clarification.\nThat complaint was marked \"partially accepted,\" although political consideration is still in the most recent draft.\nIBM said that distinctions should be made between computing services for commercial use, versus services for government applications.\n\"Computing rooms used purely for commercial cloud computing purposes shouldn't have to be located within China's borders,\" wrote IBM.\nIn a written response, Technical Committee 260 staffers said that many sectors touch upon social stability and the public interest. \"It's not only a pure commercial question.\"\nJeremie Waterman, senior director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said there is \"deep concern about the IP disclosure requirements.\" But it isn't clear what recourse U.S. tech companies might have.\nDespite any objections, U.S. firms are unlikely to leave China over the cybersecurity requirements because of the importance of the mammoth Chinese market, said James Gong, a senior associate at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who works with western clients in navigating Chinese law.\n\"I don't think they will pull out,\" said Mr. Gong. \"I haven't heard of any company that has decided to leave.\"\nChina has long had cybersecurity standards that weren't vigorously enforced—but that is likely to change when the nationwide cybersecurity law goes into effect next summer, he said.\nBeijing maintains that its security rules apply to domestic and foreign companies equally. When China passed the cybersecurity law last month, a spokesman for the internet regulator said foreigners who thought the law would favor domestic firms had a \"misunderstanding, a biased view.\"\nBut in Technical Committee 260's discussions, certain government officials argued for the standards to be drafted to favor domestic companies.\n\"The big trend is called shifting to domestic production,\" wrote Guo Qiquan, chief engineer at the China Ministry of Public Security's Network Security Bureau, in a suggestion that the committee marked \"approved.\" \"But it can't be written that way, so one calls it independent and controllable.\"\nYang Jie, Rachael King and Don Clark contributed to this article.\nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com\nDecember 01, 2016 05:55 ET (10:55 ",
