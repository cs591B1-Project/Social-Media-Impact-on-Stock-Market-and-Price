      "text": "Howard Schultz Is Stepping Down as CEO of Starbucks COO Kevin Johnson will replace him By Christine Birkner December 1, 2016, 5:27 PM EST Advertising & Branding The move sparked speculation that Schultz will enter politics. Starbucks Longtime Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, known for weighing in often on social issues and associating the brand with causes, is stepping down from the role, the company announced today. Current president and COO Kevin Johnson will become CEO of the company, effective April 3, with Schultz remaining executive chairman. In a statement announcing the change, Schultz said: \"As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson—our current president, COO, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years—has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.\" Schultz became CEO in 1987, left the role in 2000 and returned in 2008. Throughout his leadership, he has been responsible for Starbucks' involvement in social issues, including his 2013 request that customers not carry guns into stores, a move that sparked praise and criticism on Twitter. He also helmed Starbucks' long history of employee-friendly policies, including offering health insurance to both full- and part-time employees and paying for employees' college tuition. Starbucks was criticized most recently on Twitter for its green cups, which were intended to unite Americans after the election and \"represent shared humanity and connection, serving as a symbol for stitching people together as a united community.\" The day after the election of Donald Trump, Schultz sent a note to Starbucks employees saying, \"We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.\" The New York Times reported that Schultz's departure is sparking speculation that he could enter politics.

Kevin Johnson, who's currently Chief Operations Officer, will replace Schultz as CEO in April 2017. \nLittle known fact about Schultz: he wasn't an original founder of Starbucks. He started out as Marketing Director at the chain in 1982. After failing to convince the owners to introduce Italian-style espresso drinks, he defected and opened his own store. In 1986, the original Starbucks owners sold Schultz their retail units, allowing him to rename his own shop 'Starbucks'. The rest is history. \nOriginally, Schultz only allowed whole milk in stores. In 2007, due to overwhelming demand, Starbucks switched to using 2% by default. \nFeatured in: Marketplace for Thursday, December 1, 2016 About the author Kai Ryssdal is the host and senior editor of Marketplace, the most widely heard program on business and the economy in the country.",

      "text": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation - WAFB 9 News Baton Rouge, Louisiana News, Weather, Sports Member Center: Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation By CANDICE CHOI and MICHAEL SISAKAssociated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings - a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

Schultz, 63, has overseen the expansion of the company's popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nSpeaking on a conference call, Johnson called Schultz one of the world's \"most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.\" \nThe company's sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they've slowed more recently. \nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In his message to employees Thursday, he said he planned to extend his \"focus on our social impact agenda.\" \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and has spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.",

ADVERTISEMENT Schultz will become the executive chairman and will focus on the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries and the company's social impact initiatives. He will continue to serve as chairman of the company's board.\nKevin Johnson, current president and chief operating officer at the company, will assume the role of CEO. \nThe changes will take effect on April 3. \nSchultz supported Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Overnight Finance: Trump econ team takes shape | Carrier deal puts companies on notice | House passes 'too big to fail' revamp Crowd at Trump rally brings back 'lock her up' chants Overnight Healthcare: GOP in talks about helping insurers after ObamaCare repeal MORE . \n“We've seen such vitriolic display of bigotry and hate and divisiveness, and that is not the leadership we need for the future of the country,” Schultz said about Trump in September. \nFollowing Trump's victory, he said he was \"stunned\" but wanted to give the president-elect a chance to lead. \nIn a public letter sent to his company after the election, he said \"we must honor the democratic process\" and give the president-elect \"the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together.\" \n“Whether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice,” he wrote. \n“Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores.” \nTrump supporters objected when Schultz endorsed Clinton, and the president-elect last year blasted the chain's plainspoken, non-religious holiday cups. \nSince the election, Trump supporters have been giving the president-elect's name to baristas to mark their orders with their support.   1,161   619   555 Shares 4 Tired Dem donors feel like their...

Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nThe company has credited the rewards program and app for helping its strong sales growth in the U.S., although expansion has slowed more recently. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nJohnson, 56, joined the Starbucks board in 2009.",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company’s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.”\n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks’ announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, “race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he’d do again “in a heartbeat.”\n“It was one of my proudest moments,” he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson’s technology background will help ensure Starbucks’ digital initiatives will remain a priority.",

      "text": "By Wallace Witkowski, MarketWatch\nAfter returning to helm in 2008, Schultz once again to depart as CEO\nShares of Starbucks Corp. fell in the extended session Thursday after Howard Schultz said he was stepping down, yet again, as the chief executive of the coffee retailer.\nStarbucks (SBUX) shares, which at one point dropped as much as 11% after the news broke, declined 3.3% to $56.58 in after-hours trading. The company said Kevin Johnson, the current president and chief operating officer, will take the CEO reins on April 3.\nThursday's drop carries with it a sense of foreboding, as this isn't the first time Schultz has stepped down as CEO. Back on April 6, 2000, Starbucks announced that Schultz was stepping down after a 13-year run to focus on the company's global strategy.\nFollowing that announcement, Starbucks shares shed 28% over the next seven weeks before staging a steady recovery that fell apart in the Great Recession.\nSchultz returned to Starbucks as CEO on Jan. 8, 2008, as a result of challenges facing the company during the financial crisis. Shares hit a post-Schultz high of $19.82 (accounting for splits) by May 5, 2006, a run-up of 460% following his departure, but they were trading at less than half that about 18 months later.\n\"In 2007-2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies, especially consumer brands, and Starbucks was not immune,\" Schultz said on a conference call. \"The management team at that time, all good people, did not have the experience needed to navigate through that period.\"\nSchultz, who will still act as chairman, said he would be focusing on growing out Starbucks's premier Roastery stores and Reserves stores, which are meant to challenge high-end coffee chains like Blue Bottle Coffee Co. There is currently one Roastery store in Seattle, where the company custom-roasts small batches of coffee from all over the world. Schultz said he plans to open six more Roastery stores by 2019, with an eye on 20 world-wide.\n-Wallace Witkowski; 1839ET\n ",

      "text": "Kevin Johnson was named Starbucks’ next CEO today, effective April 3. Photo via Starbucks. As Starbucks continues to invest more and more in new technology, it comes as little surprise that the company picked Kevin Johnson to be its new leader.\nThe Seattle-based coffee giant on Thursday named Johnson as its new CEO , effective April 3 of next year. Johnson, who joined the board in 2009 and became Starbucks’ CCO in 2015 , will replace current CEO Howard Schultz, the longtime Starbucks exec who will remain at the company and serve as chairman.\nKevin Johnson and Howard Schultz. (Starbucks Photo) Johnson has more than three decades of experience working at tech companies like IBM, Juniper Networks (he was CEO from 2008 to 2013), and Microsoft, where he led worldwide sales for two years before running the Windows and Online Services division for three years.\nHis appointment as CEO at Starbucks signals the company’s continued focus on utilizing new technology at its stores around the world. While Johnson was COO, the company rolled out a handful of new tech-powered initiatives like mobile ordering and delivery, while bringing its app and rewards program to China. He’s also familiar with the company, having been a board member for the past seven years.\nFormer colleagues tell GeekWire that Johnson is well-equipped to lead Starbucks, particularly as the global coffee corporation prioritizes new technology opportunities.\nSheila Gulati. “I have had the opportunity to see Kevin as a leader at both Microsoft and Juniper Networks,” said ex-Microsoft manager Sheila Gulati . “He is incredibly talented as a technology executive, but also as a leader of people. Starbucks has already distinguished itself by using technology in unique and innovative ways, and I have full confidence that this will accelerate with Kevin at the helm.”\nGulati, who just raised $295 million for a new Seattle-based venture fund , called Johnson a mission-driven leader who “provides a great balance of guidance and autonomy, thus great people love working for him.”\nShe recalled when Johnson, while running worldwide sales at Microsoft, created a program that allowed anyone in the company’s subsidiaries around the world to submit an application for funding a project that they had passion around.\n“I was working in India for Microsoft and I submitted a project directly to him to drive developer platform revenue,” Gulati recalled. “He accepted and funded the proposal and in the end we were able to generate 250 times the invested amount in multi-year revenue commitments for Microsoft. This wouldn’t have happened without a senior leader like Kevin creating a forum to directly engage with him in order to highlight special opportunities.”\nSteven Sinofsky at GeekWire Startup Day 2016. Steven Sinofsky, another former colleague of Johnson who worked at Microsoft for 23 years and was president of the Windows Division from 2006 to 2012, also pointed to Johnson’s leadership and collaboration skills.\n“He was an incredible supporter and leader during the transformation of the Windows organization,” Sinofsky told GeekWire. “Much of what we accomplished owes to the environment Kevin established and supported.”\nSinofsky said Johnson will be “an amazing asset” as CEO given his past experience.\n“Starbucks is a platform as much as we think of the food products,” he noted. “From the early days of free WiFi to the current world class app, tech is central to the full experience. This makes Kevin an even more incredible leader for the future of Starbucks.”\nBrian McAndrews, the former Pandora CEO who worked for Johnson after Microsoft acquired aQuantive for $6.3 billion in 2007, also pointed to Johnson’s experience in the tech world.\nBrian McAndrews. “I think the main benefit of Kevin’s technology experience is that he understands how to work in a rapidly changing environment where the threat of disruption is always just around the corner,” McAndrews said. “Starbucks has been innovative in so many ways over the years; it will need to continue to be so in a world where retail growth is particularly challenging.”\nMcAndrews, a board member at companies like GrubHub, The New York Times, and PicMonkey, added that Johnson is a “very thoughtful leader” who is good at developing a vision and then creating specific, accountable goals.\n“He is a very good listener and doesn’t care where good ideas come from,” McAndrews said. “His sales background makes him particularly strong at providing motivation for his teams.”\nMcAndrews said he didn’t always agree with Johnson while he worked for him at Microsoft, but “I always felt I had his ear and he had my back.”\nBen Slivka , who worked at Microsoft from 1985 to 1999, also praised Johnson’s listening skills.\n“In all my interactions with him during and after my time at Microsoft, he always impressed me as a smart, patient, thoughtful listener,” Slivka said.\nJohnson, who graduated from New Mexico State University with a B.A. in Business Administration, was named to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee in 2008 and served under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\nHe announced his retirement in 2013 after leaving Juniper, but then joined the executive team at Starbucks in January 2015 .\nJohnson is also involved with a handful of non-profits. He was a founding board member of NPower and supports Catalyst and Youth Eastside Services .",

Schultz will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \n[ MORE: 7 Companies That People Are Boycotting Because of the Trump Family ] \nThe company has credited the rewards program and app for helping its strong sales growth in the U.S., although expansion has slowed more recently. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in the leadership team. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \n[ MORE: What 8 CEOs Are Saying About Donald Trump's Victory ] \nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nOver the years, Schultz has also said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nSchultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press .

      "text": "Howard Schultz Is Stepping Down as CEO of Starbucks What does this mean for one of the world's biggest café chains? Jackson Connor Image via Getty/Mike Pont \nSince the late-1980s, Starbucks has been nearly synonymous with Howard Schultz, the chairman and chief executive officer that was able to turn the rising coffee company into a global food-chain juggernaut. On Thursday, however, Schultz shocked investors when he announced that he would be stepping down from his post to take on a new role as executive chairman, focusing on the company’s rare, small-batch roastery, Starbucks Reserve. \n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination,” Schultz said in a statement. “The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI — both in the U.S. and around the world.” \nAccording to the press release , Schultz will be handing the reins over to Kevin Johnson. A seven-year veteran of Starbucks’ board of directors, Johnson became the company’s president and chief operating officer last year, and will now assume the responsibilities of CEO. Following the announcement, Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the board. \nStill, as Bloomberg notes , Starbuck’s stock fell dramatically Thursday following the announcement of Schultz resignation as CEO. Share rebounded slightly as the day went on, but continued to remain down 3.3 percent. \nSchultz originally served as CEO of Starbucks from 1987 to 2000. Then, when announcing his return to the position in 2008, the company’s shares immediately shot up by more than 8 percent, according to CNBC . But beyond the numbers, Schultz has been credited with sparking long-term, international growth for the company, and creating better working conditions for his employees. \nEarlier this year, Starbucks baristas received a 5 percent pay raise , and Schultz had begun to relax the company’s notoriously strict dress code . \nThough Schultz publicly supported Hillary Clinton—and has had harsh words for Donald Trump— he’s denied rumors that he’s planning a run for the presidency in the future.",

      "title": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation",
      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company&apos;s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks&apos; fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain&apos;s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks&apos; announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings - a move Schultz told employees he&apos;d do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company&apos;s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson&apos;s technology background will help ensure Starbucks&apos; digital initiatives will remain a priority.\n ",

      "title": "Howard Schultz On Why He’s Stepping Down As Starbucks CEO",
      "text": "On Thursday, Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ CEO and Chairman, announced he would step down but would remain executive chairman. Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ President and COO, will become the new CEO. Here are the full remarks Schultz made in a call with investors and the media. \n \nKevin and I are very excited to have this opportunity to provide additional context around this afternoon's announcement and to answer any questions you might have.\nYou may recall that it was three years ago that I shared with you what I sensed were the early signs of a seismic shift in consumer behavior - away from bricks-and-mortar and towards mobile and online retailing. Today, that shift has taken firm hold around the world, both disrupting and redefining retailing and significantly reducing the consumer foot-traffic that traditional retailers have relied on for decades.\nDespite the shift, Starbucks has been able to consistently outperform the retail industry. We've been able to do so because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination, and because we invested way ahead of the curve to create world-class mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities that enable us to provide our customers with an increasingly elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers.\nEvidence of the correctness, and the success, of the core strategy that is driving our business are the facts that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry-leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that each successive new class of Starbucks stores is delivering record-breaking revenues, AUVs, ROI - both in the U.S. and around the world. This trend was repeated most recently in the 2016 fiscal year that just ended.\nI also shared with you the view that the U.S. was over-retailed. To survive - let alone succeed - traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers would have to evolve their physical spaces into relevant customer destinations, as Starbucks stores have been for the last 40 years through the environments we create and the beverages and foods we serve - and create premiumized, experiential consumer venues.\nThat view is what inspired development of the Starbucks Roastery and Reserve brand.\nSince its opening two years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become widely recognized as the world's most immersive, coffee-forward retail experience. Executives from premier global retailers like Apple , Nike and Zara have shared with me their view that the Roastery delivers the best retail experience - in or out of coffee - that they have ever encountered. Our Roastery is attracting customers and visitors to Seattle alike, and casting a bright halo across the entire Starbucks global brand and ecosystem.\nWith the Roastery, we introduced into the coffee category a previously unattained level of premiumization. Its success is unparalled, last year achieving a comp sales increase of 24% and delivering a ticket that is four times the ticket of a typical Starbucks store. The Roastery has become a learning laboratory for breakthrough innovation and experiential design and a beacon for the next wave of Starbucks global growth and evolution.\nGoing forward, we will open at least 20 Roasteries around the world, six by the end of calendar 2019 alone. At the same time, elements of the Roastery are forming the basis of the 1,000 or more Starbucks Reserve stores we will be opening around the world in the years ahead.\nStarbucks Reserve is a new, premium retail coffee format that will showcase the newest coffee-brewing methods and offer customers the finest assortment of exclusive, micro-lot coffees sourced from around the world in an all sensory experience emblematic of our Seattle Roastery, paired with artisanal food offerings developed with our partners from Italian artisanal baker Princi. We expect Starbucks Reserve stores to deliver twice the unit economics of the typical Starbucks store.\nWe will also add Reserve bars into thousands of existing Starbucks stores over time. Let me explain what a Reserve bar is and what that means to the company.\nThe Roastery has taught us and demonstrated that we can create customized, handcrafted beverages for our customers, using cutting-edge brewing methods and profitably deliver them at scale. Over time, you will see us introduce this unique capability into thousands of existing Starbucks stores around the world, further elevating the Starbucks Experience we deliver to our customers and further extending the halo that the Roastery casts across the entire Starbucks brand.\nLike our current stores - and the new classes of Starbucks stores we will be opening globally in the years to come - Roasteries, Reserve Stores and Reserve bars that will be customer destination venues. They will broaden, deepen and elevate our customer experience, and represent an unprecedented new global growth opportunity for the company. I am personally as passionate about developing the Reserve brand, and opening more Roasteries, as I was about opening our first espresso bar more than 30 years ago in Seattle.\nAs I shift my focus to this next wave of retail innovation, I am sincerely pleased that Kevin Johnson - our current president, coo, a seven-year board member, and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business day-to-day over the last two years - will be assuming the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer in April 2017. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue to profitably grow our core business around the world.\nLet me tell you why I personally asked Kevin to take on the ceo role, and why the Board and I believe that he is the ideal ceo for Starbucks at this moment in our journey.\nMany of you are familiar with the breadth of global management experience and the deep consumer and technology expertise that Kevin brought to Starbucks when he joined our board in 2009.\nSince then, Kevin has been a wise and supportive resource for me, personally, both during and following our company's transformation. For years he has provided invaluable insights into how we scale the company around the world, and how to best integrate industry leading customer facing technology into our customer experience and operations.\nI’ll simply note that Kevin has been immersed with us on management and operations issues and opportunities well before he took over the coo role two years ago. And that the two fiscal years following his engagement have been the best years in the history of Starbucks Coffee Company, with the most recent year producing record-shattering financial results and operating metrics across the board. Let me just say he deserves a tremendous amount of credit.\nAlong the way, Kevin and I have formed a trusting partnership, and Kevin's collaborative leadership style has won the loyalty and respect of our people while driving the team to deliver record performance.\nKevin brings to the ceo role an unparalleled understanding of the market dynamics and strategic choices that have driven Starbucks to become one of the world's most recognized and respected companies and brand.\nWe share a passion for customer-focused innovation and a commitment to preserving Starbucks heritage. Our complementary backgrounds - my entrepreneurial journey building Starbucks and Kevin's decades spent scaling global businesses - will continue to help Starbucks navigate this new period of worldwide growth and innovation.\nKevin is, in every respect, a true servant leader and a person whose courage, compassion and empathy model the very characteristics we want for all partners and all our leaders. His approach to solving complex problems and his ability to bring out the best in people will continue to make all of us at Starbucks better in the same context that he has made me better.\nI will remain Starbucks executive chairman, focusing full-time on the incredible growth opportunities we have in expanding Roasteries and building out our portfolio of Reserve stores and on Starbucks social impact agenda which will be a significant part of the focus going forward.\nThe truth is, in all my years at Starbucks I have never been more energized or exhilarated about the opportunities that lie ahead.\nPlease join me in congratulating Kevin. These are exciting times for all of us.\n ",

      "text": "By Julie Jargon\nStarbucks Corp. Howard Schultz is stepping down as chief executive of the Starbucks Corp so he can devote all of his time to a new strategic initiative of opening high-end coffee shops for the 45-year-old company.\nMr. Schultz, 63 years old, is handing over the reins to President and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who served as a board member of the company for several years before joining its executive team two years ago.\nMr. Schultz will remain chairman of Starbucks and said he has no plans to step away from the company or run for political office, as many have speculated in the past due to his vocal stance on such issues as veterans' rights and job creation.\n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" he said in an interview. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\"\nThe move is aimed at refreshing the Starbucks brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin' Donuts, which has been introducing more high-end drinks such as cold-brewed coffee.\nMr. Schultz said the approach could also help protect Starbucks from an inevitable loss of traffic from people who order more goods online, instead of making mall trips. He decided that opening high-end coffee shops that would provide a luxurious experience would entice people to leave their homes.\nTwo years ago the company opened its first such store, the Seattle Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, a 15,000-square-foot store where coffee is roasted and people can buy $12 cups of small-batch \"reserve\" coffees made with a siphon brewing technique.\nStarbucks is planning to open 20 to 30 more of the high-end stores, including one twice its size in Shanghai next year. The company plans to build up to 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site roasting, under the \"Starbucks Reserve\" brand with a logo that consists of just a gold star and the letter \"R.\"\nMr. Schultz described the plan as the company's biggest strategic initiative since Starbucks began opening stores overseas 20 years ago.\nStarbucks is also remodeling many of its stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and different brewing methods offered in the Reserve stores. The company also plans to test out new drinks and food at those stores and then introduce them in its traditional coffee shops that don't contain Reserve bars.\nMr. Schultz has shepherded Starbucks through many changes since he joined the coffee company in 1982 as its marketing director.\nAfter leaving the company after a dispute with its owners, Mr. Schultz in 1986 opened his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale, and later bought the Starbucks retail unit from its owners. He renamed his shop Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across the globe.\nThis isn't the first time Mr. Schultz has stepped down as CEO. In 2000, he left the company so he could focus on other endeavors, such as his ownership of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. But he returned in 2008, when the company was struggling, in order to help turn around the business.\nIn recent months, as he decided that focusing on opening high-end shops serving more expensive coffee and food was the way to create more growth in the company, Mr. Schultz began handing over the daily operations of Starbucks to Mr. Johnson, a former Microsoft executive. The idea for Mr. Schultz to focus squarely on the new strategy wasn't something he planned when he first hired Mr. Johnson.\n\"When I joined the management team two years ago, the intent coming in was to play a role in this strategy, not about a plan around this CEO transition,\" Mr. Johnson said.\nShares of the company fell 3.1% to $56.65 in after-hours trading as investors reacted to Mr. Schultz's departure.\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com\n 16:41 ET (21:41 ",

The company also plans to test out new drinks and food at those stores and then introduce them in its traditional coffee shops that don't contain Reserve bars.\nMr. Schultz has shepherded Starbucks through many changes since he joined the coffee company in 1982 as its marketing director.\nAfter leaving the company after a dispute with its owners, Mr. Schultz in 1986 opened his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale, and later bought the Starbucks retail unit from its owners. He renamed his own shop Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across the globe.\nThis isn't the first time Mr. Schultz has stepped down as CEO. In 2000, he left the company so he could focus on other endeavors, such as his ownership of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. But he returned in 2008, when the company was struggling, in order to help turn around the business.\nIn recent months, as he decided that focusing on opening high-end shops serving more expensive coffee and food was the way to create more growth in the company, Mr. Schultz began handing over the daily operations of Starbucks to Mr. Johnson, a former Microsoft executive. The idea for Mr. Schultz to focus squarely on the new strategy wasn't something he planned when he first hired Mr. Johnson.\n\"When I joined the management team two years ago, the intent coming in was to play a role in this strategy, not about a plan around this CEO transition,\" Mr. Johnson said.\nShares of the company fell 3.1% to $56.65 in after-hours trading as investors reacted to Mr. Schultz's departure.\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com\n 16:35 ET (21:35 ",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nStarbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

But he won’t be leaving—Schultz will be developing a higher-end chain of shops for the company. \nThe coffee chain announced that Schultz will remain at the company as an executive chairman after he leaves his post next year. Current president and chief operating officer Kevin Johnson will take up the position, effective April 3, 2017. \nSchultz, in his new role, will focus on building out an upscale chain of coffeehouses called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, and expanding the line’s retail presence around the world. The company had been experimenting with different global retail formats, under Schultz’s leadership. Earlier this year, it moved into the birthplace of espresso —opening its first coffee shop in Milan. \nSchultz previously left the company in 2000 , after growing it from a local coffee chain in Seattle into an $80 billion global powerhouse. He returned eight years later, in the midst of a global recession that he said had left the company in worse shape than he had anticipated. \nStarbucks’ stock was trading as low as $3.92 a share in November 2008, and is now at around $58 a share. It fell almost 4% in after-hours trading on the news of Schultz’s resignation. Read full story ",

Warren, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) New York • Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Since returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Investor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. During a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. Schultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. In a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. Over the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. Johnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.",

Co. apologizes Posted: Dec 01, 2016 11:50 AM PST Updated: Dec 01, 2016 11:50 AM PST \nStarbucks' travel-themed Oregon mug has a falls that looks like Multnomah Falls - but is labeled Klamath Falls, where no such falls exists (Photo: KPTV) \nStarbucks' travel-themed Oregon mug has a falls that looks like Multnomah Falls - but is labeled Klamath Falls, where no such falls exists (Photo: KPTV) \nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Starbucks could be in for a new coffee cup-related brouhaha after mislabeling a landmark on an Oregon-themed travel mug. \nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports ( http://bit.ly/2gMGS6u ) that the Seattle-based coffee chain has introduced a travel mug covered in sketches of notable Oregon landmarks, including Crater Lake National Park, food carts in Portland and Ashland's Shakespeare Festival. But there was also a waterfall design identified as \"Klamath Falls\"— and no such waterfall exists. \nThe simple line drawing of a falls topped by an arched bridge was likely meant to depict the majestic Multnomah Falls, a popular spot in the Columbia River Gorge. Klamath Falls is a town in southern Oregon. \nStarbucks owned up to the mistake in an email and apologized to the people of Oregon. \n\"The ceramic mug honoring Oregon was designed to feature a topographical map of the state's famous sites,\" the company said. \"One of the landmarks on this mug was mislabeled and unfortunately, that was not caught prior to production. We apologize for the error.\" \nThe coffee chain also sparked controversy last winter by choosing a simple red ombre for its holiday cup design. \n___ \nInformation from: The Oregonian/OregonLive, http://www.oregonlive.com Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Stephen Brashear/Getty Images Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz at the Starbucks Annual Shareholders Meeting on March 23, 2016, in Seattle, Washington. His successor will be the company's current president and chief operating officer, Kevin Johnson. \nStarbucks' Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO from the business he transformed into the world's largest coffee brand over the past 30 years. \nSchultz made the announcement Thursday (Dec. 1), saying he will make the transition April 3, 2017, and remain at the company as executive chairman. \nSince purchasing the Starbucks chain in 1987, Schultz built the brand's empire with more than 25,000 stores in 75 countries and a market value of $84 billion, according to the New York Times . Schultz has been a highly visible CEO while leading the company to take on social and political issues such as gun violence, race relations, gay rights, student debt, veterans rights and more. \nHis successor will be the company's current president and chief operating officer, Kevin Johnson. \nSchultz said he plans to continue to lead Starbucks' social efforts, while focusing on developing its higher-end shops, such as the 15,000-square-foot flagship Reserve Roastery in downtown Seattle, as well as smaller premium stores and \"bars\" in current Starbucks stores. Schultz's move is sure to feed speculation he has plans to enter politics, though he has said that is not in his current plans. \nUnder Schultz's direction, Starbucks as not only grown as a coffee brand but a powerful player in music. The company's investment began with the acquisition of music retailer Hear Music in 1999, initially focusing on compilations for music discovery sold in their coffee shops. \nIn the mid-aughts, the company developed a partnership with William Morris to help identify music to feature in their stores and Schultz helped bring in a number of exclusive music releases under the Hear Music record label in partnership with Concord Music Group. This incentive included albums by Paul McCartney , Joni Mitchell , Sia , Elvis Costello , James Taylor and more. \nHear Music also developed into a branded retail store with several Starbucks Hear Music Coffeehouses around the country, as well as \"media bars\" within existing Starbucks locations. \nA 2006 Billboard article cites annual album sales of 3.6 million units or approximately $65 million in music revenue via Starbucks. \nIn a 2004 interview with Fast Company , Schultz noted of Starbucks' jump into music: \"The nature of shopping for a CD or a piece of music at a traditional record store is, at its best, a very poor consumer experience. ... The Starbucks customer [who] might want to find a Diana Krall album, a Tony Bennett album, or anything that was not being played on the radio, well, they would have a hard time going into Tower Records. Maybe they'd find the album there, but they could not find someone who could talk to them about it. That consumer has disposable income and has had a long history of buying and enjoying music, but they have nowhere to go.\" \nThe Hear Music Coffeehouses shut down in 2008, as the company transferred the record label's day-to-day management fully to Concord that same year. And in 2015, the Starbucks coffee shops stopped selling CDs but has continued its music efforts, this year announcing a partnership with Spotify.",

      "title": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation",
      "text": "# Comments \nNEW YORK (AP)  Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Advertisement \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings  a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.",

      "text": "Wall Street traders may be scared about what life will be like for Starbucks ( SBUX ) without Howard Schultz as CEO, but they should chill out a bit.\nSchultz, 63, will step down effective April 3, 2017, the global coffee powerhouse said Thursday, just days ahead of its annual meeting with investors.\nThe visionary leader of Starbucks, who was CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then again from 2008 until now, will assume the role of Executive Chairman of Starbucks, shifting his focus to innovation, design and development of the chain's high-end roastery concept. Taking over as CEO will be current Starbucks President and Chief Operating Officer, long-time board member and Schultz confidant Kevin Johnson.\n\"Kevin has been a wise and supportive resource for me [through the years],\" Schultz told analysts on a conference call, adding that Johnson is \"better prepared\" to be the CEO of Starbucks going forward given his \"skillsets.\"\nShares of Starbucks fell as much as 3.5% on the news, as investors were likely surprised by the timing of the announcement. But as TheStreet has reported , the news of one of the most influential CEOs in modern business deciding to step away from the day to operations of Starbucks shouldn't be a total shocker.\nIn effect, Schultz has been preparing investors for this very day by restructuring his management team. And as a result of that careful planning and a rich pipeline of product and technological innovation (as well as a likely wiser with age Schultz), Starbucks is in a much better position relative to when Schultz first left as CEO back in 2000.",

      "text": "Don't call it a retirement.\nStarbucks ( SBUX ) CEO Howard Schultz, 63, will step down effective April 3, 2017, the global coffee powerhouse said Thursday , just days ahead of its annual meeting with investors.\nThe visionary leader of Starbucks, who was CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then again from 2008 until now, will assume the role of executive chairman, shifting his focus to innovation, design and development of the chain's high-end roastery concept. Taking over as CEO will be current Starbucks President and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time board member and Schultz confidant.\n\"Kevin has been a wise and supportive resource for me\" through the years, Schultz told analysts on a conference call, adding that Johnson is \"better prepared\" to be the CEO of Starbucks given his \"skillsets.\"\nIn his new role, Schultz will hardly be sitting back in a cushy seat and relaxing at home on a Wednesday afternoon. Instead, he will be trying like crazy to pull off quite another remarkable feat in a storied career: Get people to pay even more for a cup of coffee mostly by developing super premium retail experiences and likely, new exotic drinks and food.\nStarbucks is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells SBUX ? Learn more now .\nIn his second act, think of Schultz as attempting to turn Starbucks into the Louis Vuitton of coffee -- a premium experience both in terms of product (coffee and food) and shopping ecosystem (how you order and ultimately enjoy coffee and food).\nHe will drill down on two areas to try and make this coffee \"premiumization\" happen.",

      "text": "NEW YORK Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.",

      "text": "Starbucks' Schultz to step aside as CEO; stay on as chairman 1 Dec 2016 Getty/AFP/File / Stephen Brashear Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks at the Starbucks Annual Shareholders Meeting on March 23, 2016 in Seattle, Washington \nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz will step aside as CEO but remain with the company as chairman, the coffee giant said Thursday in a surprise announcement that sent the share price down after hours. \nSchultz, who helped grow Starbucks from a sleepy chain in Seattle to an iconic global brand, will stay on as executive chairman and chairman of the board. The change is effective April 3. \nHe will hand the reins to president and chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, who was tapped as number two at the company in 2015 and has been a Starbucks board member since 2009. \nThe move comes as the firm faces an increasingly crowded market for higher-quality retail coffee shops and seeks to bolster foot traffic. Schultz will devote his time to developing high-end coffee shops around the world known as Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, the company said in a statement. \nSchultz, 63, told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the new initiative would help maintain in-person sales as consumers increasingly move to online shopping rather than visiting malls, where many Starbucks outlets are located. \n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" Schultz said. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\" \nIncoming CEO Johnson is a tech industry veteran, having spent 16 years at Microsoft and five as CEO of the networking equipment company Juniper Networks. \nPrior to the announcement, the company's share price closed up 0.9 percent in New York but fell 4 percent lower in after-hours trading at 2200 GMT. The company announced in October that it planned to double the number of its stores in China over five years. 1 Dec 2016",

      "text": "NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Shares of Starbucks ( SBUX ) initially dropped by 6% on 63-year-old CEO Howard Schultz' announcement that he would step down from his role, effective April 3, 2017. The coffee company's COO Kevin Johnson will replace him, while Schultz will remain executive chairman.\nFor investors following Starbucks closely, this should not come as a big surprise, nor should it be a big deal, TIAA Global Asset Management Managing Director Stephanie Link said on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Thursday afternoon. Since he is staying on as executive chairman, he will still be \"very involved\" in the \"strategic development\" of Starbucks.\n\"I wouldn't sell on this news,\" she advised.\nSchultz planned originally to leave the company back in 2000 when he became chairman, but he returned in 2008 as CEO to help with faltering sales, noted CNBC's Andrew Sorkin. But Schultz told Sorkin that he \"meddled a little too much\" last time because he wasn't \"emotionally ready\" to let go of the company. While he doesn't want to \"hover\" this time around, his office will still be connected to Johnson's, Sorkin noted.\nThe fact he had to return to the company once to help turn it around and the fact that the stock initially dropped on this news shows Schultz is the \"Steve Jobs of Starbucks,\" claimed CNBC's Bill Griffeth. \"He can operationally manage this company, but he is not the symbol of Starbucks, is he?\" Griffeth asked Sorkin.\n\"Very much so,\" Sorkin answered. Schultz will probably remain the face of the company, while Johnson will take over the operation, day-to-day management of it, including scaling the business, Sorkin explained.",

      "text": "Starbucks CEO resigning to focus on innovation, social impact activities Howard Schultz, who endorsed Hillary Clinton, won't rule out running for public office. Associated Press Read Article \nNEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Outgoing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is credited with getting the coffee chain percolating again after returning as boss in 2008. Associated Press/Ted S. Warren Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.” \n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks announced the change, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nSchultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson, who joined the Starbucks board in 2009. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. \nHe spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.

Schultz will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) Posted: Thursday, December 1, 2016 6:14 pm Starbucks chairman to step down as CEO, focus on innovation The Associated Press \nNEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks announced the change, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nSchultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson, who joined the Starbucks board in 2009. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.

Subscribe Samsung Set For Biggest Change In Company’s History \nThere are some retail CEOS — Amazon’s Jeff Bezos comes to mind — whose names are intrinsically linked to the brands they lead. Howard Schultz is one of them. \nEffective April 3, 2017, the CEO of Starbucks, who helped redefine coffee retailing, turning a cup of joe into a mass-consumption, communal experience, is stepping down from leading the 25,000 store global chain. \nSchultz joined the Seattle-based retailer, founded in 1971, in 1982. At that time, it operated four stores. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks at the coffee company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle in March 2016. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \nKevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer, will take on the CEO role and leadership of Starbucks’ global business and operations. \nSchulz will transition to a role as executive chairman, focusing his attention on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks' “ultra-premium” retail formats, according to a press statement. \nIndeed, the retailer has been tapping its more upscale Starbucks Reserve and Starbucks Roasteries retail formats to uncork new revenue streams. \nHe'll also lead the retailer’s social impact initiatives, which comes as little surprise. Schultz, who grew up in the Bayview Housing projects in Brooklyn New York in a low-income family, has made “conscious capitalism” a cornerstone of Starbucks business philosophy, marked by company policies such as health insurance for part time works and college tuition reimbursement for employees , to backing causes from high unemployment to countering racism .

      "text": " 53   7 mins Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to step aside, stay as chairman By John BIERS, Luc OLINGA | AFP – 23 minutes ago View Photo \n\nHoward Schultz, the charismatic head of Starbucks (Hanover: SRB.HA - news ) , will step aside as CEO next year, turning a major page in the history of a company he built into an iconic global brand. \nHaving led the company's rise from a sleepy Seattle chain into the world's biggest coffee business, Schultz will stay on as executive chairman and chairman of the board, the coffee giant said Thursday in a surprise announcement that sent the share price down after hours. \nThe change will take effect April 3. \nSchultz will hand the reins to president and chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a close friend who was tapped as number two at the company in 2015 and has been a Starbucks board member since 2009. \nThe move comes as the firm faces an increasingly crowded market for higher-quality retail coffee shops and seeks to bolster foot traffic. \nSchultz will devote his time to developing high-end superpremium coffee shops around the world known as Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, the company said in a statement. \nIt plans to open 20 to 30 outlets in the coming years. \n\"I will be here full-time,\" Schultz told a conference call with analysts. \"I am not leaving the company, I am here day to day.\" \n- New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) initiative - \nSchultz, who joined Starbucks in 1982 as a sales manager, is considered the driving force behind the worldwide success of the coffee chain begun in 1971. \nHe briefly left in 1986 following a dispute with the then-owners to set up his own company, Il Giornale, before buying out their shares in 1987 with support from local small investors. \nStarbucks now operates more than 25,000 stores in more than 75 countries, with a turnover of around $20 billion in fiscal year 2015. \nSchultz, 63, told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the company's new initiative would help maintain in-person sales as consumers increasingly move to online shopping rather than visiting malls, where many Starbucks outlets are located. \n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" he said. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\" \nIncoming CEO Johnson is a tech industry veteran, having spent 16 years at Microsoft (Euronext: MSF.NX - news ) and five as CEO of the networking equipment company Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR - news ) . \nPrior to the announcement, the company's share price closed up 0.9 percent in New York but fell 3.35 percent in after-hours trading to $56.55 at 2250 GMT. \n- Socially responsible - \nSchultz is outspoken about social issues such as gay rights and gun violence and has worked to make Starbucks socially responsible. \nThe company increased the base salaries of its US employees by 5 percent in July after they expressed concerns about the effect new software enabling customers to place orders on their smartphones would have on jobs. \nThe company has also opened outlets in poor areas and supported initiatives against racism. \nSchultz is close to the Democratic former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom he supported during the election campaign. But he has dismissed persistent rumors he would run for office himself. Many, including some of his friends, have said he may run for president in four years. \nHe steps down as Starbucks goes ahead with plans to double the number of its stores in China over five years. \nBut it has run afoul of European regulators, one of several major US companies the European Commission accused of having received illegal tax benefits from Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) . \nIn October 2015, the commission also ordered Starbucks to repay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) in the Netherlands, saying tax breaks there amounted to unlawful state aid. \nThe Dutch authorities are fighting the decision. \nSchultz has sought to step away from running Starbucks before. \nThe Wall Street darling became the company's chairman in 2000 before returning as chief executive in 2008 with the onset of the global financial crisis. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) worth $10 at that time climbed to a record high of more than $60 by the end of last year.

      "text": " Google+\nStephen Brashear/Getty Images\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz will give up the reins of the world’s largest coffee business in April.\nBy Andrew Ross Sorkin New York Times December 02, 2016\nSEATTLE — Howard Schultz, the leader of Starbucks, said on Thursday he would step down as chief executive next year, handing over to his personally selected successor management of the company he built into the world’s largest coffee business, with over 25,000 stores in 75 countries.\nSchultz, one of the most visible chief executives in the country, has made Starbucks a vocal part of the national conversation on issues like gun violence, gay rights, race relations, veterans rights, and student debt. The handover will take place on April 3, and he will remain at the company as executive chairman.\nAdvertisement\nSchultz, 63, will be succeeded by his close friend Kevin Johnson, the company’s current president and a longtime Starbucks board member.\n“This is a big day for me,” Schultz said in an interview. “I love the company as much as I love my family.”\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here But he said he decided it was the right time to hand the keys to Johnson, whom he described as being “better equipped” to “run the company than I am,” ticking off a list of Johnson’s operational talents, saying that he wanted to “relinquish the role and responsibility to the right person.”\nThe move is likely to ignite renewed speculation about whether Schultz is paving the way to leave the company entirely to enter politics. His outspoken positions on social issues have led many people, including his closest friends, to say he may run for president. He has spent an increasing amount of time traveling around the country speaking publicly about the need to fix the “dysfunction in Washington.” He has a close relationship with President Obama and had been a supporter of Hillary Clinton.\nSchultz will continue to lead Starbucks’ efforts on social issues as well as the development of its effort to develop a superpremium line of coffee and coffee stores. The latter has been a passion project for Schultz that he hopes will “shine a halo on the entire company.”\nAdvertisement\nJohnson, 56, spent his career in technology as a lieutenant of Steven A. Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, and later as chief executive of Juniper Networks, before being recruited out of retirement by Schultz in 2015 to become president and chief operating officer of Starbucks.\nJohnson, a soft-spoken operator known for his focus on building Starbucks’ mobile payments systems and on executing the company’s global strategy, has been on a listening tour with employees over the last year to better appreciate the company’s culture. Conversations with store managers who told intimate stories about their passion and relationship with the company have been known to bring Johnson to tears.\nThe succession plan is the second time Schultz has sought to step back from overseeing the company. He became the company’s chairman in 2000 but returned as chief executive in 2008 after firing the installed chief, James Donald, as sales faltered. Upon returning to Starbucks as chief executive, Schultz increased the company’s market value to $84 billion from $15 billion.\nIn an interview on Thursday in a tasting room at Starbucks’ flagship Reserve Roastery in downtown Seattle, a Willy Wonka-like 15,000-square-foot premium coffee emporium that the company hopes to open in large cities around the world, Schultz was animated and emotional about his decision.\nSchultz and Johnson met in the early 2000s when Schultz worked with Microsoft to help deploy wireless Internet in Starbucks stores. They became close friends, and Johnson became a sounding board for Schultz. Johnson joined the Starbucks board in 2009.\nSchultz said that unlike his previous effort to step back, “I was not as emotionally prepared for the moment as I am now. I don’t think I had the conviction — I was still meddling.”\n“I got succession wrong the first time,” he added. He said of Johnson, “I’m not going to be hovering and shadowing him.”",

NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 04: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks at an event celebrating a new partnership between Starbucks and non-profit groups in New York City and Los Angeles to assist in offsetting government funding cuts to programs for children and education on October 4, 2011 in New York City. Two Starbucks stores, one in Harlem and one in Los Angeles' Crenshaw district, will share profits with the partner non-profit groups the Abyssinian Development Corporation and the Los Angeles Urban League. Each group will receive at least $100,000 in the first year, the company said.

Updated less than a minute ago NEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Since returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Investor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. During a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. Schultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.”",

      "text": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation   6:23 PM Dec 1, 2016 at 10:53 PM   \nNEW YORK (AP) \" Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks announced the change, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nSchultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson, who joined the Starbucks board in 2009. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. About Us",

PHOTO: NYTIMES Dec 2, 2016 6:43 AM \n[NEW YORK] Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz will step aside as CEO but remain with the company as chairman, the coffee giant said Thursday in a surprise announcement that sent the share price down after hours. \nMr Schultz, who helped grow Starbucks from a sleepy chain in Seattle to an iconic global brand, will stay on as executive chairman and chairman of the board. The change is effective April 3. \nHe will hand the reins to president and chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, who was tapped as number two at the company in 2015 and has been a Starbucks board member since 2009. \nThe move comes as the firm faces an increasingly crowded market for higher-quality retail coffee shops and seeks to bolster foot traffic. Mr Schultz will devote his time to developing high-end coffee shops around the world known as Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, the company said in a statement. \nMr Schultz, 63, told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the new initiative would help maintain in-person sales as consumers increasingly move to online shopping rather than visiting malls, where many Starbucks outlets are located. \n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" Mr Schultz said. \n\"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\" \nIncoming CEO Johnson is a tech industry veteran, having spent 16 years at Microsoft and five as CEO of the networking equipment company Juniper Networks. \nPrior to the announcement, the company's share price closed up 0.9 per cent in New York but fell 4 per cent lower in after-hours trading at 2200 GMT. The company announced in October that it planned to double the number of its stores in China over five years. \nAFP ",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 per cent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.\nCandice Choi And Michael Sisak, The Associated Press",

Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.” \n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks’ announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, “race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he’d do again “in a heartbeat.” \n“It was one of my proudest moments,” he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson’s technology background will help ensure Starbucks’ digital initiatives will remain a priority. ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post...",

      "text": "Howard Schultz will step aside as CEO of Starbucks next year, and Kevin Johnson, chief operating officer, will step up to replace him.\nThe move comes as the firm faces an increasingly crowded market for higher-quality retail coffee shops and seeks to bolster foot traffic.\nSchultz will become the company’s executive chairman on 3 April 2017, concentrating on ramping up Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, a new premium experience that the company is betting on to boost growth worldwide, as well as the company’s well-known forays into community activism.\nThe coffee magnate, who has been with the company for more than 30 years, is credited with turning Starbucks into a global brand with name recognition comparable to McDonald’s and Coca-Cola.\n\"Since its opening two years ago, our Seattle Roastery has become widely recognized as the world’s most immersive, coffee-forward retail experience.\"\n\"Executives from premier global retailers like Apple, Nike and Zara have shared with me their view that the Roastery delivers the best retail experience – in or out of coffee – that they have ever encountered. Our Roastery is attracting customers and visitors to Seattle alike, and casting a bright halo across the entire Starbucks global brand and ecosystem,\" said Schultz in an investor and media conference call.\nHe added, going forward, he aims to open at least 20 Roasteries around the world, six by the end of calendar 2019 alone, and it plans to open more than 1,000 Reserve stores, a new premium coffee space that will highlight new brewing techniques, and artisanal food offerings.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales, although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nIt’s the second time since Schultz bought Starbucks in the late 1980s that he has stepped down from the role of CEO. He resigned in 2000, only to return to the helm eight years later.\nThe coffeehouse chain’s current situation is different from its position eight years ago, Schultz said, because the 2016 management team was better-suited to the challenges of the market than 2008’s senior staff had been.\nJohnson, the CEO-to-be, is known for his focus on building Starbucks’ mobile payments systems and executing the company’s global strategy. His career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks.\nThe company announced in October that it planned to double the number of its stores in China over five years.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Howard Schultz, the visionary leader of Starbucks, will be stepping down next year as CEO of the iconic coffee giant.\nSchultz’s surprise decision to step aside as the leader of Starbucks sent the stock sinking 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday.\nStarbucks said Schultz isn’t going away completely. Effective April 3, he will become executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, the company’s premium offerings and on social impact. Current chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a tech industry veteran, will replace Schultz as CEO.\n“This is a good thing. I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz told CNN’s Poppy Harlow by phone on Thursday.\nThe 63-year-old said he had been planning the move for at least a year. Asked if he’s going to Washington, Schultz laughed and said, “No, I’m not going to Washington.”\nInstead, Schultz emphasized a desire to focus on the company’s social impact initiatives.\n“Given the state of things in the country, there is a need to help those left behind,” Schultz told CNN.\nSchultz said he also wants to focus on Starbucks’ premium offerings, such as the Roasteries that allow customers to watch freshly-roasted beans arrive.\nSeparately, in a conference call, Schultz said Johnson brings “unparalleled understanding of market dynamics” and he deserves a “tremendous amount of credit” for the company’s recent record results.\nDuring the call, Johnson called Schultz “among the world’s most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.”\nJohnson seemed to choke up and his voice broke when he said it had been a “privilege to work side-by-side with Howard.”\nSchultz joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of retail operations and he helped turn the company into a retail powerhouse and an iconic American brand. He stepped down as CEO in April 2000 to concentrate on executing the company’s global strategy.\nBut Starbucks struggled without him at the helm and seemed to have lost its way. Schultz returned as CEO in 2008 and helped guide the coffee giant through the Great Recession and get it back on track. Today, Starbucks is valued at $84 billion and it has more than 24,000 retail stores in 70 countries.\nSchultz has also been outspoken on a variety of social issues. He has supported raising the minimum wage, he offered his employees free college and pushed Starbucks to open a store in Ferguson following the city’s violent protests.\nAsked if he’s concerned Starbucks could suffer again in his absence as CEO, Schultz said the “differences between then and now couldn’t be greater.”\nSchultz said the Starbucks management team didn’t have the “capability and experience” to navigate the Great Recession. By contrast, he praised Johnson’s skills and even said his deputy is “better prepared than I am” to be CEO at this point.",

He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical as shopping habits change.\nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\n— Associated Press \nNBA star becomes sportsperson of year \nLeBron James delivered on a promise and ended decades of Cleveland sports misery in 2016.\nFor leading the Cavaliers to an NBA title and ending the city's 52-year title drought, James was chosen Sports Illustrated 's Sportsperson of the Year on Thursday, joining Tiger Woods as the award's only two-time winners since its inception in 1954.\n\"I'm honored,\" James said following shootaround before the Cavs hosted the Los Angeles Clippers . \"I'm more happy for my family, my kids, for my wife, my mom, and for my foundation, for the kids that I represent and the kids that use me as a role model and an inspiration.\"\nAppearing in his sixth straight NBA Finals in June, James rallied the Cavs from a 3-1 deficit to defeat the favored Golden State Warriors , who won 73 games during the regular season but couldn't put Cleveland away. James scored 41 points in Games 5 and 6 and made a key block in the final minutes of an epic Game 7, making the Cavs the first Cleveland major sports franchise to win a title since the Browns in 1964.\nJames was selected finals MVP for the third time in his career.\n— Associated Press \nPrince Harry joins salute to Barbados \nBritain's Prince Harr y joined Rihanna in celebrating 50 years of independence for her native Barbados.\nThe prince, visiting the sixth of seven nations on a two-week Caribbean tour, and the singer shared the stage Wednesday night with the prime minister during a concert and dance performance marking the date the island broke away from Britain.\nHarry read a message from Queen Elizabeth II congratulating Barbados and saying that the island should be \"rightfully proud\" of a vibrant culture and natural beauty. He spoke before a crowd of about 20,000 people at the Kensington Oval cricket ground.\nHe also encouraged residents to work together to confront challenges such as climate change and the effects of technology on the job market.\nEarlier, Rihanna and Harry met at the airport, and then marked World AIDS Day by visiting an HIV clinic in Bridgetown and being tested for the disease. The prince took a public HIV test this summer as part of a campaign to raise public awareness.\nHarry is on a two-week tour of the Caribbean that is also a celebration of the 90th birthday of his grandmother the queen.\nHe will stop next in Guyana, where he is expected to make a trip to the rainforest, meet with President David Granger and place a wreath at a memorial to that country's independence.\n— Associated Press",

Associated Press Read Article \nPORTLAND, Ore. — Starbucks could be in for a new coffee cup-related brouhaha after mislabeling a landmark on an Oregon-themed travel mug. \nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the coffee chain has introduced a travel mug bearing sketches of notable Oregon landmarks, including Crater Lake National Park, food carts in Portland and Ashland’s Shakespeare Festival. Contary to what Starbucks' new coffee cup says, Klamath Falls is a town in southern Oregon, not a waterfall itself. Associated Press/Don Ryan Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \nBut there was also a waterfall design identified as “Klamath Falls” — and no such waterfall exists. \nThe simple line drawing of a falls topped by an arched bridge was likely meant to depict the majestic Multnomah Falls in the Columbia River Gorge. \nKlamath Falls is a town in southern Oregon.

The coffee giant struggled the last time CEO Schultz left. By Dec. 1, 2016 7:15 p.m. ET Text Size Large Starbucks Photo: Starbucks \nThe chief of Starbucks is stepping down, and investors are clearly nervous. The stock fell 4% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the announcement . Judging from the company’s performance the last time he left, the stock’s negative reaction makes sense. \nHoward Schultz, who grew Starbucks from a small Seattle chain to a multinational corporation, says he’s stepping down in April to focus on launching a series of high-end Starbucks shops. These shops are meant to draw in customers looking for a more tailored and high-end experience – special “reserve” coffees at the first such store in Seattle sell for as much as $12. Starbucks is opening 20 to 30 of them worldwide. \n“This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best,” Schultz told the Wall Street Journal . \nKevin Johnson, the current president and chief operating officer of Starbucks, will take over as CEO. Johnson, a tech industry veteran, has been on the Starbucks board for seven years but just joined the management team last year. \nSchultz has taken a hiatus before, and the company suffered in his absence. He left in 2000 after running the company for 18 years, but returned in 2008 to rescue the ailing stock, which fell 42% in 2007. The stock has more than sextupled since. \nUntil the Street gets comfortable with Johnson, expect investors’ uneasiness to be reflected in the stock. \nBig Picture: Starbucks fell after CEO Howard Schultz said he’ll be stepping down. The uncertainty could hurt Starbucks shares in the coming months. Text Size",

      "text": "You are at: Home » News » The Latest News » Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to step aside, stay as chairman Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to step aside, stay as chairman Tweet \nNEW YORK: Howard Schultz, the charismatic head of Starbucks, will step aside as CEO next year, turning a major page in the history of a company he built into an iconic global brand. \nHaving led the company’s rise from a sleepy Seattle chain into the world’s biggest coffee business, Schultz will stay on as executive chairman and chairman of the board, the coffee giant said Thursday in a surprise announcement that sent the share price down after hours. \nThe change will take effect April 3. \nSchultz will hand the reins to president and chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a close friend who was tapped as number two at the company in 2015 and has been a Starbucks board member since 2009. \nThe move comes as the firm faces an increasingly crowded market for higher-quality retail coffee shops and seeks to bolster foot traffic. \nSchultz will devote his time to developing high-end superpremium coffee shops around the world known as Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, the company said in a statement. \nIt plans to open 20 to 30 outlets in the coming years. \n“I will be here full-time,” Schultz told a conference call with analysts. “I am not leaving the company, I am here day to day.” \nNew initiative \nSchultz, who joined Starbucks in 1982 as a sales manager, is considered the driving force behind the worldwide success of the coffee chain begun in 1971. \nHe briefly left in 1986 following a dispute with the then-owners to set up his own company, Il Giornale, before buying out their shares in 1987 with support from local small investors. \nStarbucks now operates more than 25,000 stores in more than 75 countries, with a turnover of around $20 billion in fiscal year 2015. \nSchultz, 63, told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the company’s new initiative would help maintain in-person sales as consumers increasingly move to online shopping rather than visiting malls, where many Starbucks outlets are located. \n“I don’t have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,” he said. “This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.” \nIncoming CEO Johnson is a tech industry veteran, having spent 16 years at Microsoft and five as CEO of the networking equipment company Juniper Networks. \nPrior to the announcement, the company’s share price closed up 0.9 percent in New York but fell 3.35 percent in after-hours trading to $56.55 at 2250 GMT. \nSocially responsible \nSchultz is outspoken about social issues such as gay rights and gun violence and has worked to make Starbucks socially responsible. \nThe company increased the base salaries of its US employees by 5 percent in July after they expressed concerns about the effect new software enabling customers to place orders on their smartphones would have on jobs. \nThe company has also opened outlets in poor areas and supported initiatives against racism. \nSchultz is close to the Democratic former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom he supported during the election campaign. But he has dismissed persistent rumors he would run for office himself. Many, including some of his friends, have said he may run for president in four years. \nHe steps down as Starbucks goes ahead with plans to double the number of its stores in China over five years. \nBut it has run afoul of European regulators, one of several major US companies the European Commission accused of having received illegal tax benefits from Ireland. \nIn October 2015, the commission also ordered Starbucks to repay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) in the Netherlands, saying tax breaks there amounted to unlawful state aid. \nThe Dutch authorities are fighting the decision. \nSchultz has sought to step away from running Starbucks before. \nThe Wall Street darling became the company’s chairman in 2000 before returning as chief executive in 2008 with the onset of the global financial crisis. \nShares worth $10 at that time climbed to a record high of more than $60 by the end of last year.

      "title": "Starbucks CEO steps down to focus on high-end coffee, shares fall",
      "text": "Related Content View Photo Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, speaks during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, …\n\nBy Lisa Baertlein and Gayathree Ganesan\n(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive.\nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans.\nStarbucks had signalled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008.\n\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its saviour.\n\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.\nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure.\n\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. \nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune. \nJohnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015. \nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N) from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).\nOn a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\"\n\"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.\n\"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's.\nTraffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty programme, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales.\nThe company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics. \n\"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n(Reporting by Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; additional writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Oatis)",

      "title": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation",
      "text": "By CANDICE CHOI and MICHAEL SISAK\nAssociated Press NEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings - a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.\n ",

      "text": "× Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to step down \nNEW YORK — Howard Schultz, the visionary leader of Starbucks, will be stepping down next year as CEO of the iconic coffee giant. \nSchultz’s surprise decision to step aside as the leader of Starbucks sent the stock sinking 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday. \nStarbucks said Schultz isn’t going away completely. Effective April 3, he will become executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, the company’s premium offerings and on social impact. Current chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a tech industry veteran, will replace Schultz as CEO. \n“This is a good thing. I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz told CNN’s Poppy Harlow by phone on Thursday. \nThe 63-year-old said he had been planning the move for at least a year. Asked if he’s going to Washington, Schultz laughed and said, “No, I’m not going to Washington.” \nInstead, Schultz emphasized a desire to focus on the company’s social impact initiatives. \n“Given the state of things in the country, there is a need to help those left behind,” Schultz told CNN. \nSchultz said he also wants to focus on Starbucks’ premium offerings, such as the Roasteries that allow customers to watch freshly-roasted beans arrive. \nSeparately, in a conference call, Schultz said Johnson brings “unparalleled understanding of market dynamics” and he deserves a “tremendous amount of credit” for the company’s recent record results. \nDuring the call, Johnson called Schultz “among the world’s most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.” \nJohnson seemed to choke up and his voice broke when he said it had been a “privilege to work side-by-side with Howard.” \nSchultz joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of retail operations and he helped turn the company into a retail powerhouse and an iconic American brand. He stepped down as CEO in April 2000 to concentrate on executing the company’s global strategy. \nBut Starbucks struggled without him at the helm and seemed to have lost its way. Schultz returned as CEO in 2008 and helped guide the coffee giant through the Great Recession and get it back on track. Today, Starbucks is valued at $84 billion and it has more than 24,000 retail stores in 70 countries. \nSchultz has also been outspoken on a variety of social issues. He has supported raising the minimum wage, he offered his employees free college and pushed Starbucks to open a store in Ferguson following the city’s violent protests. \nAsked if he’s concerned Starbucks could suffer again in his absence as CEO, Schultz said the “differences between then and now couldn’t be greater.” \nSchultz said the Starbucks management team didn’t have the “capability and experience” to navigate the Great Recession. By contrast, he praised Johnson’s skills and even said his deputy is “better prepared than I am” to be CEO at this point.",

      "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz steps aside to focus on other corporate initiatives",
      "text": "December 1 at 7:27 PM Follow @sarahhalzack Follow @jenamcgregor Starbucks announced Thursday that Howard Schultz plans to step aside as chief executive to focus on new initiatives at the coffee giant, an abrupt change for a man widely praised for putting a once adrift company back on track and guiding it through a period of rapid global expansion.\nSchultz, who rarely shied away from putting Starbucks in the center of public policy debates, said he will stay on as chairman as he turns the CEO reins over to Kevin Johnson, the coffee chain’s chief operating officer. His sudden move revived speculation that he may one day try his hand at politics.\nIn a conference call with investors, Schultz declared that Johnson, with his background in the technology industry that includes a 16-year stint at Microsoft, “is better prepared to be the CEO on a go-forward basis than I am.”\nStarbucks, like virtually every other retailer, is trying to adapt to an increasingly digital world. Starbucks has had unusual success at it, developing a widely used mobile payment app that has led to many headlines about how the coffee chain is transforming into a technology company. In tapping Johnson as chief executive, Starbucks is making a statement about its intentions to stay out in front in the digital realm.\nWhen the leadership handoff takes place in April, Schultz will turn his focus to an ambitious project to make major brands out of two relatively new concepts in the Starbucks portfolio: Roasteries, sprawling facilities where the company roasts and packages premium coffees and offers a ­tasting-room-style experience, and Starbucks Reserve, cafes that serve the fancy coffee made at the roasteries. Schultz said the company has plans for at least 20 roasteries and 1,000 Reserve stores worldwide.\nSchultz has been in his second stint as CEO for nearly nine years — he initially stepped down in 2000 and then famously came back in early 2008. Interestingly, the first time he stepped away he also did so to take on a more strategic, high-level role: He became the company’s “chief global strategist.”\nOn Thursday’s call with investors, Schultz sought to emphasize that this time would be different.\nIn talking about his return as chief executive in 2008, amid a national financial crisis, Schultz said that the “management team at that time just did not have the capability to navigate through that difficult period.”\nNow, however, he said he believes the leadership team is better equipped to fend for itself. And, he added, “on a personal level, I don’t think I was as prepared then as I am now.”\nWall Street has long been a big fan of Schultz. After news of the transition broke, Starbucks stock sank nearly 4 percent in after-hours trading.\nThe hallmark of Schultz’s leadership of Starbucks has long been his willingness to speak out about societal issues more than most CEOs of companies of its size.\nIn 2013, Schultz told an investor he could sell his shares if he didn’t like the company’s stance on same-sex marriage. He got credit for company programs such as offering college education benefits and promoting the hiring of young, minority workers and veterans. In March, he put together a series of online videos that offered feel-good lessons on civic engagement.\nOther efforts didn’t work so well, such as his “Race Together” campaign to get baristas and customers speaking about race, which many saw as tone deaf, a company going one step too far in its effort to bring political values into the workplace.\nThat’s led some to question whether Schultz has aims on higher office. In March, he made some presidential-sounding remarks at the company’s annual stockholder meeting. Speaking in lofty terms about the lack of civility and leadership in the country, he said that “there are moments when I’ve had a hard time recognizing who we are and who we are becoming. We are facing a test not only of our character but of our morality as a people.”\nHe seemed to be alluding to the divisiveness of the 2016 presidential campaign. “What is the role and responsibility of all of us as citizens? We must do everything we can to reclaim and reimagine the American Dream and fill the reservoir back up — not with cynicism but with optimism, not with despair but with possibility, not with division but with unity,” he said.\nIn an op-ed in the New York Times in August, Schultz said he has “no intention of entering the presidential fray.”\nAsked again about it in an interview on CNN recently, he didn’t entirely rule out a run, saying: “I’m still a young man. Let’s see what the future holds.” Later, Schultz added, “I determined for myself that at this time, I can do more as a private citizen and as the CEO of a public company to advance the causes that I think are important for the country and for our company.”\nIn the Thursday call with investors, Schultz said: “I’m not leaving the company. I’m here every single day.” A spokeswoman for Starbucks said Schultz has no plans to run for political office.\nJohnson has worked as the company’s chief operating officer since 2015 and has been a member of the board of directors since 2009.\nPreviously, Johnson was chief executive of Juniper Networks and served on the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee.",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nOn December 1st an announcement was made that Starbucks' CEO Howard Schultz will be replaced by Kevin Johnson. \nSchultz and Schultz alone made the company as it is today. \nSchultz doesn't leave the company and will focus on a great differentiator with Starbucks Reserve Roastery. \nI think the combination of technology (Johnson) and more focus on authenticity (Schultz) will make Starbucks exciting again. The news had been speculated about for some time, but it still hit like a bomb: legendary Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) CEO Howard Schultz changes his CEO role for that of executive chairman. Kevin Johnson, the present COO, will become Schultz's successor in the CEO chair from April 3, 2017 onwards. This could cause some panic in some investors' minds and in the SBUX stock trade. I am going to analyze if you should sell your Starbucks shares or rather buy more if the price would drop. The history of Schultz and Starbucks Howard Schultz is probably one of the most iconic CEO's ever. Even if you are not an investor in Starbucks, you probably know the man. The fact that he's stepping aside now as the CEO of Starbucks, means the end of an era. Schultz and I would almost add Schultz alone has made Starbucks the great company that it is today. Schultz started at Starbucks in 1982 as the director of marketing. It was Schultz who saw on an Italian business trip that the Italian café was not just a place where they served exquisite espresso, creamy latte machiato and luscious cappuccino, but also a meeting place. He tested the concept of an Italian café in a few Starbucks points and it worked very well, but the owners of Starbucks refused to roll out the concept over all the branches. Frustrated Schultz left Starbucks in 1985 to start Il Giornale (Italian for The Paper), an Italian café concept. In 1988 Schultz could take over the retail part of Starbucks and the name for $3.8M and started to grow the company aggressively. He didn't believe in franchising, so he had the overview of every single Starbucks. In 1992 Starbucks had its IPO. Eight years later, Schultz resigned from Starbucks because he was exhausted from growing a small café to a huge chain in only 15 years. If you had invested in Starbucks at the IPO, you had a return of 1,560% over eight years. SBUX data by YCharts The company and the stock started to slump during Schultz leave until he came back in 2008. Schultz came back with a vengeance. He threw out almost all of the executives, closed unprofitable stores and went back to the core business and to growing same store sales. This had an immediate result and Starbucks shares went through the roof again. Another 1,320% gain for the stock (even without the rapidly growing dividend) were the result of Howard Schultz II. Will it be like 2000-2008 all over again? If you know this history, it is no wonder that Starbucks shares went down after hours after the news was announced that Howard Schultz, the icon of Starbucks, would step down as CEO of the company he has made great. The real founder of the Starbucks empire, the general that had to return to his army without direction, the guide that had to lead his sheep out of the retail swamp resigns as CEO at the age of 63. Are we going to witness the same collapse as in the eight years between 2000 and 2008? In other words, should you sell your Starbucks shares now because they could go down 10% over an eight-year time span? To answer shortly: I don't think so. The first and very important difference is that Schulz is not completely leaving now. He is going to be the executive chairman and will concentrate on the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, the newest Starbucks concept. Click to enlarge ( The Seattle Starbucks Reserve Roastery, source Pinterest ) The new CEO will be Kevin Johnson, which is no surprise at all.There have been rumours that he would take over from when he joined the Starbucks management team as COO in 2015. But don't be misled by this date: Johnson has been serving in the Starbucks board of directors since 2009, so he knows the company very well. Even more interesting: Johnson has 30 years of experience in technology, serving as the CEO of Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR ) and the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) worldwide chief of sales and marketing. Technology will be is the biggest differentiator in retail in the near future. Starbucks already has a highly appraised order and pay app and more and more customers use it. If this app can make the difference between going in for 20 seconds for your breakfast and coffee on the way to work versus 2 minutes in a competitor's store, it is clear which one the customer will prefer. So Johnson is excellently positioned to focus on the technological part of Starbucks. As the COO of Starbucks, he was already responsible for the global business operations, the supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology and mobile and digital platforms. If there is one guy who is able to handle more customers per Starbucks store efficiently, his name will be Kevin Johnson. Besides that, I think that there are big opportunities left for Johnson with all the big data from mobile app users. Not in a dirty way, but in a very positive one. As Schulz had a vision of a coffee chain as a meeting place to create a sense of community, there is a huge opportunity to create a technological Starbucks community that would create a sense of belonging for Starbucks customers. Starbucks is a technology leader if you compare it to all its competitors and with Johnson as the CEO I expect that their lead will only become bigger. How about Schultz? It is very reassuring that Schultz doesn't leave Starbucks, as he did in 2000. I'm quite sure that he will not let his baby go down as it did after his exit. He will be there to see that it thrives. He can be the visionary leader that he has always been, with keen insights and a great nose for what the consumer wants, often even before the consumer himself knows. On the other hand I think that Schultz will focus on something very important too. Schultz is convinced that the USA is completely over- retailed. I think he is completely right. There are lots of retail stores and lots of them all look and feel more or less the same. And since Starbucks has been hugely successful, its concept has been imitated several times. Therefore technological leadership is important. The consumer wants everything fast and easy. But if that consumer does take the time to relax and enjoy, he wants something that stands out. One of the hippest terms for some years now has been authenticity. It has become a worn-out term maybe, but the concept itself is still gaining power. People want real things next to the artificial lives. There are several trends that rooted from this principle: organic food next to fast food, warm wooden interiors next to plastic functionality etc. Starbucks Reserve Roastery completely meets this craving for authenticity. And therefore, I think that Howard Schultz could inject fresh blood in Starbucks once again. This Starbucks Reserve Roastery is not a minor development, it is a huge opportunity if handled correctly. And if there is one man that has all the capacities and experience for this, it is of course Schultz. Because of the authenticity concept, people are will be willing to pay much and much more. But coffee stays coffee, the production cost will not go up. People will pay more for the experience, the interior and the serenity of Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Premium authenticity is the way to go. Conclusion Even though Howard Schultz has been one of the most legendary CEO's ever, his stepping aside will not hit Starbucks, I think. As Kevin Johnson has a great technological track record and knows Starbucks very well, he will make Starbucks's lead in technology even bigger. Schultz will still be there if Johnson wants advice, especially about the visionary part of the business, which is Schultz's greatest quality. Schultz himself will lead the other very important Starbucks innovation: the Starbucks Reserve Roastery, which has the potential to boost earnings in the next decade because it will be a huge differentiator from other retailers and it will add to the already huge pricing power of Starbucks. Again Schultz will go back to the roots of Starbucks and rejuvenate it. I think this two-pronged approach will bring back the old Starbucks: different from the rest, with that typical zing combination of innovation and nostalgia. If Starbucks would fall significantly over this news, which I don't expect, I will add to my already considerable position.

      "title": "Howard Schultz Stepping Down as Starbucks CEO",
      "text": "Starbucks' Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO from the business he transformed into the world's largest coffee brand over the past 30 years.\nSchultz made the announcement Thursday (Dec. 1), saying he will make the transition April 3, 2017, and remain at the company as executive chairman.\nSince purchasing the Starbucks chain in 1987, Schultz built the brand's empire with more than 25,000 stores in 75 countries and a market value of $84 billion, according to the New York Times. Schultz has been a highly visible CEO while leading the company to take on social and political issues such as gun violence, race relations, gay rights, student debt, veterans rights and more.\nHis successor will be the company's current president and chief operating officer, Kevin Johnson.\nSchultz said he plans to continue to lead Starbucks' social efforts, while focusing on developing its higher-end shops, such as the 15,000-square-foot flagship Reserve Roastery in downtown Seattle, as well as smaller premium stores and \"bars\" in current Starbucks stores. Schultz's move is sure to feed speculation he has plans to enter politics, though he has said that is not in his current plans.\nUnder Schultz's direction, Starbucks as not only grown as a coffee brand but a powerful player in music. The company's investment began with the acquisition of music retailer Hear Music in 1999, initially focusing on compilations for music discovery sold in their coffee shops.\nIn the mid-aughts, the company developed a partnership with William Morris to help identify music to feature in their stores and Schultz helped bring in a number of exclusive music releases under the Hear Music record label in partnership with Concord Music Group. This incentive included albums by Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Sia, Elvis Costello, James Taylor and more.\nHear Music also developed into a branded retail store with several Starbucks Hear Music Coffeehouses around the country, as well as \"media bars\" within existing Starbucks locations.\nA 2006 Billboard article cites annual album sales of 3.6 million units or approximately $65 million in music revenue via Starbucks.\nIn a 2004 interview with Fast Company, Schultz noted of Starbucks' jump into music: \"The nature of shopping for a CD or a piece of music at a traditional record store is, at its best, a very poor consumer experience. ... The Starbucks customer [who] might want to find a Diana Krall album, a Tony Bennett album, or anything that was not being played on the radio, well, they would have a hard time going into Tower Records. Maybe they'd find the album there, but they could not find someone who could talk to them about it. That consumer has disposable income and has had a long history of buying and enjoying music, but they have nowhere to go.\"\nThe Hear Music Coffeehouses shut down in 2008, as the company transferred the record label's day-to-day management fully to Concord that same year. And in 2015, the Starbucks coffee shops stopped selling CDs but has continued its music efforts, this year announcing a partnership with Spotify.",

      "text": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to step aside, stay as chairman Agence France-Presse / 01:48 PM December 02, 2016 In this Wednesday, March 23, 2016, file photo, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz walks in front of a photo of Starbucks baristas, at the coffee company’s annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. Starbucks announced Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, that Schultz is stepping down from the coffee chain that he joined more than 30 years ago, and that Kevin Johnson will become chief executive as of April 3, 2017. Schultz will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things.AP FILE PHOTO \nNEW YORK—Howard Schultz, the charismatic head of Starbucks, will step aside as CEO next year, turning a major page in the history of a company he built into an iconic global brand. \nHaving led the company’s rise from a sleepy Seattle chain into the world’s biggest coffee business, Schultz will stay on as executive chairman and chairman of the board, the coffee giant said Thursday in a surprise announcement that sent the share price down after hours. \nThe change will take effect April 3. ADVERTISEMENT \nSchultz will hand the reins to president and chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a close friend who was tapped as number two at the company in 2015 and has been a Starbucks board member since 2009. \nThe move comes as the firm faces an increasingly crowded market for higher-quality retail coffee shops and seeks to bolster foot traffic. \nSchultz will devote his time to developing high-end superpremium coffee shops around the world known as Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, the company said in a statement. \nREAD: ‘Exotic’ Starbucks Reserve is here \nIt plans to open 20 to 30 outlets in the coming years. \n“I will be here full-time,” Schultz told a conference call with analysts. “I am not leaving the company, I am here day to day.” \nNew initiative \nSchultz, who joined Starbucks in 1982 as a sales manager, is considered the driving force behind the worldwide success of the coffee chain begun in 1971. \nHe briefly left in 1986 following a dispute with the then-owners to set up his own company, Il Giornale, before buying out their shares in 1987 with support from local small investors. \nStarbucks now operates more than 25,000 stores in more than 75 countries, with a turnover of around $20 billion in fiscal year 2015. \nSchultz, 63, told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the company’s new initiative would help maintain in-person sales as consumers increasingly move to online shopping rather than visiting malls, where many Starbucks outlets are located. \n“I don’t have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,” he said. “This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.” \nIncoming CEO Johnson is a tech industry veteran, having spent 16 years at Microsoft and five as CEO of the networking equipment company Juniper Networks. \nPrior to the announcement, the company’s share price closed up 0.9 percent in New York but fell 3.35 percent in after-hours trading to $56.55 at 2250 GMT. \nSocially responsible \nSchultz is outspoken about social issues such as gay rights and gun violence and has worked to make Starbucks socially responsible. \nThe company increased the base salaries of its US employees by 5 percent in July after they expressed concerns about the effect new software enabling customers to place orders on their smartphones would have on jobs. \nThe company has also opened outlets in poor areas and supported initiatives against racism. \nSchultz is close to the Democratic former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom he supported during the election campaign. But he has dismissed persistent rumors he would run for office himself. Many, including some of his friends, have said he may run for president in four years. \nHe steps down as Starbucks goes ahead with plans to double the number of its stores in China over five years. \nBut it has run afoul of European regulators, one of several major US companies the European Commission accused of having received illegal tax benefits from Ireland. \nIn October 2015, the commission also ordered Starbucks to repay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) in the Netherlands, saying tax breaks there amounted to unlawful state aid. \nThe Dutch authorities are fighting the decision. \nSchultz has sought to step away from running Starbucks before. \nThe Wall Street darling became the company’s chairman in 2000 before returning as chief executive in 2008 with the onset of the global financial crisis. \nShares worth $10 at that time climbed to a record high of more than $60 by the end of last year.",

      "title": "Starbucks Chief Howard Schultz to Step Down Next Year",
      "text": " count=\"302\" data-total-count=\"302\">SEATTLE — Howard Schultz , the visionary leader of Starbucks , said on Thursday he would step down as chief executive next year, handing over to his personally selected successor the management of the company he built into the world’s largest coffee business, with over 25,000 stores in 75 countries. Mr. Schultz, one of the most visible chief executives in the country, has made Starbucks a vocal part of the national conversation on issues like gun violence, gay rights, race relations, veterans rights and student debt. The succession will take place on April 3, and he will remain at the company as executive chairman, focusing on the company’s involvement in social causes and on growing Starbucks Reserve, the company’s new superpremium brand and chain of high-end stores.\nMr. Schultz, 63, will be succeeded by his close friend Kevin Johnson, the company’s current president and a longtime Starbucks board member.\n“This is a big day for me,” Mr. Schultz said in an interview. “I love the company as much as I love my family.” But he said it was the right time to hand the keys to Mr. Johnson, whom he described as being “better equipped” to “run the company than I am,” ticking off a list of Mr. Johnson’s operational talents, and saying that he wanted to “relinquish the role and responsibility to the right person.”\n Advertisement\n Mr. Schultz, who could be considered the Steve Jobs of coffee, grew up poor in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. He had a coffee epiphany while paying a client call on a coffee bean store in Seattle in 1981, and then went to work at the company the next year. In 1983, he visited Italy and was impressed not only by the ubiquity of coffee bars, but also their central role as community gathering spots — a role he refers to as “the third place” in society.\nAdvertisement\n Today, Starbucks is adding about 2,000 new stores a year worldwide. And its legacy under Mr. Schultz’s leadership includes many pioneering social and philanthropic programs: In 1988, the company introduced full health benefits for full- and part-time employees and their domestic partners; in 1991 it was the first privately owned American company to include part-time workers in its stock-option program; and so on, with efforts that have included the “ethical sourcing” of ingredients, a college degree program for baristas, and cups that use recycled materials.\n“I wanted to build the company my father never got to work for,” he said.\nAt an all-hands employee meeting at the company’s headquarters on Thursday, Mr. Schultz was greeted with tears and a standing ovation. “For me, perhaps there are other things that are part of my destiny,” he told them.\nThe move is likely to ignite renewed speculation about whether Mr. Schultz is paving the way to leave the company entirely to enter politics. An outspoken Democrat, Mr. Schultz has spent an increasing amount of time traveling around the country speaking publicly about the need to fix the “dysfunction in Washington.” He has a close relationship with President Obama and had been a supporter of Hillary Clinton.\nThe company’s political positions have sometimes created a backlash. During the presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump and his supporters waged war against Starbucks: In 2015, after the company redesigned its holiday cups to remove Christmas imagery, Mr. Trump suggested a boycott. This year, his supporters staged a protest called #TrumpCup in which they went to Starbucks and ordered drinks under the name Trump to get the baristas to call the name out loud.\nStill, Mr. Schultz said he intends for Starbucks to “maintain our moral courage.” And he defended efforts like the company’s “Race Together” campaign to spur a conversation about race relations, saying that it “was not a failure. I’d do it again.” He said such campaigns are deeply embedded in the company’s brand of “challenging the status quo about the role of a public company.” He is excited by the question, “Since we have stores in every community in America, how can we use our scale for good?”\nAlthough the change may come as a surprise to the public and to some Starbucks employees, the company has been sending signals to Wall Street for the last year about its intentions to carry out a succession plan, announcing a reorganization in the summer that gave Mr. Johnson oversight of the day-to-day operations.\nMr. Johnson, 56, spent his career in technology as a lieutenant of Steven A. Ballmer, former chief of Microsoft, and later as chief executive of Juniper Networks, before being recruited out of retirement by Mr. Schultz in 2015 to become president and chief operating officer of Starbucks.\n Mr. Johnson, a soft-spoken operator known for his focus on building Starbucks’ mobile payments systems and executing the company’s global strategy, has been on a listening tour with employees over the last year. Conversations with store managers who told intimate stories about their passion and relationship with the company have been known to bring Mr. Johnson to tears.\nThe succession plan is the second time Mr. Schultz has sought to step back from overseeing the company. He became the company’s chairman in 2000 but returned as chief executive in 2008 after firing the installed chief, James Donald, as sales faltered. Upon returning to Starbucks as chief executive, Mr. Schultz increased the company’s market value to $84 billion from $15 billion.\nAdvertisement\n In an interview on Thursday in a tasting room at Starbucks flagship Reserve Roastery in downtown Seattle, a Willy Wonka-like 15,000-square-foot premium coffee emporium that the company hopes to open in large cities around the world, Mr. Schultz was animated and emotional about his decision.\nReferring to his previous effort to step back, Mr. Schultz said: “I was not as emotionally prepared for the moment as I am now. I don’t think I had the conviction — I was still meddling.”\n“I got succession wrong the first time,” he added. Of Mr. Johnson, he said, “I’m not going to be hovering and shadowing him.”\nStill, Mr. Schultz says he intends to remain a visible and active presence at the company — his office is connected to Mr. Johnson’s — as he works to introduce the company’s premium coffee brand with a small team that he described as the equivalent of a start-up.\nThe project calls for the opening of several large emporium stores — one is being built in Manhattan and another in Shanghai — each year for the next several years, as well more than 1,000 smaller premium stores and premium “bars” in thousands of current Starbucks stores. “Building a new brand is not unlike what Ralph Lauren did with Purple label,” Mr. Schultz said.\nAsked about speculation that he might be laying the groundwork to run for president, Mr. Schultz said, “I’m all in on all things Starbucks and have no plans to run for public office.” Might he change his mind in the future? “That’s the way I feel today,” he said.\nMr. Johnson said that his decision to work at Starbucks came after he had rethought his career, disclosing for the first time that he had a brush with skin cancer that had led him to retire from Juniper. “It made me think,” he said. “I only want to spend time on things on which I am able to give something to people I love.” He called his job at Starbucks a “gift” and acknowledged that he was somewhat nervous about his new role.\n“Can I do this?” he said he asked himself. “I’m not going to try to be Howard. We are two different people.”",

      "text": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation - wistv.com - Columbia, South Carolina Member Center: Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation By CANDICE CHOI and MICHAEL SISAKAssociated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings - a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nStarbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

(Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 7:31 PM. CST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

Schultz will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) prev next comments NEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.",

      "text": "Business Starbucks CEO steps down to focus on high-end coffee, shares fall Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks during the company's annual shareholder's meeting in Seattle, Washington. Photo: Reuters Published: 6:00 AM, December 2, 2016 Updated: 8:30 AM, December 2, 2016 \nStarbucks Corp <SBUX.O> co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans. \nStarbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008. \n\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior. \n\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations. \nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure. \n\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp <MCD.N> CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. \nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune. \nJohnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015. \nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc <JNPR.N> from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O>. \nOn a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\" \n\"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management. \n\"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's. \nTraffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales. \nThe company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics. \n\"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said.

Schultz will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. [ The Daily Progress news app keeps you up-to-date. Click here to get the free iOS or Android app. ] \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

(KSNW) – Coffee lovers on and off campus will have a new option as Starbucks prepares to open a full-service shop at Wichita State University. \nThe 2,000-square-foot building is under construction just north of WSU’s Woodman Alumni Center near 21st Street and Mike Oatman Drive. \nEmily Patterson, WSU director of Facilities Planning, says she anticipates it opening in late winter or early spring. \nStarbucks will be the first retail building on the Innovation Campus. Located along what will eventually be the east pedestrian mall, the shop will include a drive-thru and a large plaza with outdoor seating next to the building. \nThe master plan for that area also includes future restaurant and retail development, as well as a hotel on the south side of the new 19th Street along Oliver. \n“We’re excited to have a Starbucks on campus,” Patterson says. “It’s going to be great for faculty, staff and students already here and will be a draw for the greater Wichita community.” Share this: ",

      "text": "By Julie Jargon\nStarbucks Corp. Howard Schultz is stepping down as chief executive of the Starbucks Corp so he can devote all of his time to a new strategic initiative of opening high-end coffee shops for the 45-year-old company.\nMr. Schultz, 63, is handing over the reins to President and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who served as a board member of the company for several years before joining its executive team two years ago.\nMr. Schultz will remain chairman of Starbucks and said he has no plans to step away from the company or run for political office, as many have speculated in the past due to his vocal stance on such issues as veterans' rights and jobs creation.\n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" he said in an interview. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\"\nThe move is aimed at refreshing the Starbucks brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin' Donuts, which has been introducing more high-end drinks such as cold brewed coffee.\nMr. Schultz said the approach could also help protect Starbucks from an inevitable loss of traffic from people who order more goods online, instead of making mall trips. He decided that opening high-end coffee shops that would provide a luxurious experience would entice people to leave their homes.\nTwo years ago the company opened its first such store, the Seattle Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, a 15,000-square-foot store where coffee is roasted and people can buy $12 cups of small-batch \"reserve\" coffees made with a siphon brewing technique.\nStarbucks is planning to open 20 to 30 more of the high-end stores , including one twice its size in Shanghai next year. The company plans to build up to 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site roasting, under the \"Starbucks Reserve\" brand with a logo that consists of just a gold star and the letter \"R.\"\nStarbucks is also remodeling many of its stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and different brewing methods offered in the Reserve stores. The company also plans to test out new drinks and food at those stores and then introduce them in its traditional coffee shops that don't contain Reserve bars.\nMr. Schultz has shepherded Starbucks through many changes since he joined the coffee company in 1982 as its marketing director.\nAfter leaving the company after a dispute with its owners, Mr. Schultz in 1986 opened his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale, and later bought the Starbucks retail unit from its owners. He renamed his shop Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across the globe.\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com\n 01, 2016 16:15 ET (21:15 ",

      "title": "Starbucks' Schultz Stepping Down as CEO to Focus on Higher-End Shops -- Update",
      "text": "By Julie Jargon\nStarbucks Corp. Howard Schultz is stepping down as chief executive of the Starbucks Corp so he can devote all of his time to a new strategic initiative of opening high-end coffee shops for the 45-year-old company.\nMr. Schultz, 63 years old, is handing over the reins to President and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who served as a board member of the company for several years before joining its executive team two years ago.\nMr. Schultz will remain chairman of Starbucks and said he has no plans to step away from the company or run for political office, as many have speculated in the past due to his vocal stance on such issues as veterans' rights and job creation.\n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" he said in an interview. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\"\nThe move is aimed at refreshing the Starbucks brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin' Donuts, which has been introducing more high-end drinks such as cold-brewed coffee.\nMr. Schultz said the approach could also help protect Starbucks from an inevitable loss of traffic from people who order more goods online, instead of making mall trips. He decided that opening high-end coffee shops that would provide a luxurious experience would entice people to leave their homes.\nTwo years ago the company opened its first such store, the Seattle Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, a 15,000-square-foot store where coffee is roasted and people can buy $12 cups of small-batch \"reserve\" coffees made with a siphon brewing technique.\nStarbucks is planning to open 20 to 30 more of the high-end stores, including one twice its size in Shanghai next year. The company plans to build up to 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site roasting, under the \"Starbucks Reserve\" brand with a logo that consists of just a gold star and the letter \"R.\"\nMr. Schultz described the plan as the company's biggest strategic initiative since Starbucks began opening stores overseas 20 years ago.\nStarbucks is also remodeling many of its stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and different brewing methods offered in the Reserve stores. The company also plans to test out new drinks and food at those stores and then introduce them in its traditional coffee shops that don't contain Reserve bars.\nMr. Schultz has shepherded Starbucks through many changes since he joined the coffee company in 1982 as its marketing director.\nAfter leaving the company after a dispute with its owners, Mr. Schultz in 1986 opened his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale, and later bought the Starbucks retail unit from its owners. He renamed his shop Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across the globe.\nThis isn't the first time Mr. Schultz has stepped down as CEO. In 2000, he left the company so he could focus on other endeavors, such as his ownership of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. But he returned in 2008, when the company was struggling, in order to help turn around the business.\nIn recent months, as he decided that focusing on opening high-end shops serving more expensive coffee and food was the way to create more growth in the company, Mr. Schultz began handing over the daily operations of Starbucks to Mr. Johnson, a former Microsoft executive. The idea for Mr. Schultz to focus squarely on the new strategy wasn't something he planned when he first hired Mr. Johnson.\n\"When I joined the management team two years ago, the intent coming in was to play a role in this strategy, not about a plan around this CEO transition,\" Mr. Johnson said.\nShares of the company fell 3.1% to $56.65 in after-hours trading as investors reacted to Mr. Schultz's departure.\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com\n 01, 2016 16:41 ET (21:41 ",

      "title": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation",
      "text": "Buy Now Ted S. Warren \nHoward Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, speaks at the coffee company’s annual shareholders meeting March 23 in Seattle. \nNEW YORK — The chairman of Starbucks Corp., Howard Schultz, is giving up his job as chief executive of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation, such as high-end shops and social-impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company’s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the United States, although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000 and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and such drinks as “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.” \n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks’ announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believes that the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies and has aligned himself and Starbucks with such social issues as race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN and didn’t rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write “Race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he would do again “in a heartbeat.” \n“It was one of my proudest moments,” he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of Starbucks’ global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies, including 16 years with Microsoft Corp. and five as the chief executive of Juniper Networks, a computer networking company. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she thinks that Johnson’s technology background will help ensure Starbucks’ digital initiatives will remain a priority.

      "text": "Starbucks Corp. said Howard Schultz is stepping down as chief executive so he can devote all of his time to a new strategic initiative of opening high-end coffee shops for the 45-year-old company.\nMr. Schultz, 63 years old, is handing over the reins to President and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who served as a board member of the company for several years before joining its executive team two years ago.\nMr. Schultz will remain chairman of Starbucks and said he has no plans to step away from the company or run for political office, as many have speculated in the past due to his vocal stance on such issues as veterans' rights and job creation.\n\"I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the company,\" he said in an interview. \"This gives me the entrepreneurial freedom to do what I think I do best.\"\nThe move is aimed at refreshing the Starbucks brand, which has been facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin' Donuts, which has been introducing more high-end drinks such as cold-brewed coffee.\n​Mr. Schultz said the approach could also help protect Starbucks from an inevitable loss of traffic from people who order more goods online, instead of making mall trips. He decided that opening high-end coffee shops that would provide a luxurious experience would entice people to leave their homes.\nTwo years ago the company opened its first such store, the Seattle Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, a 15,000-square-foot store where coffee is roasted and people can buy $12 cups of small-batch \"reserve\" coffees made with a siphon brewing technique.\nStarbucks is planning to open 20 to 30 more of the high-end stores, including one twice its size in Shanghai next year. The company plans to build up to 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site roasting, under the \"Starbucks Reserve\" brand with a logo that consists of just a gold star and the letter \"R.\"\nMr. Schultz described the plan as the company's biggest strategic initiative since Starbucks began opening stores overseas 20 years ago.\nStarbucks is also remodeling many of its stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and different brewing methods offered in the Reserve stores. The company also plans to test out new drinks and food at those stores and then introduce them in its traditional coffee shops that don't contain Reserve bars.\nMr. Schultz has shepherded Starbucks through many changes since he joined the coffee company in 1982 as its marketing director.\nAfter leaving the company after a dispute with its owners, Mr. Schultz in 1986 opened his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale, and later bought the Starbucks retail unit from its owners. He renamed his own shop Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across the globe.\nThis isn't the first time Mr. Schultz has stepped down as CEO. In 2000, he left the company so he could focus on other endeavors, such as his ownership of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. But he returned in 2008, when the company was struggling, in order to help turn around the business.\nIn recent months, as he decided that focusing on opening high-end shops serving more expensive coffee and food was the way to create more growth in the company, Mr. Schultz began handing over the daily operations of Starbucks to Mr. Johnson, a former Microsoft executive. The idea for Mr. Schultz to focus squarely on the new strategy wasn't something he planned when he first hired Mr. Johnson.\n\"When I joined the management team two years ago, the intent coming in was to play a role in this strategy, not about a plan around this CEO transition,\" Mr. Johnson said.\nShares of the company fell 3.1% to $56.65 in after-hours trading as investors reacted to Mr. Schultz's departure.\nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com\n 01, 2016 16:35 ET (21:35 ",

      "text": "The Office December 01, 2016 \nIf you find it easier to work in the din of Starbucks or a bar than around your chattering colleagues in an open office, you’re not alone. \nConversation and music is more distracting than meaningless noise, and leads to a greater decline in work performance, according to a new study from a Japanese sound engineer. \nOpen offices are beloved by tech startups and other creative types, and were given a boost by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who left his private office to sit amidst his lieutenants at City Hall. But there has been a sustained backlash from workers who complain about a lack of privacy and there’s evidence that employees in open office are more likely to miss work due to illness than their enclosed counterparts. Now open-office dissidents can add overheard noise to their list of grievances. \nIn the study, from Takahiro Tamesue of the University of Yamaguchi, research subjects tried to complete tasks on computers, like counting the number of times an image flashed, while listening to both unintelligible noise and human speech. The subjects were also asked to rate the noises on how annoying they found them. \nThe more meaningful noises, like conversations, were the most annoying, and proved to be the most distracting, Tamesue concluded. \nSound proofing open offices often isn’t practical, so it may be necessary to figure out a way to mask meaningful noises, Tamesue said in a press release that accompanied his study. Or maybe companies should just go back to giving their employees offices if they want work to get done. Read full story ",
