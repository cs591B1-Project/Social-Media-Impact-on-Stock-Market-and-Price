      "text": "Report: Toyota to start volume production of EVs by 2020 Email This Page   3 views Nov 8, 2016 Follow Viknesh Enlarge Photo \nAfter its success with hybrid technology, the logical assumption was that Toyota would jump in with both feet into development of pure electric cars. \nAt first it seemed that was the course Toyota was taking, with the automaker in 2010 forming a partnership with Tesla [NSDQ:TSLA] and two years later selling the RAV4 EV , albeit in limited numbers. But soon after the launch of the RAV4 EV, Toyota shocked many by deciding that fuel cells were a better bet. It then cut its ties with Tesla and started work on the Mirai . \nAs many have predicted, the hydrogen infrastructure necessary for fuel cells is turning out to be nothing but a pipe dream, despite Toyota’s best attempts to obfuscate the matter . In contrast, companies like Tesla have demonstrated that battery-powered electric cars can be a worthy if not superior alternative to internal combustion cars. \nToyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) modular platform Enlarge Photo \nIt seems Toyota has since realized its folly. Japan’s Nikkei on Monday reported that Toyota is rushing to start volume production of battery electric cars by 2020 and has formed a special team tasked with developing the cars, even teaming up with other companies. \nThe good news is that Toyota’s electric cars will likely be at the more affordable side of the new car spectrum. The Nikkei reports that Toyota’s TNGA modular platform found in cars like the Corolla and Prius is being considered as the basis of the new electric cars, the first of which is said to be an SUV. \nToyota now finds itself at a disadvantage to rivals such as Tesla and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, both of which can take advantage of the growing number of incentives for electrics cars being introduced in major markets with their existing offerings. Tesla and Daimler are also producing their own batteries, not only for use in cars but also the new market for energy storage.",

Incentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.” by IWB · November 8, 2016 \nDespite record incentive spending, constantly loosening lending standards and endless cheer leading from the “Big 3” U.S.-based auto OEMs, senior executives from Toyota and Nissan are convinced that the U.S. auto market has peaked. According to comments made to Bloomberg , Toyota co-CEO Hiroto Saikawa said “i t’s a peak and we don’t see a potential for further growth…i ncentives are rapidly growing in the industry, and we are paying close attention to it.” \n“The market turned out to be somewhat weaker,” Takahiko Ijichi, a Toyota executive vice president, told reporters Tuesday after the carmaker reported a 43 percent plunge in quarterly operating profit. The North American market “really requires very careful managing going forward,” he said. \n\nThe more dour outlook is significant not only for Toyota and Nissan but for Japan’s economy. For the nation’s automakers, North America remains the biggest export destination, with more than 1.3 million passenger cars shipped during the first nine months of the year. That was double the number of vehicles exported to Europe and fourtimes the number sent to the rest of Asia, including China, which has seen a tax cut-induced buying spurt. \n\nThe peak also has arrived at an inopportune time because the stronger yen continues to drag on earnings. While Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota raised its profit forecast for the fiscal year after the yen rallied less than expected, it’s still projecting operating profit to slump by 40 percent to 1.7 trillion yen ($16.3 billion) for the year ending in March. \n\nNissan, meanwhile, said operating profit fell 19 percent last quarter, driven primarily by the impact of a stronger yen. For the year ending in March, operating income probably will drop by 10 percent to 710 billion yen, according to the Yokohama, Japan-based company. \nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-08/peak-autos-toyota-and-nissan-execs-admit-us-auto-sales-have-peaked-rapidly-growing-i 2 views Previous story Any election without nationwide mandatory voter ID is a farce… Democrats hate democracy \nFollow: It only takes a few moments to share an article, but the person on the other end who reads it might have his life changed forever TODAY'S HOT POSTS",

      "text": "Toyota may reverse its position on battery-electric cars and introduce one in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Until now, the automaker has promoted fuel-cell cars over battery-powered ones. More Toyota doesn’t like battery-electric cars. It believes hydrogen fuel cells are the better technology, because they generally offer greater range, and short refueling times similar to gasoline cars. But Toyota may be changing its attitude.\nThe Japanese automaker is now considering building an electric car, according to a Nikkei report. That car could appear in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, although that doesn’t give Toyota much time to accomplish a huge task. The company hasn’t even put together an electric-car development team, according to the report. That will happen over the next couple of months.\nInterestingly, the Japanese government is expected to use the 2020 Olympics to promote hydrogen fuel cells, and Toyota will likely be a part of that, too. The automaker will supply a fleet of fuel-cell buses , with the first ones set to be delivered next year. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is pushing the concept of a “hydrogen society,” where fuel cells are used to power buildings as well as vehicles.\nMore: How long will electric car purchase incentives be needed?\nThe Toyota electric car itself could be a small SUV, and may use the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform that underpins the current-generation Prius hybrid . The Prius’ chief engineer, Koji Toyoshima, recently indicated that Toyota is now more confident in the lithium-ion battery cells other automakers already use in their electric cars. Toyota is continuing lithium-ion development work, but could also buy batteries for its electric car from an outside supplier, according to Nikkei.\nToyota isn’t completely new to electric cars. It sold two generations of the RAV4 EV, an electric version of its ubiquitous RAV4 SUV. Both were built solely to satisfy California regulations. The second-generation model (pictured above) used a powertrain from Tesla Motors. Toyota also built an electric version of its tiny iQ city car, which was imported to the U.S. in extremely limited numbers as the Scion iQ EV.\nInstead of electric cars, Toyota has focused on promoting its Mirai hydrogen fuel cell car . The Mirai is currently sold only in California, because it’s the only state with a decent network for hydrogen fueling stations.\nToyota may have licked the exploding lithium-ion battery problem The best hybrid car you can buy Honda’s Clarity Fuel Cell can drive 366 miles on a single tank of hydrogen",

      "text": "Toyota—with its now-ubiquitous Prius—has spent the better part of two decades democratizing the benefits of electrification like no other automaker, yet its enthusiasm for non-hybrid electric vehicles has been tepid at best. That may finally be changing. The world’s top-selling automaker is said to be reconsidering its absence from the electric-vehicle market. According to a report in Japan’s Nikkei business newspaper, Toyota is looking to add longer-range EVs to its portfolio starting around 2020. \n-Why has Toyota held back on EVs? Perhaps because battery technology wasn’t quite ready for mass-market acceptance; perhaps, also, because its efforts had been channeled toward hydrogen fuel cells . One sign that times are changing is Toyota’s new Prius Prime plug-in hybrid. Unlike the regular Prius, the Prime is an evangelist for electric motoring, with an EV mode that locks out the coarse gasoline engine for up to 25 miles. Notably, it’s more affordable than the Chevrolet Volt , although the Volt’s EV range is about double that distance.\n-A move in the direction of EVs would be quite a turnaround from just two years ago, when Toyota’s U.S. Advanced Technologies Group manager Craig Scott, speaking of the company’s broad shift toward hydrogen fuel cells, told the Los Angeles Times that “no one is coming to our door asking us to build a new electric car.”\n-The project could take form quickly. Nikkei reported that Toyota will put together an in-house EV team as soon as early 2017. Toyota is hardly making up for lost time or the lack of an electric-vehicle knowledge base, however. Executives in recent years have been careful to stress that, while they see a strong future for electric-vehicle technology (and have been working on it in R&D activities), they don’t see the battery-electric vehicle as the best short-term avenue for that. And the Toyota Mirai has a fully developed electric powertrain, just one with a hydrogen fuel cell instead of a battery pack.\n- \n-Toyota’s product plan reportedly includes several small models, including a compact SUV, likely targeting a range greater than 215 miles and built on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform that underpins the current Prius and the next-generation Corolla.\n-Lexus execs have said that the brand will skip over plug-in-hybrid technology but look ahead to fuel-cell and battery-electric vehicles, so there may be some sharing across brands. As for the battery, the automaker is said to be considering manufacturing its own lithium-ion packs (a business that Nissan, now a veteran in the mass-market EV business, has recently sought to exit). But applying some Prius-like economies of scale to battery manufacture could reduce the cost of more energy-dense packs.\n-Toyota’s last all-electric vehicle for the U.S. market was the Toyota RAV4 EV , a model that offered a startling “RAV4 Powered by Tesla” gauge-cluster greeting and did indeed pack a mostly Tesla-engineered powertrain. Its driving range was rated by the EPA at 103 miles, and it offered a zippy, Tesla-tuned driving experience despite its extra weight. Toyota produced 2600 RAV4 EVs over three years (2012–2014), but it needed to put substantial cash on the hood to find takers for that electric crossover, which was priced over the $50K mark.\n- Prior to that, back at the 2009 Detroit auto show, Toyota displayed the FT-EV , a battery-electric city car based on the short-lived Scion iQ minicompact ; that program devolved to a very limited fleet test in Japan, where it was called the eQ.\n-Toyota Motor Sales environmental communications manager Jana Hartline wouldn’t speak directly of the company’s product plans, but she confirmed that Toyota is working on both fuel-cell vehicles and EVs. Hartline added that, while there remain issues to be resolved (range, charging times, and battery performance), “We would like to be prepared to consider introducing EV products while examining the energy issues and infrastructure of each region/country.”\n- - 2017 Toyota Prius Prime Plug-In Hybrid - 2012 Toyota RAV4 EV - Toyota Mirai: Full Info, Specs, Reviews - -At present, EVs face a rapidly evolving and uncertain market. The Nissan Leaf has hardly been a sales success, and cumulative Leaf sales in the U.S., since deliveries began in late 2011, just reached 100,000 in October, while globally, Leaf sales are nearing the 250,000 mark. Meanwhile the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV is on its way to dealerships, and a slew of mass-market EVs are due within a couple of years—including a second-generation Leaf that’s expected to offer a couple of battery options and go more than 200 miles on a charge. The Volkswagen Group is now planning more than 30 new pure-electric vehicles by 2025 , and it bullishly anticipates that EVs will make up about 25 percent of the automaker’s global sales (in the range of 2 to 3 million units) by 2025. And the upcoming Tesla Model 3 , the California automaker’s mass-production model with an announced $35,000 base price, due at the end of 2017, may have a make-or-break effect on the entire segment.\n-If Toyota is making a move, you can bet it’s clever and calculated. The automaker has a reputation for locking on to fully baked technology, setting its bearings, and then playing the long game, and ultimately we expect it to do the same with electric vehicles.\n- ",

      "text": "Toyota to settle U.S. truck rust lawsuit for up to $3.4 billion Reuters Reuters Photo: \n(Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by U.S. owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers. \nThe proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers. \nAttorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle. \nToyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles. \n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said in a statement. \nUnder the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement. \nThe settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years. \nToyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys' fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement. \n(Reporting by David Bailey in Minneapolis; Editing by Bernard Orr) Related Links",

Toyota will test a new car-sharing system next year that lets users unlock doors and start cars with their smartphones. The Smart Key Box system eliminates the need for a physical key. Toyota will test the system in San Francisco with the Getaround car-sharing service starting in January 2017. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena, File) comments WASHINGTON — Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection.\nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008.\nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.",

      "text": "  Lexus x Valerian SKYJET \nMarkazia, the sole distributor of Toyota, Lexus and Hino trucks in Jordan, announced that Lexus has formed a creative partnership with film studio EuropaCorp. One of the early highlights of this collaboration will be the highly anticipated 2017 science fiction film, “VALERIAN AND THE CITY OF A THOUSAND PLANETS’, starring Cara Delevingne and Dane DeHaan. Lexus collaborated with producer and director Luc Besson as he imagined and brought to life hisvision for the Valerian SKYJET, a single-seat pursuit craft which features in the film. \nBesson created the SKYJET with the ambition of featuring a vehicle grounded in reality but befitting of the Valerian world, set 700 years in the future. The visionary director consulted with Lexus’ Chief Engineer, Takeaki Kato, and the Lexus design team, to help him realize his vision for the SKYJET and allow the final iteration to incorporate believable, imaginative technologies and contemporary design cues. \nThe SKYJET design also incorporates an adapted interpretation of Lexus’ signature “spindle” grille, and a similar headlight design to that of the hotly anticipated 2018 Lexus LC coupe, defined by an athletic and aerodynamic shape. \n“Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets” features an all-star cast including Rihanna, Ethan Hawke, Clive Owen and Kris Wu. The project marks Besson’s most ambitious film to date and the largest-budget European motion picture ever produced. \nCommenting on the development of the SKYJET, Nadim Haddad, Deputy General Manager at Markazia, said: “As fans of films and Luc’s previous work, Lexus is privileged to help bring Luc’s dream to life. We enjoyed seeing how Lexus took on the challenge of bringing its design philosophy and technology innovations to this project. We look forward to seeing this partnership with EuropaCorp flourish, as we strive to give our audiences the most amazing experiences imaginable in the coming years.” \nCommenting on the partnership, Director Luc Besson said: [to be drafted by EuropaCorp] \nThe brand is set to provide unique experiences over the next 9 months designed to bring film fans around the world closer to the action in the build up to the film’s release in July 2017.",

Now the EcoSport, which shares some of its underpinnings with the subcompact Fiesta, will make its U.S. debut in L.A. \nThe U.S. version of the EcoSport may get a new face, but it's otherwise expected to be similar to the European version, shown. Image source: Ford Motor Company. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT A new global Jeep to replace two current models \nFCA gave us a preview of the all-new 2017 Jeep Compass in September, including the photos you see below (and not much else). FCA hasn't shared a lot of details yet, but we know that the Compass will replace both the current Compass and its brawnier (but similarly sized) sibling, the Jeep Patriot, when it arrives in the U.S. early next year. It's expected that FCA will build the all-new Compass in Mexico . \nThe all-new 2017 Jeep Compass will replace Jeep's current Compass and Patriot models. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. \nThe all-new 2017 Jeep Compass will arrive at U.S. dealers in the first quarter of 2017. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Toyota gears up to take on Honda's HR-V \nToyota is jumping into the small-crossover fray with its all-new C-HR, a model that was originally planned for the discontinued Scion brand. The C-HR is built on the highly flexible Toyota New Global Architecture that also underpins the new-for-2016 Prius. \nIn U.S. trim, the C-HR is expected to come with Toyota's mainstay 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. \nToyota showed off the all-new C-HR crossover at the Paris Motor Show in October. The U.S. version is expected to be similar. Image source: Toyota. Something brand-new: A big Subaru \nFuji Heavy Industries ' (NASDAQOTH: FUJHY) quirky-but-beloved Subaru brand is expected to launch a \"three-row\" 7-passenger crossover SUV in L.A. This new Subaru will replace the Tribeca, a model that never quite caught on with brand loyalists. Being a Subaru, standard all-wheel drive is a safe bet, as is a choice between the brand's mainstay 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and its larger 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine. Will Volkswagen bring a new electric car to Los Angeles? \nVolkswagen (NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) took the wraps off its overhauled Golf lineup in Germany earlier this month. But it didn't show an expected battery-electric version of the compact hatchback, leading your humble Fool (among others) to speculate that VW was saving its electric Golf for the L.A. show. \nAlong with (maybe!) the battery-operated Golf, VW will surely show off its new 2018 Atlas crossover . The Atlas was designed specifically for the U.S. market as a direct competitor to rivals like Toyota's Highlander and Ford's Explorer. \nThe all-new 2018 VolkswagenAtlas. Image source: Volkswagen. \nThe Atlas will be built at VW's factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, starting next spring. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Ford Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

      "text": "By : Anthony Karr , Editor The automaker will have the capacity to produce 2.2 million vehicles in North America from 2019. \nToyota has started the construction of its fifteenth North American plant, which will be located in Apaseo el Grande. The so-called Toyota Motor Manufacturing de Guanajuato (TMMGT) will produce the Corolla best-seller beginning in 2019. \n“TMMGT will afford us the opportunity to boost vehicle quality and appeal while achieving cost savings through production engineering innovations,” Mike Bafan, TMMGT president, commented. “This plant will also be simple, sustainable, mindful of its environment and highly competitive. Ultimately, this means our customers will benefit from our cars being produced locally with the highest quality and environmental standards.” \nAccording to preliminary calculations, the factory will be able to manufacture about 200,000 vehicles annually. It will employ 2,000 people from the Bajio region, thanks to one-billion-dollar investment. When production in the Bajio region begins, Toyota will have the capacity to produce approximately 2.2 million vehicles per year in North America. \n“Toyota’s investment in Guanajuato represents a long-term sign of our commitment to Mexico, its people and the Bajio region,” said Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota Motor Company board chairman. \n“TMMGT will play a key role in how we make products in the future, while setting a standard for manufacturing excellence in the industry.” \nThe new factory is part of the Japanese company’s Toyota’s Environmental Challenge 2050, which seeks to reduce the manufacturer’s global carbon footprint. Under that ambitious project, Toyota will lower CO2 emissions and water usage by fifty percent by 2050, while in Guanajuato alone, the automaker will help clean up Río Querétaro and strengthen water conservation. Toyota will also donate five Hilux pickup trucks to the local police and fire departments. \n“The development Toyota will generate in the state will benefit the economy of the region since direct and indirect jobs will be created and the number of companies that will supply the plant with different inputs will increase,” the governor of Guanajuato, Miguel Márquez Márquez, commented. “Guanajuato is the main automotive cluster in the country, contributing to achieve the record in economic growth registered today, which is above the national average.” \nSource: Toyota Be part of something big Toyota breaks ground in Guanajuato, Mexico Hide press release Show press release \nApaseo el Grande, Guanajuato (Nov. 14, 2016) -- During a ceremony in Apaseo el Grande Toyota celebrated the groundbreaking of Toyota Motor Manufacturing de Guanajuato (TMMGT), its fifteenth manufacturing plant in North America.TMMGT will produce Corolla, the top selling car in the world, beginning in 2019, and will employ approximately 2,000 team members from the Bajío region. With an annual vehicle capacity of 200,000 units per year and a one-billion-dollar investment, TMMGT will serve as the model of manufacturing for Toyota thanks in part to it design built on the anticipated Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA). TNGA will serve as a catalyst for building more models on common platforms, making intelligent use of common parts, and fully leveraging Toyota’s supply chain.“TMMGT will afford us the opportunity to boost vehicle quality and appeal while achieving cost savings through production engineering innovations,” said Mike Bafan, TMMGT president. “This plant will also be simple, sustainable, mindful of its environment and highly competitive. Ultimately, this means our customers will benefit from our cars being produced locally with the highest quality and environmental standards.\" “Toyota’s investment in Guanajuato represents a long-term sign of our commitment to Mexico, its people and the Bajío region,” said Takeshi Uchiyamada, TMC board chairman. “TMMGT will play a key role in how we make products in the future, while setting a standard for manufacturing excellence in the industry.”He also highlighted that under Toyota’s Environmental Challenge 2050, which seeks to reduce the company’s global carbon footprint, Toyota will lower CO2 emissions and water usage by fifty percent. In Guanajuato alone, the automaker will help clean up Río Querétaro and strengthen water conservation.Moreover, Toyota announced it will aid the needs of the local community through mobility thanks in part to a donation of five Hilux trucks and uniforms to the local police and fire departments. The governor of Guanajuato, Miguel Márquez Márquez, commented that the installation of TMMGT contributes to consolidate the most important automotive cluster in the state. \"The development Toyota will generate in the state will benefit the economy of the region since direct and indirect jobs will be created and the number of companies that will supply the plant with different inputs will increase. Guanajuato is the main automotive cluster in the country, contributing to achieve the record in economic growth registered today, which is above the national average.\" Ildefonso Guajardo, Secretary of Economy, said that Toyota's growth in the country, with the construction of this important plant with cutting-edge technology, is a reflection of the confidence Mexico projects abroad to attract investment. \"We have very attractive competitive advantages for large companies -like Toyota- that recognize the quality of our country’s workforce,” he said. Lastly, Gonzalo González Centeno, mayor of Apaseo el Grande, thanked Toyota for its support towards the community. \"Our young people require opportunities for their development and we are sure that this complex that Toyota will build in Apaseo el Grande will bring many benefits for everyone,” he said. Once production begins at TMMGT, Toyota will have the capacity to produce approximately 2.2 million vehicles annually in North America.Attending the ceremony were Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) Board Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada, TMMGT President Mike Bafan, Toyota de México Group Vice President Jun Umemura, Toyota Motor Sales de México CEO Tom Sullivan and Toyota Motor México General Counsel and Government Affairs Director Luis Lozano; accompanied by Guanajuato Governor Miguel Márquez Márquez, Mexico’s Secretary of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo and Apaseo el Grande Mayor Gonzalo González Centeno.

      "text": "By Patrick Rall G+ 2016-11-15 18:36 How Toyota Builds Almost Every New Truck in Texas When Toyota broke ground on their truck plant outside of San Antonio Texas, critics insisted that it would be impossible for the company to make this location work – but Toyota has proven those folks wrong in a big way, building almost every truck sold in America in the Texas plant. \nWhen Toyota announced that they were going to build a massive truck assembly plant outside of San Antonio, Texas, the concern from the critics was whether or not the Japanese automaker could build trucks in Texas. If you’ve never noticed, automotive manufacturing facilities tend to be located in clusters, which allows support companies and 3rd party suppliers to set up shop in those areas as well. It also allows the company to open a factory in an area where there is a high number of experienced auto factory workers. \nFor example, when an automaker opens a production facility near Detroit, that company knows that they will have access to an endless list of suppliers for every component that they don’t produce themselves as well as a long list of qualified individuals to fill every position in the plant. \nWith that in mind, there is a theoretical problem with building a plant in San Antonio, Texas, since there is very little support infrastructure, very few automotive suppliers and a much smaller pool of experienced workers. \nAn automaker can ship components from anywhere, but every mile in component shipping can add fractions of a cent to the cost of that vehicle. The critics insisted that this lack of automotive infrastructure would be too costly for Toyota, and they may have been right, but Toyota never had to worry about that. \nToyota didn’t just build an assembly plant – they built an automotive production campus of sorts, with various outside suppliers doing business on the same sprawling piece of Texas property as the Toyota assembly plant. In doing so, they created a job boom in the area and in addition to hiring from the surrounding area to begin with – Toyota has continued to promote from within as new roles for more skilled workers or lead positions open up. \nToyota effectively created an automotive infrastructure in the San Antonio area and to take advantage of that effort, they build both the Tundra and the Tacoma on the same assembly line at the same time – making TMMTX that much more impressive. \nAssembly Line and Suppliers Share Walls While Toyota was able to find and educate plenty of workers in the San Antonio area to run the production line at the TMMTX plant, the lack of nearby supplies was the biggest obstacle. To clear that hurdle, Toyota reached out to suppliers in other areas and offered them a chance to set up shop in an adjoining building on the Toyota Texas Truck plant. With these suppliers operating a smaller facility out of a building connected to the Toyota production buildings, there is a huge reduction in cost for both the supplier and the automaker.",

      "text": "Tweet Share View of a Toyota logo on a wheel at the Mondial de l'Automobile, Paris auto show, during media day in Paris, France, September 30, 2016. REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen/File Photo More By Naomi Tajitsu TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is setting up a new in-house unit to develop electric cars, offering its strongest endorsement yet of a technology it has not embraced wholly, as take up of a rival technology it pioneered remains slow. Japan's biggest automaker said on Thursday it will launch next month a unit that will start with four persons and be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations. The unit will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed. The announcement comes after Toyota, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles. Even as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve electric vehicles for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times. Toyota has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years. But by adding longer-range models to its product range, it would be changing its tune from promoting FCVs and plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars as the most promising alternative to conventional cars. \"The company's position is changing. They still talk about hybrids and fuel cells but I think there is a recognition that battery electric cars are getting a lot of traction right now,\" CASA analyst Chris Richter said. \"It's going to take an awful long time before fuel cells are a competitive alternative to electric vehicles. In the meantime, a lot of things are going on right now (with battery electric cars) and they need to be there,\" Richter said. The new unit would initially consist of one person each from the automaker and three group companies. These are machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation, and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co and Denso Corp. \"Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly,\" spokesman Itsuki Kurosu said. \"With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars.\" Toyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050.

      "text": "  Can A Different Climate Cause Car Problems? Can A Different Climate Cause Car Problems? Toyota , Avalon , 2003 \nDear Car Talk: I own a 2003 Toyota Avalon that has 45,000 miles on it. I'm the original owner, and I live in Hawaii. My wife and I are thinking of relocating to the Pacific Northwest and are wondering if the change in weather temperature will do anything to change the car's performance. The car runs really great, with no engine problems. Back in the '90s, I shipped my 1986 Chevy truck to my son, and a year later, there were all kinds of problems. One was that the engine would stall upon accelerating, which is scary when trying to zoom across a busy intersection. Another problem was when a mechanic reported that the engine fan was hitting the shroud, even though there was no accident involved. I would appreciate your feedback and thoughts. Aloha! -- Jackson Well, since you're moving from the earthly paradise of Hawaii to a place where it's cloudy and rainy 300 days a year, my biggest concern is that your Avalon is going to become depressed. You might need to start dropping Carzac into its tank. But I have no worries about the move, mechanically. I guess you'll find out if the sunroof leaks, but in terms of the engine or drivability, the car won't miss a beat. The reason your old truck started having problems a year after you shipped it to your son is because ... you shipped it to your son. He probably drove it like an animal. And that stalling probably was due to the aging carburetor. But you'll have no such problems with this car, Jackson. On the other hand, maybe you wrote to me hoping I'd talk you out of the move. In which case, use this answer: You're going to have nothing but trouble with this car in the Pacific Northwest, Jackson. In fact, I predict it's going to cost you $60,000 or $70,000 just to get the car acclimatized to its new environment. So stay put! Tags",

      "text": "There will be a hint of sadness when Tony Stewart exits his Sprint Cup car for the final time Sunday night, but those feelings will belong to his fans not Stewart. He’ll feel relief. Beaten by bureaucracy and suffocated by success, Stewart is ready to leave NASCAR and all its rules behind. No longer will he be the voice of the garage, a position inherited from Dale Earnhardt and bequeathed to Brad Keselowski , Denny Hamlin and others willing to challenge the sport’s leadership. Now Stewart can have fun. When he looks ahead to the dirt track racing he’ll do in 2017, his eyes brighten in a way they rarely have the last few years. NASCAR was his job — a well-paying job with career winnings of more than $122 million entering this season — but it was a job. He often wanted to be driving to a dirt track in the middle of nowhere, plopping out of the truck in shorts and a T-shirt, climbing into a sprint car that sent him sliding through the corners and finishing the night with a beer in hand, more in the cooler and BSing with the same competitors he’d covered in a rooster tail of dirt. Then he would head to the next track to do it again. Thing is, Stewart was too good for that nomadic lifestyle where the highlight is finding a good diner at 3 a.m. Tony Stewart in March 1997 during a break in an Indy Racing League event at Phoenix (Getty Images). He was talented enough that he didn’t need to approach car owners with money for rides. The best teams wanted him. Many observers called Stewart a wheelman, one of the highest compliments a racer can receive. They wanted him in IndyCar and NASCAR. He found his way to NASCAR after a recruitment that a high school football star could appreciate. Baby-faced and thin, Stewart tried to rein his temper in NASCAR but couldn’t. It grew as his success and appetite for pizzas and Coke did. He became the sport’s rabble-rouser and its conscience. There’s always at least one. Before him it was Earnhardt. That’s not to say Stewart was Earnhardt. It’s just that Stewart was the closest thing to the seven-time champion in attitude. Stewart was the one most likely to speak up when he didn’t feel NASCAR gave drivers the proper respect. Five years after Earnhardt’s death in the Daytona 500, Stewart voiced his anger at NASCAR in a sharp rebuke. Incensed at the bump drafting in a preliminary race at Daytona, Stewart said that “we’re probably going to kill somebody’’ with that type of racing and added “it could be me. It could be Dale (Earnhardt) Jr. It could be anybody out there.’’ The comments were dramatic even when one didn’t consider the backdrop, but drivers supported Stewart. Less than 48 hours later, NASCAR said it would further police bump drafting. Even now, Stewart can tug at NASCAR, questioning its methods and incurring change.

(Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images for TMS) Before the season, Stewart chastised NASCAR Chairman Brian France for not having attended a Sprint Cup Drivers Council meeting. France went to one a few months later. Stewart challenged NASCAR in April on safety when it allowed teams to tighten fewer than five lug nuts per wheel, leading to a spat of loose wheels. NASCAR fined Stewart $35,000 the next day and changed the rule five days later. Stewart can be most effective or annoying at such moments, but he admitted in September that he’s tired of fighting NASCAR. “I can sit here,’’ Stewart said, grabbing his phone in a conference room with reporters in the NASCAR Plaza, “and I can pull up stuff on this phone that would make you cringe about the sport that drivers talk about. “There’s 39 of these guys that 99 out of 100 times won’t say a thing about it to you guys or to NASCAR or anybody else. I’m the one guy that most of the time will go, ‘Man this is a bad thing to talk about, I shouldn’t talk about it,’ but I’ll get pissed off enough about it to talk about it because I believe it’s worth talking about. “That’s part of the reason I’m retiring because I’m tired of being responsible for it. It’s somebody else’s responsibility now. I’ve had my fill of it. I’ve had my fill of fighting the fight. At some point, you say, ‘Why do I keep fighting this fight when I’m not getting anywhere?’ ’’ Don’t be confused. That hard exterior hides a softer side. Stewart often is among the first to check in when someone in the sport is hurt or in need. It could be a Facebook message, text or a call. He’s offered his plane countless times to families of injured drivers so they can get to the hospital as soon as possible. After Bryan Clauson, an open-wheel driver, died in a crash this year, Stewart paid more than $30,000 at a charity auction for one of Clauson’s helmets and then gave the helmet to Clauson’s fiancee. “I think that in front of everybody he’s plays his hard shell tough guy and wants everybody to sort of be weary … of him, but behind closed doors he is a bit more of a teddy bear than I think people know,’’ Dale Earnhardt Jr. said. Tony Stewart talks to Dale Earnhardt Jr. at Dover International Speedway on June 1, 2012 . (Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images for NASCAR) Stewart and Dale Earnhardt Jr. share a bond, a reverence for racing. Earnhardt embraces NASCAR’s past, and Stewart respects the hard-scrabble life drivers had before him. Earnhardt has his collection of racing artifacts from cars to magazines; Stewart’s prized possessions include more than 200 racing helmets. Earnhardt and Stewart share more than a respect of racing’s history. They share Feb. 18, 2001. Stewart’s car tumbled down the backstretch that day in the Daytona 500, sending him to nearby Halifax Medical Center. He suffered a concussion and bruises. After X-rays and a CT scan, Stewart was wheeled into a room where doctors tried revive another patient. It was Dale Earnhardt. Stewart was quickly moved to another room. He found out the fate of one of the sport’s biggest stars before NASCAR’s Mike Helton told fans “we’ve lost Dale Earnhardt.’’ On a day that Dale Earnhardt Jr. lost his father, Stewart lost a hero. Stewart has experienced loss often. Less than a year earlier, the death of a rival shook Stewart. He had raced Kenny Irwin throughout dirt tracks in the Midwest. They became rivals. At times heated. That carried over to when they both raced in the Sprint Cup level. Stewart memorably threw his heel guards and leaned into Irwin’s car as it slowly drove by after Irwin punted Stewart into the wall at Martinsville. Irwin died in a crash July 7, 2000, at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Stewart won the Cup race two days later. He gave Irwin’s parents the trophy. Years later, Irwin’s mother cried, when she recounted Stewart’s generosity. Another driver’s death affected Stewart in a different way. Competing in a sprint car event the night before the 2014 Watkins Glen race, Stewart ran side-by-side with Kevin Ward Jr., a 20-year-old New York racer. Ward’s car bounced off the guardrail and spun. He climbed from his car and walked down the track to gesture at Stewart when Stewart’s car struck him. Ward was pronounced dead 45 minutes later. Tony Stewart speaks to the media at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Aug. 29, 2014, in his return to racing after his involvement in a fatal sprint car crash. (Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images) Stewart says it was an accident. After hearing from about two dozen witnesses, a grand jury needed less than an hour to decide not to charge Stewart for Ward’s death. Nearly a year after the accident, Ward’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Stewart. The case has yet to go to trial. Stewart sat out three Cup events after Ward’s death before returning to the driver’s seat. “It’s not something that goes away,’’ Stewart said six weeks after the incident. “It will never go away. It’s always going to be part of my life the rest of my life.’’ That Stewart returned to racing is no surprise. Racing has been all he has known. He was 2 months old when his parents put his baby carrier in the seat of a go-kart. At age 2, he placed a tupperware bowl on his head for a helmet and scooted throughout the house on his plastic motorcycle. By age 5, he was circling the garage in his Big Wheel. Racing was with Stewart even as he slept. “I dreamed about winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Indy 500, the Daytona 500, the Knoxville Nationals,’’ he once said. “You name it, I wanted to win every big race in every big division.’’ His NASCAR career will end without a Daytona 500 win. He never won an Indianapolis 500, either, but he won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway twice. He’s never won the Knoxville Nationals as a driver but has won it 10 times as an owner since 2001. What he has won is 49 Cup races — including one this year at Sonoma Raceway — and three championships. No period marked Stewart’s greatness like the 2011 Chase. He entered winless and grumpy, saying a few days before the playoffs began he didn’t think he had a chance to win it. Then he won five of the 10 Chase races, dueling Carl Edwards on and off the track. After his Martinsville win, Stewart said in victory lane: “(Edwards) better be worried. He’s not going to have an easy three weeks.’’ Stewart said more the following week when he won at Texas. Edwards finished second. After his press conference, Edwards doodled a goatee on Stewart’s face on a poster. Stewart saw it and was told Edwards was responsible. Stewart responded by writing a message to Edwards on the poster: “Told you so.’’ Stewart’s pestering continued in a press conference three days before the season finale. Edwards tried to match Stewart but couldn’t. When things are going well, few can banter as well as Stewart. He can be just as entertaining on the radio. One of his favorite phrases to say on the team’s radio was “Here kitty, kitty, kitty” as he closed on the leader. When he had to pit early in that 2011 Homestead finale after running over debris and falling to 40th, he calmly told his crew: “They’re going to feel like (crap) when we kick their ass after this.’’ Such boasts have not been heard on the radio in recent years, as Stewart’s triumphs declined.

(Photo by Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images) A frustrating 2013 ended that August when he suffered a broken leg in a sprint car crash, forcing him to miss the rest of the season. The following year saw more struggles before his incident with Ward. Last season, Stewart scored a career-low three top-10 finishes. He missed the first eight races of this year because of a back injury suffered in a sand dunes injury in January. Even with this year’s win at Sonoma, he enters his final Sprint Cup Series race with nearly as many finishes of 30th or worse (seven) as top-10 results (eight). Stewart will not leave as the same driver who won Sprint Cup Series titles in 2002, ’05 and ’11 but few ever leave as they enter. When he arrived, he was swarmed by fans and media as the sport’s hot rookie who drove for car owner Joe Gibbs. Stewart later said there’s no manual on how to adjust to the sport’s demands and admitted he failed to handle those at times. Some fans who liked his brash style, soon tired of his antics and cheers turned to boos. While there remain those who will never root for Stewart, the cheers have grown louder these final weeks in the series. His teammate, Kevin Harvick , recently decried that Stewart wasn’t receiving the accolades he deserved in his final appearances at tracks. Stewart, though, did not want the tributes Gordon received last year and Dale Earnhardt surely would have had. Stewart has rebuffed many attempts to honor him. Stewart didn’t want pity. He wanted cheers when he deserved them, as he did at Sonoma. Most of all, Stewart just wanted to race. That’s all he’s ever wanted to do. ",

      "text": "The crossover craze continues to grow and it won't be slowing any time in the near future. \nToyota , Ford, Subaru , Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new crossovers and SUVs at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show . Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs at the show, which opens to the public on Friday.\nAmericans bought more crossovers and SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing, according to registration data from IHS Markit. In the first nine months of this year, SUVs made up 39.5 percent of new-vehicle registrations; cars stood at 32 percent.\nUnlike the previous SUV boom in the early 2000s — which fell victim to rising gas prices — this one is likely to stay. That's because automakers are offering more small SUVs with better fuel economy. The country's top-selling sedan, the Toyota Camry, gets 28 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving. The top-selling small SUV, the Honda CR-V, gets 29 mpg.\n“There's no reason to not buy an SUV,” says Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. “I can't imagine a lot of scenarios where this trend is going to change.”\nThe difference between a crossover utility vehicle, or CUV, and sport-utility vehicle, or SUV, is historical. SUVs used to be based on truck platforms and were off-road capable. Now nearly all such vehicles are built on unibody car platforms. \nHere are crossover highlights from the L.A. Auto Show, which will be making the rounds at the Chicago Auto Show from February 11-20, 2017:\nALFA ROMEO STELVIO: Named for a mountain pass in Italy that's known for its hairpin turns, the midsize Stelvio has Alfa's distinctive triangular grille and curvy styling. Under the hood is a 280-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired to an eight-speed transmission. Buyers can also opt for the top-of-the-line Stelvio Quadrifoglio, which has a 2.9-liter V6 that produces 505 horsepower. All-wheel-drive is standard on all models. The Stelvio, which will be made in Italy, goes on sale early next year. Pricing wasn't released.\nThe third model in Alfa Romeo's resurgent American lineup is the all-new 2018 Stelvio sport SUV. Named after the famed Stelvio Pass in the Italian Alps, Stelvio uses a 2-liter turbo four-cylinder engine delivering 280 horsepower and 306 pound-feet of torque. All-wheel drive is standard in the performance-oriented Quadrifoglio model, which uses a 2.9-liter biturbo V-6 engine. Pricing TBD.\n(Robert Duffer) FORD ECOSPORT: Ford's smallest SUV, which has been sold in other markets since 2003, will finally go on sale in North America in 2018. It will compete with other tiny newcomers like the Chevrolet Trax and Honda HR-V. To target young buyers, the EcoSport offers ten exterior colors, seven interior lighting options and optional Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It comes with either a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged engine or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with four-wheel-drive. Pricing wasn't released, but the EcoSport will be less expensive than the Ford Escape, which starts at $23,600. The EcoSport will be made in India.\n2018 Ford EcoSport debuts for American market Tribune wire reports and Robert Duffer Ford made snaps late Monday when it used Snapchat to reveal the EcoSport subcompact crossover in advance of the Los Angeles Auto Show .\nThe use of Snapchat, a social media messaging app popular with millennials and the subsequent Generation Z, to reveal a vehicle was a first, according to Ford,...\nFord made snaps late Monday when it used Snapchat to reveal the EcoSport subcompact crossover in advance of the Los Angeles Auto Show .\nThe use of Snapchat, a social media messaging app popular with millennials and the subsequent Generation Z, to reveal a vehicle was a first, according to Ford,...\n(Tribune wire reports and Robert Duffer) JAGUAR I-PACE CONCEPT: Jaguar is taking aim at Tesla Motors with an electric SUV that is due out in 2018. The five-seat I-PACE is a compact SUV, slightly smaller than the brand's gas-powered F-Pace and Tesla's Model X. It can go an estimated 220 miles on a charge and has electric motors on the front and rear axles that deliver 400 horsepower and zoom from 0 to 60 mph in 4 seconds. Pricing wasn't released.\nJEEP COMPASS: The new Jeep Compass small SUV replaces both the aging Patriot and the previous Compass in Jeep's showroom. Jeep unveiled the new global Compass in Brazil in September, and it looks like a smaller version of the Grand Cherokee. But other details of the U.S. version have been kept under wraps. The Compass is scheduled to go on sale in the U.S. in March.\n2017 Jeep Compass to replace old Compass, Patriot compact crossovers Brent Snavely Jeep revealed that Compass will be the name for the compact Jeep that will replace the Compass and Patriot crossovers as it celebrated the start of production at its plant in Pernambuco, Brazil, and released three images of the vehicle.\nThe images show a more aerodynamic design than the outgoing...\nJeep revealed that Compass will be the name for the compact Jeep that will replace the Compass and Patriot crossovers as it celebrated the start of production at its plant in Pernambuco, Brazil, and released three images of the vehicle.\nThe images show a more aerodynamic design than the outgoing...\n(Brent Snavely) LAND ROVER DISCOVERY:  The first complete redesign of the Discovery in 12 years, this family- oriented large SUV has room for seven adults in three rows. It drops the LR designation—and about 1,000 pounds—in a less boxy design. Fuel economy increases yet there's no shortage of power for towing, which maxes out at 8,201 pounds. Engines include a turbo diesel V-6 and supercharged six-cylinder gas variant. The seats can be rearranged remotely through a smartphone app even when the operator is outside the vehicle, and the second and third rows can fold flat in 14 seconds. The suspension automatically lowers the car 1.5 inches to make it easier to get in and out. There are six charging points, places to store iPads, 9 USB ports, and a 4G WiFi hotspot that can handle up to eight devices. There's no shortage of power for towing, which maxes out at 8,201 pounds. Engines include a turbo diesel V-6 and supercharged six-cylinder gas variant. Prices range from $57,000 to $84,000.\nMAZDA CX-5 : Mazda has redesigned its CX-5 midsize SUV, which goes on sale in Japan in February and the U.S. after that. It has a new grille with narrowed headlights and cleaner, less chiseled sides. Mazda says the driving dynamics have improved and the interior is more comfortable. The gas engine choices — a 2.0-liter or a 2.5-liter four-cylinder — remain the same, but for the first time, Mazda will also offer a diesel engine in the U.S. The diesel goes on sale in the second half of 2017. Pricing for the new CX-5 wasn't released, but the current CX-5 starts at $21,795.\nFully redesigned for 2017, the second generation Mazda CX-5 compact crossover will come with three available SKYACTIV engines, including a 2.2-liter diesel expected in the U.S. later in 2017. Accounting for 25 percent of global sales, the CX-5 is Mazda's most important vehicle, and it continues to push into the premium segment with sharp interior appointments. \n(Robert Duffer) MINI COUNTRYMAN: The second-generation Countryman small crossover is the biggest Mini ever. It's 8 inches longer than the outgoing model, with 30 percent more cargo space. Buyers can choose a 134-horsepower, three-cylinder engine or a 189-horsepower four-cylinder; automatic and manual transmissions are available. The Mini Countryman goes on sale in March; a plug-in hybrid version follows in June. Pricing wasn't released, but the current Countryman starts at $22,750.\nPORSCHE PANAMERA 4 E-HYBRID:  It's a comfortable four-door sedan. No, it's a high-performance sports car. If it's the Panamera, it's a little bit of both. The all-wheel drive car draws on the technology used in the company's 918 Spyder supercar so that the electric motor continually adds power; the car accelerates to 62 mph in just 4.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 168 mph. It can go up to 31 miles on just the battery. It hits Europe first in mid-April, with deliveries to follow worldwide. Expect mid-summer in North America. The price is $123,680. \nSUBARU VIZIV7 CONCEPT: Subaru plans to start selling a three-row SUV in early 2018. It will be the brand's largest vehicle yet. Like other Subarus, the VIZIV7 concept has standard all-wheel-drive and a boxer engine. The company says more details will come next year.\nTOYOTA C-HR: Toyota is also joining the subcompact SUV market with the C-HR, which stands for “Coupe-High Rider.” The C-HR, which is already on sale in Europe, has bold, angular styling and a floating roofline that will spice up Toyota's conservative showroom. Europe has a hybrid version, but Toyota hasn't yet said which engines will be offered in the U.S. The C-HR goes on sale in the spring. Pricing wasn't released, but it will slot below the RAV4 SUV, which starts at $24,910.\nVOLKSWAGEN ATLAS: Volkswagen's first three-row SUV fills a big hole in its product lineup. The seven-passenger Atlas, which will go on sale in the spring, comes with two engine choices — a 238-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a 280-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6. Both are paired to an eight-speed transmission. All-wheel-drive is available, and Volkswagen says safety features like automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning and lane departure warning will be affordable options. Pricing wasn't released. The Atlas will be built in Tennessee.\n2018 Atlas three-row SUV puts VW back on map Robert Duffer and Tribune wire reports Better late to the three-row crossover party then never for Volkswagen .\nThe beleaguered German brand took a big step toward recovering from its emissions-cheating scandal by introducing a new seven-passenger SUV.\nVolkswagen says the Atlas will have enough space for seven adults plus their luggage....\nBetter late to the three-row crossover party then never for Volkswagen .\nThe beleaguered German brand took a big step toward recovering from its emissions-cheating scandal by introducing a new seven-passenger SUV.\nVolkswagen says the Atlas will have enough space for seven adults plus their luggage....\n(Robert Duffer and Tribune wire reports) Associated Press contributed.  \nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers Jeep Mazda Toyota Motor Corp.

The Japanese automaker launched its Mirai fuel-cell car in the U.S. last year, and has been an outspoken advocate for fuel cells as an alternative to electric cars powered by batteries. But why stop at cars?\nToyota is now exploring the possibility of using fuel cells to power big commercial trucks. It will conduct a feasibility study in California for a hydrogen semi-trailer truck. California is the only U.S. state where the Mirai is currently sold, because other states do not have adequate fueling infrastructure.\nCommercial trucks rack up more mileage in a year than the average car, and have much worse fuel economy. But the limited range afforded by batteries has made them a tough nut to crack when it comes to electrification. The longer average ranges and short fueling stops afforded by fuel cells may prove attractive to truckers. Toyota did not say when the study would start, only noting that additional details will be released “in the coming months.”\nMore: 2018 Toyota C-HR crossover promises track-tuned handling\nWhile it studies fuel-cell big rigs, Toyota will also begin manufacturing fuel-cell buses in Japan . It will supply two of the buses to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for transit service, and hopes to have a fleet of 100 ready in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where the Japanese government plans to showcase fuel-cell technology.\nThe move toward fuel-cell commercial vehicles comes just as Toyota begins to change its strategy and warm towards battery-electric cars. While the automaker previously viewed fuel cells as its zero-emission technology of choice, Toyota now reportedly plans to launch a mass-market electric car in time for the 2020 Olympics. Details on that model are scarce, although it may turn out to be an SUV.\nToyota is forming a small, in-house group to develop the electric car . It hopes to have the group completely assembled by December, giving it around three years to complete work on the car. That’s a fairly tight schedule by industry standards, and the fact that Toyota is only now forming an electric-car development group indicates the company hasn’t been thinking about an electric car for very long.\nStrategy shift: Toyota commits to all-electric vehicles, forms special team Will Toyota change course and build a mass-market electric car?

      "text": "A little more than a year ago, Toyota announced ambitious goals to slash emissions from new vehicles and its production processes. To get there, the company said it would turn to hydrogen , not electric-powered vehicles.\nNow, the Japanese automaker is bringing electric cars back in the fold. Well, sort of.\nToyota announced it would establish an in-house venture company responsible for developing electric vehicles. But this is hardly represents a major re-allocation of capital or business strategy.\nThe so-called “virtual” organization--code for lots of conference calls and video meetings--will consist of four people. Each member of this in-house venture company will come from a different Toyota company, including Toyota Industries Corporation, Aisin Seiki Co., Denso Corporation, and Toyota Motor Corp.\nThe new venture company, which will launch next month, will be independent of other internal structural organizations, Toyota says.\nToyota tries to emphasize the benefits of such a small team. One line in its announcement says:\nIts small organizational structure is meant to enable it to implement unconventional work processes, leading to accelerated project progress and, thus, fast-to-market products.\nAnd the Japanese automaker stresses it has long taken a “multi-angled approach” to introducing environment-friendly vehicles. Toyota has developed hybrid vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles, for instance.\nBut Toyota has admittedly put a special focus on fuel cell vehicles because it views this alternative fuel as the ideal in terms of cruising range and fueling times .\nToyota now seems to be acknowledging that the tradewinds are heavily favoring electric vehicles.\n“Differing energy and infrastructure issues around the world and the rapid strengthening of regulations aimed at increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles have heightened the need for product lineups that can respond to various situations,” the company says in its announcement.\nToyota Is Investing In Trade Skills \n\nThe automaker says it will continue to promote fuel cell vehicles as well as create a structure that will allow it to commercialize EVs at an early stage, as an alternative means of achieving zero emissions.\nIt’s unclear whether a four-person team can effectively leverage its own internal resources to develop an EV program. On its face, the effort certainly seems weak. TMC President Akio Toyoda sees it differently.\n“Over these past few years, which we have positioned as years for strengthening our planting of seeds for the future, we have taken such measures as establishing the Toyota Research Institute, made Daihatsu a fully owned subsidiary and have begun work to establish an internal company responsible for compact vehicles for emerging markets,” he says in a statement. “The new organizational structure for EVs is a part of this effort. As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation in the work practices of Toyota and the Toyota Group.”",

      "text": "OJAI, CA: When Toyota says its 2017 Sienna van delivers huge helpings of comfort and style, the company isn’t just putting words on a press release. A few hours behind the wheel of this family hauler was enough to show it delivers on both.\nToyota invited automotive journalists to Ojai, CA, recently to try out a number of its 2017 models and figuring prominently in the rotation of vehicles was the Sienna, which includes a new engine and transmission for 2017.\nAll Siennas get an upgrade to a new 3.5-litre V6 D-4S Direct and Port Injection engine with a direct shift eight-speed automatic transmission.\nThis combination delivers 296 peak hp, up 30 hp from last year, with better fuel economy.\nFuel consumption on the Siennas without all-wheel drive is rated at 12.5/8.9L/100 km (city/highway). With all-wheel drive, fuel consumption is 13.4/9.6L/100 km (city/highway).\nThe engine’s power was evident on a drive along the Pacific Coast Highway with the Pacific Ocean and hundreds of surfers on one side and mountains and million-dollar homes on the other side.\nThe van handled the curves like a car and the numerous windows gave you amble opportunity to see all the scenery.\nThe Sienna’s dashboard is laid out particularly well, with everything you need within reach.\nHaving just driven the Honda Odyssey, I appreciated the one information screen the Sienna offers which was easy to figure out and use.\nThe GPS system on the Sienna was very useful as it warned my co-driver and myself when traffic was slow ahead.\nGetting in and out of the third row seats was also easier in the Sienna than the Odyssey.\nThe second row slid far enough forward to make getting in and out very easy.\nThe third-row seats offered plenty of legroom for adults so would be more than adequate for any kids who want to sit far away from their parents.\nI didn't get a chance to check out stowing the third-row seats so I can’t say if it was as easy as stowing the third-row seats in the Odyssey.\nMinivans may be losing drivers to SUVs and CUVs but nothing beats the comfort and room of a well-laid out van to haul around your family and Toyota’s Sienna should be on your list for a test drive. It just might convince you to ditch the SUV.\nThe Sienna is offered in six models, which includes two with all-wheel drive.\nThe Sienna seven-passenger has a starting price of $33,420 topping out with the XLE AWD seven-passenger has a starting MSRP of $44,130.\nEvery 2017 Sienna is loaded with safety features including back-up camera, child safety seat anchors and eight airbags.\nMike Johnston is Managing Editor of Metroland's Durham Region and Northumberland County division.

      "text": "Daniel Strohl on Jun 4th, 2015 Share \nInside Holt Motor Co. in Los Angeles. Photos courtesy Toyota Archives. \nIn 1958, a little Japanese car called the Toyopet showed up in California. It got ridiculed. It got amazing mileage. And by the end of the year, it got about 288 sales. Who exactly made the first of those sales, however, remains a mystery, one which Toyota itself can’t resolve even though several entities have laid claim to being the first Toyota dealership in the United States. \nToyota Motor Sales president Shotaro Kamiya led the charge to introduce Toyotas to the United States as early as 1956 and after Toyota sent a few over for testing on American roads in late summer of 1957, the company began to devise strategies for selling the cars in the United States. According to Toyota USA archivist Jason Bell, Toyota initially wanted to sell the cars itself through a handful of centralized locations, but Shoji Hattori, the company’s executive vice president, advised the company to instead adopt the dealership model already prevalent in the United States. \nAccording to Wanda James’s book Driving from Japan: Japanese Cars in America , Kamiya began signing up dealerships in 1957, with the road testing underway. She even pinpoints one in particular as the first – Ben Alexander’s Hollywood Toyota, an offshoot of his Hollywood Ford dealership at 6850 Hollywood Boulevard – and supplies a date for the establishment of the dealership – October 31, 1957. \nBut that may not be the case at all. Bell noted that the dealership (actually located at 6000 Hollywood Boulevard , as seen in the above image) was more of a showroom operated by Toyota and relocated in 1960. “(It) was more of a temporary HQ from which they may have sold a few cars than an actual independent dealership,” he wrote. As for the current Toyota of Hollywood, Bell noted that it’s an entirely different entity established in 1981 at the original location, despite the dealership’s occasional claims of having been in that location since 1957 . Officials from Toyota of Hollywood did not return calls for this story. \nJames notes that “surprisingly, only sketchy information exists in Toyota’s own archives regarding their early days in America,” and indeed, Bell can’t point to any one specific dealership as the first American Toyota dealership. Toyota records show that the oldest existing Toyota dealership in the United States, Krause Toyota in Pennsylvania, was established in 1959 and that the oldest existing Toyota dealership in California, Deal and Davie in Susanville, was established a year later, which only means that the first U.S. Toyota dealership, established in 1957 or 1958, is no longer in operation. \nBell’s research over the years has come up with about nine candidates for the first U.S. Toyota dealership, all in California, though he points out that the evidence for any of them being the first is inconclusive. Two descendants of former Toyota dealers – Hil Probert in Larkspur and John A. Rose in San Diego – have laid claim to being the first, and a Los Angeles Times clipping from late July 1958 notes that seven Southern California dealers had started selling the Toyopet:",

      "text": "Tweet \nWhen Toyota unveiled the C-HR—first as a concept car at the 2014 Paris Motor Show, and then as a production-ready vehicle early this year—its aggressive design, dramatic interior and hybrid powertrain instantly attracted everyone’s attention. After all, it was a far cry from the safe styling and humdrum dynamics of the Toyota of old. \nAnd with the subcompact crossover class fast becoming a popular choice among today’s car buyers as evidenced by the number of EcoSports, HR-Vs and Jukes on the road, many assumed that Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP) would be eager to capture a significant slice of the proverbial pie by bringing in the C-HR. Unfortunately, that may not be the case if what a source from the Japanese carmaker’s local office shared with us is true. \nAccording to our source, TMP could very well pass up the C-HR because the higher-ups in the company believe it will just eat into the sales of the RAV4. Our source claims that since the RAV4 is a global model for Toyota, TMP is obligated to sell it and thus cannot remove and replace it with the C-HR, regardless of the fact that the RAV4 isn’t exactly selling like hotcakes. Unfortunately for TMP (and for us consumers), the C-HR seems to have the makings of another bestseller should it be marketed and distributed here (and should TMP price it right, of course). \nThere is a slim chance, however, that the C-HR could find its way here since the vehicle will reportedly be assembled in Thailand by either 2017 or 2018. Perhaps if there’s enough clamor for it in our market, TMP could bring it in anyway. After all, business is business, and it would be unwise to ignore the opportunity. \nThe C-HR is currently on sale in Europe and is available with either a 1.8-liter hybrid mill or a 1.2-liter turbocharged engine, although some markets will reportedly get a beefier 2.0-liter version. The C-HR also serves as the debut platform for a first for Toyota: sequential turn signal lights in the headlight housing with 12 LED lights beaming up from the inside to the outside. \nLet’s cross our fingers.",

      "text": "How would you spend your money if you were a billionaire? Would you immediately trade your Toyota in for a McLaren? Would you ditch your apartment for a beach house? Would you eschew flying with the commoners and instead buy a private jet? No one would blame you or bat an eyelash. But that isn't how the five billionaires below operate. Though all of them have been wildly successful in their chosen fields, they've all retained a measure of humility and frugality that is unusual for billionaires.\nLet's take a look at some of the penny-pinching habits of these ultra-wealthy people.\nJudy Faulkner \nNet worth: $2.6 billion \nJudy Faulkner built Epic from the ground up. She launched the healthcare company that sells medical records software in 1979, with $70,000. She has never been one to splurge and has had just two cars over the past 15 years. She has also lived in the same Madison, Wisconsin suburb for almost three decades.\nCharlie Ergen \nNet worth: $14 billion \nCharlie Ergen isn't just frugal when it comes to running DISH network, he also penny pinches in his personal life, a habit that he learned from his mother's experience growing up during the Great Depression. So how frugal is Ergen? He packs a brown bag lunch of a sandwich and a Gatorade before work every day. He also shares hotel rooms with colleagues when traveling.\nManjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images\nAzim Premji \nNet worth: $15.5 billion \nAzim Premji is the wealthiest tech mogul in India. He's also been said to make Uncle Scrooge look like Santa Claus. The 70-year-old is head of IT consulting firm Wipro. He is so frugal that he keeps tabs on the toilet paper usage in Wipro's offices. He also constantly reminds people to turn the lights off in the offices.\nMark Zuckerberg \nNet worth: $50 billion \nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has $50 billion reasons to live lavishly, but he does not. He and his wife Priscilla Chan live a pretty low-key lifestyle. Zuckerberg is fond of his t-shirt, hoodie, and jeans uniform. After Zuckerberg and Chan married in the backyard of their Palo Alto house in 2012, the two dined out on a meal of McDonald's. In 2014, he traded in his Acura for a VW GTI hatchback with a manual transmission.\nWarren Buffett \nNet worth: $65 billion \nThe Oracle of Omaha is one of the most frugal billionaires in the world. He is one of the richest men in the world and he still lives in the same modest home he bought in 1958 for $31,500. Buffett also doesn't carry a cell phone or have a computer on his desk. Given all of this, it might not surprise you that at one point, Buffett had a vanity license plate that read \"THRIFTY.\"\nRead more: Five Billionaires Who Are Surprisingly Frugal ",

Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.",

(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama) . .   TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in a battery used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. Toyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. Increasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because powering stations aren't as common as gas stations. Toyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. But all the world's automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which boasts a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. Toyota's new technology will allow the company to test out various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. The tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

      "text": "Toyota says new technology means longer battery life By YURI KAGEYAMAAP Business Writer \nTOKYO (AP) - Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in a battery used to power electric vehicles - an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because powering stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which boasts a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test out various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama  ",

(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama) . . Video Buy AP Photo Reprints TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. Toyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. The ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. Increasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. Toyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. Toyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. But all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. Toyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. The tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama",

      "text": "OJAI, CA: Prime real estate, prime rib and Optimus Prime, all the best in their fields. Toyota hopes to add a fourth name to that list when it launches the Prius Prime in the spring of 2017.\nThe Prius Prime is Toyota’s most advanced plug-in hybrid.\nNoting it is more than a name change, Toyota Canada vice president Stephen Beatty said the new Prius is “the most fuel-efficient vehicle,” using 1.9 litres of gas per 100 kilometres, a number Toyota says is 12 per cent better than Chevrolet’s Volt and 22 per cent better than the Prius Plug-In.\nWith an electric range of 35 kilometres, Beatty says the new Prime will meet the driving needs of 75 per cent of the Canadian driving public.\nThe car can travel 965 kilometres on a full tank and a full charge in hybrid mode.\nBut why just talk about the car?\nToyota invited a group of Canadian automotive journalists to Ojai, CA, to test drive its new vehicle.\nToyota couldn’t have chosen a better location as it looked like every 10th car on the road in California is a Prius. Even the cabbies happily drive around in their Prius.\nAnd if a Prius wasn’t in front of you, the other electric vehicle on the road is a Tesla.\nBut that is likely out of the price range of Canadian families looking for style and comfort, while trying to help the environment and not have to rob a bank.\nI had the opportunity to drive the Prius Prime Technology. Toyota also offers the Prius Prime.\nThe first thing you notice when you step into this car is the enormous 11.6-inch display screen. (The screen is seven inches on the Prius Prime). You can’t miss it. But even at that size, the screen looks like it is just another part of the car, which says a lot about how Toyota designed this vehicle.\nInside, the Prime Technology features integrated satellite radio, 10 speakers, advanced voice recognition and numerous other features. But the star of the show is the screen.\nIt shows you exactly how the car is performing, where the energy is being produced and how well you are driving.\nOur first short trip featured a drive with just the electric motor working to power the car.\nIt had great response time when you hit the accelerator and never missed a beat keeping up with traffic. Because of the silence due to the electric motor, the cabin can be noisy particularly from the tires.\nAfter using the battery, a longer trip allowed my co-driver and I the chance to see how the gas motor worked.\nNeedless to say, the car performed admirably. At one point, the screen informed us we were getting 199 mpg (1.4L/100 km).\nThe Prius handled all the curves going up and down the hills surrounding Los Angeles.\nIt even kept up with a Mustang GT convertible, the driver and passenger each taking selfies as we waited for some construction.\nOnly in California.\nThe Prius comes loaded with a number of standard features including back-up camera, heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, lane departure alert, automatic high beams and dynamic radar cruise control which, when on, keeps a safe distance between you and the car in front of you.\nThe Prime Technology model adds a few more standard features such as a heads-up display, blind spot monitoring and rain-sensing wipers.\nOutside the Prime sits lower than its predecessor, features LED Quad headlamps, a new stylish front grille and a carbon fibre liftgate.\nThis is one classy looking hybrid.\nCharging time is about five hours on a standard outlet (120 volts), two hours with a 240volt outlet.\nIf our short drive is any indication, Toyota has a winner with its redesigned Prius.\nMike Johnston is Managing Editor of Metroland's Durham Region and Northumberland County division.

Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Tags",

(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama) \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. What's going on in the markets today? \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Tags",

(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama) \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Tags",

      "text": "The tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in a battery used to power electric vehicles - an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 per cent to 15 per cent.\nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones.\nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because powering stations aren't as common as gas stations. Toyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.\nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers.\nBut all the world's automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which boasts a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold.\nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test out various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager.\nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings.",
