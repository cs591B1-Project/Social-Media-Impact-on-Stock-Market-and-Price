By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup - bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below - drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known - they wanted red cups.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.\nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades.\nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain.\nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed.\n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   rewritten or redistributed.",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) comments NEW YORK — Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.\nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed.\n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked.\nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

      "text": "But he asks his staff to respect the result \n(Fortune) – Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has made no secret of his disdain for Donald Trump. \nIn a letter to staff on Wednesday, Schultz said he was gobsmacked by the president-elect’s victory but said Americans had to respect the results. \n“Like so many of our fellow Americans—both Democrats and Republicans—I am stunned,” Schultz wrote. “We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.” \nEchoing the conciliatory tone of Trump’s opponent, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and President Barack Obama in speeches Wednesday afternoon, Schultz said people needed to give Trump a chance to govern well. \nIn September, the politically outspoken Schultz endorsed Clinton for president, saying he remained optimistic about the country’s future, despite what he saw as an effort by politicians and the media to paint the nation with “cloudiness and despair.” Earlier in the year, he had decried the Republican primaries as “a circus.” \nSPECIAL: Fight back against the Establishment Elites! Blast all 535 members of Congress with a red hot “Citizen Declaration of Independence” letter today! Together we can stop the globalist agenda and preserve American values! \nIn his staff letter Wednesday, Schultz called on his employees to be kind with other people and to to “find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve.” \nThis election isn’t the first time Schultz waded into political territory at the risk of angering his clientele. A few years ago, he became a target of the gun lobby for asking gun owners to leave their weapons in their cars when coming to a Starbucks. And last year,Schultz quickly backed off an effort to have Starbucks baristas talk to customers about the state of race relations. The company itself has also been targeted for seemingly innocuous efforts like monochromatic coffee cups during the holiday season. \nBelow is Schultz’s letter in full: \nDear Partners, \nLast night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned. \nWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. \nAs Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. \nWhether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores. \nWe can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism. \nToday, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let’s take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans. \nI am so very proud to be your partner. \nOnward,",

And they’re actually pretty sweet.\nPicture: Starbucks For the first time ever, Starbucks are releasing a range of red cups designed by their customers, with thirteen different red cup designs.\n13 designs from six countries were chosen from a competition Starbucks ran last December on Instagram, which invited customers to share their own red cup designs.\nTen of the designs will be served in the UK.\nDena Blevins, the creative director of Starbucks Global Creative Studio, said: ‘People will be walking around the street in Shanghai, New York and London carrying these cups.\nPicture: Starbucks ‘We love that this year our customers’ artistry can play a part in brightening someone’s day.’\nWhich is a pretty lovely, concept, no? Here are all the cup designs in a handy gallery, so you can pick a favourite or make it your mission to collect one of each.\n(Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) (Picture: Starbucks) MORE: Your definitive guide to 2016’s Christmas coffee drinks \nMORE: How to get your very own Buster the boxer from John Lewis’ Christmas advert \nMORE: Greggs’ Christmas menu is here and it’s as magical as always \n \n ",

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) prev next comments NEW YORK — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.\nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades.\nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain.\nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed.\n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) Joseph Pisani   Show Caption Previous Next NEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. \nBy JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup - bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below - drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known - they wanted red cups. \nContact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani .

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

      "text": "Starbucks , Holiday Red Cup , Coffee \nThe holidays are approaching and we all know what that means, the Starbucks red holiday cup is here! This year 13 cups will serve hot and even cold beverages. Starbucks approached the design of the cup with the customer in mind. Crowd sourced and designed by their very own customers, each cup was entered into a contest through instagram last winter and selected for this year's holiday cup. For many, when Starbucks red cups return, it’s a signal that the holiday season is drawing near. \nSince 1997, Starbucks has welcomed the holidays with a special red cup that celebrates the spirit of the season. Over the years, designs have ranged from the modern, using whimsical brushstrokes in bold colors, to the nostalgic, featuring mistletoe and ornaments. This year, for the first time, Starbucks red cups will feature designs created by customers with 13 distinct cups in stores starting tomorrow (November 10). “We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nFor years Starbucks customers have been decorating their white cups (Starbucks even held a contest to support this creativity). Taking a cue from customers who had been using their red holiday cups as a canvas, last December Starbucks invited customers to share their designs on Instagram. \nFrom Illinois to Indonesia, Pennsylvania to Korea, Dubai to Ontario, in just eight days, Starbucks received more than 1,200 individual submissions from 13 countries. Many of the images were featured in an online cup collection. “We were surprised and inspired by the amount of incredible art submitted by our customers. The designs were beautiful, expressive and engaging,” said Dena Blevins, creative director, Starbucks Global Creative Studio. “We quickly realized there was potential to use the customer-created art for our holiday cups.” \nThe Starbucks Creative team printed each design posted to social channels and noticed the themes that began to emerge – graphic, inspirational, intricate, seasonal, typographic. No customer names were included, just a photo of the cup that was submitted. “We loved how the red cups with white designs naturally created a collection,” Blevins said. “They hang together as one idea, but each expression is unique.” \nNext, the Starbucks team asked a small group of customers to mail in their cup so that it could be evaluated for potential production. The team worked to honor the artists and the integrity of their artwork, making as few changes as possible to the original. \nIn the end, 13 customer designs were selected from six countries to represent the collective spirit of the holidays around the world. Their designs will be showcased on the holiday cups served in the more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries. \n“People will be walking around the street in Shanghai, New York and London carrying these cups,” Blevins said. “We love that this year our customers’ artistry can play a part in brightening someone’s day.”",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades.\nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favourites , Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain.\nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed.\n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

      "text": "Shutterstock GokGak \nIn Shakespeare's Macbeth, three witches stand on a high road, looking into the future to divulge to the approaching, ambitious warrior his fate. They present three opportunities for him to make history — but when their advice is not heeded, these risks lead to his downfall. \nOrganizations are now under intense scrutiny due to the environmental pressures of resource scarcity and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Stemming from this, three corporate risk profiles present opportunities to create wealth from within, but they also present untold pitfalls to companies who look out for their short-term benefit rather than adapting to serve society at large. \nAccording to the conversation from a GreenBiz webinar this week, the new risk profiles include stronger regulatory requirements for disclosure on sustainable practices; customer preferences cascading through supply chains (nearly instantly); and the growth of responsible investing. \nClearly, corporations must raise the profile of sustainability to guard customer reputation, engage employees, drive growth, manage risks, and keep up with financial markets. Yet they are struggling to plug quickly-changing sustainability measures into established financial modeling or enterprise risk management processes. \nIn order to do so, sustainability executives must build a business case for company-wide initiatives, frame sustainability opportunities and risk in the language of corporate business, and create allies with finance and risk leaders inside the company. A common language \n“The common framework for evaluating longer-term risks exists in the corporate language,” said Alex Wittenberg, executive director of Marsh & McLennan Companies’ Global Risk Center, during the webinar panel. “Sustainability professionals should provide that context and make sure it’s not separate. They need to translate the firm’s language into the sustainability world, not the other way around.” \nThe company’s commitment to sustainability started at the top, with the CEO’s concern about the responsibility of a for-profit company. \nA poll by risk and insurance consulting firm Marsh & McLennan shows a divide between financial and risk strategy agendas: 57 percent of finance and risk executives believe their organization has effectively integrated sustainability risk into risk management and reporting, while 72 percent of sustainability executives disagree. Meanwhile, 59% of finance and risk executives believe their organization’s finance and risk management teams effectively work with sustainability programs, while only 20 percent of sustainability executives agree. \nWhen a sustainability professional links resilience issues to an organization’s KPIs and metrics, Wittenberg said “the issues you’re championing will go much farther.” Embedding sustainability into existing operational and strategic breaks down silos of information and perspective within companies, helps long-term strategic scenario planning and helps price externalities into the budget — like planning for an internal carbon price. \nOne of the challenges here is that sustainability risk horizons span three to five years, as opposed to most corporate risk assessments of six to 18 months. One of the simplest ways to educate the organization about sustainability risks and opportunities, said Wittenberg, is to “talk to the people and the heads of the ERM committee about what their top risks are.” Invest in environmental and social factors \nStarbucks Treasurer Drew Wolff said that his role is to be both the “bank account and the wallet” of the global company with more than 300,000 employees and billions of dollars in market cap. He borrows and invests money, protects cash, takes care of short-term liquidity and long-term financial needs, and hedges foreign risks and commodities. \nThe company’s investments consider environmental, social, and corporate governance factors, and include a robust portfolio of green and sustainability bonds. \nAkamai’s guiding principles for renewable energy procurement are they are impactful, aligned with customers’ expectations and cost effective, said David Neshat, its treasurer. \n“The conventional wisdom is that excluding anything hurts returns, but you can craft sustainable portfolios with similar risks and returns to passive benchmarks,” he said. “The growing area of green and sustainable bonds are like any other. It amounts to some additional reporting, issuing debt securities to investors with an explicit use of proceeds for green or social purposes, and is governed by the ‘green bond principles’” demanded by investors and stakeholders. \nThe use of proceeds outside renewable energy (such as agricultural, social and educational purposes) is a broader sustainability category, but Starbucks also has broader sustainability strategies of supporting sustainable coffee economy, “green retail” in LEED-certified stores, and educational pathways for its employees. \nThe company’s commitment to sustainability started at the top, with the CEO’s concern about the responsibility of a for-profit company. It’s trickled down to being a key part of Starbucks’ investing portfolio. \n“We talked to investors we hadn’t talked to before,” said Wolff. “We had 40 new investors involved in this $500 million, 10-year bond.” Bond proceeds expand the program. The company has received numerous internal and external benefits, showed how finance and public policy can commit to working together, fostered new internal dialogue and ideas. Explore new financing models \nThe Treasurer of Akamai, one high-growth technology company with more than $2.2 billion in revenue, discussed its plans to cover 50% of electricity consumption using renewable energy by 2020 and reduce absolute Scope 2 and 3 emissions below 2015 levels. \nAkamai’s guiding principles for renewable energy procurement are they are impactful, aligned with customers’ expectations and cost effective, said David Neshat, its treasurer. \nOnce the risk gap was bridged in favor of investing in clean energy, “it was a no-brainer.” \nTheir executive process to transition to clean energy is to: Estimate renewable energy procurement requirements based on regional network energy and grid renewables growth Identify and build financial models for candidate projects in key U.S. power markets where Akamai has concentrated energy usage Implement multi-year phased procurement of renewable energy in these markets Present and seek approval from its board of directors Monitor opportunities for non-U.S. renewable energy procurement \nAkamai also turned to a “contract for differences” (CFD), 15 to 20-year agreements to purchase electricity and renewable energy certificates at a fixed price for a particular renewable energy project such as a solar farm. Generated electricity is sold into the market, and Akamai pays or receives the difference between the average monthly market price and fixed price. The company then retains the certificate. \nMonthly gains or losses are accounted for, presenting as a “hedge” against rising fossil fuel electricity prices that are factored into ongoing colocation data center expenses. \n“The financial impact is that there are no up-front cash flows,” said Neshat, who spoke about Akamai’s CFD program for the first time at the GreenBiz webcast. “It’s a great solution for the company; we can be impactful while managing financials as we would for our shareholders.” \n“At first, as a high-tech, high-growth company, you want to be mindful of capital,” he continued. But once the risk gap was bridged in favor of investing in clean energy, “it was a no-brainer.” \nThe transition to clean energy is an inevitable road driven by market forces and consumer demand. Companies are making this transition in many ways, and as the bridge between sustainability and financial risk is closed, the risks themselves turn into opportunities rich with environmental and social benefits.

In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. \nBy JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup - bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below - drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known - they wanted red cups. \nContact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani .

(KTRK) AP  41AM NEW YORK -- Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year possibly with snowflakes and reindeer, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.The coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols.Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades.Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. Eleven will be available at U.S. locations.All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known - they wanted red cups.

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) Related Coverage Starbucks rolls out ‘unity’ cup ahead of Election Day \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Over the years, designs have ranged from the modern, using whimsical brushstrokes in bold colors, to the nostalgic, featuring mistletoe and ornaments. This year, for the first time, Starbucks red cups will feature designs created by customers with 13 distinct cups in stores starting November 10.\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\nFrom Illinois to Indonesia, Pennsylvania to Korea, Dubai to Ontario, in just eight days, Starbucks received more than 1,200 individual submissions from 13 countries.\nAll the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo.",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

Over the years, designs have ranged from the modern, using whimsical brushstrokes in bold colors, to the nostalgic, featuring mistletoe and ornaments. This year, for the first time, Starbucks red cups will feature designs created by customers with 13 distinct cups in stores starting November 10.

They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\nStarbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain.\nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed.\n“It’s just a cup,” he joked.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

Guest - 11 months ago like new cups and deal is right on. Guest - 11 months ago People are dying around the world ( terrorist attack, hunger, diseases...etc) & the hypocrite 'Christians' are fussing about 'CUPS' & 'anti-gay marriages' JBeiber (L4 Member) - 11 months ago Thank you.Time to get a starbucks now. Dark Stitch (L9 Corporal) - 11 months ago I love how all of the negative comments are almost always a 'Guest'... It's nice to hide, isn't it. Anyways, I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but Starbucks coffee isn't the best, and it's not that bad. If you don't like it, go away! You want to b*tch and whine? Go see your mom or dad so they can tell you to go away. Jeez. Have religious problems, etc? Go to your local church and stay there, pray that your religious entity can help you be a normal human. DraKKaR169 (L13 Sergeant) - 11 months ago Seems they have a 5 minute leeway when I was in line at 4:55pm. Ordered drinks for me and my family at 5:02 and by the time the guy after me ordered, it was 5:05 and the Barista told him it was over. Guest - 11 months ago I do not support the liberal, Obama kissing rubbish at this corporation called Starbucks. Guest - 11 months ago I would like to get one~ Guest - 11 months ago And for the guy complaining about having 'religion specific' drinks? Really? You're a little bit racist, huh? Because everything should be segregated, right? Dumbass. Guest - 11 months ago Starbucks at NO POINT IN TIME said they are against guns. No RELIABLE record of it. And if you support the defunding of planned parenthood, then you are AGAINST women getting health exams that normally they can not afford. Planned parenthood does ALOT MORE than abortions you know. Seriously, expand you narrow ass minds a little bit. Guest - 11 months ago Go to an anti-gun and Planned Parenthood contributor? No thanks.The cups do not matter to me...their morals (or lack of) do. Guest - 11 months ago Starbucks, yea no thanks. Give me a Timmies or Dunkin coffee. pacfolly (Freebie Lover) - 11 months ago Draw whatever you want on your cup and worry about things that are more important and not a marketing distraction. I hope you can mix and match drinks, though. I want to try two with my gift card even though not many of the holiday beverages sound all that tasty. GpD (L9 Corporal) - 11 months ago Religious extremists are so ridiculous! The clamor people are creating over their outrage of this 'holiday' cup is downright entertainment! It is so bizarre that I honestly feel like living in some sort of absurd movie. Anyway, I thought this comic would be appropriate, and oh so funny, for this post! Anyhow seems the Holiday drinks are too sweet for me. Guest - 11 months ago I'm not upset about Christmas cups. I refuse to give them any money because they're against Americans having the right to protect themselves (anti-gun) and they give money to butcher babies at Planned Parenthood. Now THOSE are values worth fighting for. Printed cups...get a life.Oh yeah, and their over-roasted, burnt-tasting, overpriced coffee takes like crap too. Guest - 11 months ago This may be a shock to Christians but there are religions older than Christianity, which is just an offshoot of the Eastern religions. Jesus went to India and copied almost every aspect of their doctrines except for the part about reincarnation. I applaud Starbucks for being sensitive to everyone's preferences! Guest - 11 months ago Those who are offended because Starbucks didn't put Christmas theme on the cup can just boycott them. Next year if they decide to put Christmas theme, those who are offended by it can boycott them.For me it is about economics: I will not spend $5 for one cup of Starbucks Coffee because I don't feel it is worth $5. If I get two cups for $5, I am in for it. jihiggs (L10 Corporal) - 11 months ago for crying out loud shut up about the damn christmas cups! your religion is not the picture on a cup, if this upsets you so much, you are nothing but a poser. if you actually look, you will find things star bucks supports that is far more offensive to christians than a damn cup. but no, you dont really care, you just want to look pious. Guest - 11 months ago craigminah, you people just can't get it thru your thick skulls that there are millions of people who do not celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah. Moron. Guest - 11 months ago Its origin can be traced to an ancient Roman Pagan celebration called Saturnalia. It was a commemoration of the dedication of a temple to the God Saturn. Saturnalia was originally celebrated as a one day celebration on DEC-17. It became so popular that it was expanded to seven days. This celebration was picked up by the followers of Mithraism where it became the Feast of Sol Invicta, (the Unconquered Sun). It started on DEC-25 of the year 274 CE. Guest - 11 months ago Spoofee is it really 'BURLEE?' Guest - 11 months ago OMG, the cup design is horrid and so pagan! LOL craigminah (L6 Recruit) - 11 months ago Until they make this a Christmas or Hanukkah beverage and not a generic 'holiday' beverage, Starbucks is dead to me. Guest - 11 months ago Maybe they are trying to get rid of the red cups. :) Spoofee (Spoofee.com!) - 1 year ago No, this is only good until 11/16 Guest - 1 year ago I think you meant that the deal is good until 12/16/14, not November. Guest - 1 year ago Have fun waiting in the long line, and if your lucky like me I had no option but to wait in the drive through line once i was sandwiched in. Peppermint coffee was delicious but not sure if the coffee was worth the 23 minute wait.Probably wont do that again and just pay regular price. Guest - 1 year ago Just got mine, GREAT DEAL!

But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols.\nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.",

But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.

      "text": "November 10, 2016 Starbucks 2016 Red Cups: Creators Mention ‘Christmas’ As Buy One Holiday Drink, Get One Free Promotion Launches Paula Mooney \nStarbucks took no chances with controversy that has fallen upon Starbucks in the past over the company’s holiday cups, as reported by the Inquisitr . Instead, for 2016, Starbucks used designs from Starbucks customers, who doodled on Starbucks cups and created amazing art. McDonald’s Nativity Scene ‘His Name Is Jesus’ Gets 107,000 Facebook Likes [Photo] – https://t.co/oFoqkT3GOY https://t.co/rjiwPPXBgx \n— Gerard Spicer (@SpicerGerard) December 22, 2015 \nLast December Starbucks let customers create their own designs for Starbucks cups and share them on Instagram, as reported by Starbucks . The very popular promotion saw Starbucks being flooded with more than 1,200 designs. In the end, Starbucks went with 13 designs on Starbucks cups — most of them white ink set against the red background of a Starbucks cup for their 2016 holiday season . \nStarbucks also gave a shout out to those artists from all over the world, but not a link to their Instagram accounts. With the announcement of the new 2016 Starbucks holiday cup designs, Starbucks also announced their new “buy one holiday drink, get one free to share” promotion. It runs from November 10 through November 14 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. \nAs seen in the top photo above, the new 2016 Starbucks holiday red cups are on display in Starbucks stores, like one pictured in New York. The new Starbucks cups contain snow on bare trees, snowflakes, Christmas lights, reindeer, candy canes and more. The Starbucks holiday coffee cups from 2015 caused controversy, after a pastor claimed that Starbucks was launching a so-called war on Christmas. We crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/x418dfjFeu \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \nAlong with all the white ink on red cup designs, Starbucks also chose a design from an artist from Los Angeles, who drew a wreath around the Starbucks logo for Starbucks cold beverage cups. Starbucks even saw fit to mention Christmas and the Christmas spirit via a couple of the comments made by artists who created the designs. \nAs for the buy-one, get-one free event, Starbucks has dubbed that their #ShareEvent on social media. But what Starbucks drinks fall under the free promotion? \nAccording to KTVU , Starbucks holiday drinks like Peppermint Mocha, Caramel Brulee Latte, Eggnog Latte, Gingerbread Latte, and Chestnut Praline Latte are a part of that promotion. [Image by Joseph Pisani/AP Images] \nThe notes that folks who are members of the Starbucks Rewards™ program get an extra hour to share the buy-one, get-one free promotion, until 6 p.m. — instead of the promotion ending at 5 p.m. for those folks. \nTherefore, while Starbucks fans can’t pop into a Starbucks store in the morning to take advantage of the promotion, they can get their late afternoon and early evening fix of caffeine and sweet stuff in order to bolster their spirits and the bottom line of Starbucks from November 10 through November 14 — and check out the new red cup designs in the process. [Image by Joseph Pisani/AP Images] \nStarbucks also didn’t shy away from the controversy that has consumed the nation with the recent presidential election. \nIn a company release titled “A Message from Howard Schultz: Onward Together,” posted to the Starbucks website on November 9, the Starbucks Chairman and CEO provided his thoughts about President-elect Trump. A portion of those thoughts are quoted below. \n“Last night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned. We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. As Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. \n“We can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion.” \n[Featured Image by Joseph Pisani/AP Images]",

Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY , KSDK 4:37 AM. CST November 10, 2016 Starbucks new line of red cups. (Photo: Starbucks) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nNEW YORK -- It might not sound like that big of a deal, but Starbucks has rolled out the latest edition of what has become a tradition -- its holiday cup designs. \nDon't look now, but the holidays are almost upon us. And one way to tell, besides colder days and holiday decorations going, will be the colorful cups. Starbucks is bringing them on in a bid to spread some holiday cheer and to ring up sales. \nStarting Thursday. the Seattle-based coffee giant will begin serving its beverages in one of 13 “distinct cups” created by artists from around the world. \nPaper cups aren't usually the kind of thing that instill customer loyalty, but Starbucks has learned the hard way. When the company came out with its green pre-holiday cup last week, the Internet was outraged. Thinking it was a replacement for the famous red cup, users took to Twitter to voice their complaints. The uproar even made it into a segment on CBS' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \n\"The holidays don't start until you've had your first red cup at Starbucks, \" says Nancy Poznoff, Starbuck's vice president of marketing \nThe new cups are a twist on Starbucks usual red cup holiday design which feature a red background behind the Starbucks logo. \nAfter last year’s red cups inspired customers to draw on them, the company launched an Instagram campaign looking to encourage people to share their work with the world. In just eight days 1,200 designs poured in from 13 different countries. The company took 13 submissions and made them into this year’s cup collection, company officials say. The cups will be offered in all 25,000 Starbucks locations around the world. \nIn addition to releasing the red cups on Thursday, the company will also be launching its annual \"buy one, share one\" promotion where those that buy a drink between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. will get a second one free. The promotion will run through Monday. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.\nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who’ve made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades.\nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\nStarbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain.\nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed.\n“It’s just a cup,” he joked.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.\n",

      "text": "If you’re ready to get out of election mode and into the holiday spirit , Starbucks is here to help, ushering in the return of their annual red cups on Thursday.\nAnd if last year’s minimalist design had you feeling Grinchy (or, like certain factions of our society, downright outraged ), the coffee chain has done a complete 180 — serving up seasonal beverages in brand new, ornately decorated cups. While we had previously reported on a leaked photo of the new design , it turns out this was just one of 13 different versions available, each curated by a different artist from across the country.\nScroll down to get a peek at some of the new cups, which feature undeniably Christmas-themed decorations like reindeer, candy canes, poinsettias, Chrismas trees, and ornaments.\nRELATED: The Best Drinks to Order from the Starbucks Secret Menu \nStarbucks \n \nStarbucks Starbucks \nRELATED: Starbucks Is Finally Adding This Highly-Requested Item to the Menu \n\nThe new cups are, indeed, a response to the backlash the company received during the previous holiday season.\n“[Last year], we introduced what we thought was a spectacular, beautiful, emblematic red cup,” Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told the crowd at a launch event on Wednesday. “Unbeknownst to us, there were a number of people who decided that Starbucks perhaps was not in the Christmas spirit and that created quite a storm […] So this year, we decided to do something quite different.”\nOur new president-elect will surely be thrilled by the latest development on this pressing national issue.",

      "text": "Starbucks Customers Create Holiday Cup Designs November 10, 2016 7:20 AM Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter NEW YORK (AP) – Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who’ve made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. “It’s just a cup,” he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups. (© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

While we had previously reported on a leaked photo of the new design , it turns out this was just one of 13 different versions available, each curated by a different artist from across the country. \nScroll down to get a peek at some of the new cups, which feature undeniably Christmas-themed decorations like reindeer, candy canes, poinsettias, Chrismas trees, and ornaments.",

Related News/Archive Apple shifts design of stores to lure newcomers and sell more to existing customers 5 Months Ago \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997.

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades.\nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain.\nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed.\n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

      "text": "Share \nTo most Americans, the news earlier this week that that Japan’s i-mode service will cease to exist won’t cause much of a stir. Looking at the name of the product alone, we imagine that the average consumer might wonder if Apple is pulling the plug on something or other. \nBut i-mode is not an Apple product — though it did arguably teach Apple a valuable lesson or two, but more on that in a moment — and never quite got big traction anywhere outside of Japan, which is why its passing may not be much mourned. \nBut the announcement out of Japanese mobile maker NTT DOCOMO that it will stop selling mobile phones that operate with its i-mode internet service by the end of this year (minus a handful of phones for elderly users) due to the increased difficulties in creating the actual hardware stunned a number of mobile payments veterans who remember a time when everyone wanted to be *just like* i-mode. They were regarded as the pinnacle of mobile payments and mobile phones. \nSo what made i-mode so special? \nAhead Of Its Time And Contemporaries \nIf one jumps in the wayback machine and parks it at the turn of the millennium, the gears were already turning in innovators’ heads about making mobile about more than a device that could make phone calls and send SMS messages. While there were myriad ideas about how to connect increasingly ubiquitous devices in people’s pockets to the web, in the East and the West two roughly parallel but different approaches emerged. \nIn Japan, that was all i-mode all the time, launched by NTT DoCoMo. Instead of creating a proprietary language for mobile sites — aka WAP — i-mode used a proprietary technology that made it possible for simple sites to work on devices built on top of the i-mode platform. \nSaid simply — users could do more with i-mode powered phones webwise than they could do with their wireless web enabled counterparts in the U.S. Part of that was smart design, but part of it was smart business. \nChanging The Revenue Model — And Courting Developers \nI-mode not only built a better mobile web experience – it gave app developers a reason to get on board. Part of that was a better revenue sharing agreement. Before their service launched, mobile purchases were only really possible with carrier billing — i.e. users bought the good or service and the charge for it appeared on their phone bill. \nI-mode introduced a revenue-share business model and built a content charging mechanism right into its service. This meant that content providers could easily monitise their services (sports scores, weather, games, ticket booking, etc.) as it was consumed. \nI-mode also made a concerted effort to court developers and introduced the world to the idea that mobile devices + developers = more functionality valued by consumers. That was a lesson it took the rest of the mobile world nearly ten years to catch on to. \nThe Rest Of The Week In Mobile \nPayPal And Siri Play Nice \nComing soon to an iPhone or iPad running iOS near you is the abilty to tell Siri to make a payment with PayPal. According to some late night blogging, PayPal users running said OS will be able to make payments merely by commanding Siri to do it for them. According to PayPal, users can now send and request money via a voice command with Siri in 30 countries. \nApple Pay Hits The Web \nOne month in, Apple Pay on the web is in the top 5 online payments technologies. That figure comes care of SimilarTech, whose data tracks 30 billion webpages each month. According to their numbers, Apple Pay is the 5th most popular payment platform used by the top 10,000 websites. PayPal was #1 by a pretty large margin. We don’t know from “popular” but we did produce a report on “Buy Button” penetration on the top 1000 web sites just last month. Of the five we looked at – PayPal is on nearly 70 percent, Amazon on 10 percent and the rest trail with sub-5 percent penetration. Check out The PYMNTS report on Mobile Buy Buttons here. \nStarbucks, Still Killing It At Mobile \nAnother round of earnings figures out last week confirmed that Starbucks remains much, much better at mobile payments than just about anyone else. According to the most recent figures out, mobile payments now account for a quarter 25 pecent of all transactions processed at Starbucks locations nationwide. Also succeeding are Mobile Order and Pay transactions representing which are now 6 percent of Starbucks’ total transactions and rising. As of September 2016 that figure had ticked up to 7 percent . \n“Approximately 3,300 of our stores are handling 10% of their orders at peak through Mobile Order and Pay,” COO Kevin Johnson told investors during the coffee chain’s Q4 earnings call. “In 600 stores, Mobile Order and Pay represents over 20% of orders at peak, triple the number from last year.” \nImpressive. \nShell Pays At The Pump (With PayPal) \nShell and PayPal are teaming up to eliminate having conumsers get out of their cars to pay for fuel. Coming soon , drivers will drive up to pumps and select the kind of gas as well as pump location using the Shell mobile app and a QR code on the pump itself. \nOnce the payment is processed, a receipt will be sent to the phone to confirm the purchase — and to prevent people from making off with a full tank of gas at no charge. \nThe technology was successfully trialed by both companies in 2013, while PayPal has already established a strong mobile payments process in the United Kingdom. \nMobile Payments At The POS- Smoking, But Still No Fire Study Says \nThe good news for mobile payments peeps — the tidal wave of wallets and “Fill In The Blank Pays” has pushed mobile payments at the physical POS into double digit growth territory that is set to double year over year. \nThe not so good news? \nStill not dealing with a majority of consumers yet — and probably won’t be a for a while. According to the latest data out of eMarketer, 38.4 million Americans 14 and over will have used their mobile phones to pay at the point of sale at least once in the preceding six months in 2016. That’s just 19.4% of US smartphone users. We’ve been tracking Apple Pay Adoption now for two years, and if anything, it’s plauteaued at something like only 1 in 20 consumers using Apple Pay in stores when they have the opportunity to use it.",

      "text": "Associated Press photo\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — It looks like development at a busy Northeast Heights intersection might get a caffeine jumpstart.\nStarbucks is seeking city approval to build a new drive-through cafe at the northwest corner of Montgomery and Wyoming, according to City of Albuquerque records . The cafe chain has plans for a 2,200-square-foot, 40-seat cafe north of the existing Wells Fargo, according to documents submitted to the city.\nIts request for a site development plan for building permit is scheduled to go before the city’s Environmental Planning Commission later this week.\nAside from the bank and a McDonald’s, the corner has gone largely undeveloped, even though a City Planning Department report shows it has had its existing commercial zoning since 1977.\nBut owners have begun taking steps to add to the site, getting EPC approval earlier this year to subdivide the remaining 6.75 acres into five pad sites.\nStarbucks already has more than 40 locations throughout the metro area, including those in Targets and other retail stores.\n ",

Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

Some are bold and graphic while others evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned storybook,” the news release said. “Together the collection expresses the shared spirit of the season.” \nFor their annual , participating Starbucks locations are offering free holiday drinks with the purchase of a holiday drink Nov. 10-14 from 2-5 p.m. Rewards members can take advantage of an extra hour for the promotion, until 6 p.m. \nSo far, people are excited about the new line of #RedCups: &mdash; Kellie Jahncke (@kjahncke) November 10, 2016 it&#39;s that time of year again #RedCups pic.twitter.com/Pq98l75CbZ &mdash; jess (@earthtojessx) November 10, 2016 Things that make me smile.

Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

      "text": "This Year's Starbucks Red Cups Are Festive AF So let’s all try to get along share Starbucks/Official Each November, it’s not a chill in the air or a changing of the leaves or a sale on winter coats that signals the start to the holiday season: It’s the first sighting of Starbucks’ red cup . A tradition that goes back 19 years, Starbucks’ holiday cups are beloved by Starbucks fans across the country. They are collected , they are fought over, they spark controversy , and yet, they are but a utilitarian object, a vehicle for caffeine intake, meant to be disposed. And today, November 10, 2016 — a full day after America elected its 45th president — this year’s red cups are here. So as to appease previous years’ upsets about the cups being not “festive” or “Christmas-y” enough, this year’s official red holiday cups are, yes, red — that green cup was just there to throw us off — and feature a variety of wintery designs including snowflakes, snowy tree scenes, reindeer, ornaments, and Christmas tree lights. President-elect Donald Trump, who famously threatened to boycott Starbucks over its cup design last year because it was not festive enough, can take heart in knowing that at least at Starbucks, Christmas is alive and well. There shall be no mention of Hanukkah or “happy holidays” or any other December holiday at Starbucks, people — it’s Christmas or bust. A major departure from years’ past, this year’s Starbucks red cup is actually a collection: 13 different designs appear on the cups, so, like Pokémon, get ready to catch ‘em all. Starbucks/Official Why 13 different cups? All year round Starbucks’ customers like doodling on Starbucks’ white cups. Starbucks once even held a cup design contest . So this year, in looking for the right holiday design — and looking to appease a mad populace — the marketing team crowdsourced its red cup design. Last year’s controversial, plain red ombre cup was the basis for this design challenge. When people began posting their cup designs on social media last December, Starbucks took note. “We were surprised and inspired by the amount of incredible art submitted by our customers. The designs were beautiful, expressive and engaging,” Dena Blevins, creative director, Starbucks Global Creative Studio said in a release. “We quickly realized there was potential to use the customer-created art for our holiday cups.” Blevins did not say, “and we figured if the design came from the people, they couldn’t get mad at us.” 1,200 designs were submitted on Instagram in 13 different countries; Starbucks’ marketing team picked 13 designs from six countries. The designs appear on this year’s red cups, which will be used at over 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries. Starbucks global chief marketing officer Sharon Rothstein wrote in a release, “We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers.” She did not add, “Please don’t hate us this year.”",

The cups were created by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year and feature images including candy canes, ornaments and snowflakes, among other things. (Q13) \nStarbucks\nWe crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \n\nSome of Nashville’s biggest names are helping give back to a wounded warrior. Guitars signed by Brad Paisley, Darius Rucker, Dierks Bentley, Florida Georgia Line, Jason Aldean, Keith Urban, Kenny Chesney, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert, Rascal Flatts and Toby Keith were auctioned off to raise money to build a smart home for Navy Veteran Andrew Bottrell. Bottrell was deployed to Afghanistan in July 2011 with Seal Team 10. He suffered extreme injuries which led to a double leg and left arm amputation in October 2011 when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device. (Yahoo) \nBrad Pitt has officially been cleared of abuse allegations by the L.A. County Department of Children & Family Services. The case, involving an incident between Pitt and his teenage Maddox on a private jet, has now officially been closed. The DCFS determined that Brad did not commit child abuse during the argument that reportedly ended with physical contact. Angelina claimed that Brad had struck Maddox without justification and that his actions followed a pattern of misconduct. The case was investigated and no further action involving the incident will be taken. (CNN) \nA Portland-based boutique ice cream shop called Salt & Straw has created a full Thanksgiving dinner…in ice cream form. Included in its $65, five-course Thanksgiving ice cream meal are the following flavors, all containing the ingredients of the traditional Turkey Day courses: Sweet Potato Casserole with Maple Pecan Ice Cream, Buttered Mashed Potatoes & Gravy Ice Cream, Cranberry Walnut Stuffing Ice Cream, Spiced Goat Cheese & Pumpkin Pie Ice Cream, and yes, Salted Caramel Thanksgiving Turkey Ice Cream, apparently made with turkey and turkey fat.

Show Caption Previous Next \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.

Show Caption Previous Next NEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The design features a string of holiday lights wrapped around Starbucks’ bright red cup.\nMore: See All The Designs \nOther designs include images of birds and flowers, snowflakes and Christmas scenes featuring reindeer and sleighs.\nStarbucks faced some criticism last year for their stripped-down version of their iconic holiday cup, with some angered over the removal of Christmas images from the coffee staple.\nPastor and social media personality Josh Feuerstein made a video that went viral – complaining that Starbucks had removed references to Christmas on their holiday cups and instead going with a plain red design with the company’s green and white logo.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump even suggested a boycott of the brand over the design.\n“No more ‘Merry Christmas’ on Starbucks. No more,” Trump told a crowd in Springfield, Illinois. “Maybe we should boycott Starbucks. I don’t know. Seriously. I don’t care.”\nAccording to Starbucks, the new Holiday 2016 cup designs will be available in more than 25,000 locations in 75 countries worldwide.",

      "text": "November 10, 2016 by Tony Rossi Leave a Comment \nThere was a lot of hubbub over the fact that Starbucks released plain red cups for the holiday season last year, with some people (though many fewer than the controversy made it seem like) claiming they were being anti-Christian. Since Starbucks cups never included actual Christian symbols, the argument rang hollow to many. But apparently Starbucks paid attention. \nTheir new commercial for their red holiday cups points out that their customers designed various versions for 2016, including one with a Nativity scene as the below video shows. Though I’m not a regular Starbucks customer, I hope that this decision results in a more peaceful Christmas season for coffee lovers everywhere. \n(Screen capture property of Starbucks) \nStay in touch!

      "text": "Starbucks\nEveryone’s favorite part of the Christmas season is here. Starbucks has unveiled this year’s holiday cups and they are filled with plenty of holiday cheer.\nThe new red cups will feature 13 different designs, ranging from intricately-drawn snowflake and candy cane motifs to bright holiday lights. According to Starbucks , the cups feature customers’ artwork from six countries. “Their inspiration came from nature and seasonal traditions. Some are bold and graphic while others evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned storybook. Together the collection expresses the shared spirit of the season.” They were inspired to use the designs of others based on customers using last year’s plain red cup as a canvas and posting their creations on Instagram.\nThis year’s updated cup is much different than last year’s holiday cup, which sparked controversy across social media. Many people accused Starbucks of caving to political correctness and being anti-Christian, given that the word “Christmas” was nowhere to be found in the design of the cup. The word, however, has never been used on their holiday cups, rather Starbucks has used holiday imagery, such as snowmen and ornaments. Let’s hope this year’s cups have enough holiday cheer for everyone’s taste.\nTo celebrate the festive occasion, Starbucks also released a sponsored filter on Snapchat, complete with carolers and the new red cup. Take a look at some of the reactions to this year’s red cup below:\nSocial Media Reacts to Starbucks Red Holiday Cups Wow. The Starbucks Red Cups are here. That is very exciting. They are CUPS and RED! This is going to be the most wonderful of days after all\n— Katherine Timpf (@KatTimpf) November 10, 2016 \n\nSo, @Starbucks has #RedCups with winter scenes.

(KTRK) AP   10:03AM NEW YORK -- Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.In all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday.Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.The company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed.\"It's just a cup,\" he joked.For the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Related Topics:",

You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups.” In the clip posted to Twitter, they mention how the cups were created by fans all over the world. “Last year, we made the red cups. You made them the holidays. Introducing the 2016 Starbucks red cups. Created by our customers all around the world.”\nWe crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \n\nFans were, at the very least, disappointed that Starbucks only offered red cups last year. A;ready the reactions to these new designs have been overwhelmingly positive.\n@Starbucks love it!\n— Christi Yoder (@christitherula) November 10, 2016 \n@Starbucks Got mine this AM. Can't wait to see the other designs! pic.twitter.com/0eaC2oIviS \n— The Real MBsandsKU (@MBsandsKU) November 10, 2016 \n@Starbucks Got mine this morning! #warmhands#warmheart pic.twitter.com/DECbCX8jrg \n— Jennifer Zatechka (@jenzat71) November 10, 2016 \n\nWhile only 12 are shown, there is a 13th design that is meant for cold and iced drinks. Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz, said these designs are meant to create a “symbol of unity in this divided election.”\nSo what do you think? Yay or nay on the new cups? We think they look great!\nVia Us Weekly ",

      "text": "  Jessica Chasmar - The Washington Times   \nStarbucks CEO and Hillary Clinton supporter Howard Schultz wrote a letter to staff Wednesday night saying he was shocked by Donald Trump’s presidential win but hopeful that the country could unite and move forward. \n“I am stunned,” he wrote . “We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.” \nMr. Schultz, who last month predicted Mrs. Clinton would win the White House, said Americans should honor the democratic process and respect the results. \n“We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together,” he continued. “Whether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores.” \n“Today, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country,” he wrote. “Let’s take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans.” \nMr. Schultz, a self-described lifelong Democrat, endorsed Mrs. Clinton for president in September. He said during a CNN interview on Oct. 19 that he was “confident” she would win. \n“I think we are in need of civility, of unity, and the kind of authentic leadership that will unite the country, and what we do not need is division and vitriolic statements in which we are creating hatred or bigotry of any kind,” he said at the time.",

      "text": "Starbucks turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs Connect With Us     11:22 AM Enlarge Image Request to buy this photo Joseph Pisani | AP File Photo In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nNEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries.\n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer.\nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.”\nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them.\nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here .\nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday:\n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n",

      "text": "Here's Why Starbucks Has 13 Holiday Red Cups   (Daniel B. Kline) 52 min ago \nIn 2015, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) found itself at the center of a controversy because its holiday season red cups were perceived by some as not being \"Christmas-y\" enough. The cups were simple, red with a company logo. They lacked traditional symbols of the season (like snowflakes or Santa Claus) that previous versions had featured. \n\"In the past, we have told stories with our holiday cups designs,\" said Jeffrey Fields, Starbucks vice president of design and content, in an October 2015 press release . \"This year we wanted to usher in the holidays with a purity of design that welcomes all of our stories.\" \nThat intent was taken by some as being an assault on Christmas. Most people recognize that the coffee chain, which has long been progressive on social issues, was seeking to be inclusive, but some customers did not see it that way. A similar backlash occurred earlier this month when Starbucks released green cups designed to celebrate unity in advance of the holiday season. \nCEO Howard Schultz has never been shy about sharing his political opinions, even when they might alienate customers, but cup design is not about paying living wages, offering free college, or any of the other social issues he has championed. So, with its 2016 red cups , Starbucks has sought to offer something for everyone while making sure to celebrate Christmas along with the broader season. Starbucks has 13 holiday red cups this year. Image source: Starbucks. What did Starbucks do? \nFor 2016, Starbucks invited its customers to design its red cups. The chain said that in the eight days it asked for submissions via Instagram, it received 1,200 individual submissions from 13 countries. It selected 13 winners after consulting customers via social media and has rolled out all the designs in the more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries. \nSome of the cups feature winter symbols while others have more traditional nods to Christmas. This is Starbucks blatantly trying to avoid controversy. \"Should we just go back to last year and come out with a great red cup ... and perhaps start another firestorm?\" Schultz said during an event revealing the cups. \"We didn't think that was such a good idea.\" This is a smart play \nIn the current charged political climate in the United States, Starbucks and its CEO will have plenty of opportunities to antagonize customers over political and social issues. That could be Schultz speaking out on health insurance or his having issues with the wages paid by other businesses. Holiday drink cups are simply not a place to court controversy, which was never the chain's intent when it went with the blank canvas design last year. \n\"We hope that this year's red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,\" said Global Chief Marketing Officer Sharon Rothstein in a press release. \nWith these red cups, the coffee chain will hopefully have pleased as many people as it can. That's the right play for shareholders, customers, and its employees. There will be places for Schultz to make statements, but he was smart to recognize that this was an area where appeasement is the right play. \nFind out why Starbucks is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now \nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market. (In fact, the newsletter they run, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market!*) \nTom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now. Starbucks is on the list -but there are nine others you may be overlooking. \n*Stock Advisor returns as of November 7, 2016 \nDaniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.
