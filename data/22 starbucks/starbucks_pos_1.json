      "text": "A Project Wing aircraft lowering a package to the ground during recent testing. (Via Project Wing) If you wanted a Starbucks latte with your drone-delivered Chipotle burrito, it appears you’re going to have to wait a while as a new report says that the Seattle-based coffee giant and Google parent Alphabet have shelved a partnership.\nBloomberg reported on Tuesday that the “brakes are being tapped” on Project Wing, part of Alphabet’s X research lab, due to a tightening of budgets across the company.\nProject Wing won FAA approval in September to begin test deliveries of Chipotle Mexican Grill items on the campus of Virginia Tech. The company said at the time that it was looking to test operational scenarios in real-world conditions.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Alphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee chain. A former X employee said disagreements about access to customer data that Alphabet wanted led to a nixing of the joint effort.\nThe report further states that hiring was frozen at Wing following the departure of project head Dave Vos in October.\n“Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world,” a spokeswoman for X told Bloomberg. “What we’re doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems.”",

      "text": "Starbucks brings back traditional holiday cups this season   JOSEPH PISANI   4:57   Joseph Pisani   Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

      "text": "The Starbucks red holiday cup designs are here, and they are gorgeous Just what we need today — some holiday cheer. Starbucks is bringing back its red holiday cups , and they’re unlike any we’ve seen in past years. The mega coffee chain debuted not just one of the 2016 holiday cups today, but 13 brand new red cups designs.\nStarbucks has been bringing in the holidays with special red cups since 1997. Throughout the years, designs have ranged from “modern, using whimsical brushstrokes in bold colors, to the nostalgic, featuring mistletoe and ornaments,” Starbucks noted in a press release .\nLast year, the company faced major backlash when it came out with classic red cups that many complained weren’t “Christmas-y” enough. People protested in outrage on social media about the basic cup. But ultimately, they either dealt with the red cups or they bought their coffee elsewhere. Shrug.\nWe’re pretty sure Starbucks didn’t feel that loss. During the reveal of the new cups today in New York City, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz joked about the controversy.\n“Should we just go back to last year and come out with a great red cup… and perhaps start another firestorm?” Schultz said. “We didn’t think that was such a good idea.” Instead, they decided to use inspiration from customers! The 13 new cups are all inspired from actual photos that customers posted of designs they drew on the blank red cups last year (see, the red cups DID have a purpose).\nStarbucks “We were surprised and inspired by the amount of incredible art submitted by our customers. The designs were beautiful, expressive and engaging,” said Dena Blevins, creative director of Starbucks Global Creative Studio. “We quickly realized there was potential to use the customer-created art for our holiday cups.” \nStarbucks So they rounded up their favorite designs and asked those customers to mail in their cups to be evaluated for possible use. They chose the 13 designs from six countries to represent the spirit of the holidays around the world. Their designs will be showcased on the holiday cups served in the more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries.\nStarbucks “People will be walking around the street in Shanghai, New York and London carrying these cups,” Blevins said. “We love that this year our customers’ artistry can play a part in brightening someone’s day.” Starbucks will start serving beverages in the holiday cups starting Thursday, and that means the HOLIDAYS ARE BASICALLY HERE!\nThe post The Starbucks red holiday cup designs are here, and they are gorgeous appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year, people. \nYes, I’m referring to the holiday season, but I’m also referring to the time of year when Starbucks finally reveals their festive red cups to get you in the holiday spirit once and for all. \nFor months, people wondered whether or not Starbucks was going to hand out their traditional red cups this year. \nWell, today I’m here to tell you that you no longer have to sit around and obsessively ponder such a thing — because THEY ARE! \nThis holiday season, Starbucks will be providing a variety of red cups. According to Cosmopolitan, there will be 13 new red cups in total . \nThat’s A WHOLE LOT, but any basic Starbucks-obsessed person would definitely agree that it’s completely and utterly necessary to our well-being. \nTwevle of the new, red cups will be served with hot drinks and the 13th cup will be used for cold drinks. \nSo, how exactly did 13 cup designs come up? Let’s just say a few artists handed over some really good artwork at the #RedCupContest in 2015 in a big way. \nAre your eyes ready to behold these 13 glorious, new cups that will be heading to a Starbucks near you? 1. “Deer”",

      "text": "Signs of the holidays unmistakable on new Starbucks red cups Cups feature 13 seasonal illustrations created by customers Author: By Jill Disis Starbucks via CNN NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - \nRed cups are back at Starbucks -- and they're looking a lot more like Christmas this year. Related Content Lock her up? Maybe not so much, Giuliani and Christie say \nThe coffee company introduced its new holiday cups in stores Thursday morning. They feature 13 seasonal illustrations created by customers from six countries. \nAmong them are classic holiday images like reindeer, ornaments and snow-covered landscapes, marking a return to a more traditional and overtly Christmas-inspired promotion. Last year's red cups drew controversy for abandoning seasonal designs in favor of a simple, two-toned red cup. \nStarbucks said at the time that it wanted a \"purity of design that welcomes all of our stories.\" Critics called it a declaration of war on Christmas. \nThe new designs were culled from more than 1,000 submissions Starbucks received last December when it asked customers to share designs on Instagram. \nStarbucks says it asked a small group of customers to mail in their cup so they could be reviewed for potential production. \nThe return of the red cup has been rumored for more than a week, after fans began noticing boxes at Starbucks stores labeled \"no peeking\" until Thursday. \nStarbucks didn't comment on its red cup plans at the time, and instead unveiled a pre-election, limited edition green \"unity\" cup that CEO Howard Schultz called \"a reminder of our shared values\" during a \"divisive time in our country.\" \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

And while Christmas may have 12 days, Starbucks goes one better, offering 13 different cups, each with its own cheery design. \nThe coffee chain’s holiday cup is eagerly awaited every year, but last year’s plain, red-ombre design took a lot of heat. And it was the same angry customers who thought Starbucks was declaring a war on Christmas that inadvertently produced this year’s bounty.

      "text": "\nThere’s no denying that Americans love their coffee. Just count the number of Starbucks you drive by on your way to work, and you can see how that is true. But many of these fancy coffee drinks people buy are created with very basic machines. Sure, there are temperature controls and other standard features, but we can control the temperature of our homes from our smartphones when we are halfway around the world, so that really isn’t a feat.\nBut what if our desires for technology mingled with our love of coffee? Would we be able to achieve our ideal brew with laser-like precision? Or could we simply enjoy a fresh mug coffee without burning the roof of our mouths?\nWell, lucky for us, coffee and tech have become excellent friends. Here is just a sample of the more interesting developments in coffee-tech, including one still in development.\nIf you have dreams of replacing your water faucets with freshly brewed coffee, your dream has come true. The Scanomat TopBrewer presents in an elegant steel tap that can be added to any tabletop surface, including kitchen counters. Not only can this wonder machine create a excellent coffee, but the Scanomat TopBrewer also features the smallest milk foamer in the world . That means you can also get your favorite specialty drinks on demand.\nIdeas are not the only thing flowing at #WORKTECH16 ! We've got fresh coffee on tap! Join us in the breaks to discover the #internetofcoffee pic.twitter.com/kTw3DkaGKj \n— TopBrewer UK (@ScanomatUK) November 10, 2016 \n\nTo make this even better, this brewer can connect to your smartphone. That means you can choose your drink from the app, including through a customized favorites page, and get a cup of coffee your way. This includes freshly ground beans, the ability to adjust for your preferred amount of foam, and options for achieving your ideal temperature.\nThis brewer also handles more than coffee, for those looking for a more well-rounded product. You can also get chilled drinking water, hot water for tea or hot cocoa, and cold milk. You can even get steam on demand, for whatever you may use that for.\nThe Brugo (pronounced Brew Go) lets every sip of coffee be at your best temperature, even if it is freshly out of the machine. The cup features multiple chambers to ensure an ideal coffee experience. First, the coffee is poured into the main chamber, similar to any other double-walled or insulated mug. Next, you simply tip the cup away from you for a few seconds to automatically move a small portion of the coffee into a Temperature Control Chamber. Lightly swirl the cup and devour a cooler sip immediately. Once the main coffee chamber cools to a desirable temperature, you can bypass the cooling chamber and sip directly from the cup.\n@Laura_Hardingx : Having a try of my new @brugo_uk commuting will never be the same again. #brugo #purple #coffee pic.twitter.com/UI0gcpAF \n— Laura Harding (@Laura_Hardingx) January 24, 2013 \n\nWhile this doesn’t involve high-powered tech, they certainly scienced the heck out of this to find a way to enjoy fresh coffee without burning your tongue. Simply brew your cup of coffee using the science of coffee extraction to achieve your optimal flavor, and enjoy immediately. No burned tongue required.\nNow for the tech that you can’t have yet: the Bonaverde IoT Coffee Machine . Not only can this high-tech gadget grind and brew a stellar cup of joe, but it can also roast its own beans. Bean pouches feature beans from specific farmers. Each pouch has a RFID tag that tells the IoT Coffee Machine the ideal way to roast the included beans for an optimal experience.\nFinally my first coffee out of the @coffeechangers #bonaverde machine #futurefood pic.twitter.com/wVGzGjQC35 \n— konrad lauten (@konratz) October 28, 2016 \n\nOnce the roasting is complete, the high-allow steel cone grinder takes over. It features precise specifications to produce a consistent grind every time. A rain shower brewing head ensures that grounds are wet evenly for the perfect flavor extraction, letting you experience the true flavor of each coffee to its full glory.\n[Featured image by AP Photo/Ted S.

      "text": "Will Starbucks’ new holiday red cup be controversy-free this year? November 11, 2016 Unlike last year, the cups are distinctly seasonal, with graphic designs of snowflakes, Christmas ornaments, reindeer and sleighs. \nFor Starbucks fans, the unofficial start of the holiday season has arrived. \nOn Thursday, Starbucks stores around the world began serving coffees and lattes in the 2017 edition of their holiday red cups. This year, coffee and tea drinkers will take sips from a range of 13 distinct cups, each designed by a Starbucks customer from around the world. \nAnticipation for this year’s holiday red cup is particularly high, following a spate of controversies involving their political green cup released earlier this month, and last year’s holiday edition which angered some consumers. \nWhen Starbucks released its minimalist red, white and green cup last year, devoid of Christmas images — notably Christmas trees and decorations — some Christian consumers called the cup a “war on Christmas” and a larger war on Christianity in America. \nThe same was said of the chain’s green cups which were introduced earlier this month before the US election. \nThe limited-edition cups represented coffee farmers, baristas, family and friends and were drawn in one continuous stroke to represent unity during a divisive time. \nBut the good intentions backfired with some consumers blasting the company for wading into politics. Others, mistakenly believing the green cups had replaced the traditional holiday cups, resurrected the accusation that Starbucks was waging “war on Christmas.” \nMeanwhile, this year’s cups were a year in the making. Last year, Starbucks invited consumers to share and submit cup designs on Instagram. More than 1,200 designs were shared from 13 countries including the US, Indonesia, Canada and Dubai. \nUnlike last year, the cups are distinctly seasonal, with graphic designs of snowflakes, Christmas ornaments, reindeer and sleighs. \nA total of 13 designs were chosen from six countries and will be served in more than 25,000 stores in 75 countries. \nCanadian coffee and donut giant Tim Hortons also released its holiday cups this week, which turn coffee and hot chocolate drinkers into snowmen, reindeer, and toy soldiers thanks to cheeky designs that feature the bottom half of wintry characters. \n-AFP Relaxnews",

The chain is so ubiquitous, it's almost like having an outsourced pantry staple available within a 5-mile radius (or a few city blocks) all day. \nYou can always count on it for coffee, tea and some tasty bites to fuel you up in the morning or to tide you over until lunch or dinner. But if we can count on Starbucks to be \"there\" for us, what are the most nutritious options among so many different beverages, mini-meals and snacks? Starbucks makes it easy for us, especially when it comes to deciding what to drink. One of the most appealing aspects of Starbucks' menu is that you can customize your beverage to your liking. To order even a simple drink at Starbucks is to participate in some level of customization, when you take into account the size, temperature (hot or iced) and fat content of the milk. We really like this level of personalization, considering we all have different nutritional needs and preferences. JUST WATCHED Healthy fast food switches that will surprise you Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nHealthy fast food switches that will surprise you 01:22 When it comes to calories in Starbucks beverages, the count varies greatly. The lowest-calorie options at Starbucks include unsweetened coffee and tea. For example, a tall (12 ounce) brewed coffee has 5 calories, and the same size brewed tea has zero calories. The same size nonfat cappuccino has only 60 calories, mostly from the milk. Read More In general, if you want to enjoy some sweetness in your beverage but don't want to over-consume calories, you can ask for less syrup (i.e. fewer \"pumps\": Most hot espresso beverages contain three, four and five pumps of syrup for tall, grande and Venti, respectively). Even better, order your beverage \"skinny,\" which means it will be made with nonfat milk and sugar-free syrup and without whipped cream. For example, a grande (16 ounce) vanilla latte with whole milk has 290 calories and 11 grams of fat (6 grams saturated). But the skinny version, with nonfat milk and sugar-free syrup, has 120 calories and 0 grams of fat. Other lighter cold beverages include a tall Teavana Shaken Iced Passion Tango tea or an iced coffee, which are lightly sweetened and contain only 60 calories (both have zero calories if you omit the sweetener). Dunkin' Donuts' menu, as curated by a nutritionist Finally, if you are not willing to part with syrups or whipped cream -- or full-fat milk, for that matter -- choose the smallest size. A Venti (24 ounce) mocha Frappuccino containing whole milk, whipped cream, syrup and mocha sauce contains 520 calories and 10 grams, or about half a day's worth of saturated fat. But the mini size (10 ounce) version contains 190 calories and 4 grams of saturated fat. Still not dietetic, but significantly skinnier. Though you can customize a beverage to your liking at Starbucks, the same does not hold true for the chain's food. You can ask a barista to take something off of a sandwich -- bacon, for example -- and bagels and oatmeal are customizable with toppings and spreads. But that's about it when it comes to personalizing meals and snacks. Aside from breakfast foods and bakery items, Starbucks offers salad bowls; bistro boxes that contain fewer than 500 calories and are suited for different palates; and yogurt parfaits, which have fewer than 300 calories and provide 13 to 14 grams of protein. And it is trying to help. The chain reduced sodium by 20% for all breakfast sandwiches; however, some still have a lot fewer milligrams than others. And by the end of 2017, the company claims that all beverages will be free of artificial flavors. It is also committed to reducing average added sugar in some of the more indulgent beverages by 25% by the end of 2020. Here are the best Starbucks options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu. We break it down by our picks for kids, athletes, drivers, vegetarians and vegans, as well as low-calorie, low-sugar, low-salt, gluten-free and low-carb options. For kids Our picks: Breakfast: Egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich Lunch: PB&J on wheat bistro box Snack: Chocolate cake pop Beverage: Vanilla crème with nonfat milk (8 ounces) or organic low-fat plain milk box (Horizon) We're not surprised to see that there is no specific children's menu at Starbucks. After all, kids generally don't go to Starbucks to eat -- or to consume coffee, for that matter. But if you find yourself needing a caffeine boost with kids in tow, there are some nutritious, kid-friendly options to consider, and they don't include items from the bakery section. We really like the egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich and the PB&J on wheat bistro box, which has apple slices, string cheese and veggies with Greek yogurt dip. (We don't think kids will mind the chocolate-covered raisins, either). If your child is craving a sweet treat, the chocolate cake pop will be sure to please, and it won't top the calorie charts. When it comes to kid-friendly beverages, on a cold day, consider a vanilla crème with nonfat milk in lieu of hot chocolate. An 8-ounce cup has fewer calories (100) and more calcium (25%) than the same size nonfat hot chocolate without whipped cream, which has 140 calories and 20% calcium. We also like the organic low-fat milk boxes from the ready to drink cooler section of the store. For vegetarians Our picks: Breakfast: Strawberry Greek yogurt parfait, or egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich Lunch: Roasted tomato and mozzarella panini Beverage: Café latte with soy milk (12 ounces) or unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk (16 ounces) Vegetarians can choose from a variety of protein-rich options at Starbucks. The Evolution Fresh Greek yogurt parfaits and the egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich each have 14 grams of protein and provide 15% of your daily calcium needs. For lunch, we like the tasty roasted tomato and mozzarella panini with spinach and pesto. We would recommend the cheese and fruit bistro box too, since it's so portable, but it does contain about half a day's worth of saturated fat, from the cheese (10 grams). Pair any of the above with a tall (12 ounce) caffé latte with soy milk, which delivers 7 grams of protein and a third of your daily calcium needs. In warmer weather, an unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk will keep you cool. Note that you need to specify \"unsweetened\" iced coffee: A standard tall iced coffee contains three pumps of simple syrup; most syrups contain about 20 to 25 calories per pump. If you want some sweetness without extra sugar calories, you can ask for just one pump or sugar-free syrup instead. For vegans Our picks: Breakfast: Hearty blueberry oatmeal or multigrain bagel Lunch: Hearty veggie and brown rice salad bowl Snack: Hippeas far out fajita Beverage: Caffé Misto with soy milk (12 ounces) or unsweetened iced coffee with coconut milk (12 ounces) Chipotle's menu, as curated by a nutritionist When it comes to options for vegans, the hearty blueberry oatmeal tops our list. It provides 5 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber, which helps slow the post-meal rise in blood sugar, contributing to sustained energy throughout the morning. We are also impressed with the multigrain bagel, with 17 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber from ingredients including oats, flax and sunflower seeds. For comparison, Starbucks' plain bagel has 9 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. However, you will have to enjoy your bagel sans spreads, as there are no dairy-free spreads available to pair it with. The chain is testing an avocado spread in two markets, but it's not available nationwide just yet. For lunch, we highly recommend the hearty veggie and brown rice salad bowl, a fiber and antioxidant-rich medley with butternut squash, beets, kale, broccoli and roasted tomatoes. If you avoid honey, skip the lemon-tahini dressing. If you are in the mood for a snack, try \"hippeas\": protein-rich chickpea puffs that are certified vegan. To sip, a Caffé Misto with steamed soy milk will keep you warm in the winter. In summertime, an iced coffee with coconut milk is low in saturated fat and contributes 80 calories; however, save 60 calories by ordering it unsweetened. Note that while foods may be free of ingredients of animal origin, the chain is cautious about calling foods \"vegan\" unless they are packaged and \"certified vegan,\" as foods are subject to cross contamination. For calorie counters Our picks: Breakfast: Classic whole-grain oatmeal or reduced-fat turkey bacon and cage-free egg white breakfast sandwich Lunch: Zesty chicken and black bean salad bowl Beverage: Nonfat cappuccino (12 ounces) or unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk (12 ounces) If you are looking to shed pounds and are keeping a close eye on calories, you can't go wrong with choosing the classic whole-grain oatmeal. Without any toppings, it has 160 calories, 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of filling fiber. We recommend adding a bit of dried fruit to boost sweetness. The reduced-fat turkey bacon and cage-free egg white breakfast sandwich with reduced-fat white cheddar cheese is also a filling, calorie-controlled option, with 16 grams of protein and only 230 calories. Panera Bread's menu, as curated by a nutritionist For lunch, the zesty chicken and black bean salad bowl is under 400 calories and offers a satisfying combination of protein and carbs, but we particularly like the fact that it has 8 grams of fiber, which fills you up without providing additional calories, as well as some appetite-suppressing spice from its chili vinaigrette. When it comes to beverages, the lowest-calorie options at Starbucks include unsweetened coffee (5 calories for a tall, or 12 ounces) and tea (zero calories, even for unsweetened Iced Passion Tango tea). Additionally, a tall café Americano has only 10 calories. It also depends how strictly you are watching calories. If you are on a 1,400- or 1,600-calorie diet, we understand you might prefer to eat your calories instead of drink them. However, if you have a little more wiggle room, a tall nonfat cappuccino has only 60 calories and delivers 20% of your daily calcium needs. Additionally, a tall iced coffee with nonfat milk that is lightly sweetened (with 3 pumps of syrup) has 80 calories, but if you order it with one pump of syrup, the count goes down to 35 calories. The unsweetened version is the lowest, at only 20 calories. And if you enjoy a flavored latte, order it \"skinny,\" which means it will be made with nonfat milk and sugar-free syrup (the \"skinny\" definition also implies no whipped cream, where appropriate). For the sugar-sensitive Our picks: Breakfast: Reduced-fat turkey bacon and cage-free egg white breakfast sandwich or classic whole-grain oatmeal Lunch: Roasted tomato and mozzarella panini Beverage: Café Americano (12 ounces) or unsweetened Teavana Shaken Iced Passion Tango tea (16 ounces) The first step in slashing sugar calories at Starbucks is to skip over the bakery items, Venti (20-ounce) flavored lattes and Frappuccinos. The next step is to check out the hot breakfast menu, which offers some of the lowest-sugar options at the chain, such as the egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich, with 2 grams of sugar, and the reduced-fat turkey bacon sandwich, with 3 grams of sugar. The classic whole-grain oatmeal has zero grams of sugar without any toppings, but you might want to add some dried fruit or nuts, which are optional. There are many low-sugar options for lunch at Starbucks, but the sodium levels are too high for our comfort level. We recommend the tomato and mozzarella panini, which has only 3 grams of sugar. Pair it with unsweetened coffee, espresso or tea to keep sugar grams at a minimum. And when it comes to sweet drinks without extra sugar calories, choose \"skinny\" or light versions of your favorites. For the salt-sensitive Our picks: Breakfast or lunch (mini-meal): Fresh blueberries and honey Greek yogurt parfait Snack: Seasonal harvest fruit blend Beverage: Café latte with nonfat milk (16 ounces) or iced skinny flavored latte (16 ounces) If you are looking for a mini-meal and watching salt intake, Starbucks' Greek yogurt parfaits come in tasty blueberry, strawberry and dark sweet cherry combinations and are by far the lowest-sodium menu items at the chain, ranging from 65 to 75 milligrams per parfait. We especially like the blueberry and honey parfait, as the blue fruit is loaded with anthocyanins, which protect against aging. The yogurt is also rich in potassium, which can help to blunt the blood pressure-raising effects of sodium. The classic whole-grain and hearty blueberry oatmeals are also low-sodium breakfast options, with 125 milligrams each. When it comes to lunch, there is nothing on the Starbucks sandwich, panini and salad menu that is under 600 milligrams of sodium, and bistro boxes range from 460 to 830 milligrams of sodium, so the yogurt parfait is still the best option if you are closely watching sodium intake. For a snack, the seasonal harvest fruit blend is sodium-free and is a healthful add-on to any meal, as it contributes antioxidants and fiber, for only 90 calories. To sip, we like the grande (16-ounce) nonfat latte, as it offers almost half of our daily calcium needs and adds even more potassium to the meal. An iced skinny latte is a sweet, calcium-rich option during warmer months. For the gluten-sensitive Our picks: Breakfast: Hearty blueberry oatmeal or strawberry Greek yogurt parfait Lunch: Hearty veggie brown rice and salad bowl Snack: Kale chips, zesty nacho Beverage: Nonfat latte macchiato (12 ounces) or iced café latte with nonfat milk (16 ounces) You won't find much success if you are specifically looking for \"gluten-free\" items at Starbucks. The only gluten-free-labeled product we could find is a gluten-free marshmallow dream bar. There is no dedicated section for allergen information on the company's website, so you have to navigate carefully if you are allergic to gluten, or wheat or milk, for that matter. Starbucks cautiously maintains that its food is handled in an open environment and is subject to cross-contamination. However, some meals such as the hearty blueberry or classic whole-grain oatmeal, Greek strawberry yogurt parfait, or hearty veggie brown rice and salad bowl are nutritious options that do not have gluten-containing ingredients. Additionally, if you are avoiding gluten, you won't be surprised to learn that the chain's scones, cakes and muffins are off-limits. But you can enjoy a bag of zesty nacho kale chips, which have 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber to keep you satisfied. Since gluten is generally not an issue when it comes to beverages (that is, except for the java chip Frappuccino, which contains cookie crumbs), we decided to list some of our favorites, such as the nonfat latte macchiato and the nonfat iced café latte, for their bone-building calcium. For the athlete Our picks: Breakfast: Spinach, feta and cage-free egg white breakfast wrap or hearty blueberry oatmeal Lunch: Egg salad sandwich Beverage: Organic low-fat chocolate milk box (Horizon) or strawberry smoothie with non-fat milk (16 ounces) Starbucks' spinach, feta and cage-free egg white breakfast wrap offers 19 grams of protein, which is a welcome dose for weight lifters, and has plenty of carbs to fuel a light cardio workout. Athletes can also fuel up with the hearty blueberry oatmeal. For lunch, we like the protein and iron-rich egg salad sandwich. The sandwich delivers 42 grams of carbs, which is especially beneficial post-workout. When it comes to a post-workout beverage, the choice depends on the intensity and duration of the workout. For a low-intensity workout, like a brisk walk, Pilates or yoga, water is fine. For a morning jog, low-fat chocolate milk offers adequate carbs and protein, along with electrolytes lost in sweat, like sodium and potassium. If you are training for a marathon, feel free to grab Starbucks' strawberry smoothie, which provides a generous amount of carbohydrates to replenish muscle glycogen stores, as well as 16 grams of protein, which provides amino acids for muscle building and repair. For the road warrior Our picks: Breakfast: Ham and cheese savory foldover Lunch: Protein bistro box Snack: Kind bar, blueberry vanilla and cashew Beverage: Café latte with nonfat milk (12 ounces) or cool lime Starbucks Refreshers beverage (12 ounces) If you are on the road, our guess is that you might want to grab a quick bite from Starbucks' bakery counter. If that's the case, consider the ham and cheese savory foldover. Unlike many of the chain's bakery items, this croissant has fewer than 300 calories and offers 13 grams of protein, which will satisfy you for a morning road trip. We are also pleased to see it has less than 500 milligrams of sodium). For lunch, we like the protein bistro box that is packed with easy-to-nibble foods including a hard-boiled egg, apple slices, cheddar cheese, muesli bread and peanut butter. For long drives, grab a Kind bar, which will come in handy when hunger pangs begin to distract. For a road trip on a hot summer day, a tall lime Starbucks Refresher is a welcome treat: It has a third of the calories of a typical lemonade and is lightly caffeinated with green coffee extract to keep you alert on the road. For the carb-conscious Our picks: Breakfast: Protein bistro box (minus the muesli bread and grapes) Lunch: Protein bistro box (minus the muesli bread and grapes) Snack: Squirrel Black truffle almonds Beverage: Caffé Misto with nonfat milk (12 ounces) or iced café Americano (16 ounces) If you're on a low-carb diet, Starbucks is not going to be at the top of the list for a bite to eat. The lowest-carb foods we could find on its food nutrition menu is the Frappuccino cookie straw, at 14 grams, and the petite vanilla bean scone, with 18 grams of carbs. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter .\nSo your best bet is to get the protein bistro box with a hard-boiled egg, cheddar cheese and peanut butter. Feel free to enjoy some apple slices too, but the muesli bread won't make the low-carb cut. If you subtract both the bread and grapes from the meal, the carb count goes down from 37 grams to 11 grams. For a low-carb snack, heart-healthy almonds are available, though if you are watching calories too, stick to a half portion, as a full serving contains 270 calories. When it comes to drinks, keep in mind that any beverage containing milk will include carbs from naturally occurring lactose, and we encourage you to include milk in your morning beverage to get an that calcium boost. A tall (12-ounce) Caffé Misto with steamed nonfat milk has only 8 grams of carbs and delivers 20% of your daily calcium needs. If you are looking for a low-carb beverage without milk, a café Americano (hot or iced) will satisfy. You can add a pump of sugar-free syrup and whipped cream without making a dent in the carb content, though in that case, we recommend a tall size, as doing so boosts calories and saturated fat.",

      "text": "The grain size of a coffee grind plays a key role in the taste. (Credit: Starbucks) One coffee drinker’s perfect brew may be another drinker’s battery acid, but mathematicians say they’re zeroing in on the equations behind the taste of drip coffee.\nThe University of Limerick’s Kevin Moroney and his colleagues lay out the state of the art in the SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics . The findings could well spark a buzz in coffee-crazy Seattle, the birthplace of Starbucks.\n“Our model describes flow and extraction in a coffee bed, specifies extraction mechanisms in terms of the coffee grain properties, and compares the model’s performance with experiment,” Moroney said in a news release from the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.\nOne of the conclusions can be boiled down to a simple rule: If the coffee tastes too watery, grind the beans more finely. If it tastes too bitter, go with a coarser grind.\nA co-author of the research paper, University of Portsmouth mathematician William Lee, says he sets his coffee grinder on the largest setting.\n“The grains are a bit larger than you get in the standard grind, which makes the coffee less bitter,” he told the BBC . “Partly because it’s adjusting that trade-off between the stuff coming out of the surface and stuff coming out of the interior.”\nResearchers Kevin Moroney and William Lee measure coffee concentration using a refractometer. (Credit: University of Portsmouth) In a follow-up email, Lee told GeekWire that the findings suggest a French-style coffee press might result in a more refined brew, “in that you have more control over the length of time the coffee spends in contact with the water.”\n“Of course, the advantage of a drip filter is that it requires very little human intervention to brew coffee – something I appreciate very much early in the morning,” he wrote.\nLee said the next challenge is to study the effect of different drip methods. Is it better to pour the hot water into the center of the brewing chamber, or sprinkle it in like a shower? Are there factors that distinguish a flatbed coffeemaker from the conical variety?\n“These are next on our ‘to investigate’ list,” Lee said. “We know for sure that they are important, since a single jet can deform the coffee bed by excavating the center. Our plans are to use equations developed in the context of river bed erosion to investigate this.”\nWho knew the science of brewing coffee could be so complicated? It’s enough to drive a person to drink … tea .\nIn addition to Moroney and Lee, the authors of “Asymptotic Analysis of the Dominant Mechanisms in the Coffee Extraction Process” include Stephen O’Brien, Freek Suijver and Johan Marra.

      "text": "Tweet \nThis was no pre-Christmas cup; just a wonderful way to show we’re all connected. \nOn November 1, Starbucks released a teaser to their annual “Red Holiday Cups” that was neither red nor holiday-y enough for some of the coffee chain’s diehard fans. Instead, it was a pine green cup with dozens of people drawn together in one continuous line. Immediately, Starbucks was met with protest online for not featuring winter nor Christmas on their cup, a complaint that has been lodged with the company in years past. Turns out, they’ve never featured Christmas on their Red Holiday Cups and the new green version had little to do with the red one. So what was the story behind this new design? \nTurns out the talented individual is Shogo Ota, a Japanese artist who has been living in the U.S. since moving there for college almost 14 years ago. It couldn’t have been easy deciding to go to school in the States, especially after failing to be accepted to numerous Japanese art colleges and not being able to speak a word of English. But Ota wanted to fulfill his mother’s dreams, and was able to attend college in Idaho to continue his art. \nHis hard work gained him a canvas on one of the most popular coffee chains in the world. There are plenty of people who are drawn on the cup, but some of the faces you’ll find on there include his family and the multitude of people he’s met in Idaho and Seattle, where he’s now based. As Ota says, “People should feel everybody is equal and happy together; that sounds peaceful to me.” This seems like a great message as we come to the end of this year, and a perfect goal to continue to aim for in 2017. \nShogo Ota not only has a life story to inspire the next generation of English learners in Japan, but also a message to all of us to continue to work hard. If you liked the Green Cup, be sure to check out Ota’s website, Tireman Studio , where he shares his other product designs. ",

Image: Bill Woodard New Kensington’s virtual tour provides preview of campus Social media channels give activities updates November 16, 2016 New Kensington’s virtual tour provides preview of campus \nNEW KENSINGTON, Pa. — Prior to visiting the campus in person, prospective students can access  ’s interactive virtual tour or the social media dashboard to get a feel for the campus via a home computer or mobile app. \nThe online tour also highlights campus students, facilities and activities. After previewing the campus, future Penn Staters can use the navigation buttons to schedule a visit or apply online. The tour is available in English, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese. \nUsers can explore different areas of the 72-acre campus using four tour options — walking, panoramic view, videos and photos. The guided walking tour starts at the Lion Shrine and continues to 19 other campus hot spots, including the Junction Coffee Bar, Art Gallery, Computer Center, Forum Theatre, Conference Center, Café 780 and Athletics Center, Biomedical Engineering Technology (BET) and Radiological Sciences (RadSci) classrooms and labs. \nThe panoramic tour provides 360-degree views of campus facilities. The Academic and Student Success Center, Elisabeth S. Blissell Library, and Nittany Highland Apartments are among the 21 campus venues. The virtual tour features students, faculty and staff and highlights the quality of academic programs and the variety of student extracurricular activities. \nA gallery of 50 photos features the Café 780 court yard, the iconic arch that overlooks the campus entrance off state Route 780 and the Larry R. Pollock Fountain. \nPenn State students star in the video option, which extols the virtues of the campus, from bachelor’s degree programs to the 2 + 2 plan to scholarships. Students can stay at the campus for four years and earn a degree in one of 10 bachelor’s programs or start the first two years in most of Penn State’s 160 majors at New Kensington and finish at another Penn State campus. Numerous scholarships are available. For the fall 2016 semester, more than $850,000 in scholarships were awarded to campus students. To view the interactive experience, visit Virtual Tour. \nIn addition to the virtual tour, future Penn Staters stay updated on the campus through the Social media dashboard. New Kensington has eight channels — Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Google, SmugMug, and Linkedin. To join the conversation, visit Social Media Dashboard.",

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.

Show Caption Previous Next \nIt's going to cost Starbucks customers a little extra to quench their cold drink craving and satisfy their sweet tooth. \nA Starbucks spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday to the TheStreet.com that prices on select cold drinks and baked goods went up Nov. 10 without any formal announcement. Customers can expect to pay between 10 to 30 cents more at the register. \n\nThis is the second time Starbucks increased its prices this year. In July, Starbucks raised prices by up to 30 cents on certain brewed coffees, espresso and tea lattes. \nThe most recent price hike came without warning, though, and some customers questioned the necessity of another cost increase so soon. \n— Sue McElligott (@SueMacArtist) November 22, 2016 #starbucks must you raise the price of cold drinks? I already feel I am getting less for my money getting cold given it's mostly water... — Lucy Sky (@PaperbackLucy) November 22, 2016 #Starbucks taught the world $5 is acceptable for a (commodity) cup of coffee. Now it will watch us line up every 6 mos for price increases. — Randall E. King (@randallking) November 22, 2016 Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "All the new Starbucks holiday menu items are making us hungry It’s that jolly time of the year when you eat turkey, see family, and dream of the Starbucks holiday menu . We couldn’t help but get excited when we saw the red snowflake-drenched holiday cup from the Starbucks camp , but now we need some grub to go along with it.\nRed cups are back. Show us your creativity by tagging your photo #RedCupContest for each week's theme. Week 1: Cozy up to Red Cups. (Three weeks, three themes.) Open to Legal residents of the 50 United States (D.C.) and Canada, 18 years or older. Enter Contest by: 12/10/16 at 11:59 p.m. PT. For Official Rules, including prize descriptions, see our link in bio. Nine $500 grand prizes up for grabs. Void where prohibited. \nA photo posted by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Nov 19, 2016 at 7:48am PST \nWell, worry on more. That red cup is about to have some company. There are some yummy new sandwiches coming up at your nearest Starbucks , like the All the Trimmings Breakfast Sandwich that includes maple-glazed ham, apple sausage, apple-sage stuffing, and a maple glaze, all shoved between a gloriously buttery bun. Don’t get too excited, though, because this one is only available in Florida, Seattle, and parts of California.\nThe other brand new sammie is the Carved Ham, Egg, and Swiss Breakfast Sandwich, which comes on a croissant, and you should have no trouble finding that around the country. If you’re looking for something more familiar, you can also get your paws on a traditional Holiday Turkey and Stuffing Panini.\nCelebrating #EarlyThanksgiving with a #TurkeyStuffingPanini... and an ever-growing list of things to be thankful for. \nA photo posted by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Nov 21, 2016 at 10:22am PST \nNow for the sweets. Expect to munch on some snowman cookies, holiday ugly sweater cookies, and the kitschy cake pops, of course. If you haven’t tried the cranberry bliss bar yet, put that on the top of your priority list, because it goes smashingly well with any of the Starbucks holiday-themed lattes .\n\"Ohh, man: you look like I feel.\" -#SnowmanCakePop \"...\" -#PeppermintBrownieCakePop Regram: @simplycutesy \nA photo posted by Starbucks Coffee ☕ (@starbucks) on Nov 20, 2016 at 12:47pm PST \nBetter hurry up, because you don’t want to wait for ages in line only to find out your favorite Starbucks holiday snacks have already been gobbled up.\nThe post All the new Starbucks holiday menu items are making us hungry appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

Which is all to say: Nestle announcing it has a new, healthier form of sugar on the way for 2018 is an enormous deal .\nThe full details of this “super sugar” (our name, let’s make it a thing) are currently under wraps, as Nestle is seeking to patent it. The basic science, however, is simple enough. Your typical sugar crystal is a dense lattice, and when you eat it, your body breaks it down and sends the sugars spiraling around your system. Simple sugars, like the sucrose in your sugar bowl, break down quickly, while more complex ones, like from whole grains and veggies, take a longer time to get broken up and shipped out. Nestle claims to have rebuilt the sugar into a different shape that has fewer sugars; the claim is that it’s more of a hollow globe. So, when you eat it, the sugar is still there to trigger your taste receptors, but you’re consuming less chemical energy overall, and thus there’s less actual sugar hitting your system. It’s basically a sugar-based reverse Trojan Horse (the molecule is empty, which is a good thing). \nNestle doesn’t claim to have the magical sugary bullet, however. It’s not going to work to sweeten liquids such as coffee or soda, and sweet drinks are, by far, the most likely source of added sugar in the average diet . However, it does claim that the sugar in its candy and baked goods will descrease by up to 40%. \nThat would, for example, reduce the sugar in your typical Butterfinger from 24 grams to about 15.\nNetflix\n\n\nOf course, we’ve all heard the claims about magic reformulations before, such as the notorious Olestra and its “anal leakage.” Still, Nestle’s basic science seems to hold up, and if nothing else, it illustrates it’s taking the idea of sugar as a public health problem seriously, which is half the battle for health advocates. Here’s hoping Nestle can deliver on its promises come 2018.\n(via The New York Times )\nNew Line Cinema\n",

The move is a nod to the company's growing reputation for innovation: It introduced the world's first successful mobile-payment service, beating out the likes of Apple and Google, and gets an increasingly large portion of its revenue from that source.\nSchultz will keep the role of executive chair at Starbucks, focusing on the rollout of its upscale Reserve brand.\n\"I'm not leaving the company,\" Schultz, 63, said after the change was announced Thursday. \"But Kevin and the team are in charge.\"\nJohnson, who joined the board in 2009, was tapped for the operating chief job after Troy Alstead went on sabbatical. Johnson, 56, previously worked at Microsoft and Juniper Networks. In 2008, he was named to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, where he served under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\nThe CEO change initially jarred investors even though Johnson was seen as a possible successor since he took the No. 2 job last year.\nFor many shareholders and customers, Schultz has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. And he's used the company to pursue social causes — occasionally clumsily — such as racial strife and sustainability.\nSchultz will focus on expanding Starbucks' Reserve Roasteries, a chain of massive coffee houses that provide tastings and other experiences, as well as new Reserve retail stores. The executive has been working to position the Reserve name as Starbucks' new higher-end brand. Schultz also will continue the company's \"social impact\" efforts.\nAs CEO, he's already pushed to open stores in low-income areas and supported gay marriage. It hasn't always gone smoothly. Schultz's idea for employees to discuss race relations with customers was criticized as ham-fisted.\nInvestors weren't anticipating Schultz's departure as CEO so soon, though having both executives focus on different parts of the company could have benefits, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus.\n\"The timing of this is a surprise,\" she said. \"I do think the 'divide and conquer' strategy is probably good for the company long-term.\"\nStarbucks' digital and technology prowess has put it ahead of its peers, allowing it to serve more customers faster. Same-store sales rose five per cent in the Americas region in the most recent quarter. Mobile payments accounted for about 25 per cent of U.S. transactions in that period.\nStarbucks built on its tech leadership with an order-ahead feature, which lets customers select and pay for drinks in advance. They then can pick up the beverages at a shop without waiting in line.\nSince Johnson became operating chief, Starbucks has rolled out mobile ordering across the U.S. and even tested delivery. The Seattle-based company also is boosting spending on digital ventures, including taking its app and rewards platform to countries such as China.\nThis isn't Schultz's first retirement as CEO. After serving in the job from 1987 to 2000 — punctuated by an initial public offering in 1992 — he stepped down in 2000. But Schultz returned in 2008 after Starbucks faltered. The company had opened too many locations too quickly and got hit by the financial crisis. Profit plunged.\nSchultz put Starbucks back on firmer footing.\n\"The difference between then and now couldn't be greater,\" he said on Thursday. \"In 2007-2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies and Starbucks was not immune.\"\nThe company now has the \"strongest leadership team in history,\" he said.\nIt's been speculated that Schultz might make a run for U.S. president, though he's repeatedly said he has no intention of doing so. While speaking at a conference in New York last month, Schultz said he wouldn't serve as part of president-elect Donald Trump's cabinet. He also denied rumours of running for president last year in a New York Times opinion piece.\nIt's probably too early to tell if Schultz has designs on the White House, Bartashus said.\n\"Certainly if he is interested in a political career, he has the next 2 ½ years to sow those seeds,\" she said. \"A lot will depend on the first half of the Trump administration.\"\nBloomberg",

According to a \"Barista Need-To-Know\" memo, a majority of stores will in fact become PokéStops or gyms. What can players expect? For one, users visiting participating Starbucks will get the Pokémon Go Frappuccino Blended Beverage. It's actually more than just an in-game item, it will be available on the menu as a real drink as the event goes on. No details yet as to what flavors or ingredients are in the drink.\nExpect the cross-promotion to roll out on December 8.\nPhoto via Imgur.com\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Does Starbucks Have a Good Credit Score? 11 hrs ago ( … ) \nCoffee lovers tend to pledge strong loyalties to their favorite coffee shop, often stronger than loyalties to a professional sports. Sound familiar? Well, if this is you, could your allegiance to your favorite coffee shop be swayed by knowing how it treats its suppliers and contractors? \nWhat if you knew their business credit scores, which are a reflection on how they handle their finances and debts? If so, take a look at the scores of major coffee shops Starbucks, Peet’s, Philz, and Dunkin’ Donuts to find out which has the best business credit score. (Note: Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.) \nWhat’s a Business Credit Score? \nSimilar to personal credit, business credit scores and reports offer one way to determine the credibility of a company by looking into how it has handled debts and obligations in the past. \nAs a business makes payments on business credit cards , loans, trade accounts with suppliers, etc., those payments may be reported to various warehouses that collect business data. Business credit reporting agencies use that data to create a score, which suppliers, vendors and even business partners can look up. \nThese scores can determine a business’s ability to qualify for funding or trade terms, large work contracts, rates on insurance premiums and more. \nHow did we get our hands on these coffee giants scores? Well, here’s a wild fact: Anyone can look up a business’s credit score, any time they want, without notifying or getting permission from the business. Here are the scores (and what they mean) for the four major coffee shops we mentioned. (Note: All scores are on a 0 to 100 range and are as of Nov. 17, 2016.) \nStarbucks \nStarbucks Corp.’s business credit score was a 50, putting it in a medium risk category. The national score average is 56.8. \nThe most important factor influencing this score is payment status, which accounts for approximately 50% or more of the score. Payment status, however, works differently from that of personal credit — instead of a 30-day grace period, a payment that is even one day late can be reported on a business credit report as a slow or delinquent payment. \nThe report shows that of all the accounts listed for Starbucks, close to 30% of them have a delinquent status. Starbucks is also using 50% of its total available credit. Both the high number of delinquent accounts and the high debt usage can signal financial risk and reduce the score. \nThe report also shows that Starbucks Corp. has 361 derogatory marks, 277 of which are accounts that have been turned over to a collections agency. Derogatory marks are also likely bringing down their score. Of those collection accounts, 238 of them are listed as paid in full. More than 200 of them are from the Environmental Control Board. It’s important to know what these accounts are — they could even be duplicates or mistakes negatively affecting the score. \nThe other derogatory remarks include 60 state tax liens — tax debts that have not been paid in full — and 23 judgments, which indicate a financial obligation to pay any court-ordered damages following a lawsuit in which the business was the defendant. Both of these can hurt a business’s chances of qualifying for the best financing products and most flexible terms. \nPeet’s Coffee & Tea \nPeet’s Coffee & Tea’s credit score was a 75, putting it in a low- to medium-risk category, well above the national score average. \nOf Peet’s 56 accounts reporting, 16 of them show a delinquent status. There are seven tax liens and 12 derogatory UCC filings , as well as one account that has been turned over to a collection agency and is listed as paid in full (these can stay on business credit reports for more than six years, even if paid). \nThis score shows that Peet’s generally pays its creditors on time or just a few days late, which is usually an indication that a business is financially healthy and considered low risk. \nPhilz Coffee \nComing in hot with a score between that of Peet’s and Starbucks is Philz Coffee, with a score of 65. This score puts Philz in the same low- to medium-risk category as Peet’s. \nPhilz has a smaller number of accounts than the above competitors, with 15 accounts reporting and only one showing a delinquent status. Other factors that might be bringing down Philz score include one state tax lien, UCC filings that are listed as derogatory and even the age of the credit file. Philz has 11 years in business, according to the business credit report, while Peet’s and Starbucks each have more than 30 years. A credit file showing fewer years in business can indicate less certainty about the future of the business. \nThe payment trends section of the report shows that Philz pays its bills approximately on time or only a few days late. This is a good indicator of financial health to creditors and is likely having a positive effect on the score. \nDunkin’ Donuts \nDunkin’ Donuts’ score is a 24, which puts the business in a medium- to high-risk category. \nDunkin’ Donuts has one account that is beyond the terms of the agreement, according to the report. The report indicates that the low number of active accounts in the past 12 months could be a factor bringing down the score, as well as the multiple tax liens, derogatory UCC filings and a judgment.",
