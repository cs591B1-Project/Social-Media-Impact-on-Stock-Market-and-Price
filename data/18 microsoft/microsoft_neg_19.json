REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen/File Photo 1/2 left right The logo for LinkedIn Corporation is shown in Mountain View, California, U.S. February 6, 2013. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo 2/2 \nBRUSSELS Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion (20.8 billion pounds) bid for social network LinkedIn ( LNKD.N ), the European Commission said on Wednesday. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nThe U.S. software company is making its largest ever acquisition, which will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop) Next In Business News",

The application was created by Microsoft engineers who themselves were suffering from colour blindness. Microsoft team called “Microsoft Garage” has now launched the application for all iPhone users through Apple store. \nThe application automatically adjusts the colours so that the users suffering from colour blindness will be able to differentiate the colours easily. Microsoft claims that the application is supportive for three common types of colour blindness. Microsoft Garage Color Binoculars helps those with color blindness see the world in a new way.

However the application is only launched for IOS based iphones and not for android users and it seems that Microsoft does not intends to launch it for android users. Advertisement",

      "text": "By Boyd Chan Neowin LLC @therealboydchan · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nThis year, Microsoft has been talking up bots and how they will become increasingly important and relevant in our lives. With bots dedicated to specific tasks, like ordering pizza, handling travel bookings, or altering the time or destination of a package delivery, the capacity and availability of underlying infrastructure will become of great importance. \nAlready, the company has seen significant uptake from the developer community after releasing its Bot Framework back in March this year. While Microsoft has been thrilled with the response, it is looking to kick things up a notch with the announcement of a brand new service. \nYesterday, Microsoft announced the launch the industry's first bot-as-a-service capability, called Azure Bot Service. The service leverages the existing Bot Framework in addition to the company's popular cloud platform. \nIn her announcement , Lili Cheng, Distinguished Engineer in Microsoft's Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, said: \n\"With this cloud service, you can build, connect, deploy and manage intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking – from your app or website to text/sms, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Teams, Kik, Office 365 mail and other popular services.\" \nThe Azure Bot Service can also help developers shorten build times by incorporating Microsoft Cognitive Services into their bots, allowing them to \"hear, interpret, and interact in more human ways.\" Other services, such as Azure Search, can also be used to enhance bots with additional capabilities. Numerous out-of-the-box templates have also been provided to help kick start bot development. \nWhile it remains to be seen how popular Microsoft's bot-as-a-service offering will become, the company is playing to its ecosystem strengths, in laying the foundation for the development of scalable bot solutions.",

      "text": "\nFacing resistance to its largest-ever corporate acquisition, Microsoft has offered concessions to the EU’s antitrust agency.\nToday’s news comes via Reuters , which reports that the European Commission has announced that it has received concessions from Microsoft. It will now garner feedback from Microsoft customers and competitors before deciding on December 6 whether to accept Microsoft’s offer.\nEU antitrust regulators had previously expressed concerns about Microsoft’s planned $26 billion acquisition of the LinkedIn social network. But it has faced strong opposition from Salesforce.com, which we later learned was irked because Microsoft swooped in and purchased LinkedIn out from under it.\nBut according to LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, there was nothing nefarious about the deal with Microsoft. The software giant simply offered more money and less risk.\n“Microsoft’s offer was of greater value, an all cash offer versus stock and cash, where Salesforce would have potentially been diluted in a way where the stock that they offered to lose value, at least in the near term,” Mr. Weiner said at a recent tech conference.\nOne has to think that LinkedIn is a better fit at Microsoft as well, and it’s not hard to imagine how the firms might integrate the service into Microsoft products such as Office 365 and Outlook.\nSponsored But Salesforce.com will have none of that. And as time as gone on, its complaining about Microsoft’s acquisition of LinkedIn has gotten more and more strident.\nIn early October, Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff accused Microsoft of anti-competitive behavior, and he seems to have a particular issue with Microsoft executive Scott Guthrie for some reason.\n“I’m cool with Satya [Nadella] for sure, but some of his executives however, I am not cool with because they have made some very aggressive statements about what they are going to be doing with this LinkedIn data,” Mr. Benioff said in early October. “It’s amazing what they have said. And they are doing things that are absolutely anti-competitive.”\nBenioff’s complaints about Mr. Guthrie date back to a September public appear in which the Microsoft executive reportedly spoke of “bundling” LinkedIn data, an act Benioffs says is anti-competitive. But Guthrie was simply speaking about integrating LinkedIn with Dynamics, its in-house CRM solution. That doesn’t just make sense, it’s why Microsoft is seeking to purchase LinkedIn.\nUltimately, the Salesforce.com complaints may simply come down fears of Microsoft stepping further and further into what it perceives as its market. And while Microsoft’s ability to integrate popular products and services is a notable strength, it is not in any way anti-competitive. So by November, Benioff had moved to a new tactic, stating that despite the veneer of newness at the software giant, they are simply engaging in familiar, old-school business practices that violate antitrust laws.\nSponsored “The new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft,” he said. “And little things … started stacking up and we put it all together. I don’t feel like this is exactly the new Microsoft that we were looking for.”\nThe EU seems curiously open to this message and has locked into the notion of “unique data,” suggesting that LinkedIn’s data may be so important that Microsoft should be forced to share it with competitors. But it’s not clear yet whether Microsoft’s concessions address this concern. Or whether this concern is anything more than hot air, for that matter.\nThe post Microsoft Offers EU Concessions on LinkedIn Purchase appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "Microsoft teams up with Musk’s $1 billion OpenAI project Microsoft teams up with Musk’s $1 billion OpenAI project Microsoft has teamed up with OpenAI, a non-profit AI research organisation co-founded by Elon Musk, to democratise AI. By: IANS | San Francisco | Updated: November 16, 2016 1:28 pm OpenAI is the billion project co-founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. \nIn a move to “democratise” artificial intelligence (AI) and making it accessible to everyone, Microsoft has teamed up with OpenAI, a non-profit AI research organisation co-founded by Elon Musk. OpenAI is the $1 billion project co-founded by Tesla CEO Musk, US-based startup incubator “Y Combinator” President Sam Altman and others. As part of the partnership, OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud platform to help advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud. \n“OpenAI chose Microsoft due to our deep learning research and ongoing commitment to AI, along with Azure’s support for open source technologies and its unique combination of high performance computing, big data and intelligence capabilities,” Harry Shum, Executive Vice President, Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, posted on its website on Wednesday. \nOpenAI is an early adopter of “Azure N-Series Virtual Machines”, which will be generally available starting in December. These virtual machines are designed for the most intensive compute workloads, including deep learning, simulations, rendering and the training of neural networks. They also enable high-end visualisation capabilities to allow for workstation and streaming scenarios by utilising the “NVIDIA GRID” in Azure. \n“In addition to OpenAI, other companies like Esri and Jellyfish Pictures are already using Azure N-Series,” Shum said. Microsoft also announced to introduce the Azure Bot Service, a first of its kind in the industry. \nWith this new service, developers can accelerate the development of bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework and easily deploy and manage them in a serverless environment on Azure. “Running on Azure Functions, these bots can scale on demand and you only pay for the resources your bots consume. “Azure Functions, which is available today, can be used to maximise development agility and operational efficiency of nearly any app or service at lower cost,” Shum further posted. \nRead: Microsoft powers Cheyenne datacentre with solar energy \nMore than 50,000 developers are already building bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Thanks to cloud computing power, more advanced algorithms and the availability of massive amounts of data, the AI field has exploded — allowing computer scientists to create technology many of us only dreamed about just a few years ago.",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft’s Photos app has just updated across all supported Windows 10 devices and has received some rather significant changes. The most obvious change is the user interface which has been completely revamped with a newer, fresher look. The text and image spacing is much better than before though using the mouse wheel will now zoom in and out on an image instead of scrolling through an album and this may frustrate some users. Users can now also view an image in fullscreen without resorting to a slideshow as needed to be done before. Windows 10 Photos app \nThe Photos app has also been given a cleaner editing process with new filters and is significantly easier to use than before. The biggest new addition to the Photos app though is support for Windows Ink . With this update, not only can users draw on their photos on Windows 10 devices (with mouse, pen, and touch) but the actual drawing or writing process is recorded and can be played back anytime afterwards as long as a copy of the image is saved afterwards. \nHave you had a play with the new Photos app yet on your Windows 10 device? Let us know your favorite (or least favorite) change  ",

      "title": "15 Best Xbox Games As Gaming Console Turns 15",
      "text": "11/16/16 AT 4:39 AM Close \nThe first Xbox gaming console was released by Microsoft in North America on Nov. 15, 2001, bringing competition to Sony’s PlayStation and a new line of steady revenue for the Redmond, Washington, company. And as the console, over its subsequent versions, turns 15, the company shared some data about its history. \nThere are over 222 million players on the gaming network, who have so far collectively logged over 100 billion hours of gaming, of which about 29 billion hours were spent on multiplayer games. \nBut what are these games that players have been spending so much time on? Here’s a list of 15 of the most popular Xbox games of all time (in no specific order, or so we think). \n1. Forza Motorsport — The racing game has already inspired six titles in the original, as well as three titles of the related Forza Horizon series. The original, launched in 2005, is often considered Microsoft’s match for Sony’s Gran Turismo. Only, with those realistic physics, it is even better. \n2. Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction — Luckily for Microsoft, game maker Pandemic split from EA Sports and set up shop with LucasArts to bring to virtual life the open world of destruction set in North Korea. What better thrill than to shoot down a helicopter from the sky? Leveling whole buildings. \n3. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time — Ubisoft did a great job bringing the old 2D game to a 3D world with excellent art design and game mechanics. Along with the refreshing game-play, it also brought together multiple game genres in a love story. Bonus points for that. \n4. Burnout 3: Takedown — In stark contrast to the realism of Forza, this game was all about high-octane racing that led to spectacular crashes, making it an instant hit with gamers who liked a touch of violence in their races. For Criterion Games, it was third time lucky. \n5. The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind — The first truly open-world RPG came with its share of bugs but that didn’t stop the game from being maddeningly huge and equally addictive. With a literally endless world, hundreds of quests and multiple ways of completing them, Bethesda gave us a very good reason to murder elves with a stolen wooden spoon: just because you wanted to. \n6. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas — The first GTA title to appear on the Xbox, San Andreas was an instant hit, what with its ridiculous plotline and even more ridiculous stunts. Using an Uzi for a drive-by while cycling down the hood? Rockstar did well to get the over-the-top excesses out of the system before the relatively polite GTA 4 followed. \n7. Jade Empire — One of the first games on the console that had different endings based on in-game choices players made, it was also the first BioWare game that was based on an original universe, created as a blend of Chinese myth and kung fu films. \nBonnie Ross, head of 343 Industries, speaks during a presentation of the game \"Halo\" at the Xbox E3 Media Briefing at the University of Southern California's Galen Center in Los Angeles, June 9, 2014. Photo: REUTERS/Kevork Djansezian \n8. The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay — Vin Diesel notwithstanding, the film doesn’t hold a candle to the game. The sci-fi prison-break drama developed by Starbreeze packs brutal action and Diesel’s great voice acting make the game one of the best on the Xbox to this day. \n9. Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell — There was a plethora of Splinter Cell titles on the Xbox, and it is hard to pick the best among those. But if we had to pick, Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory would have to be the top two. \n10. Psychonauts — Another of those games on the list that isn’t inherently violent, the game from Double Fine Productions is truly fine. The game-play is clever and the dialogue funny. It requires more brains than button-smashing to work your way through the levels, and the laughter it produces adds to the intellectual satisfaction. \n11. Ninja Gaiden — Developed by Team Ninja, the game and its expansion, Ninja Gaiden Black, were both insanely difficult from the word go. But then again, what kind of ninja are you to expect things to be easy? The action with legendary moves is mind-blowing and the graphics are a thing of beauty.

Beyond Good and Evil — Not heavy on traditional action, this action-adventure by Ubisoft makes a camera the most important weapon in its storyline. It also stars a woman of color as an “activist” heroine. Massive conspiracies and cute chimera-type characters (with comical powers) make for a game-play that just can’t be put into a box. \n13. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic — BioWare’s success of Jade Empire rests on the gargantuan shoulders of the Knights of the Old Republic. With the legions of fans, the \"Star Wars\" title could have done well without being very good but the game’s storyline was brilliant, full of twists and turns, and the game-play incorporated lightsabers and the Force. Only the original \"Star Wars\" films are better. \n14. Halo — The first smash hit to come out of the Microsoft stable, the sci-fi first person shooter was everything the company could hope for, and then some. The game by Bungie Studios single-handedly made the Xbox a phenomenon in the first couple of years of its existence. Apart from the shooting and explosions, the game also featured excellent graphics, music and sound effects. \n15. Halo 2 — Three years after Halo, its successor did what many wanted but few expected it could: it bettered the Halo experience. The game-play is improved, the story gets more complex and morally ambiguous, the weapons are bigger and badder, and the graphics are breathtaking. It cemented the place of the Halo franchise as one of the most enduring ones of all time.

      "text": "Tweet Published: 6:10 PM, November 16, 2016 \nBRUSSELS - Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nU.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said.

      "text": "Microsoft has just released preview patches for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 which interested users and administrators can download for preview testing before they are pushed out via Windows Update on the second Tuesday of December.\nThe company changed how updates are made available for Windows 7 and 8.1 systems recently; it switched from releasing individual updates for issues to so-called rollups which include all patches released for a given month.\nA complete rollup image, called Security Monthly Quality Rollup, is made available via Windows Update. This update includes security and non-security updates for Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. A security-only rollup image, called Security Monthly Quality Rollup, is not made available on Windows Update but only via direct downloads, for instance from the Microsoft Update Catalog website.\nPreviews are released on every third Tuesday of the month. The preview images are only available for the Security Monthly Quality Rollup patches, and available on Microsoft's Update Catalog and on Windows Update. The patches are tagged as optional on Windows Update though which means that they won't be installed automatically.\nNote that only the non-security part of the update is provided as a preview.\nMicrosoft publishes December 2016 Patch Previews \nKB3197869 -- November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1\nThis update includes improvements and fixes that were a part of Monthly Rollup KB3197868 (released November 8, 2016). This update also includes these new quality improvements and is a preview of the next Monthly Rollup update. Key changes include:\nAddressed issue where event logging fails to log the IP addresses of incoming Remote Desktop Protocol calls. Made updates to support the deprecation of SHA1 server authentication certificates where applications can opt in to the new behavior. Updated Belarus’ ISO 4217 code from BYN to BYR. Addressed issue with devices that intermittently fail to shut down correctly. Addressed issue where external authentications through the Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Proxy role start failing after renewing the token signing certificate Direct Download links : Microsoft Update Catalog \nKb3197875 -- November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2\nThis update includes improvements and fixes that were a part of Monthly Rollup KB3197874 (released November 8, 2016). This update also includes these new quality improvements and is a preview of the next Monthly Rollup update. Key changes include:\nAddressed issue where updating the driver for the onboard RAID controller to a version higher than the RTM version causes all impacted servers to stop responding indefinitely Addressed issue where the Internet Information Services (IIS) W3C logging service stops working when using custom logging fields to track user requests. Addressed issue where a cluster node that has lost network connectivity doesn’t fail over properly to the partner node that has full network connectivity. On the node with full network connectivity, the cluster services shut down. Addressed issue with an error that occurs when retiring and removing a physical disk using the Cloud Platform Suite (CPS) field-replaceable unit (FRU) procedure. After replacing the disk, it fails. Improved support for networks by adding new entries to the Access Point Name (APN) database. Addressed issue where a Network File System (NFS) server crashes when a user tries to back up data files to it. The error code is “STOP 0x4E”. Addressed issue where, after enabling the Cluster Service’s IgnorePersistentStateOnStartup switch for troubleshooting, you must restart the entire cluster to exit diagnostic mode when troubleshooting is done. Addressed issue where event logging fails to log the IP addresses of incoming Remote Desktop Protocol calls. Addressed issue with a consistent five-second delay during network data transfer to a Microsoft iSCSI Initiator Server. Addressed issue where the dynamic DNS registration process often causes failures and queue buildup when a reverse lookup zone is not present. Made updates to support the deprecation of SHA1 server authentication certificates where applications can opt in to the new behavior. Addressed an issue with the domain controller running out of memory during security descriptor propagation to a very large number of Active Directory objects. Addressed issue where a disk that’s configured with the Resilient File System (ReFS) stops working when it’s under heavy loads and is using software that makes calls to a Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) I/O. Any infrastructure or components that rely on this disk will also stop working. Addressed issue where some cluster nodes become unresponsive when the Wmiprvse service fails. Updated Belarus’ ISO 4217 code from BYN to BYR. Addressed issue with the boot partition appearing in File Explorer after installing MS16-100. Addressed issue with lost access to a shared Resilient File System (ReFS) volume folder when a write operation occurs and its parent folder is being renamed concurrently. The file server (ReFS) becomes unavailable. Addressed issue with input/output errors in the Microsoft Cloud Platform Suite (CPS) when a Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) enclosure management module (EMM) malfunctions. Added a feature for Windows virtual machines called In Machine Configuration (IMC). IMC will reduce boot time by eliminating the reboot performed during specialization. Improved server’s first boot time. Addressed issue so that the In Machine Configuration (IMC) sequence number is reset after sysprep to support policy-based error handling for IMC. Addressed issue where timeout failures occur when using Microsoft Multipath I/O (MPIO.SYS) and a path temporarily fails. Addressed issue where the Remote Desktop Service gets into a deadlock during virtual channel management and can’t accept new connections. This leads to a black screen or brief window before the client disconnects.

      "text": "Microsoft Offers EU Concessions Over Its $26 Billion LinkedIn Bid Reddit \nMicrosoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn , the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the US software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week . \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by December 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. LinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion (roughly Rs. 20,353 crores) annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.\nUS rival Salesforce , which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said. \n© Thomson Reuters 2016",

      "text": "up vote 3 down vote favorite \nI am in the process of vetting Microsoft Lync Online for use within our organization. I have purchased 2 licenses for testing so far. We will only be using Lync Online Plan 2 and nothing else so we are using the Lync Basic client. \nI installed, configured, and tested the 'Active Directory® synchronization' (DirSync) software and it seems to work fine. I followed this guide as a reference. \nI am now able to log into (using AD credentials) the Microsoft Portal and download the Lync client for users that have a license associated with their account. I am not able to login using their AD credentials via the Lync Basic client. Any account I create in the 'cloud' and test works fine and I am able to login to the Lync Basic client. \nI ran the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer for Lync and everything seems fine there. I also double checked synchronization between DirSync and Lync Online and changes are coming through. \nThe users I have tested do have the correct UPN (had to change from domain.local to our actual public domain domain.ca as mentioned in this guide. ) \nThe error I am getting exactly is: \nThe username, password or domain appears to be incorrect. Ensure that you entered them correctly. If the problem continues, please contact your support team. \nI have researched this error and found a Microsoft KB ( KB2541980 - How to troubleshoot sign-in issues in Lync Online ) and I am following the troubleshooting steps here and get to part 8. I do not have AD FS running on the domain so I am lost. Do I need AD FS? The guide I followed had no mention of it and I am able to login fine on the Microsoft Portal with AD credentials so why doesn't it work with the Lync Basic client?",

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | November 16, 2016 : 7:18 PM MYT Translated by Google Translator: Translated by Google Translator: \nBRUSSELS (Nov 16): Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its US$26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn makes most of its US$3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nU.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said.

      "title": "Microsoft offers EU concessions over its US$26 bil LinkedIn bid",
      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | November 16, 2016 : 7:18 PM MYT Translated by Google Translator: Translated by Google Translator: \nBRUSSELS (Nov 16): Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its US$26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn makes most of its US$3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nU.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said.

      "text": "| Topic: Microsoft \nMicrosoft is offering EU antitrust regulators concessions in the hopes of gaining approval for its pending purchase of LinkedIn. \nThat's according to a November 16 Reuters report , which also claimed that the move occurred after \"the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week.\" \nMicrosoft announced intentions to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in June, 2016. The deal, if approved, will be Microsoft's largest acquisition to date. \nMicrosoft only submitted for EU regulatory approval its LinkedIn acquisition in mid-October , after already receiving similar approval from authorities in the U.S., Canada and Brazil. \nSalesforce CEO Mark Benioff has been agitating to get EU antitrust regulators to give the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal extra scrutiny before clearing the purchase. Salesforce also bid on LinkedIn and lost to Microsoft. \nReuters said the European Commission will rule on the Microsoft-Linkedin deal by December 6. At that time, it will either approval the deal (with said concessions) or open a full investigation regarding Microsoft's purchase. Last I heard, the EU was required to issue a decision as to whether or not it intended to explore the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal by November 22. \nMicrosoft officials recently have committed publicly to providing LinkedIn data to other companies, rather than keeping it only for Microsoft's own use. \nThe Softies also have said they believe that Microsoft and LinkedIn's data graphs are mutually complementary . Microsoft is expected to use LinkedIn's data and algorithms to bolster its Dynamics CRM/ERP line, its Office family of products and services and other parts of the company's productivity-related businesses. \nI've asked Microsoft for comment on the Reuters report, but no word back so far.

      "text": "Informed news analysis every weekday Google's cloud GPU undercuts, outperforms AWS, Microsoft Google's cloud GPU instances offer a granular, pay-by-the-minute option to attach GPUs to VMs -- and cutting-edge hardware for those who can use it More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry \nFirst came Amazon, offering GPU-powered instances in its cloud back in 2010 . Then, more recently, Microsoft Azure and IBM Softlayer each provided their versions of the same, albeit with different pricing structures and instance types. \nWho’s left? Take a guess. [ The InfoWorld review: Google's TensorFlow shines a light on deep learning . | Start here with TensorFlow . | Get a digest of the day's top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter . ] \nStarting next year, Google will offer GPU instances for both Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Machine Learning users, with GPU profiles that complement both high-end number-crunching and more modest remote workstation computation loads. \nGoogle’s plan to stand apart from the competition is to be more granular. Amazon’s machine-learning-oriented GPU instances are rented by the hour and come in a discrete instance type. Google, however, is planning to allow users to “attach up to 8 GPU dies to any non-shared-core machine,” regardless of instance type. \nEven more critical, Google’s GPU pricing will follow its existing model: by the minute, same as Google’s VMs. This isn’t about consistency alone; it also reflects how GPU-powered machine learning is actually used. If a machine learning application employs only GPUs for training, it makes sense to be able to toggle off the GPU when it’s not needed instead of changing instance types. \n“Whether you need one or dozens of instances,” says Google, “you only pay for what you use.” \nGoogle is also trying to get a leg up on the competition by providing three types of GPU, depending on your needs or application profile. The AMD FirePro S9300 x2 is meant to be used to power remote graphics workstations. For deep learning, Google has two Nvidia Tesla GPUs: the vintage 2012 K80 variety and the new, Pascal-architecture-powered P100. \nAmazon’s cloud currently offers only the K80, but the P100 provides better performance under machine learning frameworks designed to take advantage of its advanced instruction set. Likewise, the GPUs in Microsoft Azure are the older-school K80, partly because the GPU is stable and well-understood. \nGoogle’s pricing structure might make more sense when coupled with so-called serverless (“lambda”) architectures , where the application and the hardware are as decoupled from each other as possible. Machine learning applications lend themselves to implementation as microservices (ingest, train, report), and the serverless architecture was built to elevate microservices to first-class status. \nThat said, such items aren’t likely to be built on Google’s systems in great numbers yet. Google’s native lambda architecture, Google Cloud Functions, is still in alpha—but once it becomes production-ready, it’ll have at least one major, GPU-powered use case waiting for it.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan ​Meet Alice, the Microsoft Cortana-based AI chatbot who aims to make you look stylish Catalan company and Microsoft partner Bismart has used Cortana and Azure technology to create a digital assistant aimed at improving the clothes-buying process. | Topic: E-Commerce Image: Bismart \nHer name is Alice and she's designed to help you decide what clothes and accessories suit you best. \nAt the recent IoT Solutions World Congress in Barcelona, she was busy making recommendations about men's suits and women's party dresses via Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, SMS, and webchat. \nBismart, the Catalan company behind the digital assistant, is a Microsoft Worldwide Partner with a background in big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applied to marketing. With 50 employees, it expects to close the year with a turnover of €3m ($3.32m), 50 percent up on 2015. \n\"We've just opened a new office in Singapore, where we anticipate a turnover of up to €500,000 in the first year,\" says Albert Isern , CEO of the company. \nDuring his enthusiastic presentation of Alice's capabilities at the conference, he turned to his colleague Ismael Vallvé, who specializes in e-commerce and business models, for assistance with a demo. \nVallvé describes Alice as a digital assistant that can be integrated into a mirror, e-commerce, a mobile or even a small robot. \n\"Imagine a small robot assisting you when you're trying on something,\" he says. \nAlice takes advantage of Microsoft's Cortana intelligence capabilities, which allow the bot to be incorporated into customers' business applications. \n\"We could have developed an app, but users are already on Telegram, Messenger, and so on,\" Vallvé says. Read More \nBismart's artificial-intelligence algorithms do the rest. They combine the necessary data to make clothing recommendations, based on preferences, lifestyle, social profile, economic status, and purchasing history, when customer loyalty cards are involved. \nThis information is processed using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. The system also uses the SDK offered by Microsoft in its suite and the Cortana Cognitive Services for the interpretation of language. \nThis makes the interaction with the BOT look like a human conversation -- at least when it has to do with clothing. But Alice is not perfect yet and continues to misunderstand some phrases. Still, Bismart is working hard to improve it so that it can be launched in early 2017, as planned. \n\"We're in talks with several stores and working with an international retail company and a chain of aesthetic clinics for the launch,\" Bismart's Isern says. \n\"We're going to start with clothing, but actually Alice can be applied to any sector to offer better services to consumers based on their tastes and demographics,\" he adds. \n\"These predictive capabilities can help companies target their customers and be more efficient in marketing campaigns. Big data does help us to be more effective.\" \nThe company's Smart Social Home Care big-data product for healthcare and social services, which is aimed at predicting future demand, won awards in the healthcare and best innovation categories at the IoT Solutions World Congress & Technology conference. \nRichard Soley, executive director of the Industrial Internet Consortium and one of the keynote speakers at the conference, echoed this sentiment. He says his organization is already seeing the combination of IoT, AI, and machine learning in an IIC testbed project, led by Dell Technologies and Toshiba for automated building-control efficiency. \n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg. Safety and efficiency gains will lead quite quickly to new business models, new products and services that we can't even guess, in every market,\" he says. \n\"The convergence of these disruptors is fun to watch, but more fun to do, which is why the IIC builds testbeds.\" Read more from the IT Iberia blog",

      "text": "0 0 \nEvery creator likes to praise its creation, and Microsoft isn’t an exception. In its latest blog post, the company talked about the changes introduced in Windows 10 Anniversary Update , claiming that its is the most secure version of Windows ever, especially since it’s able to fight ransomware. \nRecently, Eugene Kapsersky complained that Microsoft is sabotaging third-party antivirus software by forcing users to only accept Windows Defender. In reality, the situation isn’t that bad because this application really protects PCs using real-time protection to scan everything users download or run on their computers. And thanks to cloud-based protection and faster updates, devices are more protected than ever. \nMicrosoft published a white paper titled “Ransomware Protection in Windows 10 Anniversary Update ” in which it states that computers running this new version of Windows are 58% less likely to be hit with ransomware. Rob Lefferts, director of program management, Windows Enterprise and Security, explained how Microsoft is fighting against ransomware: Six of the top 10 ransomware threats use browser, or browser-plugin-related exploits, so we made it harder for malware authors to exploit Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge. We increased detection and blocking capability in our email services, increasing the number of ransomware-related attachments being blocked. We added new technology to Windows Defender to reduce detection time to seconds, increasing our ability to respond before the infection can occur. We released Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection which can be combined with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection to make it easier for companies to investigate and respond to ransomware attacks. Combined with other significant security advances, such as Credential Guard, Windows Hello and others, we’ve made Windows 10 Anniversary Update the most secure Windows ever. \nLefferts added that Microsoft Edge is now updated and now, the browser runs Flash Player in an isolated container so if there are any threats, they are kept there. Also, Microsoft is offering better protection for email, preventing hackers from getting their hands on important data. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nAt the Windows 10 event held on October 26, Microsoft revealed several features regarding the Windows 10 Creators Update, including the newly added support for Dolby Atmos on Xbox One. The Dolby Atmos audio testing app has made it to Windows Store, adding support fir PCs, tablets and smartphones with Windows 10, and of course, Xbox One. \nThe Dolby Atmos update for Xbox One and Xbox One S will make these home media devices even more powerful, adding combined support for Blu-ray , 4K, and Atmos into a single package. What is Dolby Atmos? \nThe technology is developed by Dolby Laboratories that is based on sound objects, generally operated in cinemas, to provide a surround sound system “wraparound” during playback of movies, video or music. \nIt is a sound format used to deliver a supported soundtrack to the standard surround speakers placed either in a walled area of your house or on the ceilings of an open boundary. Dolby Atmos is devised to provide extra height to the soundscape, making the experience more riveting and multidimensional. However, you are going to need a Dolby Atmos-certified amplifier or AV receiver for a fuller experience. \nThe Dolby Atmos technology has a huge potential if we talk about future upgrades. Given the surround sound feature, if developers are considering adding extra height channels in the near future, gamers will not only hear enemies surging from the front, sides or behind, but also above their heads. \nNote that the application is only available for installation if you have the latest Windows 10 Insider build running on your PC, that is build 14965 . \nExperience up to 7.1 channels of personal surround sound from any pair of headphones from an A / V receiver, game headset, and PC That features Dolby Headphone. \nYou can get the Dolby Atmos app from the Windows Store. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Microsoft offers EU concessions over LinkedIn bid (Seeking Alpha) \nPete Najarian shared with the viewers of CNBC's Fast Money his reasons to buy Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ). \nHe explained that the tech space has sold off after the presidential election and he thinks the selloff in Microsoft is an overreaction. \nNajarian especially likes cloud segment revenue growth and margin expansion in Microsoft . He's also impressed by its cash position, which gives the company the ability to repurchase shares and pay a healthy dividend yield. \nHe bought the stock on Tuesday and he sold some calls against it. He believes it could trade higher to $65 or $70.  ",

Lots of controllers and consoles, it must be noted, more than you would've expected. Let's take a look at the pictures below. \nIn terms of consoles, it's ranging from the original Xbox to the (two) Battlefield 1 Xbox One S, including the two different Xbox 360 Slim versions and the black Xbox 360 Elite. The original Xbox controller is as huge as you'd remember, and as you might recall it was soon replaced by a smaller version especially to improve the platform's sales in Japan. \nIn case you forgot, here's a quick look at the original Xbox launch lineup: \n4x4 EVO 2",

      "text": "Sign up for our Newsletters . Daily Edition Microsoft Offers EU Concessions on Planned LinkedIn Acquisition 3:16 AM PST 11/16/2016 by Georg Szalai Courtesy of Getty Images Brussels The European Commission is expected to decide on the planned $26.2 billion deal by early December. \nMicrosoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators related to its proposed $26.2 billion acquisition of professional social networking firm LinkedIn, the European Commission said Wednesday without providing details. \nThe offer of concessions comes after EU competition officer Margrethe Vestager expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week, Reuters reported. \nThe Commission is expected to rule on the deal by Dec. 6 after gathering feedback from rivals and customers. It could accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment, Reuters said. The planned LinkedIn deal would be the software giant's largest acquisition ever. \nCritics have suggested the acquisition could hurt innovation and reduce competition, with some also expressing concern about data privacy issues. \nUnder the planned deal, LinkedIn would keep its name and independence, with Jeff Weiner continuing as CEO. \nLinkedIn was founded in 2003 and went public in 2011. This year, it aired its first-ever TV ad during the Oscar broadcast on ABC.",

      "text": "Microsoft offers EU concessions over its $26 billion LinkedIn bid By Foo Yun CheeReuters \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nU.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Alexandra Hudson) 11/16/2016 5:03 © Copyright Reuters Ltd.

(http://bit.ly/2gdxifR) \nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities. \nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years. \nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru) 11/15/2016 11:42 © Copyright Reuters Ltd.

      "text": "(credit: Microsoft)\nAt the start of this year, Brussels' antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager warned data-hoarding tech giants that she was looking at them very closely—even though she was yet to spot a \"competition problem.\" In June, Microsoft—with its planned buyout of LinkedIn —caught the eye of the Dane, who has been examining whether the £18.5 billion ($26.2 billion) deal should clear a regulatory hurdle in the 28-members-state bloc.\nOn Wednesday, a spokesperson at Vestager's office—which has been looking at the business activities of the two firms to determine whether the proposed merger could be bad for competition—confirmed to Ars that it had \"received a commitments proposal\" from Microsoft and LinkedIn.\nIt comes after Salesforce boss Marc Benioff, who had reportedly been considering a takeover of LinkedIn, before Microsoft stepped in, told Recode that he had pushed the US Federal Trade Commission to probe the proposed merger. The deal has already received regulatory clearance Stateside, however.\nRead 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "November 16, 2016 0 As we reported that , Microsoft announced a new Microsoft Authenticator app for Android, iOS, and Windows 10 Mobile. The Windows 10 Mobile app has been in beta for the past few months now it is finally coming out of beta form and available for both Windows 10 mobile and Windows 10 PC (UWP). This is the one app to quickly and securely verify your identity online, for all of your accounts. A month ago a full Windows 10 UWP version of this appeared for Fast Ring Insiders and this has now rolled out to people using production Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft Authenticator Description: \nThis app provides an extra layer of protection when you sign in, often referred to as two-step verification or multi-factor authentication. If you’ve enabled this for your work or school Microsoft accounts, you’ll get a notification from this app after trying to sign in. Just tap approve and you’re good to go. For any other account, or if you’re offline, our built-in security code generator has got you covered. \nThis new app replaces the Azure Authenticator, Microsoft account, and Multi-Factor Authentication apps. \nYou can download the app from the given link below.

Thomson Reuters | Last Updated: November 16, 2016 18:04 (IST) Thomson Reuters EMAIL COMMENTS Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal.The move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week.The Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. Microsoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.LinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.U.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal.Microsoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said. © Thomson Reuters 2016 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Specifically, Microsoft is no longer releasing individual patches, but rollups that include all updates for every month, and the company is giving users the chance to try out the next month updates with so-called Security Monthly Quality Rollups available as optional. Basically, these updates are only aimed at users who want to test in advance the company’s latest patches, but also for IT admins who need to prepare for the next Patch Tuesday cycle in their organizations. These updates are released on the third Tuesday of each month and can be downloaded from Microsoft’s Update Catalog.

      "text": "Microsoft offers concessions to EU regulators eyeing its $26.2BN LinkedIn bid Posted The R.Pi IoT Shield adds IoT connectivity to your DIY project \nMicrosoft has offered concessions to EC competition regulators in the hopes of smoothing the way for its planned acquisition of LinkedIn. It announced the $26.2 billion deal this June . \nReuters reports the development follows a meeting between the Commission and Microsoft executives last week at which the EC expressed concerns. \nAn EC spokesperson confirmed it has received “a commitments proposal” from Microsoft but declined to comment further. \nCommitments, in EC antitrust nomenclature, refers to remedies a company can offer if the Commission has concerns a merger/acquisition may significantly affect competition. These can include proposing certain modifications to the project to guarantee continued competition on the market. \nA Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on what concessions it is offering. Nor would it comment more generally on the big data competition issue. But the spokesman did point to this blog , written by competition lawyer Stephen Kinsella (whose firm has advised Microsoft on a range of antitrust issues), which sets out arguments against big-data-related competition concerns as a blocker to the Microsoft-LinkedIn acquisition. \nKinsella’s position is the big data competition concern essentially pivots on the question of whether a data set can be “unmatched”. “Unless there is convincing evidence that a particular data set is genuinely both non-replicable and uncontestable, it would place an unreasonable burden on competition enforcers if they were always obliged to analyse the impact on some rather nebulous “data market”,” he writes. \nComplaints that the LinkedIn acquisition might make it difficult for Microsoft’s competitors to launch future services are are dismissed by Kinsella as moving into “the realm of an “innovation offence”” — where regulators would be tackling, in his words, “speculative impact” and “the levels of abstraction introduce too much uncertainty into the merger review process”. \nClearly Microsoft hopes the Commission will come to similar conclusions. The majority of competition cases are cleared unconditionally by the EC, so the Microsoft-Linkedin deal is already in a minority — although the EC spokesman said it also has “many cases” where parties submit remedies at this stage as they seek to satisfy regulator concerns. \nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has raised concerns about whether big data players’ data holdings can impact competition for more than a year now, warning at the start of this year: “If a company’s use of data is so bad for competition that it outweighs the benefits, we may have to step in to restore a level playing field.” \nMarc Benioff, chief executive officer of Salesforce.com — which also made a bid for LinkedIn — has been one of the most vocal competitors opposing the acquisition , arguing Microsoft will use LinkedIn’s database of ~430 million professional profiles of users to “block competition”. \nFor its part, Microsoft has said it wants to integrate LinkedIn data into its existing software programs, such as Outlook email, Skype messaging and Office’s suite of productivity apps — combining the social graph of the professional network with data held within Microsoft users’ emails, calendars and comms in order to enable new utility and functionality. Such as “a LinkedIn newsfeed that serves up articles based on the project you are working on and Office suggesting an expert to connect with via LinkedIn to help with a task you’re trying to complete”. \nIt has also said it wants to apply machine learning/AI on top of that mix to, in the words of one Microsoft exec, Scott Guthrie , “create the ultimate selling tool, the ultimate customer support tool”. So another driver for the LinkedIn acquisition is its vast social graph dataset as a pure ‘raw material’ for training the machine learning models Microsoft will need to build a next generation of smarter software. \nAI’s need for data to create new products likely helps explain the hefty price-rag on the LinkedIn acquisition. But it remains to be seen how EU regulators will weigh up the competition implications of any such LinkedIn-data-enabled future Microsoft products. \nThe new deadline for the EC’s decision on the acquisition is December 6 .",

      "text": "BRUSSELS: Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion (Dh95.50 billion) bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the US software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal.\nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. The Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. (Reuters)",

      "text": "OpenAI Adopts Microsoft Azure for AI Research Updated 0 \nMicrosoft and OpenAI have partnered to help promote artificial intelligence. \nThe alliance was announced on Tuesday, promising to use AI to \"tackle some of the world's most challenging problems,\" Redmond's Harry Shum wrote in a blog entry. \n\"We're also excited that OpenAI chose Microsoft Azure as their primary cloud platform, to help advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud,\" Shum, executive vice president of the Microsoft AI and Research Group, added. \nBy working together, OpenAI will benefit from Microsoft's Azure cloud computing infrastructure which unlocks access to large-scale AI experiments. Microsoft can in return take advantage of OpenAI's artificial intelligence research to improve key services such as real-time translation and voice and conversation recognition. \nElon Musk's nonprofit research firm was drawn to Azure's open-sourced technology, as well as its Batch, Machine Learning, and Cognitive Toolkit capabilities, according to Redmond. The deal also nets OpenAI early access to the software giant's GPU-powered N-Series Virtual Machines, designed for deep learning and other intensive workloads. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" an OpenAI blog announcement said. \nThe company, co-founded by Tesla CEO Musk and Y Combinator's Sam Altman, debuted in December, backed by industry heavyweights Ilya Sutskever, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research. In June, the group announced plans for three artificial intelligence projects, including a robot butler. \nMicrosoft this week also launched its Azure Bot Service, a new program that allows developers to easily deploy and manage bots on Azure. \n\"We've made major strides in artificial intelligence just in the past five years, achieving milestones many people who have devoted their lives to the field wouldn't have thought possible,\" Shum wrote. \"Now, we have the opportunity to help our partners and customers use these breakthroughs to achieve their goals.\" \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com .

      "text": "SC asks Google, Yahoo, Microsoft to delete info about sex determination SC asks Google, Yahoo, Microsoft to delete info about sex determination A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Amitava Roy said that the nodal agency would inform these search engines about any such advertisements on the websites and Indian arms of Google, Microsoft and Yahoo would delete them within 36 hours. By: PTI | New Delhi | Published:November 16, 2016 6:47 pm The Supreme Court of India. (File Photo) \nSearch engines like Google , Yahoo and Microsoft were on Wednesday asked to “delete” within 36 hours the advertisements, hosted by them, pertaining to pre-natal sex determination in India by the Supreme Court which directed the Centre to appoint a nodal agency to monitor the websites. A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Amitava Roy said that the nodal agency would inform these search engines about any such advertisements on the websites and Indian arms of Google, Microsoft and Yahoo would delete them within 36 hours. \n“We direct the Union of India to constitute a nodal agency which would give advertisments on TV, radio and in newspapers….that if anybody comes across anything which identify a girl or a boy (at pre-natal stage), it should be brought to the notice of the nodal agency. “Once it is brought to the notice of the nodal agency, it shall inform the search engines and they, after receiving the information, are obliged to delete it within 36 hours and inform the nodal agency,” the bench said. \nThe apex court, which fixed the matter for further hearing on February 17 next year, said the “interim arrangement” would continue till the issue pertaining to advertisements relating to pre-natal sex determination was “debated” upon before it. During the hearing, the bench expressed concern over the declining sex ratio and said, “Whether one will have a boy or a girl, that kind of information is not necessary in India. The sex ratio is going down here and we are concerned about that.” \n“We had passed an order recently on this. Whether you are making money or not we are not concerned with that. The 1994 (Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Act says nobody shall propagate (pre-natal sex determination) and if anyone is propagating, it has to be stopped,” it said. “Whatever is prohibited under the Act cannot go through it (websites),” the bench observed, adding, “If anyone comes across anything which offends or has an impact on the sex ratio in India, it shall be removed by the search engines within 36 hours.” \nSenior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who was appearing for Google India Pvt Ltd, said they have complied with the earlier order passed by the apex court in the matter and they have already taken steps to block any such advertisements. The counsel appearing for the other search engines also said that they have taken steps to comply with the provisions of the Act. However, they contended that the matter requires further debate.

      "title": "How to Opt Out of Microsoft Targeted Ads in Windows 10",
      "text": "Andre Da Costa | November 16, 2016 in How-To \nWindows 10 is very much a service-oriented operating system. Part of Microsoft’s strategy for delivering free revisions of Windows 10 almost every six months is dependent heavily on one thing: advertisements. These advertisements are fueled in part by the tighter integration of your Microsoft account with your everyday usage of the Windows operating system. \nLeading up to the initial launch in 2015, many tech pundits took issue with possible privacy concerns on this front. To Microsoft’s credit, they’ve provided a number of options to allow users to tailor the way their data is shared with Microsoft and third-parties. The company’s goal is to monetize the operating system without making it seem like users are being extorted for their personal information. \nAs some users began noticing recently, the default Windows 10 settings include some advertisements for the Windows Store. Throughout the operating system, you will find examples of that such as advertisement of apps on the Start menu or the Lock Screen. If you have the Windows Spotlight dynamic images feature enabled, you will see ads there too. In this article, we show you how you can opt out of these targeted ads. Stop Receiving Personalized Ads in Windows 10 \nClick Start > Settings > Privacy, select the General tab then toggle off the following option: Let apps use my advertising ID for experiences across apps (turning this off will reset your ID). \nIf you don’t want websites to provide locally relevant content for your region, you can toggle off the following option: Let websites provide locally relevant content by accessing my language list. \nTwo other options you may want to modify include the personalized ads in the web browser and Personalized ads wherever I use my Microsoft account . Scroll down to the bottom of the window then click the link Manage my Microsoft advertising and other personalization info . This will open your web browser and take you to the opt-out page for Windows 10 and Microsoft web browsers. \nOn the right side of the page, toggle off the Personalized ads in the web browser and Personalized ads wherever I use my Microsoft account . \nIf you are using Microsoft Edge , you can further protect your privacy by enabling Do not track requests. In Microsoft Edge, click the More Actions menu then click Settings > View Advanced Settings , scroll down then toggle on Send Do Not Track request . DNT is a feature first introduced in popular web browsers over the past 5 years ago that lets you opt out of behavioral web advertising. \nIf you are using Windows Spotlight , you can switch to a standard lock screen background to stop seeing ads on the lock screen. \nWindows 10 might seem aggressive with all these options for advertising, but I personally don’t feel overwhelmed by it. The software behemoth is trying to strike a balance between delivering advances, while still being able to fund the development of each revision of the operating system . The privacy settings in Windows 10 go a long way to helps users to take control of their personal experiences. If you want to go the extra mile with privacy in Windows 10, consider setting up a Local Account instead, but that defeats the purpose of using Windows 10 and realizing many of its benefits .

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has a new series of virtual machines called the N-series and they will be generally available starting on December 1st. These new virtual machines will be available in South Central US, East US, West Europe, and South East Asia at GA.\nThe N-series VMs are powered by NVIDIA GPUs and are designed for developers who are looking to capitalize on the growth in computational power in the GPU segment. Microsoft says that they have had thousands of customers participating in its N-Series preview program that was launched in August and now feel the product is ready for production environments.\nThis new offering is the latest effort from Microsoft to help differentiate its cloud platform to attract developers and IT Admins from around the globe to utilize the company’s cloud infrastructure. Cloud growth has been a key part of Microsoft’s recent success and the company shows no signs of slowing down on its investments into this service.\nMicrosoft and Amazon are in a fiercely contested battle to win over new clients to adopt their cloud technologies. Amazon has announced this week that they will be cutting prices on their services by up to 25% and you can’t rule out Google, while they are coming from behind, has begun making significant investments into its cloud platform too.\nYou can read more about the Azure N-Series, here .\nThe post Azure N-Series General Available Starting December 1st appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "Xbox Scorpio Price to Make It Microsoft's Most Expensive Console? Reddit \nWith the PS4 Pro receiving a slew of developer support (although not all of it favourable ) and seeing solid sales in markets like the UK, it’s but obvious that Microsoft would want to talk up its competing console, the Xbox Scorpio. \nAlthough it doesn’t have a release date with the company not saying more than a holiday 2017 window, that hasn’t stopped Xbox boss Phil Spencer from commenting on what it could be priced at. Needless, to say, if you’re expecting an inexpensive console, you may want to consider something else. \n(Also see: Xbox Scorpio Won't Have an Upgrade Every Two Years: Microsoft ) \"Scorpio will be a premium console. It will cost more than S, obviously, this is how we are building it up. We have not announced the pricing yet, but want to make sure that the investment we are making in the product of Scorpio goes hand in hand with the requirement of high-end consumer and that means a higher price,\" said Spencer in conversation with Spanish gaming website Levelup. \"There is not a single product you see and say 'this is the product that defines how you are doing in the market'. It really is the repertoire of all products with prices and when we think of Scorpio it is for a high-end consumer who demands the maximum of a console, and the console built to meet that demand.\"\n(Also see: Xbox Scorpio Games to Run in Native 4K Resolution: Microsoft ) \nWhile it should come as no surprise given how Microsoft has positioned the device since its E3 2016 reveal, the comments come after analyst Michael Patcher claimed it would be “suicide” for the company to price above $399. This could possibly see Scorpio priced more than the Xbox One at launch, which at the time was the company’s most expensive console. \nWhat’s your take on iterative consoles or is the PC enough for all your gaming needs? Let us know in the comments. (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

      "title": "Microsoft, Dynamiss to Boost Digital Learning in Schools",
      "text": "Nigeria: El-Rufai Replies Atiku - You Are a Liar, I Dare You to Go to U.S. By Sunday Okobi Microsoft Nigeria and Dynamiss Solutions have concluded plans to launch a new initiative to fast track digital learning in Nigerian primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. Schools proprietors, heads and ICT directors will be the focal point of the initiative on November 16 in Lagos, where they will be compelled to include ICT training as part of the curriculum at all levels. According to the Microsoft Specialist Sales Executive, Ms. Jordan Belmonte, the company will reveal an initiative that integrates ICT into the classroom while ensuring the sustainability of the programme by enabling schools to also financially benefit from the implementation of the solution \"as the programme is subsidised and made affordable for students.\" Also, Dynamiss will disclose the benefits of its new learning management system, which incorporates Microsoft Office 365 as core element of classroom and out-of-school learning for students and teachers. Briefing journalists in Lagos recently, Belmonte, who doubles as the Microsoft Head of Education for Nigeria, said \"Microsoft Nigeria is committed to promoting lifelong learning by providing affordable access to education solutions and promoting the adoption of ICT in schools. We believe that investment in education is a critical component of preparing youth for the global workforce and is directly tied to a countries economic growth. \"The pilot project, which will commence in Lagos before spreading to other parts of West Africa will empower the entire education community- students, teachers and parents- and benefit them financially in order to sustain the programme. \"Microsoft will be unveiling a 21st century skills centre that benefits both students, teachers and surrounding communities by providing schools with access to a vast e-learning platform and affordable professional certifications.\" She added that Dynamiss is challenging education norms with its product which ensures that digital technology will become a key aspect of teaching and learning. \"Our mission is to ensure that we support this advancement in learning and the benefits it provides for Nigerian students. \"We are trying to integrate every classroom (not only ICT centres) with Dynamiss to illuminate Mathematics, English Language, Geography among other subjects with the use of ICT. ICT is into our lives every day, like the usage of our mobile phones, televisions and games. Children are excitedly distracted these days. So we want to bring that interest and excitement into the classroom by using technology to engage students in a new way.\" The Head of Sales for Dynamiss, Mrs. Angela Oyekanmi, who disclosed that the project would be demonstrated at the event starting by 9am, stated: \"Dynamiss has created a robust learning system which subtly and overtly aids the adoption of digital skills by students and teachers. Remarkably, our software also incorporates all Microsoft Office 365 tools for free for all students, as well as Microsoft Imagine Academy digital learning platform which offered for qualifying schools also for free.\" On the implementation of IT training for schools, Oyekanmi said: \"We have ensured that the cost of our solution is affordable for all students. We have also partnered financial institutions to create payment plans that ensure the affordability of the product by most people. Schools are also able to benefit and generate revenue from our partnership with Microsoft which will support their IT implementation and we will be revealing this in more details at the event. \"Ultimately, it is the student's quality of education and employability that will benefit the most from implementing the Dynamiss Microsoft Learning Management System. It is also going to demonstrate the affordability of access to education in schools and economically empower the workforce in the country.\" Nigeria \nThe Nigerian police said they have foiled a plan by some suspected kidnappers to abduct a popular businessman, Femi… Read more » Copyright © 2016 This Day.

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIn June, Microsoft announced its intention to purchase professional networking platform LinkedIn, in an all-cash deal worth $26.2 billion . An acquisition of this scale - with a potential impact on competitors - requires regulatory approval, and Microsoft hasn't yet received its blessing to proceed with the purchase from the European Union. \nAccording to Reuters , antitrust regulators in the EU 'expressed concerns' about the deal to Microsoft executives last week, prompting the company to consider its options. \nThe European Commission said today that Microsoft has offered unspecified 'concessions' to regulators in an effort to allay their concerns. The Commission will deliver a ruling on the acquisition by December 6, when it may approve the deal with Microsoft's concessions, request further changes to the company's proposed purchase, or open a full investigation. \nThe latter option is obviously the least desirable one for Microsoft, as it would likely include a detailed and time-consuming probe into factors such as the impact of the acquisition on the wider marketplace. \nSalesforce called for a full investigation into the deal in October, claiming that it \"raises significant antitrust and data privacy issues that need to be fully scrutinized by competition and data privacy authorities in the United States and in the European Union\". Microsoft president Brad Smith said that Salesforce's fears surrounding the acquisition were unfounded .",

      "text": "0 0 \nAccording to Eugene Kaspersky, head of the Russian security company, Microsoft is doing some anti-competitive things with its Windows 10 operating system. Kaspersky says that Microsoft is currently trying to push Windows Defender on Windows 10 devices in order to destroy the competition. \nMicrosoft is also trying to create obstacles for antivirus companies to access the market. It is good to know that the Windows Defender that comes with the Windows 10 is able to protect users on a basic level against threats. In fact, according to some AV Tests, Windows Defender does not offer the same protection level as most third-party antivirus solutions. \nWindows Defender automatically activates in case there is no third-party antivirus program installed on the computer. However, if the user installs a third-party antivirus application, Windows Defender will automatically disable itself. However, Kaspersky claims that the Windows 10 may also deactivate installed third-party antivirus solutions during system upgrades because of incompatibilities. Windows Defender can also activate itself in case a third-party antivirus is about to expire in a few days. \nAt the same time, Windows 10 comes with many issues which include those that affect the incompatibility check during system upgrades. For example, if you upgraded Windows 10 to a new version or from an older version of Windows to Windows 10, you may have noticed that the system tells you that the software “X” is incompatible with the Windows 10. However, if you install it on your computer, it runs just fine without any issues at all. \nKaspersky is suggesting Microsoft change the install and notification system in order to make it clearer for users that the process will actually remove the third-party antivirus application from their computers. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Small businesses now get CRM tool with their Office subscription Microsoft launched a tool for Outlook that helps manage customer relationships More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 9:30 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nSmall businesses that need a tool to track their relationships with customers now have a new weapon from Microsoft in their arsenal. \nOn Monday, the company launched Outlook Customer Manager (OCM), a lightweight customer relationship management (CRM) system. It allows users to track their customers, manage deals in progress, track tasks and more -- all from their Outlook email client. \nThe launch builds on Microsoft's ongoing push to capture the small business market. Earlier this year, the company launched Bookings, a service designed to help service-focused businesses manage customer appointments. \nIt's a move by Microsoft to further compete with Salesforce and other players in the cloud CRM space. Companies that already have an Office 365 Business Premium subscription may not want to choose one of the competing CRM systems, if they can get OCM for free. \nAs the needs of those businesses grow, they may be more likely to turn to Microsoft's Dynamics 365 cloud CRM system. OCM gives users a path to migrate to the more powerful service when their needs become more complex. Microsoft \nOutlook Customer Manager provides users with information about their customers -- right inside Microsoft's email client. \nOCM takes a few forms inside Outlook on the desktop. First, users can pull up customer records alongside their emails so it's possible to track the history of a customer's account, what tasks are associated with them, and what appointments they have scheduled. \nThere's also another screen where users can see a list of all the customers they have, and then drill down into individual accounts, similar to a traditional CRM system. Microsoft \nOutlook Customer Manager lets users see a list of customers at a glance. \nIn addition to working inside Outlook, OCM also has an iOS app that people can use to access the system on the go. In the future, Microsoft says, it plans to bring the app to other mobile platforms. \nThe service will roll out first to Office 365 Business Premium customers who are part of Microsoft's First Release track. The company expects that it will be available to everyone with a Business Premium plan in the coming months, and Microsoft is also working to make it available for Office 365 Enterprise E3 and E5 customers as well.

      "text": "  09:00 AM EST Infoblox Brings Additional Network Control & Security to Microsoft Azure SANTA CLARA, Calif.,   Infoblox Inc., which provides DNS, DHCP, and IP address management (DDI), today introduced Infoblox DDI for Microsoft Azure, a virtual appliance that delivers network control and security to the Azure cloud computing platform. With the addition of Azure, Infoblox now provides DNS, DHCP, and IP address management capabilities —the category known as DDI— across multiple cloud platforms including AWS, OpenStack, VMware and traditional on-premises networks. According to a survey among 1,000 North American and European enterprise infrastructure technology decision makers, 59 percent will adopt a hybrid cloud model in the next 12 months 1 . As companies are making the transition to a hybrid model, they have to operate in a multi-cloud, multi-platform environment which often includes traditional on-premises components as well. Legacy DDI approaches in the new cloud paradigm often negatively impact cloud agility due to manual processes, cause inconsistencies across hybrid deployments, and increase vulnerabilities that can lead to outages, security breaches and a poor end-user experience. “The network is the foundation for any business, and enabling our customers to keep their network strong, stable and secure, from any platform, is our top priority. By extending Infoblox’s Actionable Network Intelligence to Microsoft Azure, we’re offering our customers the ultimate in choice,” said Scott Fulton executive vice president of products at Infoblox. “Legacy DNS infrastructure is one of the most exploited parts of a network and often the hidden crack in the foundation that derails a business especially with next-generation, dynamic initiatives like public and hybrid cloud. Like the Millennium Towers luxury high-rise in San Francisco that is sinking and tilting, problems at the foundation can be notoriously hard to diagnose and can have costly, devastating impacts. Infoblox helps increase business speed and agility by making it fast and easy for IT teams to take charge of core network services and security through one unified platform.” Ryan McGee, director, Microsoft Security Marketing, Microsoft Corp. said, “The cloud brings tremendous speed and business agility with an automated process for spinning up storage and compute, but network configuration like DNS across hybrid environments is often complex and is still managed manually. Now, Azure customers can implement Infoblox’s DDI technology to automatically provision and manage core DNS infrastructure in Azure as part of the workflow, have visibility across disparate platforms, and accelerate the speed in which they can be up and running.” 1 Forrester, The Cloud Computing Playbook For 2016 , by Glenn O’Donnell, October 26, 2016 New Infoblox for Microsoft Azure Infoblox DDI for Azure manages DNS records and IP addresses and integrates seamlessly with an organization’s existing Infoblox infrastructure. The offering also supports DNS firewall security to detect infected workloads and help prevent the spread of malware. The benefits of Infoblox DDI for Azure include: Greater Agility . Infoblox DDI for Azure can reduce deployment times of virtual machines by eliminating manual processes and lengthy trouble ticket processes with automated provisioning and clean-up when VMs are destroyed. As a result, customers can eliminate bottlenecks in creating DNS for setting up virtual machines and deploying new applications in Azure. Consistency . Infoblox’s unified solution helps eliminate errors, reduce unplanned outages and ensure a uniform policy for DNS naming conventions and IP address assignments in a multi-cloud, multi-platform environment that includes Azure. Automated Discovery and Visibility . Infoblox provides network administrators visibility with non-disruptive, automatic discovery of virtual machines and resources in Azure and other cloud platforms, across geographic regions. This helps ensure that organizations meet security and compliance needs without manual overhead. Connectivity . API integrations allow additional automation including IP address assignment and integration with other workflow and orchestration tools. In addition to Azure, supported platforms include AWS, VMware, Microsoft, OpenStack, Cisco, HP, BMC, CA and Elasticbox. This broad support enables organizations to evolve their cloud strategy based on business needs, while maintaining consistent network-services infrastructures without costly and disruptive migrations. Pricing and Availability Infoblox DDI is available now in the Azure Marketplace: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/infoblox/infoblox-nios-forvnios/ Pricing information is available from Infoblox sales representatives and channel partners. About Infoblox Infoblox delivers Actionable Network Intelligence to enterprise, government, and service provider customers around the world. As the industry leader in DNS, DHCP, and IP address management, the category known as DDI, Infoblox ( www.infoblox.com ) provides control and security from the core—empowering thousands of organizations to increase efficiency and visibility, reduce risk, and improve customer experience.

      "text": "Register Sign In Infoblox Brings Additional Network Control & Security to Microsoft Azure With Infoblox Actionable Network Intelligence Customers can Automatically Provision and Manage DNS Infrastructure Regardless of Where the Application Lives - in Azure or On-Premises - from a Single System  00 ET | Source: Infoblox Inc. SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 16, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Infoblox Inc., which provides DNS, DHCP, and IP address management (DDI), today introduced Infoblox DDI for Microsoft Azure, a virtual appliance that delivers network control and security to the Azure cloud computing platform. With the addition of Azure, Infoblox now provides DNS, DHCP, and IP address management capabilities —the category known as DDI— across multiple cloud platforms including AWS, OpenStack, VMware and traditional on-premises networks. According to a survey among 1,000 North American and European enterprise infrastructure technology decision makers, 59 percent will adopt a hybrid cloud model in the next 12 months 1 . As companies are making the transition to a hybrid model, they have to operate in a multi-cloud, multi-platform environment which often includes traditional on-premises components as well. Legacy DDI approaches in the new cloud paradigm often negatively impact cloud agility due to manual processes, cause inconsistencies across hybrid deployments, and increase vulnerabilities that can lead to outages, security breaches and a poor end-user experience. “The network is the foundation for any business, and enabling our customers to keep their network strong, stable and secure, from any platform, is our top priority. By extending Infoblox’s Actionable Network Intelligence to Microsoft Azure, we’re offering our customers the ultimate in choice,” said Scott Fulton executive vice president of products at Infoblox. “Legacy DNS infrastructure is one of the most exploited parts of a network and often the hidden crack in the foundation that derails a business especially with next-generation, dynamic initiatives like public and hybrid cloud. Like the Millennium Towers luxury high-rise in San Francisco that is sinking and tilting, problems at the foundation can be notoriously hard to diagnose and can have costly, devastating impacts. Infoblox helps increase business speed and agility by making it fast and easy for IT teams to take charge of core network services and security through one unified platform.” Ryan McGee, director, Microsoft Security Marketing, Microsoft Corp. said, “The cloud brings tremendous speed and business agility with an automated process for spinning up storage and compute, but network configuration like DNS across hybrid environments is often complex and is still managed manually. Now, Azure customers can implement Infoblox’s DDI technology to automatically provision and manage core DNS infrastructure in Azure as part of the workflow, have visibility across disparate platforms, and accelerate the speed in which they can be up and running.” 1 Forrester, The Cloud Computing Playbook For 2016 , by Glenn O’Donnell, October 26, 2016 New Infoblox for Microsoft Azure Infoblox DDI for Azure manages DNS records and IP addresses and integrates seamlessly with an organization’s existing Infoblox infrastructure. The offering also supports DNS firewall security to detect infected workloads and help prevent the spread of malware. The benefits of Infoblox DDI for Azure include: Greater Agility . Infoblox DDI for Azure can reduce deployment times of virtual machines by eliminating manual processes and lengthy trouble ticket processes with automated provisioning and clean-up when VMs are destroyed. As a result, customers can eliminate bottlenecks in creating DNS for setting up virtual machines and deploying new applications in Azure. Consistency . Infoblox’s unified solution helps eliminate errors, reduce unplanned outages and ensure a uniform policy for DNS naming conventions and IP address assignments in a multi-cloud, multi-platform environment that includes Azure. Automated Discovery and Visibility . Infoblox provides network administrators visibility with non-disruptive, automatic discovery of virtual machines and resources in Azure and other cloud platforms, across geographic regions. This helps ensure that organizations meet security and compliance needs without manual overhead. Connectivity . API integrations allow additional automation including IP address assignment and integration with other workflow and orchestration tools. In addition to Azure, supported platforms include AWS, VMware, Microsoft, OpenStack, Cisco, HP, BMC, CA and Elasticbox. This broad support enables organizations to evolve their cloud strategy based on business needs, while maintaining consistent network-services infrastructures without costly and disruptive migrations. Pricing and Availability Infoblox DDI is available now in the Azure Marketplace: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/infoblox/infoblox-nios-forvnios/ Pricing information is available from Infoblox sales representatives and channel partners.

      "title": "Microsoft offers antitrust concessions to EU over LinkedIn purchase",
      "text": "At the start of this year, Brussels' antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager warned data-hoarding tech giants that she was looking at them very closely—even though she was yet to spot a \"competition problem.\" In June, Microsoft—with its planned buyout of LinkedIn —caught the eye of the Dane, who has been examining whether the £18.5 billion ($26.2 billion) deal should clear a regulatory hurdle in the 28-member-state bloc.\nOn Wednesday, a spokesperson at Vestager's office—which has been looking at the business activities of the two firms to determine whether the proposed merger could be bad for competition—confirmed to Ars that it had \"received a commitments proposal\" from Microsoft and LinkedIn.\nFurther Reading EU antitrust chief eyes up data-hoarding US tech giants It comes after Salesforce boss Marc Benioff, who had reportedly been considering a takeover of LinkedIn before Microsoft stepped in, told Recode that he had pushed the US Federal Trade Commission to probe the proposed merger. The deal has already received regulatory clearance Stateside, however.\nHe claimed that Microsoft's play for LinkedIn was an anticompetitive swoop on the data pumped into business productivity software. And Benioff has apparently made his feelings known to Vestager. It's understood that Salesforce submitted a response to a European Commission questionnaire, which sought views from interested parties who may have been concerned about LinkedIn being wedded to Microsoft.\nIn October, the EC said : \"On preliminary examination, the commission finds that the notified transaction could fall within the scope of the Merger Regulation. However, the final decision on this point is reserved.\"\nSalesforce foreshadowed its submission to the bloc's competition boss in late September, when its legal chief Burke Norton argued: \"By gaining ownership of LinkedIn’s unique dataset of over 450 million professionals in more than 200 countries, Microsoft will be able to deny competitors access to that data, and in doing so obtain an unfair competitive advantage.\"\nVestager's office is now looking at Microsoft's so-called \"commitments proposal,\" and will seek the views of the company's rivals. Her spokesperson told us that \"the new decision deadline is 6 December.\"\nMicrosoft declined to comment on the makeup of its concessions package to the commission when quizzed by Ars.\nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK",

      "text": "November 16, 2016 at 12:09 PM EST Code Dx Selected by Bitnami for Microsoft's Azure Government Cloud Marketplace PRWeb \nCode Dx, Inc., a provider of an award-winning suite of fast and affordable tools that help software developers, testers and security analysts find, prioritize and manage software vulnerabilities, today announced that it has been selected by Bitnami as one of the first applications to be included in Microsoft's Azure Government Cloud Marketplace. Government organizations are able to easily launch the Code Dx Application Vulnerability Correlation and Management Solution from an environment that adheres to the strict government procurement regulations for cloud technologies. \n\"Government organizations are looking for applications that are accessible in the cloud environment but also meet strict government procurement requirements,\" said Anita D'Amico, Ph.D., CEO for Code Dx. \"With Code Dx now available in the Azure Government Cloud Marketplace, public entities are able to easily launch their broad application security capabilities directly from the Azure Government Cloud Marketplace. This will be particularly valuable to government agencies and contractors who must demonstrate that the software they are developing or running has been tested for security, and complies with the DISA STIG (Defense Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation Guides).\" \nThe Microsoft Azure Government Cloud Marketplace is a cloud platform built upon the foundational principles of security, privacy and control, compliance, and transparency. Government organizations (federal, state, local, tribal, and educational) receive a physically-isolated instance of Microsoft Azure offering high-level security and compliance services that are essential to the U.S. government for all systems and applications built on its architecture. \nCode Dx is listed under the \"Bring Your Own License\" category enabling users to run the current free trial version of Code Dx and/or contact Code Dx to purchase a license. Through Bitnami, Code Dx can be easily deployed for both quick evaluations and production installations, and the process for future upgrades is simplified. After one quick installation, users are able to automatically configure and run Code Dx to consolidate and normalize software vulnerabilities detected by multiple code analysis tools. \n\"The Azure Government Cloud Marketplace is an invaluable resource for government entities in search of trusted cloud computing solutions,\" said Kevin Franklin, Director of Business Development at Bitnami. \"We selected the Code Dx solution as one of the first Bitnami applications to be included in this online marketplace, because it is perfectly aligned with the requirements of most government organizations looking for a reliable solution to help secure their software applications.\" \nA joint webinar with Code Dx and Bitnami will be held on December 6, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. PST. This webinar will focus on what government organizations need to know about application security, why it is so important, an overview of the key features and functionality of Code Dx, as well as a demo of the application vulnerability correlation and management system.

      "text": "’s Azure Government Cloud Marketplace \nNorthport, NY (PRWEB) November 16, 2016 \nations to be included in Microsoft’s Azure Government Cloud Marketplace. Government organizations are able to easily launch the Code Dx Application Vulnerability Correlation and Management Solution from an environment that adheres to the strict government procurement regulations for cloud technologies. \n“Government organizations are looking for applications that are accessible in the cloud environment but also meet strict government procurement requirements,” said Anita D’Amico, Ph.D., CEO for Code Dx. “With Code Dx now available in the Azure Government Cloud Marketplace, public entities are able to easily launch their broad application security capabilities directly from the Azure Government Cloud Marketplace. This will be particularly valuable to government agencies and contractors who must demonstrate that the software they are developing or running has been tested for security, and complies with the DISA STIG (Defense Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation Guides).” \nThe Microsoft Azure Government Cloud Marketplace is a cloud platform built upon the foundational principles of security, privacy and control, compliance, and transparency. Government organizations (federal, state, local, tribal, and educational) receive a physically-isolated instance of Microsoft Azure offering high-level security and compliance services that are essential to the U.S. government for all systems and applications built on its architecture. \nCode Dx is listed under the “Bring Your Own License” category enabling users to run the current free trial version of Code Dx and/or contact Code Dx to purchase a license. Through Bitnami, Code Dx can be easily deployed for both quick evaluations and production installations, and the process for future upgrades is simplified. After one quick installation, users are able to automatically configure and run Code Dx to consolidate and normalize software vulnerabilities detected by multiple code analysis tools. \n“The Azure Government Cloud Marketplace is an invaluable resource for government entities in search of trusted cloud computing solutions,” said Kevin Franklin, Director of Business Development at Bitnami. “We selected the Code Dx solution as one of the first Bitnami applications to be included in this online marketplace, because it is perfectly aligned with the requirements of most government organizations looking for a reliable solution to help secure their software applications.” \nA joint webinar with Code Dx and Bitnami will be held on December 6, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. PST. This webinar will focus on what government organizations need to know about application security, why it is so important, an overview of the key features and functionality of Code Dx, as well as a demo of the application vulnerability correlation and management system.

      "text": "Microsoft is livestreaming its developer event Connect(); 2016 for the next three days. If you’re not in New York City on November 16, 17, or 18, don’t worry, you can watch it right here.\nLast year, Microsoft open-sourced Visual Studio Code, launched the free Visual Studio Dev Essentials program, and debuted Microsoft Graph .\nThis year is expected to be even bigger. Microsoft even managed to leak some of its news: Visual Studio is coming to the Mac.\nThe underlying message is the same as the last two years: Give developers the tools they need regardless of what platform or device they’re using. Microsoft continues to move away from being the company that limited developers to just its offerings.\nConnect(); 2016 all begins at 7:00 a.m. Pacific (10:00 a.m. Eastern) with a keynote from Microsoft Cloud and enterprise vice president Scott Guthrie.\n\nAs always, if you’re a developer, you won’t want to miss what Microsoft has to say. Steve Ballmer may not be there to get you going , but the company will undoubtedly try to woo you with many announcements, partnerships, and new tools.\n",

      "text": "Published on November 16th, 2016 | by Joshua S Hill 0 \nNovember 16th, 2016 by Joshua S Hill Microsoft announced on Monday its largest purchase of wind energy to date in two agreements together representing 237 MW, bringing the company’s total investments in wind energy projects in the US to over 500 MW. \nMicrosoft has been consistent in its ambitions to green its operations, acquiring 285 MW of wind energy in the space of two years in deals that were pivotal in the development of two separate wind projects. The company was also listed alongside Apple and Google as new entrants to CDP’s 2015 Climate A Listers in November of last year . Microsoft also announced just this past September that it intends to reach a renewable energy target of 50% by 2018 — at which point it was already at 44%. \nSo this week’s announcement should come as no real surprise, although the size of the deal is nevertheless impressive. \n“Microsoft is committed to building a responsible cloud, and these agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our datacenters,” said Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at Microsoft . “Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate.” \nThe two new agreements are broken into two separate wind energy projects: \nThe first contract is with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART), which will see Microsoft benefit from fixed long-term energy costs, as well as purchase the environmental attributes connected with the new 178 MW Bloom Wind project being developed in Kansas, which is being developed by Capital Power in partnership with ART. Specifically, the Bloom Wind project is the first to use a new structure developed by ART which is designed to offset high upfront costs associated with the creation of large-scale wind projects. Microsoft is therefore the first buyer to participate in this structure, which could have the potential to speed the development of clean energy projects. \n“It is important for investors in renewable energy projects to secure long-term, stable revenues, and our structure does just that,” said Karsten Berlage, managing director of ART. “We are thrilled to be partnering with Microsoft on this groundbreaking project.” \nThe second agreement sees Microsoft contracting with Black Hills Corp, a subsidiary of Black Hills Energy, under a long-term agreement to purchase 59 MW of renewable energy certificates from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind projects, both adjacent to Microsoft’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, datacenter. \n“Our longstanding partnership with Microsoft productively led to this landmark collaboration,” said David R. Emery, chairman and CEO of Black Hills Corp. “This collaboration provided them the opportunity to utilize significantly more renewable energy while still ensuring the reliability they’ve come to expect through our energy infrastructure and generation resources. We are proud to be a strong supporter and partner in their mission to power their datacenters with increased renewable energy resources, and look forward to our continued collaboration in the years ahead.” Drive an electric car?

      "text": "Benioff can’t kill Microsoft-LinkedIn. \nCST holders approve sale. Welcome to the European issue of M&A Daily Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) offered key concessions to the EU on its acquisition of LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ). The $4.94 arb spread offers a 30% IRR if the deal closes in December. The commission will come back around Tuesday December 6 with their response; on that date they should and probably will clear the deal. Meanwhile, Salesforce.com's (NYSE: CRM ) Marc Benioff is trying to stir up trouble for the deal, complaining that Microsoft ownership of LinkedIn data is anticompetitive. His preference is for Microsoft to pay for it and then give it to him. Cabela's Today is the regulatory filing date for the bank purchase agreement for the Bass Pro acquisition of Cabela's (NYSE: CAB ). The $4.80 arb spread offers a 12% IRR if the deal closes by July. Chemtura HSR expires today for the Lanxess ( OTCPK:LNXSF ) acquisition of Chemtura (NYSE: CHMT ). Everyday Everyday (NYSE: EVDY ) received early termination of HSR for its acquisition by j2 (NASDAQ: JCOM ). G&K G&K (NASDAQ: GK ) shareholders approved the merger with Cintas (NASDAQ: CTAS ). CST CST (NYSE: CST ) shareholders approved its acquisition by Alimentation Couche-Tard ( OTCPK:ANCUF ). HSR expires today. Transocean Transocean Partners (NYSE: RIGP ) holders approved its acquisition by Transocean (NYSE: RIG ). CIFC CIFC (NASDAQ: CIFC ) shareholders approved its acquisition by FAB.

      "text": "Why Microsoft Is Partnering With Elon Musk's $1 Billion Artificial Intelligence Company The partnership will help both companies remain competitive against Google and Amazon.   \nMicrosoft has announced a new partnership with OpenAI , the $1 billion artificial intelligence research nonprofit cofounded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Y Combinator President Sam Altman . \nUnder the terms of the partnership, OpenAI will use the Microsoft Azure cloud computing service as the \"preferred\" place to do its AI experiments. In return, Microsoft gets increased access to OpenAI's deep bench of robotics and experts, making Azure a better place for building AI-powered software. \n\"You want to get a good feedback loop going,\" says Microsoft Executive VP of Cloud and Enterprise Scott Guthrie. \"That helps you ultimately build a better platform.\" \nArtificial intelligence is going to be a big point of competition between Microsoft Azure, the leading Amazon Web Services , and the relative upstart Google Cloud over the months and years to come. As Guthrie says, \"any application is ultimately going to weave in AI,\" and Microsoft wants to be the company that helps developers do the weaving. \nThat's where the OpenAI partnership becomes so important, Guthrie says. \nBecause we're still in the earliest days of artificial intelligence, he says, the biggest challenge is figuring out what exactly can be done with artificial intelligence. Guthrie calls this \"understanding the art of the possible.\" \nWith OpenAI, a research institution focused largely on just that, it's a natural collaboration as they work to \"jointly build an even richer ecosystem around artificial intelligence\" and \"learn as fast as possible,\" Guthrie says. \nGuthrie highlights the fact that Microsoft customers like ThyssenKrupp and Uber are already working with Azure and its artificial intelligence capabilities to power things like fixing elevators before they actually break or making sure your driver is actually your driver. \nCombine that with Microsoft's expertise in serving large business customers and helping them build applications that can securely handle large amounts of data, and Guthrie believes Microsoft really stands out from the pack. \n\"Combined, they help make Azure an even more differentiated platform,\" Guthrie says.

      "text": "SplitBook is a pretty neat third-party Splitwise app for Windows 10 \nBack on October 14th of this year , Microsoft had filed for EU approval for their acquisition of the business and employment-oriented social networking service LinkedIn. Salesforce tried to block Microsoft’s 26.2 billion all-cash acquisition of LinkedIn in the EU, citing antitrust issues. Today we have learned that the EU has received commitments from Microsoft on the LinkedIn deal, and will be set to rule on the merger by December 6th ( via Reuters. ) \nWhile Microsoft has yet to comment on the commitments, the move does come after a EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. Not many details were provided by the Commission in regards to Microsoft’s commitments, but Reuters mentions that the Commission will seek feedback from rival companies and customers before making a decision on Microsoft’s commitments. \nDespite concerns by SalesForce, Microsoft President, and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, has accepted many the worries in regards to the LinkedIn deal and has recently come out to say that Microsoft has “no intention” of cutting off access to LinkedIn data. There has, however, been lots of news on the LinkedIn front since Microsoft’s acquisition of the company, and as most recent as last week , a LinkedIn ban in Russia was upheld and 6 million users were shut down.

      "text": "Microsoft and OpenAI have partnered to help promote artificial intelligence.\nThe alliance was announced on Tuesday, promising to use AI to \"tackle some of the world's most challenging problems,\" Redmond's Harry Shum wrote in a blog entry .\n\"We're also excited that OpenAI chose Microsoft Azure as their primary cloud platform, to help advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud,\" Shum, executive vice president of the Microsoft AI and Research Group, added.\nBy working together, OpenAI will benefit from Microsoft's Azure cloud computing infrastructure which unlocks access to large-scale AI experiments. Microsoft can in return take advantage of OpenAI's artificial intelligence research to improve key services such as real-time translation and voice and conversation recognition.\n\nElon Musk's nonprofit research firm was drawn to Azure's open-sourced technology, as well as its Batch, Machine Learning, and Cognitive Toolkit capabilities, according to Redmond. The deal also nets OpenAI early access to the software giant's GPU-powered N-Series Virtual Machines , designed for deep learning and other intensive workloads.\n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" an OpenAI blog announcement said .",
