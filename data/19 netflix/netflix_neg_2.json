      "text": "spoilers Share this article \nTo find solace in anything at all as the bizarre, dumpster fire of an election roars on like an old-timey steam engine just below the border is no small feat. (By the time this article is posted, I do realize we will have possibly ushered in the horses of apocalypse as the human race combusts into flames or have elected a new POTUS. However, if the election was any indicator, the dumpster fire is probably still burning away in some form or another.) \nThis past weekend, though , I did find my happy place : nestled amongst my meticulously curated throw pillows, clutching onto my grandmother’s vintage English china that was filled to the brim with almond milk and chocolate Lucky Charms, as I simultaneously devoured Netflix’s comestible new original series The Crown. \nThe fact that I would fall head-over-Jimmy Choos in love with this show was as inevitable as me finding any lazy excuse to bring up Jon Hamm in an article (Boom. I did it, Mom!). It has stunning costumes (from Game of Thrones designer Michele Clapton), gold and upholstery laden sets , fabulous acting with people from all of my other favourite British shows, and a palatable 10-episode first season. What is not to adore?And further, like any good American, the Royal Family has always fascinated and enraptured me. I remember waking up at 2 in the morning and wearing a stupid headband to watch the Royal Wedding of Will and Kate. Every subsequent news story involving them has grabbed my attention ; be it who Harry’s new girlfriend is (unfortunately, it isn’t me), or who designed the sweater-set that Prince George has been subjected to wearing. I am on-board with all of it. So when I heard there would be an absurdly expensive ($100 million) show helmed by Peter Morgan (who wrote The Queen and Frost/Nixon ) about the reign of Elizabeth II, I was elated to say the very least. The Crown is just so on-brand for me. \nThe erratic remarks that follow contain spoilers for the series, but not really, because it is based on real events , so if you are remotely well informed about the various goings-on of the Royal Family and their political compatriots, then none of this will be news to you. \nThe series quickly sweeps us away into the rich and luscious visual language that the show will uphold throughout its 10-episodes (and hopefully though its anticipated 6 seasons). If one has to ask why this show costs so much money, one need only glance at the gloriously intricate sets and costumes to see where that money went. \nWe begin with King George VI (Jared Harries, aka Lane Pryce from Mad Men ) performing the ceremony that denounces Prince Philip (Matt Smith) of his Greek and Danish royal titles and becoming a fully naturalized Brit. So, at this point, Elizabeth II (Claire Foy) remains unmarried , with Prime Minister Winston Churchill (John Lithgow), Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden (Jeremy Northam), and others in the parliament still deeply disapproving of Elizabeth’s choice of spouse. \nNow, about 20-minutes in to the show, I had to pause to spend about a half-hour furiously googling “young Prince Philip” to see if the real person exuded the oozing and smoldering sexuality of Matt Smith. The real Philip was not a hideous man in his heyday, but a Mr. Smith he was not. \nOkay, getting back on track here. Elizabeth and Philip are married in 1947 , and her dress is stunning. All is well. \nThe couple makes an excursion to Kenya , and they are both working some Out of Africa, safari realness. While they are away, her father passes away, so she must return to England to deal with the fact that she will now be the Queen. \nDespite the death of the character in present day (1952), there are various flashbacks throughout the series , so we still see Lane Pryce, the King, interacting with Elizabeth and Princess Margaret as children. There is no way they would have Jared Harris hanging about and wasting his talents. \nThere are 2-episodes after the death of King George VI, both fairly tedious, if lovely to look at. I am pretty sure I was just refreshing my Twitter, occasionally glancing at the screen and writing down one or two words of my thoughts on what I saw. We do get to see Wallis Simpson , though, who remains one of my greatest center-part icons next to Goop. \nWe also get to watch a bevy of smog cover the city that killed a bunch people in 1952 , and then watch as Churchill refused to acknowledge that it was a real issue. According to his portrayal on this show , which Lithgow does with deft skill and should receive an Emmy-nom for, he was kind of a d-bag. \nWe get into the juicy stuff by episode 5 (“Smoke and Mirrors”). Queen Mary (the mother of King George VI and the Duke of Windsor) passes away , and Edward (the Duke of Windsor... this nomenclature gets bonkers) writes to Wallis about how his mother was kind of the worst person ever and the family will be like vultures about her fancy stuff . I mean, the letter he wrote was savage. The man gave up being the King to go marry a woman who had been divorced multiple times, so he clearly gives zero sh*ts about anything. \nThis episode is also the coronation of Elizabeth, in which Philip throws a hissy fit for having to bow to his wife. Philip is also kind of a d-bag . \nThe idea that she has a duty to her Crown, but that she is still a wife and has a family is a resounding theme throughout the show. Churchill and Philip both act as the two main masculine figureheads that are constantly questioning and troubling Elizabeth with problems , with her uncle Edward and many others in the government in her ear along the way. \nThere is some dribble drabble with the Soviet hydrogen bomb , and I mainly watched this for the Royal intrigue and not the politics, so I sort of zoned out here. \nIn the background of all that genuinely important stuff was what I was actually into. Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) was having an affair with Group Captain Peter Townsend (Ben Miles), a married man, who was 16-years Margaret’s senior (Get it, girl!), and had served as equerry to King George VI. In 1953, he ended up proposing to her , which set off a whole hodgepodge of scandal and mess. Much to Margaret’s dismay, he was sent away until her 25th birthday, wherein she would no longer have to obey her sister in regards to whom she could marry. \nElizabeth , all the while, is making her Royal Tour of the Commonwealth from 1953-1954. She is beloved , and she is making speeches, despite feeling it is not her best skill. She is all-around being pretty cool and gets to wear some killer outfits along the way. \nWhen she returns, we are introduced to Lord Porchester, a horse-breeder who is a family friend and whom everyone implicates would have been her ideal match. Her sister is sassy AF about her partially over-friendly relationship with him. Her husband makes a snide remark about him being furniture and for Elizabeth not to sit on him. It was straight out of the Dowager Countess handbook and I was here for it. \nWinston Churchill is getting super sick , and for a while he was essentially on death’s doorstep. Nobody told Elizabeth about it and she slayed them with her sharp tongue , prompting lots of snapping and “Yassss Queen”-ings from moi. \nAnywho, he is turning 80 , and the Queen discusses his retirement. Then, Stannis Baratheon, I mean, Graham Sutherland (Stephen Dillane) shows up to paint his portrait. Churchill is furious about how decrepit he looks in the final painting, so he burns it up right away in a bonfire. This is the same thing I do whenever I stumble upon any old pictures of me with brown hair. \nThe final episode culminates in a load of personal dramas between Elizabeth and Margaret about her marriage to Peter Townsend. Despite trying to keep her word, Elizabeth has no choice but to demand that Margaret and Townsend marry in another country and not return to England for some time. So, essentially, she cannot approve the marriage because of her position as “defender of the faith.” They make a big public announcement how they won’t marry, blah, blah, blah. \nWith Churchill retired, Anthony Eden has taken over as PM (pretty sure he shoots up heroin as the episodes closes? I genuinely need answers on this.). As Elizabeth prepares for a photo shoot , and she is looking glam, Philip just kind of leaves her and drives away in the Rolls Royce convertible of my dreams. \nThis series, while beautiful and entertaining , is not making any sort of profound statement about the Royal Family and the seemingly private lives that they lead. It does paint certain figures as heroes and as villains in the grand scheme of it all, but beyond that, it is a fairly straightforward and enjoyable period drama that is sumptuous and seeping in Netflix cash. The experience of watching it can best be described as eating a rich and delicious piece of dark chocolate cake with lots of frosting slathered on top, but it won’t make you feel like regurgitating the whole slice back up if you eat the whole thing at once. Coming from someone who lives for these kinds of shows, it is definitely worth 10 hours of your precious time. \nAnd now, some of my random favourite moments because there was really no proper place to insert these in the complicated narrative I was attempting to paint: Someone uttered the line: “unbecoming tittle tattle.” Elizabeth was told by her doctor to stop smiling due to some strained nerves in her face, and the brain of every girl that has ever been told to “smile more” (I am part of that club!) just melted. Margaret giving her savage roast of everyone at the state dinner, while Elizabeth was away, made me want to see what her as Queen would have been like. There are lots of scenes with people moving in slow motion with dramatic opera music playing in the background that really spoke to me. At one point , there was a horse sex scene. Someone strongly pronounced the “t” in “adjective.” Elizabeth was told by her mother that she has to “let her sister shine,” and it was in that moment that I realized exactly why I love being an only child. Matt Smith always looks like he wants to have sex with whatever he is looking at. Like, how is a person’s face just naturally like that? It is a marvel. \nHappy watching, darlings! xx",

      "text": "By Allyson Koerner 4 hours ago \nTuesday, Nov. 8, aka Election Day, has been a whirlwind of emotions. Whether you support Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, you have to admit that the results of the 2016 presidential race have been quite surprising. I mean, did anyone really expect Trump do so well? Maybe I'm being a bit biased, but I'm sure many will agree with me there, right? Whatever the case, you just might be in need of something to make you feel better, so here are some shows to watch on Netflix on Nov. 9 if you need a reason to smile . \nThe following list includes some great TV comedies, feel-good movies, and other selections that could be the medicine you need to cure whatever kind of fatigue or hangover you have after election night. All elections are a bit stressful, but this one in particular was even more so. I mean, the entire presidential campaign has been so emotional and frustrating, so of course results night would be exactly the same. \nWith that said, get comfy on your couch, put on those sweats, grab all the junk food you can, crack open your favorite drink, and get ready to marathon some shows. Let's face it, sometimes Netflix is the cure you really need when it comes to relaxing a little. 1. Gilmore Girls [Embed] \nIf anyone can turn that frown upside down it's Lorelai, Rory, and the town of Stars Hollow. 2. Friends \nThese just might the group of friends you need come on Wednesday. 3. Parks and Recreation \nMaybe Leslie Knope can restore your faith in humanity? 4. 10 Things I Hate About You [Embed] \nThis one's great because you can express frustration, feel empowered by Julia Stiles' badass character, and smile at Heath Ledger. 5. Grease \nA musical might be what you need. Sing out those emotions! 6. Jane the Virgin [Embed] \nGina Rodriguez is just delightful and so is the entire series. Trust me, you will be smiling after the first episode. 7. Love Actually \n\"Love actually is all around.\" Need I say more? 8. Master of None [Embed] \nAllow Aziz Ansari to school you on a few things — and make you laugh out loud. \nHere's hoping on of these Netflix suggestions lighten the mood at least a little bit. \nImages: The WB; Giphy (8) Must Reads ",

By Ella Rozic , Parent Herald November 09, 05:30 am TAG The Originals , The Originals Season 4 , The CW , ABC , Netflix , Klaroline , TVD , The Vampire Diaries , TV Series SAN DIEGO, CA - JULY 26: In this handout photo provided by Warner Bros, Joseph Morgan, Leah Pipes, Phoebe Tonkin, Charles Michael Davis, Danielle Campbell, and Daniel Gillies of 'The Originals' attend Comic-Con International 2014 on July 26, 2014 in San Diego, California.(Photo : Smallz+Raskind/Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. via Getty Images) \nJust recently, The CW network revealed that “The Originals” will have lesser episodes in the upcoming season. With this, fans of the “TVD” spin-off series speculate the show nearing its end. Advertisement \nThe parent series “The Vampire Diaries” is currently airing its final season. Because of this, viewers of “The Originals” are thinking that the same will happen to the drama series. According to a report, “The Originals” Season 3 premiered late last Oct 2015 for the suspected reason that “The Vampire Diaries” canceled its eighth season. \nTVLine reported that the CW drama series “The Originals” was not able to secure a spot on the network’s fall schedule. The CW network president Mark Pedowitz shared how the network has a strong schedule but he still believes in the series and his decision to hold “The Originals” until mid-season is just a booster. Season 4 of pic.twitter.com/AWmCnFcDYy \n— The Originals (@cworiginals) September 12, 2016 \nIn our previous report, the speculations about the end of “The Originals” have been going around for quite some time. Some reports say the drama series has been steadily dropping viewership. \nReports have it that instead of dropping the show, The CW network came into an agreement with Netflix to salvage “The Originals”. Both agreed that all episodes of “The Originals” from The CW network can be viewed in Netflix eight days after each season finale. \n“The Originals” fans are still hoping for a crossover noting CW president Pedowitz’s statement. Klaroline aficionados have been waiting for the confirmation of their reuniting but no decision has been made final by the movie executives just yet. \nIf the network cancels after the upcoming season of “The Originals”, word goes around that the ABC network will pick it up for season 5. No official statement from the series producers and network executives were released. \nTune in for more updates about the drama series! “The Originals” Season 4 premieres in 2017 on The CW network.

      "text": "Netflix continued to lead in OTT marketing in October By Natan Edelsburg - 09 November 2016 13:00pm MediaRadar chart for Found Remote \nFound Remote has been partnering with MediaRadar , a leading ad-sales intelligence platform to understand how the major OTT platforms are diversifying their marketing efforts. \nFor the middle of October, Netflix kept up their lead. Here's the chart and full insights. \nInsights : Amazon dropped advertising from 7 shows to 4 shows, the majority of promotion went toward Good Girls Revolt across 28 TV networks! Good Girls Revolt won Amazon's \"you-rate-it, we make it\" pilot series last year and was developed into an Amazon original series. AOL's Connected was the single-most promoted show with promotion across 29 websites--up 16% from last week (and a record high for AOL this fall). Connected is getting noticed as the next true reality series--since the main characters film themselves--no camera crew or director is present. Then the thousands of hours of footage are later turned into episodes highlighting real-life conflicts. MotorTrend tripled their advertising. This is the first major advertising push for MotorTrend since the Emmys week. Advertising is still small compared to other OTT though. This significant increase accounts for MotorTrend promotion of Roadkill--their most popular webseries (and now a magazine). This show has even been deemed the Top Gear of the U.S. Netflix and Hulu both advertised 11 shows but with very different strategies. Netflix primarily targeted online (across 44 websites) with a mere 6 TV networks. Comparatively, Hulu more evenly dispersed marketing efforts across 26 websites and doubled TV advertising from last week to 25 TV networks--showing a big increase in ad spend. Netflix still reigns with top unique video ads with an increase of 45%--most of those spots were used to promote Luke Cage and Project Mc2. Project Mc2 is in season three and aimed at tween girls with tagline 'smart is the new cool.' \nMediaRadar revolutionizes the way ad sales teams do business. This innovative SaaS tool streamlines communication, delivers advanced analytics and quickly identifies new business opportunities. Through a customized intuitive dashboard, clients easily view analytics and actionable advertising insights for over 2.6 million brands. Instantly receive insights that combine TV and print with digital analysis, including new ad formats like online video, mobile, and native. MediaRadar can also pinpoint new business and determine revenue potential. It also helps sales reps plan their pipeline and prioritize the most important points to pitch. This amazing service eliminates the guesswork, so ad execs can focus their time pitching. MediaRadar is a cross-platform solution that is constantly innovating with the ad tech landscape. No longer is it necessary to piece together information from multiple tech products to build a pitch; ad teams can get all their information with ONE tool. \nThis article is about: North America , Found Remote , Media , Marketing , Brand Natan Edelsburg \nI help run the Shorty Awards (http://shortyawards.com) and Muck Rack (http://muckrack.com).

      "title": "Under-pressure Ubisoft plan new ventures in Netflix and mobile gaming",
      "text": "Under-pressure Ubisoft plan new ventures in Netflix and mobile gaming By \nYves Guillemot, the head of Ubisoft, outlined a number of new initiatives for the giant publisher, including a possible Netflix series, some huge mobile gaming acquisitions and hundreds of new jobs in France. \nHow many Ubisoft titles can you spot on our list of the best PC games ? \nThe news comes via Reuters , reporting from a news briefing on Monday. According to Guillemot, Ubisoft is “in talks with Netflix” about producing a TV series based on one of its videogame properties. This would be a new plank in Ubisoft’s growing multimedia platform, following its many novels, comics and, of course, the Assassin’s Creed movie, which hits cinemas on December 21. \nGuillemot also says Ubisoft are considering new acquisitions, primarily in the mobile gaming sector. For the right company, it seems his budget stretches quite a distance: Reuters quotes a price range of €50-100 million (up to $110.7 million US). Guillemot also says his company is considering hiring between 500 and 1,000 new staff in France over the next five years. \nThe bullish announcements come just as Vivendi, the vast media conglomerate, increased its stake in Ubisoft, sparking renewed chatter of a hostile takeover. Against this context, Guillemot reiterated his wish to keep Ubisoft independent, saying the company’s founding family was looking at ways they could retain control. Vivendi, for its part, has denied it is pursuing a hostile takeover bid as recently as October.",

      "text": "4 MCU Characters That Would Actually Make Sense On Marvel's Netflix Shows November 09, 2016 at 05:29AM By James Thomas @TheIntersect Posted by James Thomas @TheIntersect Writer, Graphic Designer, Husband, Father, Geek and Aspiring Scripter of Moving Pictures \nAt this point, it's pretty safe to say that the entertainment juggernaut of the #Disney -owned #Marvel Cinematic Universe (or #MCU ) is an unstoppable powerhouse, with blockbuster hit after blockbuster hit unfolding on theater screens multiple times a year with no end in sight. Likewise, the television division, which includes Marvel's #AgentsOfSHIELD on ABC and the massively popular shows on #Netflix , including #Daredevil and #LukeCage , are an equal force to be reckoned with. \nHowever, despite existing in the same universe, the two divisions haven't exactly been cooperating with each other ever since the film division — lead by MCU mastermind Kevin Feige, and Marvel Television, under the flags of Isaac Perlmutter and Jeph Loeb — split from each other. The shows still take place in the same universe — and often reference each other in less than direct ways — but there haven't been any guest stars or cameos ever since the split. \nNow, this isn't exactly an Earth-shattering moment by any means. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is still holding its own without the films, as made evident by this season's inclusion of #GhostRider and, likewise, the films have always managed to go on without AoS, as they don't even acknowledge the show's existence. Similarly, the Netflix shows are great, self-contained stories that fit nicely within the gaps between movies and haven't really needed any direct involvement in the films. The allusions to \"The Incident\" and references to iron suits and magic hammers are all they need to hold that weave together. \nDaredevil especially came into its own with a captivating second season that introduced us to classic comic characters Elektra, The Hand and the new MCU version of The Punisher (Jon Bernthal), who is now set to receive his own show in 2017. As Fans, Is That Really Enough? \nIt can't be denied that one of the MCU's biggest assets has been the crossover and the guest star appearances (or, at least cameos) of other characters. Ever since The Avengers came out, fans haven't really seemed interested in the solo adventure. Arguably, two of the best movies that Marvel has released since #TheAvengers — #CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier and #CivilWar — were basically Avengers 1.5 and Avengers 2.5 , respectively. \nEven the new characters being introduced to the MCU in their own solo films cannot do so without a major Avengers character making a guest appearance to ensure that the fan interest is there for these new, non-Robert Downey Jr. characters. Scott Lang Meeting Sam Wilson in ANT-MAN \nFans want more direct crossovers with the film and television sides of the MCU. I'm sorry, suit-wearing film executives, but they do. I know it. You know it. The world knows it. Is it necessary? Not particularly. But when building an entire world as massive as Marvel has, those guest appearances, cameos and crossovers help hold the fabric together the same as they do in the comic books on which they're based. \nThat said, I'm well aware that there's a lot of red tape involved. The two divisions split and that's not likely to be amended any time soon. However, if they could come to some sort of agreement to reintroduce guest appearances akin to Samuel L. Jackson's two turns on AoS, that would be fantastic. Not only would it help hold the two divisions together in one overall story, but it would allow for Daredevil, Luke Cage and The Punisher to mix it up in #AvengersInfinityWar , which is something that fans have been clamoring for ever since the film's announcement. It would also open up a whole new library of story possibilities for the Netflix shows to build off of going forward after the first outing of #TheDefenders hits in 2017. So, Which MCU Characters Would Make The Most Sense Crossing Over With Netflix? \nThere has been a lot of talk about Jeremy Renner doing a #Hawkeye series on Netflix, which doesn't seem like it would ultimately be too likely. However, there are four characters that could easily show up in smaller capacities on the existing shows and it would make perfect sense. 1. Doctor Strange \nThis is the obvious first choice for a variety of reasons. Not only did #DoctorStrange just blow up the box office with the debut of his first feature, setting him up as a possible contender to hold the films together after Iron Man, Thor and Captain America soon retire, but he also holds in his favor a lot of direct ties to characters in the Netflix corner of the MCU. \nThe good doctor's powers are rooted in the mystical and there is no doubt going to be some references to him in next year's #IronFist Netflix series. It would be great to see him show up in an episode or two of that show's inevitable second season. More than that, though, Doctor Strange is actually a founding member of the original Defenders in the comic books, as well as one of it's longest-running and most consistent members. While the red tape obviously won't be cleared up in time for The Defenders to air next year, perhaps he could be a major player in the bigger and better The Defenders 2 somewhere around 2019 or 2020. 2. Black Widow \nEveryone loves Scarlett Johansson. I mean, how could you not? She has been a tremendous asset to The Avengers , Iron Man and Captain America films as everyone's favorite Russian assassin. Fans the whole world over would love to see her in a solo film of her own — or at least a team-up film with Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye — but so far there are no confirmed plans. However, honestly (and I'm prepared for angry comments over this one), I don't feel like that is necessary. She has been built up as an amazing supporting character, similar to her comic book counterpart, and works best in that capacity. \nSo why not let her guest star on a few episodes of a Netflix show to broaden her character's horizons? \nLet's not forget that for a period of time in the comics, the Daredevil comic was actually titled Daredevil and the Black Widow and featured storylines wherein the two were partners and lovers. \nA two or three episode commitment from Scarlett Johansson on a future season of Daredevil would be an amazing story element that would help ground the show to its comic book roots and be a definite draw for fans. It wouldn't need to be anything elaborate or expensive, just a fun little bit of filler to bridge the two halves of the season as stakes start to get a bit higher going forward. 3. The Hulk \nThe Hulk has had a rough go at it in the MCU, to say the least. Following the relatively poor performance of The Incredible Hulk and the fact that there's still a lot of legal mumbo jumbo with Universal holding the distribution rights to his solo films, he's been relegated to a side character in the Avengers films. He's also set to be featured in #ThorRagnarok , which will be the closest we're apparently going to get to a Planet Hulk story on film. But does that need to be all we see of the not-so-jolly green giant? \nLike Doctor Strange, the Hulk is also a founding member of The Defenders and has been consistently featured in their adventures over the years. So why not bring him into the fold when The Defenders 2 inevitably hits the streaming service? And honestly, if cost is an issue over Mark Ruffalo, you don't necessarily need him. Clever editing could \"feature\" Bruce Banner and then the rest of the Hulk's appearances would be CGI. He wouldn't need to be a prominent character, either. The Hulk could smash up the climax of the season finale and it would be huge for audience enjoyment. 4. Namor The Sub-Mariner \nOK, so #Namor isn't exactly an MCU character...yet. Like the Hulk, his film rights were held by Universal and no progress was being made on getting a film in development. It's been rumored that the rights had lapsed and reverted back to Marvel, but it's also been hinted that Universal may still hold distribution rights the same way they do for Hulk. That would put Marvel in a tough spot with releasing the film. \nHowever, if the rights are back with Marvel, then a film will likely be what they do with him for a couple of reasons. The budget for a predominantly water-based superhero action film would be nuts. Also, with #WarnerBros and their #DCEU set to debut an #Aquaman film soon, it would make sense for Marvel to want to compete with them using their own (and significantly older) aquatic character. \nBut, like the characters above, Namor has close ties to The Defenders and also holds a spot as one of the founding members. If Namor were to grace the silver screen as one of the as yet untitled Marvel films slated for 2019/2020 then he could follow that up with a spot in The Defenders 2 or even The Defenders 3 . Or, if the legal tape were to be cleared up, maybe he could debut in The Defenders series and branch out into the films — similar to Tom Holland's #SpiderMan showing up in Civil War before taking back his own franchise. \nSo what do you think? Would you like to see MCU characters crossover with the Marvel Netflix shows? Or, do you think they work better on their own with subtle references? \nSound off in the comments below and don't forget to follow me on Twitter ( @ThisIsJamesT ) for all things rant and ravey.

      "text": "Sandman Is Perfect For TV Another writer has left 'Sandman' over creative differences [Credit: Vertigo Comics] \nIn an interview with io9, Heisserer announced his departure was because he had a different vision for how the story should be told. He said: \n\"I had many conversations with Neil [Gaiman] on this, and I did a lot of work on the feature and came to the conclusion that the best version of this property exists as an HBO series or limited series, not as a feature film, not even as a trilogy. \n\"The structure of the feature film really doesn’t mesh with this. So I went back and said here’s the work that I’ve done. This isn’t where it should be. It needs to go to TV. So I talked myself out of a job.\" \nThe trouble is, the Arrival screenwriter is right. The rich playground of the metaphysical is primed for television, and the studios stubborn stance is concerning. While Gordon-Levitt's departure was a significant blow due to his passion for the source material, Heisserer's is significant as it shows New Line Cinema are adamant on the feature format, despite this not necessarily being the best option. \nUnlike years gone by, #TV is no longer second best to the big screen. If the source material is relevant, the format can be much more effective. It allows the story to breathe, encourages character development and, crucially for Sandman , it gives plenty of time to construct a fictional world, slowly building complexities and idiosyncrasies. The Story Of The Seven Endless Dream of the Endless [Credit: Vertigo Comics] \nSandman focuses on the protagonist, Dream of the Endless (also referred to as Morpheus) — an omnipotent being who rules the world of dreams — and his quest to repair his Kingdom following 70 years imprisonment. Dream is one of Seven Endless, a group of all-powerful beings, made up of Destiny, Death, Desire, Despair, Delirium (formerly Delight) and Destruction. \nEach of the Endless serve as guardians of their particular realms, and the richness of Gaiman's fictional world lies within the depth of these worlds. Compared to a feature film, a TV show would allow each of these different destinations to be fully explored and beefed out, perhaps with an episode dedicated to each. \nAcross the 2,500 pages of material, there seems to be too much to compress into a feature, perhaps one of the main issues that has delayed the project for two decades. The necessity to change format is heightened by another Gaiman creation, #AmericanGods , which has been adapted for a TV show on Starz next year. \n#HBO have shown how the increased budgets on the small screen can create vast, fantastical worlds in the case of Game of Thrones . Another comic book adaptation, Preacher , illustrated the need for expansive storylines. That's not to mention the strength of #Netflix 's adaptations for the MCU. \nPersonally, I think the adventures of Sandman are perfectly suited to a 10 episode Netflix original. The streaming service has a great track record with TV, have shown with Marvel they can remain true to the source material, and the binge option would be an added bonus. \nSandman has the unfortunate label of \"unfilmable.\" Setback after setback has made the project a point of frustration for fans of the graphic novel series, but it is possible to pull it back from the brink. And that requires being filmed for the small screen, not the theater. Hopefully New Line Cinema will eventually agree. Poll Should Sandman be a TV show or a feature film? Definitely a TV show, there's too much to explore. A film. It needs to have the big budget blockbuster treatment. ",

      "text": "The Latest Trailer For Netflix's 'A Series Of Unfortunate Events' Explores Villain Count Olaf November 07, 2016 at 05:37PM By Jeremiah Paul @Jeremiahapaul Posted by Jeremiah Paul @Jeremiahapaul What's better than Superheroes? Not much. So I'm bringing you Everything Super. Verified Creator and member of the Rogues Gallery. \nIn case you haven't heard, Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events is getting the live action treatment once again. Recently, a brand new teaser trailer dropped and it's everything you would have hoped for. Titled \"Meet Count Olaf,\" Netflix has really delivered a terrific glimpse at what we can expect from this new version of the wonderful YA series. Everything We Know About Netflix's 'A Series Of Unfortunate Events' \nBefore we jump in, let's take a look at the trailer: \nToday, we'll be breaking down the trailer to take a look at what makes Count Olaf such a unique and wonderful villain! Olaf's Strange Fascination With The Baudelaire Children \nOne of the things I always found interesting about Count Olaf was his determination to make the lives of the Baudelaire children awful. He continuously chases them, doing everything he can to be in their lives and mess them up. From the very beginning of the trailer we hear \"[Count Olaf] said specifically he was waiting very eagerly to get his hands on you.\" And from that forward moment we know that the Baudelaire children are in for a unfortunate series of events. The Mysterious Clues About Who Olaf Really Is \nA few seconds later we see a blueprint being unrolled; at the top of the blueprint it reads \"EXT DR. MONTGOMERY MONTGOMERY.\" This is, of course, a map to Uncle Monty's house and, presumably, maze-like gardens. The children notice a symbol on the map, the same exact symbol that Count Olaf has tattooed on his ankle. A bit later in the trailer we also see a bald man, who I would guess is The Bald Man (one of Olaf's henchman), get lost in a hedge maze. It would make sense if Uncle Monty had planted these hedges in hopes of keeping people out, whether those people be seeking to harm the Baudelaire children or looking to steal Uncle Monty's research. A Nod To Olaf's Many Disguises \nOne of the things the Count is best known for is his fondness for disguises. Throughout the series, Olaf has won dozens of disguises to trick those tasked with caring for the Baudelaire children. Typically the children see through these disguises yet the adults rarely manage the same feat. In the trailer we can hear Klaus say, \"He's in disguise and trying to take us away.\" We Learn Of Count Olaf's 'Charming' Traits \nAfter establishing that Count Olaf is, in fact, a creep, we see several shots of Olaf from behind (as his face hasn't been revealed yet) while several characters discuss the evil man in voiceover. Someone calls him a \"vile, terrible person\" and another describes him as a \"thief and a murderer\" who has managed to completely evade arrest for all these years. We continue to get shots of the Count (all of which still cleverly cover his face) as words are thrown at us such as \"villain,\" \"wretch,\" \"horrible,\" and \"awful,\" all of which are clearly not compliments. This series of adjectives and the imagery of the Count, coupled with the dramatic music, really paints the kind of character we can expect from Neil Patrick Harris once the show debuts on Netflix in January. The Big Reveal Of Count Olaf \nIn the closing moments of the trailer, Count Olaf is finally revealed in all of his, er, glory. Neil Patrick Harris quite literally steps out of the shadows and creepily tells the children, \"You haven't the faintest idea.\" And with that the trailer closes with the title card and release date. \nPersonally, I'm very excited for A Series of Unfortunate Events . It's a wonderful series of books that deserves a faithful live-action adaptation. The only way to truly capture the spirit and depth of the world Lemony Snicket created is through a television series, and I'm glad Netflix has seized that opportunity as they have a phenomenal track record when it comes to producing content. I'm not entirely sold on the idea of NPH portraying Count Olaf — he just doesn't seem right to me — but I've been wrong about casting choices before and will go in with an open mind. After being introduced to Count Olaf through this teaser trailer, I'm definitely intrigued to see what else is to come. \nSee Also: ",

      "text": "Netflix's 'Haters Back Off' Brings YouTube To TV Yet Again: Why This Show Actually Works November 08, 2016 at 05:27PM Posted by NerdTranslation @nerdtranslation I'm just a nerdy kid who learned to use the internet! \nA few weeks back, Netflix brought us a brand new a comedy featuring a character you may have heard of before. YouTube sensation Miranda Sings brings her \"bootiful\" singing voice to a whole new platform. Haters Back Off chronicles the inception of Miranda's YouTube career and introduces us to the strange world we always knew surrounded her. This show combines the dry awkward feel of Napoleon Dynamite with the cringe-worthy family insanity of Arrested Development and it's absolutely brilliant. This show brings YouTube to TV and it works so well. My question is why? \nOther YouTubers have made their way to television and film with less success. Why does Miranda Sings succeed where so many others haven't? Let's take a look at Haters in comparison, and discover what makes it work so well. Not Just Kids \nOne of the first YouTube to TV transitions came from Fred . He was quite possibly the most annoying human being ever to exist, but for a short time in the fourth grade he was hilarious for some unexplained reason. Fred started out strong with a TV movie on Nickelodeon. But he lost his audience pretty quick. By the time Fred: The Show came around, we fourth graders were sixth graders, and he had lost his appeal. Fred 's YouTube audience was mainly kids, and as we all know, kids are fickle. Shows like React to That and The High Fructose Adventures of the Annoying Orange faced similar challenges. \nSo why is Haters different? It's clear from the show's start that it's not made for kids only. In fact I'd actually say that young kids may not even understand most of the humor. This show definitely wanted to appeal to a wide range of age groups. It's humor had my teenage sister, my middle age parents, and my twenty something self all laughing together, which to me, is a challenge that most shows fail to overcome. Haters Back Off appeals to a very wide audience. Translating YouTube \nI had such high hopes for The Grace Helbig Show . Grace was and is one of the most lovable comedians on YouTube. Her videos dive into pop culture from the comfort of Grace's home. E! tried to capture that and bring it to TV and as much as I love Grace, it just didn't work. Trying to do a internet savvy, YouTube-esque, talk show in a house was just to disorienting. The show actually seemed hard for the star as well. She faced the challenge of addressing her YouTube fame and trying to build a TV audience at the same time. \nThe concept of Haters Back Off fixed this problem instantly. The show doesn't feel like it's trying to be a 30 minute YouTube video. The show creates a framework that actually enriches Miranda's videos. She often posts 6 minute rants about people \"hating on her\" or \"being porn\" (which is Miranda's word for inappropriate) and they often referenced her previously unseen family. Haters lets us see into Miranda's life and see the events that surrounded this and that video, which makes the videos even more fun to watch. In my mind that's absolute genius and the show's creators, Colleen Ballinger and her older brother Chris, deserve all the recognition I can give. The Netflix Appeal \nThere is one common element involved in each of the previously mentioned shows, which I think could be the reason they weren't as good: Network television. Each of these shows faced huge challenges in bringing their brand to TV. On top of that, each show had to face network executives and all of their research and analytics that pile on top of creators, making the challenge almost impossible. \nWatching Colleen Ballinger's behind the scenes videos of Haters really proved that Netflix is different. Netflix hired two creative people, and then they let them create what they envisioned. The show seems to be an uninhibited artistic creation from the minds of the Ballinger siblings. There was no network or censorship bureau or board of directors to please and make changes for. This show seems to be exactly what it's creators intended. You can sort of feel it in each episode. You can tell that Haters Back Off came from the exact same people who make the videos we love. It's creative, artistic, and refreshing. \nI have nothing but praise for Haters Back Off . It succeeds where other shows have failed. Colleen and Chris Ballinger had the talent and the resources to bring YouTube to TV successfully. I hope we get to see more of Miranda and her shenanigans in a second season. \nMore than that, I hope that the networks will see this show and learn. YouTubers get famous all on their own. They don't need to be tweaked or fixed. All they need are resources, support, and respect to shine, just like the uniquely amazing Miranda Sings. Poll What do you think of 'Haters Back Off!'? It's dicussting! I hate it! Why would you show me that?! It's the most bootifulest thing I've ever seen! Trending from our Creators ",

      "text": "[email protected] \nBarbara Holland became one of the most beloved characters on Netflix's #StrangerThings , despite only being around for a measly 3-episode arc which ended in her tragic death at the hands of the Demogorgon. She was beloved for her over-sized glasses, mom jeans and tell-it-like-it-is attitude, and emerged as the unsung hero of the hit #Netflix show. Barb was played to perfection by emerging actor Shannon Purser, who recently revealed a personal and moving message about her history with self harm on Twitter , proving she's just as fearless as the character she plays on #TV . *TRIGGER WARNING* I haven't self-harmed in years, but I kept this around, \"just in case.\" I forgot it was there & now it's in the trash. pic.twitter.com/C0oAQTL0IM — Shannon Purser (@shannonpurser) November 7, 2016 \nAlong with the Tweet which reads, \"I haven't self-harmed in years, but I kept this around, \"just in case.\" I forgot it was there & now it's in the trash,\" she added: Recovery is possible. Please don't give up on yourself. — Shannon Purser (@shannonpurser) November 7, 2016 \nMore Stranger Things : ",

      "text": "'Young Justice' Season 3 Is A Go! Here Are 4 New Characters That We're Sure To See November 07, 2016 at 08:15PM By Liam Dixon @Speedy97 Posted by Liam Dixon @Speedy97 Awkward geeky teen writer. Form an orderly queue ladies \nUPDATED November 7, 2016: The dream has finally become a reality. Young Justice Season 3 is officially happening ! Read on to find out what four characters are almost certain to turn up in the third season in response to the storylines set in motion in Season 2. \nOriginal article: Series writer Peter David has revealed to a fan that Netflix approached him about a third season of Young Justice . Just hearing that and watching the original trailer is enough to get me pumped. \nThis comes a few months after Young Justice creator Greg Weisman called for fans to keep watching the series on Netflix in the hopes of giving the show new life. A Redditor states that he spoke to David at TerrificCon in Connecticut about Young Justice and the possibility of a third season. David reaffirmed the fan that Young Justice was cancelled due to its large female demographic translating to poor toy sales and not because of viewing figures or lack of overall quality. \nDavid then followed this up with a statement that is sure to excite every Young Justice fan around the globe by saying that Netflix, after seeing the viewing figures for Young Justice , approached him about a possible third season. \nDon't get excited yet, as Netflix are yet to confirm or announce Young Justice Season 3. And after the news broke, David himself tweeted to deny it. @Greg_Weisman @Kster95 Yeah, that's a total misquote. Meetings are just wishful thinking at this point. — Peter David (@PeterDavid_PAD) August 22, 2016 \nHowever, that Redditor stands by his statement. But where there's smoke, there's often fire, so it's impossible to think that a Young Justice Season 3 isn't looking more likely. \nSo let's assume that we are getting a third season of #YoungJustice sooner or later. If that's the case, we have to look at where the show is going. The show was left on a cliffhanger, with Darkseid confirmed to be in league with The Light, and Wally West sacrificing himself and possibly becoming one with the Speed Force. The Season 2 finale left a lot of hints about what we can expect from a potential Season 3 and what new characters might be introduced. 1. Red Hood: A Replacement For Arsenal Arsenal and Red Hood \nI'm sure everyone saw this coming. The Season 2 finale left us with a monumental Easter egg that hinted toward Jason Todd, a.k.a. the second Robin, a.k.a. Red Hood appearing in Season 3. Toward the end of the episode when Artemis and Bart talk at Wally's memorial, the camera cuts to Wonder Girl and Tim Drake welcoming Static to the team. Standing adjacent to them is none other than the memorial of Jason Todd, the second Robin. R.I.P. Jason Todd \nThis is the second time that Todd's memorial has appeared in the second season, as it was previously seen next to Artemis' memorial. The shows writers teased the death of Jason Todd throughout Season 2, and with the inclusion of Tim Drake as Robin, I'd bet my mortgage that Jason Todd was murdered at some point during the show's 5-year jump forward between Seasons 1 and 2. \nThe team is in need of a replacement for Arsenal, and who better to replace him than Red Hood? 2. Black Flash: Coming Out Of The Speed Force Flash vs. Black Flash \nLet's just put this out there: Wally is not dead. It is safe to say that Wally has simply vanished into the Speed Force so it is only a matter of time before his eventual return. Of course, as many of us The Flash fans know, tampering with the Speed Force has some severe consequences. If Wally returns to Earth, he will be chased by the Black Flash. Wally West went into the Speed Force, and he's coming back out with Black Flash. \nFor those who don't know about the Black Flash, it is essentially the manifestation of death in the DC Universe. It has appeared before the deaths of Bart Allen and once attempted to take Wally West back into the Speed Force. The later is significant as I believe Young Justice could be setting up a rather important moment from Wally's history. \nWhen the Black Flash attempted to take Wally back into the Speed Force, Wally raced him to the end of time itself. Yep, Wally West ran to the end of time causing the Black Flash to dissipate. With Wally being the weaker of the three speedsters at the end of Season 2, making the character run to the end of time and back will surely develop the character's power and make him more than ready to handle the invasion of Season 3's main villain. Which brings us to... 3. Darkseid: The Main Baddie Of Season 3 Darkseid \nIntroduced at the very end of Season 2, Darkseid will definitely become the main antagonist for Season 3. He was teased to be the ringleader of The Light, the main antagonists for the first two seasons, so for Darkseid to be the man behind everything that has transpired thus far makes him even more of a foe to be reckoned with. \nHe set up six of the League's big hitters to be sentenced and orchestrated Vandal Savage's takeover of the Justice League, all while remaining in the shadows. The fact that he almost broke the Justice League on two occasions without revealing himself makes you wonder what damage he will do when he gets to earth with his army. 4. Supergirl: Experience Battling Darkseid \nThe team is going to need someone more experienced to fight alongside Superboy in the upcoming war against Darkseid. Sure they have Wonder Girl, but she doesn't have the sheer raw strength of Supergirl. \nDarkseid's history with Superman has caused Supergirl to get involved in their feuds over the course of many years. She has most notably appeared in Batman/Superman: Apocalypse where she was under the control of Darkseid and later turned against him. \nThere is no doubt that she has a rich history with Darkseid, and considering that Superman is the only main member of the Justice League not to introduce a protege (he later took on Conor in the role), now would be a prime time to introduce Supergirl. Supergirl \nOf course there are many other characters that could be coming to Young Justice Season 3, but I wanted to list the ones that are without a doubt on their way. Who knows, we may even see Oracle, the New Gods or maybe even Rip Hunter. Young Justice isn't shy when it comes to introducing new and obscure characters - Rocket and Icon - so it will be interesting to see who they will bring in over the course of Season 3. \nCan't get enough Young Justice?

      "text": "Scripps Networks Interactive will not be renew a streaming deal with Netflix when it expires at year's end, COO Burton Jablin said Monday on the company's earnings conference call.\nHe explained that the company made the \"strategic decision\" because the arrangement does not provide the kind of dual revenue model that Scripps feels best monetizes its content.\nChairman, president and CEO Kenneth Lowe also highlighted the focus on dual revenue streams, meaning advertising and distribution revenue.\nScripps announced the Netflix streaming deal in late 2014 after a yearlong deal with Amazon.\nLowe on Monday also was asked about the AT&T-Time Warner acquisition, saying his takeaway from the deal was that \"content is valuable.\"\nAsked if he felt Scripps needed to get bigger, he said: \"Our results speak for themselves. It's a question I think I have been getting for 20 some years. It's about the quality of the brands\" and ensuring the company owns channels that are \"relevant\" and \"valuable\" to distribution partners, whether they are six or 20 channels.\n\"We're perfectly happy sitting here domestically with six brands that are performing very well,\" Lowe concluded. \"Yeah, we're big enough. It's going to continue to be a consolidated world, but that's been the case for the past 15 years. We have seen consolidation on the cable distribution side. It's just now there's getting to be some heft.\"\nScripps on Monday also detailed that its recent deal with Tribune Media to extend their Food Network partnership will run for four years. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.\nRead more: Scripps Networks Third-Quarter Earnings Exceed Estimates",

      "text": "By jessica rawden 2 minutes ago \nNetflix has been dropping content left and right in recent months. Some of this content has been dropped so that Netflix can replace it with original TV programming and movies that will have a longer life on the streaming service. However, some of this content isn't leaving Netflix because Netflix no longer wants to shell out cash for it; instead, some of this content is leaving Netflix of its own free will. Recent reports indicate that HGTV and other channels, like the Food Network, the Travel Channel, the Cooking Channel, and DIY will all see content disappearing from the subscription streaming service, and soon. \nNormally, at the beginning of the month, we get a list of stuff that is coming and leaving Netflix. This list often includes a few TV shows, but at the end of the year, we expect a very different email because a lot of shows from a lot of different networks are going to disappear. Scripps Network Interactive, which owns all of the aforementioned networks, has decided it no longer wants a partnership with Netflix. Per Fox News , the company looked at their earnings on traditional networks and the monetary gain they were also pulling from Netflix and decided it wasn't really working out. Here's the direct quote from the HGTV parent company's CEO Buton Jablin. \nWe assessed and analyzed the S-VOD [streaming video-on-demand] universe and have made the strategic decision not to extend our S-VOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year. In the end, it is really not the kind of dual revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long-term. \nUnfortunately, this means that episodes of a lot of popular shows are going to be leaving Netflix. First and foremost, users will have to say goodbye to Fixer Upper , the Waco, Texas rehabbing series starring Chip and Joanna Gaines that has nabbed a lot of attention over the years and is prepping to premiere its fourth season later this month. We'll also have to say goodbye to the cast of Property Brothers , Love It or List It and more---and that's just the HGTV shows. \nEpisodes of popular properties from other networks, including Food Network Star and Worst Cooks In America will also be leaving the service. For some of these Scripps Network Interactive Shows, this won't be as big of a deal. For instance, Netflix only had a selection of House Hunters episodes that have occasionally been swapped out, anyway, but for other shows, entire seasons or series will be missing. \nPeople have been talking for years about how adding content to a subscription streaming service could theoretically keep some households from making the investment in traditional cable. However, the short term gains the major networks have been making by selling stuff to Netflix or Hulu or whatever had until recently trumped any long-term planning. Then, last year, HGTV was one of the most viable cable properties out there, and even saw major ratings increases in a landscape that has been seeing live TV viewership drop. \nIt may not make sense for every channel to drop out of the streaming game, but while the going is still good, HGTV and other channels are going to try to pull as many live numbers as possible and make profit elsewhere. To find out what just left the streaming service, take a look at our list for November.

      "title": "Netflix Moves to Kill Relativity's $1.5 Billion Lawsuit",
      "text": "Netflix is moving rather quickly to put an end to the $1.5 billion lawsuit filed three weeks ago by Ryan Kavanaugh's Relativity Media. On Monday, the streaming giant filed a motion to strike Relativity's complaint and took some vindication in the film studio's troubles since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nThe two sides have been engaged in a legal war since the beginning of the year. Netflix initially opposed Relativity's restructuring and later insisted it had the right to stream Masterminds, a comedy starring Zach Galifianakis, and The Disappointments Room, a horror film that features Kate Beckinsale, ahead of their theatrical release. A bankruptcy judge rejected Netflix's \"bad faith\" gambit to escape a licensing deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In mid-October, Relativity went on the offensive with a complaint against Netflix in Santa Clara Superior Court alleging breach of contract and trade libel.\nAccording to Relativity, Netflix wasn't loyal and the attempt to undercut the studio forced Relativity to be put up for sale. A big stake in Relativity was recently sold to Singapore web giant YuuZoo.\n\"Although the Bankruptcy Court ultimately permitted Relativity to assume the 2010 agreement, Netflix's objections proved prescient: post-bankruptcy Relativity would flounder,\" states Netflix in court papers demanding Relativity's lawsuit be stricken under California's anti-SLAPP law.\nRelativity asserts that Netflix has spreadstatements to press outlets, producers and talent agencies.\nNetflix responds that the statements disparaging Relativity's ability to theatrically release films emanate from the bankruptcy proceedings and are thus privileged in furtherance of its right to petition under the First Amendment.\n\"It does not matter whether they were made with malice or not,\" adds Netflix.\nUnder California law, if a judge accepts that the objectionable statements fall within the ambit of the SLAPP law, it's the plaintiff's duty to demonstrate a probability of prevailing before the case moves any further.\nNetflix argues that Relativity's libel claim falls short for two other reasons besides statements being non-specified and privileged.\n\"First, Relativity has failed to properly plead an essential element of its trade libel cause of action - pecuniary loss - because the Complaint includes only a bare allegation of loss and does not identify particular transactions or relationships that allegedly were interfered with,\" states Netflix's court papers.\n\"Second, Relativity cannot show that the statements are \" continues Netflix. \"Relativity's inability to theatrically release the required number of films was demonstrated in the bankruptcy court; it is now a simple matter of historical fact. The other statements - that Relativity's 'business model was flawed,' and that Relativity would be unable to implement its Plan - cannot be proven true orbecause they are statements of opinion, not fact. They are therefore not actionable.\"\nAs for Relativity's contract claims, Netflix's attorney Stephen Mick writes the parties fought each other over interpretation of the licensing deal, and the dispute was already litigated in bankruptcy court. As such, Netflix argues all of this - including correspondence in connection with the bankruptcy matters - are covered by privilege as well.",

      "text": "A reader sent a message this week asking about my preferred method for watching Netflix on a TV. Such a simple question. So many different answers.\nSince they asked, I'm guessing they don't have a smart TV, one with a built-in Netflix app. So we are talking about adding a streaming box to their current TV.\nFor this, you should have an open HDMI port on the TV. Almost all the choices we'll talk about here need to connect to your TV via HDMI.\nNow we need to ask a few questions that might lead us to a specific box.\nDo you have any brand allegiances? For instance, do you have Macs (or iPads or iPhones) at home that would make you predisposed to picking Apple TV ($149.99)?\nAre you a subscriber to Amazon's Prime service? Amazon has a video streaming service that's included in the Prime subscription. The easiest and cheapest way to take advantage of Prime video is through an Amazon Fire TV Stick ($39.99).\nRoku also makes a full line of streaming devices that can be added to any TV. The easiest and most inexpensive is its Streaming Stick, which is on sale for $39.99 at Roku.com. The Roku has the most video sources, both free and paid, including Netflix.\nApple TV is nice. It has a bunch of apps to stream different video services, and it has games, but at such a price premium, I can't recommend it for people who want simple streaming.\nI should also mention Google's Chromecast ($35), which is a streaming dongle you attach to your TV's HDMI port. It enables you to \"cast\" video playing from your phone or tablet or computer to your TV screen.\nThis means that the device you already have (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Chromebook) is the source and Chromecast is the receiver.\nCasting a show or movie isn't difficult, but it's not the easiest choice. So if all you want is Netflix, the cheapest and simplest way is either Amazon's or Roku's streaming sticks.\nOf those two, I'd say Roku has a bit cleaner interface.",

      "text": "  \nWarning: If you don’t want to spend the next couple of weekends watching lots and lots of television, avoid the following episodes at all costs! \nNew data released by Netflix on Wednesday revealed which specific episodes from 25 different television programs hooked a viewer into watching the full season. What type of television sorcery did Netflix use to unearth this information, you ask? According to a press release , the streaming company analyzed its global streaming data to determine which episode often inspired viewers to continue watching. The data concluded that 70% of viewers who watched the “hooked episode” went on to complete the entire season. \nWhile different types of shows may take a little longer to hook viewers, Netflix’s data suggests that it takes more than just the pilot episode for a viewer to become enamored with a series. \n“Given the precious nature of primetime slots on traditional TV, a series pilot is arguably the most important point in the life of the show,” said Netflix’s Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos in a statement . “However, in our research of more than 20 shows across 16 markets, we found that no one was ever hooked on the pilot. This gives us confidence that giving our members all episodes at once is more aligned with how fans are made.” \nWe’ve taken all 25 programs used in the study and grouped them together by how many episodes it takes to become hooked. Enjoy! \nHooked after episode two",

      "text": "Elektra is Returning for The Defenders \nIt’s no secret that Netflix has become more of a TV network than a movie streaming service. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as they’ve put out some of our favorite new TV shows of the last few years. But a lot of their oldest subscribers didn’t join Netflix to watch TV. For them, it was all about the movies. You know flicks. On the ‘net. So you can imagine the streaming service’s increased focus on TV has caused a fair amount of frustration for film buffs. But, as recent research found, they might not want to cancel their subscriptions just yet. \nAccording to Streaming Observer , Netflix still has the best catalog of movies out there, in terms of quality. Just not quantity. The number of movies available to stream on Netflix has certainly declined. At the beginning of the month, Streaming Observer pointed out that the site only has 31 of IMDB’s top 250 movies in its streaming library. That means Netflix’s chances of having a popular movie you’ve heard of is lower than it once was. But, using a tool on Rotten Tomatoes that allows you to see the “Certified Fresh” movies available across a number of streaming services, the site found that Netflix still has the largest catalog of critically acclaimed films around. \nAlthough Netflix only has 15 percent of the movies Rotten Tomatoes rates as “Certified Fresh,” that adds up to 357 (ostensibly) great movies. That’s over 100 more than its closest competitor, Amazon Prime. HBO Now only has 52, but let’s be honest. The movies on HBO Now are really just there to keep you occupied between seasons of Game of Thrones and now Westworld . Hulu has a solid movie collection too. (Photo: Screenshot via Hulu.) \nIt’s worth noting that Rotten Tomatoes doesn’t keep track of the movies available on Hulu, which likely has a fair amount of “Certified Fresh” or at the very least objectively great movies, given its large library of classics, including Rocky and Fargo as of this writing. \nSo Netflix has around 357 movies that are worth watching, many of which even serious movie buffs may not have seen or even heard of yet. That’s still not going to be enough for a lot of people, though. If you’re serious about having access to a large streaming catalog of great films, one service isn’t going to do it for you. You’ll want to hang on to Netflix, but it’ll also be worth looking into Amazon Prime, Hulu and possibly a specialty service. Shudder is great for horror; Mubi is for indie flicks, and there’s also FilmStruck, Ted Turner’s new-ish service that has an impressive catalog of classic movies. \nOr you could just buy every movie you like, rip the discs and keep them all on your own private server. That actually might end up being cheaper in the long run. Plus you won’t have to worry about your movies disappearing each month. Share",

      "text": "Brian Gallagher | 15 minutes ago \nProduction began this week on Netflix's crime fantasy thriller Bright , with Will Smith and Joel Edgerton spotted on the Los Angeles set in the first photos. Our initial report revealed that this story is set in a world where humans live side-by-side with orcs and faeries, which is represented in this photo by the human cop played by Will Smith and his orc partner played by Joel Edgerton, both of whom are seen wearing medals. The scene in question appears to take place at a memorial service for fallen police officers, but no further details were revealed. \nThe first photos surfaced on Just Jared , with others surfacing on various Twitter accounts. This project reunites Will Smith with his Suicide Squad director David Ayer , who is directing from a script by Max Landis (Chronicle, American Ultra). There was originally talk that Warner Bros. would pick up this project, in hopes of putting it on the fast track for David Ayer to direct, before he starts work on Suicide Squad 2, but that didn't exactly happen. \nInstead, a bidding war sparked between Netflix, Warner Bros. and MGM offering to pay upwards of $50 million for the project, while Palmstar reportedly offered to pay $4 million for Max Landis ' script, and $60 million for the entire project. Netflix won this bidding war by paying $3 million for the script and $90 million for the entire package, $45 million of which will go towards the production budget. David Ayer and Max Landis are also producing with Eric Newman and Bryan Unkeless. \nThe story follows Will Smith and Joel Edgerton 's characters who work for a police division that handles crimes involving magic. Their world turns upside down when they come into possession of a powerful and highly illegal magic wand. The cast also includes Lucy Fry as an elf named Tikka who possesses the wand and comes under the protection of these cops. The supporting cast also includes Chris Browning, Andrea Navedo, Brad William Henke and Nadia Sloane. \nNetflix hasn't announced when Bright may be released, or if it will get a limited theatrical release as well. The streaming service gave its first narrative feature, Beasts of No Nation, a limited theatrical release for awards consideration last year, in tandem with its debut on Netflix.

      "text": "GHOST RIDER Actor Implies NETFLIX X-Over / Spin-off Possible By George Marston, Newsarama Contributor November 9, 2016 09:41am ET Credit: ABC \nGabriel Luna's Ghost Rider could make the leap from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to teaming up with the Defenders , or even his own spin-off, according to the actor. \n\"It's been talked about. There's definitely deals in place for that potential,\" Luna told Comicbook when asked if Ghost Rider might team up with the Defenders, or even receive his own spin-off show. \"People talk about, 'Ah man, he'd be great as a feature,' which is an idea too... It could be in the cinema, it could live on Netflix, whatever it is.\" \nWhile this is not confirmation that a crossover or spin-off is being planned, or even could happen, it likely means that Luna's contract as Ghost Rider could allow him to appear in other places or eventually land his own series. \nLuna went on to say what he'd really like to see is more \"West Coast superheroes,\" saying he'd be interested in a Midnight Sons-style team-up with Blade and the Punisher. The groundwork for a Midnight Sons team up may already be in place, with the Book of the Darkhold having made an appearance on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. \nLuna currently appears as Ghost Rider on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. , which airs Tuesday nights on ABC Similar content",

      "text": "What we learned about Marvel movies and Netflix shows from Comic-Con \nIt has been a long week, and it is only Wednesday. Thankfully, Wednesday is the best day of the week, being that it is new comic book day. A bunch of great comics came out today, but this column is meant to focus on that one particular, must have comic that should be in everyone’s stack for the week. For my first installment, I am looking at Black Panther: World of Wakanda #1, by writers Ta-Nehisi Coates, Roxanne Gay, and Yona Harvey, as well as artists Alitha Martinez and Afua Richardson. via Marvel Comics \nWorld of Wakanda is an unprecedented comic, for a lot of reasons. Let’s get this out of the way right now, World of Wakanda is a good comic book. I would go as far as to say a great comic. It is worth buying on those merits alone. Beautifully written, with great art on the main story and the backup, it is one of the best books I have read from Marvel or DC in awhile. However, what makes World of Wakanda especially interesting is the context in which it exists. \nTo begin, it is a spin-off of Marvel’s recent, successful Black Panther series, also written by Ta-Nehisi Coates. Black Panther is one of the first examples of a character that was previously relegated to being a C or D lister, elevated to the frontlines of superhero comic books through his inclusion in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Similar to how Doctor Strange recently received not only his own solo-series but also a spin-off series called Doctor Strange and the Sorcerers Supreme , right around the same time that his movie released. WoW is also made by a creative team comprised solely of people of color. The comic book industry, especially superhero comics, tend to be a straight, white, able-bodied men. This makes Roxanne Gay, who is coming off of her success with her book Bad Feminist, is one of the first woman of color to work for the company in a creative sense. Lastly, it starts two African women of color who are also in a same-sex relationship, further setting itself apart from the “traditional” superhero comic. via Marvel Comics \nAgain, the book is great on its own. It manages to be a fun introduction to Wakanda, while also doing wonders with the characters, having the reader solidly invested in the leads by the end of issue one. This book is special, and even if it isn’t your cup of tea, we need more comics created by and starring, people of color, and we need to support those comics, especially when they are as great as this one. via DC Comics \nWhile World of Wakanda is my personal favorite for the week, there are plenty of honorable mentions as so many great comics come out this week. The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows #1 by Gerry Conway and Ryan Stegman takes us back to a world where Spider-Man and Mary Jane get married and have a daughter together. Doom Patrol #3 by Gerard Way and Nick Derrington keeps bringing the weird and wacky to the table. Finally, Mother Panic #1 by writer Jody Houser and artist Tommy Lee Edwards brings a new rich vigilante to Gotham. \nAll available on Comixology .",

      "title": "Ubisoft Netflix TV Series May Be Coming, But Which Video Game Property Will It Be?",
      "text": "\nNobody outside of Netflix knows exactly how many people watch anything on everyone’s default streaming service, but the numbers are high enough for everyone involved to keep investing in original shows and movies. They’re also large enough to attract major talents. Netflix is responsible for an upcoming Will Smith movie. A Will Smith movie!\nWhich brings us to today’s little morsel of news: Ubisoft , the video game publisher responsible for its fair share of popular titles, is looking to get into the Netflix business. With a Ubisoft Netflix tv series possibly in the works, which video game property might they be looking at for a small screen tv show?\n\nThe news comes our way in a brief Reuters article that offers no details beyond Ubisoft being “in talks with Netflix over a series.” These discussions arrive a little over a month before Assassin’s Creed , the first film produced by the company’s film division, hits theaters.\nUbisoft first started dipping its toe in the movie and television pool back in 2011 with the creation of Ubisoft Motion Pictures, a division of the company dedicated to bringing their various titles out of the video game world and into other mediums. Their first project, the animated series Rabbids Invasion (based on characters from the Raving Rabbids series), premiered in 2013 and is currently airing its third season.\nSo let’s go ahead and assume that the Rabbids characters and Assassin’s Creed are both off the table for whatever Ubisoft is cooking up with Netflix. What series could justify an ongoing show on Netflix? We know that film adaptations of Splinter Cell , The Division , Far Cry , Ghost Recon , and Watch Dogs are all being developed, but it’s easy to imagine one of those breaking away and getting the television treatment. After all, an action and espionage story like Splinter Cell would work quite well as a serialized story, and we haven’t heard much about the film adaptation starring Tom Hardy for quite some time.\nRight now, all eyes are surely on Assassin’s Creed , a movie that could (maybe, hopefully, possibly) shatter the video game movie curse . The combination of star Michael Fassbender and director Justin Kurzel is a step or three above the regular video game adaptation. It could buck the trend and be, you know, a good movie. If it’s a hit, I certainly wouldn’t put it past Ubisoft to create a companion series that further explores this world. Especially since they annualized the Assassin’s Creed games and made sure a new chapter was released every year like clockwork for a while (often to their detriment, if we’re being honest).\nIf something comes of this, we’ll let you know.\nThe post Ubisoft Netflix TV Series May Be Coming, But Which Video Game Property Will It Be? appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "\n**Warning: Though The Crown is a historical account of the life of Queen Elizabeth, this article may include spoilers.**\nThe new series by Netflix, The Crown , is a resounding success, but like all good shows which are offered a season at a time, fans are yearning for more. But luckily, the creator of The Crown , Peter Morgan, has season two in the works, and has promised more to come in telling the tale of the Windsors.\nPlans for the rest of the series, The Crown , have been leaking out, including the idea that Claire Foy and Matt Smith will not return for season three of The Crown, says the Inquisitr . It does make sense to some degree, that as Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip age, the youthful Foy and Smith will find it hard to adapt in a believable manner.\nEn un día complicado, hablemos de una #serie maravillosa con una historia sorprendente: #TheCrown https://t.co/7gp1HtyBAu pic.twitter.com/wfsObJFtQX \n— Soledad Venesio (@MissJulepina) November 9, 2016 \n\nThe first part of The Crown focuses on the events that lead to Princess Elizabeth becoming Queen Elizabeth, and the human face of the crown as a young woman, with a family, waking up one morning to bear the weight of the monarchy. The Hollywood Reporter got the opportunity to sit down with Peter Morgan to discuss the nuanced tale of Elizabeth Rex .\nRELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR\nNew Series ‘The Crown’ Is The Most Expensive Yet By Netflix \nUnlocking The Secret Netflix To Watch Even More Movies Than You… \nOne Of Queen Elizabeth’s Last Welsh Corgis Has Died \nOne of the things that Morgan had to address was the differing levels of knowledge that each viewer has when they come to The Crown , as some are learning the modern history of Queen Elizabeth’s monarchy for the first time. Many people got their first dose the the era prior to where The Crown starts by watching Colin Firth play Elizabeth’s father, King George IV or Bertie, as his family called him in The King’s Speech. Other knew the story of his brother, who abdicated for American divorcee Wallace Warfield Simpson, but Morgan said he just used his judgement in deciding what to emphasize.\n“I think I have to trust my own instincts and I have to think to myself, “If I don’t know it then I think we can pretty much assume that other people won’t know it on this particular field.” If it interests me, I also sort of think, ‘Well, gosh, if it interests me then I’m going to hope that it interests others’.”\nI am watching The Crown #TelfieApp #thecrown https://t.co/bI60R1Vquz \n— Julia Gray Carswell (@JSweit8573) November 9, 2016 \n\nThough Netflix has shared that the plan for The Crown is to tell the full story of the reign of Queen Elizabeth in six seasons, Morgan admits that in terms of writing, he can’t think beyond season two at this time.\n“I’ve got to be honest with you. I cannot think beyond season two and I’m not going to think beyond season two. Of course by virtue of the fact that we continue to have Prime Ministers and the Queen has continued to stay alive and on the throne, there is a possibility of further material.”\nBut Peter Morgan has done an incredible job at choosing what to focus on, and to give extra time, like the Graham Sutherland/Winston Churchill episode, the romantic trials and tribulations of Princess Margaret, and the arc with the pea soup weather that led to the accidental deaths of over one thousand citizens.\nSa Majesté la Reine vient de me nommer. Découvrez mon titre royal #TheCrown #Netflix https://t.co/fmALOToNB1 pic.twitter.com/xU7pRChuYK \n— Arnaud (@HumezArnaud) November 9, 2016 \n\nBut Morgan decided early on that some things needed to wait for the follow-up seasons, like the Suez Canal storyline. Originally, he believed that The Crown would only be three parts, but in doing it right, and giving certain events the proper emphasis with the benefit of knowing the full history, Morgan decided that he would need double the initial amount of episodes.\n“I think quite early on I knew. I thought I’d take it up to that point. Initially, I thought this would only be three seasons. It would be one season of her as the Young Queen, one season of her as the Middle-Aged Queen, one season of her as an Old Queen. It’s only in the writing of it that I said, ‘Oh, my God I need more time.’ The truth of the matter is, I could’ve written three or even four seasons of her as the Young Queen. I did get to the point where I thought, ‘Actually no, let’s leave it on the knife’s edge of Suez because Suez feels like a changing point for the country. Britain was never the same again after Suez.’ Therefore, I was going to deal with that at the beginning of season two.”\nFans of The Crown are in for a long haul, as the series will likely take six years to create, and then watch the full series. Season two of The Crown started shooting last month.\nAre you watching The Crown ?

      "text": "Here's how much the highest-paid actors make from the shows by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu Wednesday Nov 9, 2016 at 2:30 PM Eugene Kim - Business Insider \nRobert De Niro will make his TV debut on Amazon through a new crime series directed by David O. Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services.

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety.

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

      "text": "It's been a pretty slow news day in the entertainment world so far, so you'll have to forgive me for writing an entire article about a single bit of information from a report in Reuters. But that bit could prove fairly interesting down the line, and the statement in question is that Yves Guillemot, the chairman of video game company Ubisoft, told reporters that the company is \"in talks with Netflix over a series.\" A Ubisoft TV series, hmm? OK, so naturally the question becomes \"what game are they considering adapting for the small screen?\" With the Assassin's Creed movie finally coming out next month, there's a chance they could be looking into a spin-off series to keep that franchise alive between sequels (assuming it performs well enough to earn one). With games like Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, The Division, Watch Dogs, and more being eyed for the big screen, that only leaves a few Ubisoft properties left for TV. Far Cry, Call of Juarez, and Rainbow Six have potential, and since this is Netflix we're talking about, I wouldn't even put it past them to maybe develop a children's show around a game like Just Dance that's specifically designed to keep kids active and entertained. Which game do you think is the best fit for a TV series?",

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

      "text": "Aaron Sagers  49pm \nAcclaimed director Guillermo del Toro is dipping his toe into streaming fare with the new Netflix series Trollhunters , and he opened up to us about what inspired the series. \nWhen putting the series together, del Toro said he tried to draw from inspirations across the spectrum of folk lore and history. He said they made an effort to keep it “fluid,” linking everything from Arthurian legend to classic lore about trolls (i.e. turning to stone in the sunlight). Del Toro also alluded to his film Pan’s Labyrinth , and the approach they took with it to weave different cultural threads together. \nAlong with del Toro, we also chatted with producer Rodrigo Blaas about the new animated series. He touched on how they came up with the visual style for the series, from the stone-esque trolls, to the colorful world they build underground. \nTrollhunters is set to hit Netflix on December 23. \nCheck out the interview below: Video of Guillermo del Toro on Trollhunters | New York Comic-Con 2016 | Blastr Related Stories",

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

      "text": "Hidden Figures REX/Shutterstock \nNetflix apparently didn’t see it coming, the Donald Trump victory . The streaming company wrapped Wednesday morning’s print edition of the New York Times with a four-page advertisement for its series The Crown , built around a message of female empowerment that seemed to welcome a Hillary Clinton presidency. “We have a new leader: Let us give her a celebration that is befitting the wind of change,” it said. How Will Trump Change Media? Here Are Potential Losers And Winners \nBut Marshall Mitchell, a values-oriented Hollywood audience consultant with Wit PR, and a pastor at Jenkintown, PA’s largely black Salem Baptist Church, caught something in the wind at least six months ago. Over drinks at the Hollywood & Highland center in May, Mitchell let slip he was seeing a surprising receptivity to Trump and his message among the heartland types with whom he and his partner Corby Pons do much of their work on films like Warner Bros’ Sully and Fox’s upcoming Hidden Figures . Fox 2000 \nSpeaking by telephone on Wednesday, shortly after Clinton’s concession speech, Mitchell elaborated. \n“I am not particularly surprised” by the Trump triumph, said Mitchell. “It began to be evident to me and some people in my circle, Corby and others, as we spent time with audiences in Harrisburg, outside Philadelphia, and in forgotten parts of Pennsylvania, places very far removed from the Upper West Side” of New York, he said. \nIn screenings and small focus groups, Mitchell explained, large numbers of viewers months ago were talking of Trump not as a primary election candidate, but as an expression of something they found missing both in their political lives and in many of the films and television shows they were watching. \nThe viewers with whom he spoke were mostly blue-collar or lower-rung white-collar workers. About 80% of them, Mitchell reckoned, were white. In the simplest terms, he said, many “wanted someone to be the hero,” and they expressed a willingness to embrace a less-than-perfect Donald Trump in that role. Warner Bros Pictures \nA pervasive feeling in those groups, said Mitchell, was that “America has seen its best days.” Yet he also found the viewers to be surprisingly optimistic. “They seemed to believe that the best days can still be restored.” \nIf that mood, as Mitchell suspected, ultimately helped Trump, it also carries some messages for those who make and sell movies and television programs. One of those lessons he said, is obvious. “They still want aspirational content, they still want stories that end on a high note,” said Mitchell. \nBut a slightly subtler theme emerged from those interviews last spring and summer. “The audience was telling us of their desire to not have the same stories told over and over again, the same film with a different paint job,” said Mitchell. Instead, viewers are looking for something that surprises—like the rule-breaking Trump, or perhaps a movie equivalent of the same. \nA more specific surprise, said Mitchell, was the discovery of Hispanic males who voiced support for Trump, notwithstanding his tough views on illegal immigration. Many Hispanic men, said Mitchell, seemed to view him like a character from one of their favorite television shows, The Family Guy — that is, as a bawdy, outrageous but ultimately acceptable fellow male. \nGoing forward, said Mitchell, Hollywood marketers should simply listen more closely to what the viewers are saying. “The audience wants to own a story, to allow it to become their own,” he explained. \n“Sometimes the studios resist the audience.”",

Some even have tables instead of the traditional rows of fold-up seats.\nBut that sort of business model only works if you can get the proper licenses from the local or state government.\nIt won't fly in Bismarck, North Dakota.\nCity officials there voted last week to rewrite the rules to prevent a movie theater from purchasing a liquor license.\nCarmike Theaters, a national chain, had applied for a license and planned to offer beer for sale—something the company is doing across the country as part of a national effort to expand concession offerings.\nCity commissioners responded by tightening the rules on who can get a license to serve booze. They told the Bismarck Times that the original intent of the city's liquor licensing law was to ensure only restaurants and bars can sell. The new law requires potential licensees to have table tops and a full kitchen before they can serve beer or liquor.\nIn Bismarck, Carmike Theaters filed the license application on Jan. 20, before city commissioners rewrote the law to specifically exclude them.\nR.J. Pathroff, an attorney from the Vogel Law Firm, who represented Carmike Theaters, told the Bismarck Tribune that the city should not base its decision retroactively on a revised law. \nCity officials say they have never given a liquor license to any establishment that isn't a restaurant or a bar—the classic bureaucratic response of \"we've always done it this way\" explains so much about what makes government a pain to deal with, when you think about it.\nExcept that's not even true. As the Tribune points out, the Bismarck Event Center, a convention center, has a liquor license.\nFinally, other members of the city council said they had concerns about minors being served alcohol in the movie theater.\nSeems like that's an argument for banning all alcohol sales in the city, right? Isn't there an equal concern that minors could get a beer at a bar or restaurant?\nIf those establishments serve minors, and get caught, they will be punished and will lose their license. Why should a movie theater be treated any differently?\nRewriting a law to specifically exclude or ban one particular business—after they've already applied for the license, no less—is a straight-up intrusion by government into the marketplace. In the absence of a legitimate public safety reason to stop Carmike Theaters from selling beer, this action by the Bismarck City Council screams of nannyism.\nIt could be worse, though. This guy in England is trying to get theaters to ban popcorn . The horror!\nThis article originally appeared at Watchdog.org. \nPhoto Credit: Chris Smith/flickr",

      "text": "Netflix and comfort TV could be the reprieve you need today — and that’s OK Take a mental health day share After AP reported that Donald Trump would become the next president of the United States , a large group of people who were hoping for a Hillary Clinton victory took to social media to voice their outrage, fears, sadness and general feeling of being lost. As CNN commentator Van Jones said , for Trump and the Republican party, the result was a miracle, but for many American citizens, it was a nightmare they couldn’t wake from. As the night went on, hopeful messages started spreading across Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other sites from people that wanted to fight. They wanted to fight for women’s rights, gay rights, trans rights, progress in environmental protection, economic inequality, and justice for minority people. A fire had been lit under the tens of millions of Americans that didn’t want to just sit back and let whatever was going to happen, happen. But there was also an overwhelming sense of grief and despair at what the future of the country — the future of the world — could look like. People on Twitter cited an increase in anxiety, depression and a general feeling of unwell scrolling through tweets or watching live coverage. Many just wanted to block out the entire election and try to forget about what was happening outside their windows for as long as possible. A brief reprieve from reality . I was — I am — one of those people. When the results came in and AP called the election, I turned off my television, trudged into my bedroom at three in the morning, and put on an episode of Friends . \"The One with the Cop,\" if you’re particularly interested. \nIt wasn’t much, but I laughed It’s not like there wasn’t other and better TV options; there most certainly were. As an entertainment reporter for Polygon, I spend quite a bit of my time cycling through different TV shows to see what’s worth writing about and what’s not. But last night, feeling just as scared as my friends about the future of everything we know, all I wanted to do was watch Ross scream \"PIVOT!\" at Chandler and Rachel as they tried to get a couch up the stairs. It wasn’t much, but I laughed. For about twenty-two minutes, I genuinely laughed and briefly forgot about what was happening in the real world. It didn’t matter that I had seen the episode about eight times, Friends had become comfort television and a form of therapy. When I needed it most, well, it was there for me too. A couple of minutes into the episode, I got a text from a friend who had just returned home, devastated, from an election party in Manhattan. It was a screenshot of an episode of Friends and it was captioned, \"This is the only thing getting me through tonight.\" \nNBC Today on Twitter and Facebook, there are people talking about how they want to start volunteering with different organizations and pick up the metaphorical sword, running headfirst into the dark forest to take down the evil monster. It’s been nothing short of inspiring to see. But there are also people talking about how they don’t want to — or even can’t — do anything but watch their favorite TV shows, movies and return to their favorite games. Hordes of people are returning to Animal Crossing to lallygag the day away fishing and chatting with neighbors. As I sit here, feeling like many of my co-workers and friends that I should be doing more than just writing about watching garbage television, I still have Friends playing in the background. It hasn’t taken my mind off of the election, but I can look up every once in a while and smile, sometimes even laugh. Instead of surrounding myself with news and constant updates or analysis, I’m focusing my attention on the ridiculous lives of six friends who live in a different time — whose lives, while messy, seem simpler. Right now, simplicity seems like something we’re all yearning for. Someone I follow on Twitter tweeted that she noticed Netflix had added the complete collections of Xena and Hercules . That, she added, was what she was planning to do with the rest of her day. Another of my friends said he was spending the day revisiting How I Met Your Mother . We weren’t looking for an experience that you’d get with Westworld , where you can spend your time trying to unravel mysteries and focusing on what lies ahead; we just wanted something we could watch aimlessly and pretend we lived in different times. \nvia GIPHY The thing is, it’s OK to not be OK. It’s OK to recognize that we’re human beings with emotions and feelings. It’s OK to tell yourself, friends and family that you need a day or two to not engage with the rest of the world. It’s OK to just sit back and watch Friends for the thousandth time. There will be time to fight tomorrow, or next week or even next month. If what you need today is to throw on that pair of old and comfortable sweat pants, eat a box of cookies and watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer again from beginning to end, then do that. Comfort TV and being able to binge watch are part of what makes services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime great. If you need today to be a mental health day, full of nothing but comfort TV, then take the time to make that happen. One of my closest friends texted me today saying that he felt paralyzed by fear, and wanted to do nothing but watch Parks and Recreation , a show that many of us are turning to today. He wanted to hear the hopeful words of Leslie Knope, and pretend that he was living in Pawnee, Indiana. There are many lessons that can be taken away from Parks and Rec — a few that could even be applied to the country’s exact situation right now — but the most important one today comes from Tom and Donna, and it’s the message I texted back immediately. \"You gotta treat yo self.\" More From Polygon",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nNetflix is ramping up its selection of international content with Fauda , a popular political thriller from Israel that focuses on a deep-cover unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, reports Variety . \nThe first season of the show, which airs on the YES Israeli satellite network, will be available for streaming starting December 2. While season 2 is still in production, Netflix has reportedly already picked up rights for it as well. Interestingly, despite already airing in another country, Netflix will be dubbing the show a “Netflix Original Series,” making it the first Israeli series to receive the classification. \nMore : Amazon Prime is being offered at an aggressive discount in India \nThe Mista’arvim is a commando unit of the Israeli army with soldiers who are trained to work undercover among Palestinians, learning their language, dress, and even mannerisms in order to fit in unnoticed. The unit has helped stop terrorist attacks and guide military operations. \nFauda , a name in Arabic that translates to “Chaos,” has been lauded for its fair portrayal of both sides, focusing equally on backstories of both the Jewish soldiers and Arab characters, and not drawing a line between innocence and guilt. Each 45-minute episode is also offered up with dialogue in both Arabic and Hebrew, and will be available on Netflix with English subtitles. And, as with any political drama, the series is filled with scenes depicting close combat, as well as plot twists and hostage negotiations, to keep viewers riveted. \nAt the Israeli Academy Awards in 2015 (the country’s version of the Emmys), Fauda won a total of six awards, including Best Drama Series, and has become the most-watched program in the history of YES. The show was created by journalist and Arab affairs specialist Avi Issacharoff and actor Lior Raz, and is based on their experience working for the military. \nOther international series Netflix has picked up include Suburra from Italy, 3 percent from Brazil, Sacred Games from India, and a yet-to-be-named period piece from Spain.",

But speaking to The Hollywood Reporter after a special screening of The Crown at New York's Museum of Modern Art last month, creator Peter Morgan quickly shot down that \"most expensive show ever made\" distinction.

      "text": "Travel Watch Netflix on British Airways flights Passengers will soon be able to use the Internet on their phones on BA flights. Photo: Reuters Published: 4:00 AM, November 10, 2016 \nLONDON — British Airways (BA) will introduce Wi-Fi on its short-haul flights from next summer. \nPassengers flying with the airline will also be able to watch programmes on Netflix at 30,000 feet, check Twitter, and call friends and family on Skype or FaceTime once the service is introduced. \nThe carrier’s owner, IAG, announced the plans this week, adding that it would extend the service to its other airlines, Vueling, Iberia and Aer Lingus. \nThe deal with technology firm Inmarsat means travellers will be able to connect to 4G in the skies and, according to IAG, have the bandwidth capacity to use multiple devices at the same time with “connection speeds ... similar to what they have at home”. \nThere is no word yet on costs, but it is expected that a basic service will be free to use, with fees charged for premium connections. \n“We are giving customers the fastest connectivity you can get on any aircraft,” said IAG chief executive Willie Walsh. “Connectivity is essential because it’s what our customers demand, and IAG will be the first European airline group to offer high-quality air-to-ground Wi-Fi on short-haul flights.” \nBA only currently offers Wi-Fi on some of its long-haul routes, while rivals Lufthansa and Norwegian already offer it on shorter flights. While relatively novel in the United Kingdom and Europe, Wi-Fi on flights is more common in the United States, with American, Delta and United Airlines all providing the service. \nA BA A321 will be the first aircraft in the fleet to have it — with a launch date scheduled for next summer. IAG estimates that by 2019, 90 per cent of BA’s fleet will be fitted with Wi-Fi. \nLeo Mondale, the president of Inmarsat Aviation, said: “The European Aviation Network is a game changer for the millions of airline passengers that have been cut off from fast, reliable and consistent broadband access during flights in Europe. \n“It will provide IAG airlines with unprecedented high-speed capacity by combining the strengths of Inmarsat’s satellite connectivity with a powerful ground network operated by our partner, Deutsche Telekom.” \nLufthansa first boasted of a scheduled flight with Internet services in 2003, however, the service was suspended in 2006 after the necessary satellite went out of operation. It returned on the airline’s long-haul fleet in 2010 before being rolled out across other shorter routes. \nLast month, BA announced it was halting the service of free food and drink on its short-haul flights and replacing it with the opportunity to purchase Marks & Spencer sandwiches and snacks.

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services.

      "text": "By jessica rawden 2 minutes ago \nGilmore Girls is coming back and in a big way on Netflix. To celebrate the upcoming release of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , we've seen coffeehouse pop-ups and Funko Pop! Figures all hit the scene. Now, there's a brand new product that should be an absolutely perfect purchase for the night of the Gilmore Girls premiere on November 25. That product is none other than the \"They Scoop Gilmores, Don't They?\" ice cream, produced by Ample Hills Creamery in New York. \nOk, normally I'm not all about toting ice cream flavors related to TV series, or at least I haven't been since Ben and Jerry's first introduced The Tonight Dough back in 2015. This ice cream is particularly special because it fits Lorelei and Rory Gilmore so well. The base of the ice cream is a coffee flavor, mixed with chocolate pudding ice cream. There's also a mention of snickerdoodles and a note that the flavor is topped off with pink \"Pop Tart\" sprinkles, because: A photo posted by @gilmoregirls on Aug 2, 2016 at 11:31am PDT \nThe item is sold in a pint individually or you can order a four-pack that includes several other flavors from Ample Hills, including a marshmallow ice cream that fits the theme of the four-pack. Ample Hills delightfully titled the four-pack \"Where You Lead, I Will Marshmallow,\" pleasing Gilmore Girls fans everywhere. Ample Hills also does that thing where they will ship ice cream across the country, so you don't have to live near New York to sample the goods. Directions are a little complicated, as the product only ships on certain days, but there's good information on the page. \nThe Gilmore girls are known lovers of junk food along with caffeine so \"They Scoop Gilmores, Don't They,\" actually does seem like the perfect treat for the premiere, which is really coming up quite soon. We recently learned that one fun character, Marty, will not be back for Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life , although on the bright side, Melissa McCarthy will . You can take a look at who will be back with our what we know guide for the unofficial eighth season of the series. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life will hit Netflix on November 25 at 12:01 a.m. PT. In addition, the subscription streaming service has a ton of shows coming up in the New Year; check 'em out with our 2017 Netflix premiere schedule .

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

      "text": "Netflix’s ‘The Crown’ Debut Ratings: Worse Than ‘Longmire,’ Better Than ‘Bloodline’ (Exclusive) \nOpening weekend draws fewer than half a million viewers Tony Maglio | November 9, 2016 @ 2:32 PM Netflix \nNetflix’s “The Crown” didn’t draw viewership worthy of a king, despite its reported palatial price tag. \nThe original series debuted to just 496,000 total viewers over its opening weekend, according to Symphony Advanced Media data that was provided exclusively to TheWrap. That places the premiere 26th out of the 35 originals measured by Symphony AM since its VideoPulse inception last year. “The Crown” fared better than “Bloodline” Season 2, but was worse than the fifth season of “Longmire” on Netflix. \nDue to the recent release of “The Crown,” Symphony’s Live + 3 day data is not completely stable yet and is subject to change slightly. Also Read: 'Amanda Knox' Ratings Are No Killer on Netflix, Firm Says \nThe Season 1 debut of “Fuller House” (7.33 million) remains at the top of Symphony’s list, with runner-up “Orange Is the New Black” Season 4 (5.84 million) quite a ways behind it. \nIn third and fourth are two Marvel shows: “Luke Cage” and “Daredevil.”“Stranger Things” rounds out the top five. \nSymphony measures viewership through audio recognition software found in a panelist’s cell phone. The list also includes Hulu and Amazon series. Hulu first appears at No. 9 for the premiere of “11.22.63,” while Amazon’s “The Man in the High Castle” tops that platform at No. 22 overall. Also Read: Meet the Man Who Thinks He Knows Netflix's Secret Ratings \nHere are some more unpopular debuts against which “The Crown” did worse: “The Ranch,”“The Path” and “Haters Back Off,” for example. It did, however, top “The Mindy Project” Seasons 4 and 5, and “Marco Polo,” among a handful of others. \nReaders are probably wondering which show measured by Symphony AM had the worst debut viewership. That unfortunate distinction belongs to Amazon’s “Catastrophe,” which only attracted 274,000 viewers over its first few days.",

      "text": "\nNetflix subscribers have been grumbling for a while about the service’s shrinking catalog of movies and shows, and we’ve got a bit more bad news for you today on that front. If you’ve been meaning to catch up with Man v. Food , or love binging Property Brothers , or want to revisit old episodes of Chopped , you’d best do that all right now. Scripps Networks Interactive has announced they won’t renew their streaming deal with Netflix. Their channels include Food Network, Travel Channel, HGTV, and DIY Networks. \nThe deal dates back to fall 2014, when Scripps got into bed with Netflix after ending its previous relationship with Amazon Prime Video in March. It won’t expire until the end of the year, so Netflix viewers still have a few more weeks to enjoy Scripps shows. Those include Food Network’s Chopped , Diners, Drive-ins and Dives , Food Network Star , Cupcake Wars , and Cutthroat Kitchen ; HGTV’s Property Brothers , House Hunters , Flip or Flop , Fixer Upper , and Love It or List It ; Travel Channel’s Man v. Food and Expedition Unknown , and DIY Network’s Kitchen Crashers .\nThe decision, of course, comes down to money. Specifically, Scripps’ nagging feeling that they could be making more of it. In an earnings call, COO Burton Jablin said the Netflix deal “really is not the kind of dual-revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.” CEO Kenneth Lowe was more direct and specific, explaining that they were losing ad dollars (because Netflix doesn’t play ads). “We have such compelling content for advertisers that we just don’t want to really cut ourselves off from any opportunity,” he said.\nThis might not be a huge loss if you’re not a fan of these particular shows, but it’s an interesting look into the current state of the industry. As we’ve discussed before, licensing outside content has only gotten more expensive for Netflix as competitors like Amazon and Hulu have entered the fray. For related reasons, Netflix has started dedicating more of its resources to developing in-house content, with the goal of reaching about 50% original programming within the next few years. It’s good for viewers in that there’s more stuff to watch than ever, but bad in that if you want to watch a wide range of stuff, you might find yourself needing to subscribe to multiple services.\nThe post Netflix Will Lose All of These Networks’ TV Shows at the End of 2016 appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": " Netflix’s ‘The Crown’ Debut Ratings: Worse Than ‘Longmire,’ Better Than ‘Bloodline’ (Exclusive) Netflix’s “The Crown” didn’t draw viewership worthy of a king, despite its reported palatial price tag.\nThe original series debuted to just 496,000 total viewers over its opening weekend, according to Symphony Advanced Media data that was provided exclusively to TheWrap. That places the premiere 26th out of the 35 originals measured by Symphony AM since its VideoPulse inception last year. “The Crown” fared better than “Bloodline” Season 2, but was worse than the fifth season of “Longmire” on Netflix.\nDue to the recent release of “The Crown,” Symphony’s Live + 3 day data is not completely stable yet and is subject to change slightly.\nAlso Read: 'Amanda Knox' Ratings Are No Killer on Netflix, Firm Says\nThe Season 1 debut of “Fuller House” (7.33 million) remains at the top of Symphony’s list, with runner-up “Orange Is the New Black” Season 4 (5.84 million) quite a ways behind it.\nIn third and fourth are two Marvel shows: “Luke Cage” and “Daredevil.” “Stranger Things” rounds out the top five.\nvar googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || []; googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/30981161/TheWrapRemnantOOP', 'div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0'); }); Symphony measures viewership through audio recognition software found in a panelist’s cell phone. The list also includes Hulu and Amazon series. Hulu first appears at No. 9 for the premiere of “11.22.63,” while Amazon’s “The Man in the High Castle” tops that platform at No. 22 overall.\nAlso Read: Meet the Man Who Thinks He Knows Netflix's Secret Ratings\nHere are some more unpopular debuts against which “The Crown” did worse: “The Ranch,” “The Path” and “Haters Back Off,” for example. It did, however, top “The Mindy Project” Seasons 4 and 5, and “Marco Polo,” among a handful of others.\nReaders are probably wondering which show measured by Symphony AM had the worst debut viewership. That unfortunate distinction belongs to Amazon’s “Catastrophe,” which only attracted 274,000 viewers over its first few days.\nCheck out the full Symphony rankings below. Netflix does not reveal viewership data. Executives at the streaming giant have denounced Symphony’s data as “remarkably inaccurate” in the past .\nAlso Read: Netflix Boss Ted Sarandos Still Insists Ratings Have 'No Relevance for Us'\n“The Crown” reportedly had a $130 million production budget, which would make it the most expensive TV show ever. Clearly, the returns on that investment have not been worthy of such royal treatment.\nWithout further adieu, here are the streaming originals’ viewership, ranked in descending order…\nRead original story Netflix’s ‘The Crown’ Debut Ratings: Worse Than ‘Longmire,’ Better Than ‘Bloodline’ (Exclusive) At TheWrap",

      "text": "Ubisoft Planning A Netflix TV Series? By - Wednesday, November 9th 2016 12:54 pm \nVideo game giant Ubisoft will crack into the film business with next month’s “Assassin’s Creed” movie. That comes ahead of several other films in the works based on Ubisoft game properties including the Tom Hardy-led “Splinter Cell,” the Jake Gyllenhaal-led “The Division,” the Michael Bay-produced “Ghost Recon,” and films based on the “Watch Dogs” and “Far Cry” franchises. \nYet there may be something else in the works with a Reuters article indicating today that the French game publisher is “in talks with Netflix over a series”. No further details are available. \nUbisoft’s first non-game project was the animated series “Rabbids Invasion” which premiered in 2013 and is currently airing its third season. A Netflix deal would be something different and of course the big question is – what property would it be? Other notable Ubisoft titles include the “Prince of Persia,”“Call of Juarez,”“Rainbow Six,”“Rayman,”“Just Dance” and “Trials” franchises. SHARE",

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

      "text": "Posted Wed Nov 9, 2016 at 01:30 PM PST by Steven Cohen \nThe upcoming disaster flick will stream globally through Netflix next year. \nNetflix has announced an international licensing agreement with Next Entertainment World for their movie 'Pandora.' The South Korean nuclear disaster film comes from CAC Entertainment and director Park Jung-Woo. \n\"We are excited to work with Next Entertainment World to bring such high-quality Korean titles like Pandora to our members worldwide,\" said Rob Roy, Vice President Content Acquisition at Netflix. \"Netflix is committed to bringing the best of global entertainment to the world and in an era where the Internet knows no bounds, this is another step towards delivering great stories to fans no matter where they live.\" \nIn 'Pandora,' disaster strikes a nuclear power plant in a small, quiet town when an earthquake unexpectedly hits. The Pirates star Kim Nam-gil plays Jae-hyuk, a man who risks his life to save his family and country from the impending atomic explosion. The film also stars Kim Young-ae (The Attorney), Jung Jin-young (Miracle of Cell No. 7) and Kim Dae-myeong (Misaeng). \n'Pandora' will stream exclusively through Netflix in 190 countries, excluding South Korea, in 2017. In South Korea, the film will start streaming after its theatrical release. \nNext Entertainment World CEO, Kim Woo-taek said, \"We are delighted to partner with Netflix, a world-class content distributor, to be able to present Pandora to global audiences in over 190 countries. Following the recent success of Train to Busan in Asia, we hope the 'nuclear' themed Pandora can win much love from the audiences worldwide.\" Other upcoming Netflix premieres include ' Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ' on November 25, ' 3% ' on November 25, ' Fuller House ' season two on December 9, ' Barry ' on December 16, ' A Series of Unfortunate Events ' on January 13, ' David Brent: Life on the Road ' on February 10, and ' Iron Fist ' on March 17.

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

      "text": "Melissa Heng \nCOSTUMES FROM THE CROWN AT ROBINSONS THE HEEREN \nNine costumes from The Crown, Netflix's original television series about the British royal family, will be on display at Robinsons The Heeren till Nov 20. \nThe costumes - which have been worn by actors Claire Foy (Queen Elizabeth II) and Matt Smith (Prince Philip) - include the wedding gown and suit (pictured) seen in the pilot episode. \nIn addition to this exclusive showcase, shoppers who spend a minimum of $250 at any of the three Robinsons stores (including Raffles City and Jem) from now till Nov 20 will stand to win one of three limited-edition The Crown gift boxes. \nEach box comes with a three- month Netflix subscription worth $32.98, media streaming device Google Chromecast and a Smythson 2017 diary. \nTen winners from each store will also each receive a six-month complimentary Netflix subscription. \nRobinsons The Heeren is located at 260 Orchard Road, open daily from 10.30am to 10pm, tel: 6735-8838. \nCHANEL BODY OIL INFUSED WITH THE FRAGRANCE OF NO.5 \nFans of Chanel's classic and luxurious No. 5 perfume can now get their hands on a body oil infused with the French fashion house's signature scent. \nNo. 5 The Body Oil ($150 for 200ml, left) is perfect for those who want a subtle hint of No. 5. The scent left on the body is softer than a full spritz of perfume. \nBody oils also help to moisturise the skin and are often absorbed more quickly compared with lotions and creams. \nThe new limited-edition oil absorbs easily into the skin and does not leave it feeling greasy. \nNo. 5 The Body Oil is available at all Chanel counters.

      "title": "HGTV and Food Network Shows are Leaving Netflix For Good",
      "text": "By Jessica Mattern Nov 9, 2016 If your Netflix queue is full of hits like Property Brothers , Chopped, and Flip or Flop , we have some rather sad news for you. Television shows from HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, the Cooking Channel, and the Travel Channel will be removed from Netflix at the end of 2016, Fox News reports. The Scripps Network Interactive, the parent company for all of the channels, just announced the decision not to renew its partnership with the online streaming platform. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Netflix has been a second home for these lifestyle shows since 2014, but all of that is about to change. The company doesn't want to be limited by the partnership anymore, said Scripps' chief operating officer Ken Lowe, during an earnings report conference call. They've grown and no longer need to rely on partnerships or the streaming service. A photo posted by Giada DeLaurentiis (@giadadelaurentiis) on Jan 2, 2016 at 5:04pm PST Most Popular A photo posted by HGTV (@hgtv) on Jul 22, 2016 at 3:00pm PDT This year alone, a single episode of Fixer Upper attracted more than 8 million viewers to HGTV, and one of the best Flip or Flop episodes drew 7.9 million viewers, according to the company's press releases . Both shows were among the top-watched cable programs on their given night. And despite major events like the 2016 summer Olympics and the U.S. election, five of the six parent company's networks grew in the most recent quarter of 2016. Thankfully, there are plenty of other ways to watch your favorite shows. Tons of free programming and full-length episodes can be found on HGTV.com , FoodNetwork.com , DIYNetwork.com , and the rest of the networks' websites, but if you want to catch all of the seasons in order, you'd better watch them on Netflix while you can!

      "text": "#Politics \nWhen Words Fail About this Election, We Give You Unlikely Animal Friends on Netflix \nThese cute animals are friends against all odds, and I'm so tired that this is all that matters right now. By Rebekah Allen @rebekahmallen November 09 2016 5:26 AM EST \nIt's a dreadful day. It's an unavoidably horrible day, and yes, there is plenty that we can do to mobilize and regroup and find ways to fight the results of the 2016 presidential election. We're going to do that in just a moment, but we also lost a lot of sleep last night and need a sec to collect ourselves and find some peace of mind. Since they took Kitten Party , a delightful 30 minute, acid trip-esque literal party of kittens, off of Netflix, we obviously need a replacement, and it looks like Unlikely Animal Friends is just what the doctor (/us, depressed, scrolling through Netflix) ordered. If anything, doesn't your confused, tired soul deserve to listen to the words \"Silky Chicken\" said over and over again? Don't you want to know what a Silky Chicken is? This, this is a Silky Chicken. \nBut it's not only just the existence of Silky Chickens that's great. There are a lot of wonderful unlikely animal friends in this video, which we'd particularly hope for -- in that it's called \"Unlikely Animal Friends.\" There's a tammar wallaby who's best friends with a girl named Taylor. There's a goat that's just in the midst of a fierce friendship with a donkey because they've figured out how to work that out even if our nation can't figure out how to be a country that isn't run by a Batman villain. If a squirrel and a dog can be friends, can I finally get an hour of sleep? Why is there an entire segment about a cat and a person, which is a pretty normal duo? Who knows, but it's cute, and for 43:37 we're going to embrace preciousness and not think about anything else. \"That's quite a lot of minutes to devote to unlikely animal friends,\" you may say. We say, \"It's not enough time at all .\" Remember Silky Chickens? \nBut if you don't have Netflix or, like me, are considering dropping your subscription to pay for a bus to Toronto, here are 10 glorious GIFs of unlikely animal friends that don't require your payment information. \n10. This raccoon and these dogs are kickin' it \n\n9. America? What America? This otter and hyena are tight AF. \n\n8. This cat and a fennec fox don't understand politics at all. \n\n7. It's snuggle time for this dog and tiger because nature is full of gifts. \n\n6. Lemurs and kangaroos are a thing now. Thank goodness. \n\n5. This cat is enamored with this turtle, and we get it. It's a great turtle. \n\n4. Run, goat and rhino friends. Run into the sunset, to never-ending bliss. \n\n3. My friends won't stop texting me about the apocalypse but they probably would for a sec if they saw this Weiner dog and lion be chill. \n\n2. What is goin' on with this kitten and gorilla? How'd they make this happen? \n\n1. Tiger and piglet, together forever. \n\nI guess it's time to face the real world. But thank you for the diversion, unlikely animal friends. \n",

      "text": "Netflix's love letter to the '80s, Stranger Things, has reminded everyone how much they loved that decade, tubby kids with curly hair and, erm, Eggos. So fans of that decade - including lots of people who weren't even alive back then - will be delighted there's already a third series in the works. Speaking to Collider, the show's producer/director Shawn Levy said they don't want to rush a potential third instalment, so are already preparing. He said: \"We are not gonna be caught off guard and we don't wanna be making stuff up like the day before we have to write it and make it, so we are definitely optimistic and we have started thinking ahead.\" You might remember that Netflix straight up lied to everyone by commissioning a second seasons before the first even premiered, meaning your screams for a follow-up (we assume you screamed) were wasted breath. The good news is that season two actually began filming this week (November 7) and it's expected to be one episode longer, according to Shawn. So what could Stranger Things season 3 have in store? Perhaps Eleven's hair will have grown back? Perhaps Winona Ryder's character might laugh for the first time, rather than blubber endlessly. And maybe, just maybe, we'll FINALLY get some justice for Barb, goddammit. We do know that the second season should pick up with Will Byers' return home and his weird new habit of vomiting slugs into the sink. Plus we can expect the continued adventures of Eleven, perhaps in the woods, but probably not. The show has also cast a host of new characters, including two '80s heavyweights. Sean Astin from The Goonies will play Bob Newby, a school friend of Hopper and Joyce's. Meanwhile, Paul Reiser (who played that asshole Burke from Aliens) has been hired to play \"a high-ranking member within the Department of Energy on a 'clean-up' assignment, tasked with containing the events of last year\". Levy told Collider: \"Will Byers was in that Upside Down for a while. So Season 2 is about this determined desire to return to normalcy in Hawkins, in the Byers family, in that group of friends, and it's the struggle to reclaim normalcy and maybe the impossibility of it.\" We know Hopper has made some kind of deal with the government agents, as we saw them drive him away in the finale. But afterwards he still hid Eggos in the woods for Eleven, so maybe he's been tasked with catching our favourite baldy? Or is he just trying to double-cross them? We'll turn the internet upside down trying to find some answers for you, but for now, we'll all just have to wait until 2017 for Netflix to bless us with the next season.",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nNetflix has always been a trendsetter, even in some cases where it may not necessarily be trying to bring about change. \nThe company recently revealed it will not take its usual spot at the media's Television Critics Associations (TCA) press tour in January, citing logistical reasons. \nRegardless of the reason, a major player no-showing TCA is rarely done and Netflix doing so could set up a domino effect in the industry with other networks following suit. \nTCA has shown its age in recent years and many have questioned if it still serves the same value it had in previous years. As goes Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), so goes the TV industry. That's never been truer than as of late and the company's latest news could again be a game-changer. Yet this isn't a big series acquisition, technological enhancement or executive hire, it's actually what they are NOT doing that makes this important. Twice a year TV critics gather in Los Angeles for the Television Critics Association media tour. TCA, as it more commonly referred to, accounts for a large part of a network's budget every year. Simply put it is a HUGE undertaking for all involved. For those unfamiliar, TCA is basically a two week marathon where everyday a major network (or in some cases multiple) present the best and brightest from its upcoming slate. It is panel-after-panel with A-lister after A-lister. Every night usually ends with a giant party where the media can get one-on-one time with actors, showrunners and executives. Since 2013 Netflix has been a part of the festivities but this year it's skipping the event and that could cause an industry wide ripple effect. Now the official reason given for the company sitting this one out is logistics as the upcoming presidential inauguration is wreaking havoc on scheduling. As a result TCA organizers changed their schedule and that caused Netflix to bow out. At least that's the official story. Now I'm sure a large of part of that is true, but the fact Netflix is missing it, regardless of the reason speaks volumes. TCA in the past was always a \"must-attend\" and no network would ever think to skip. If they did, they'd have a number of angry TV outlets coming at them from every angle, especially if they were high profile. Yet that was then and this is now and Netflix bows to no one. No outlet would dare openly challenge Netflix for skipping TCA, in fact few even covered the news (which conveniently came out late Friday afternoon). By nature they are a disruptor and this is what disruptors do. To be clear, I'm not saying Netflix is making a statement by not going, I'm saying its absence will be noticed. A big reason why is because of the impact this could have in general. TCA is looking more antiquated with every year. Its membership has turned over to include more bloggers as many print/top tier sites outlets have shuttered their TV coverage. Some question if the event still carries value. The reporter's themselves even seem reluctant to be there as some have started calling it \"a death march with cocktails.\" Personally I find that insulting for a variety of reasons, not the least of it being these reporters are being paid to spend two weeks talking to celebrities and being given free food and drinks. To be fair, I don't want to discount that (perks aside) it is a lot of work for these reporters and they are expected to post constantly and dig for exclusive information. It really isn't all fun and games and I know (first hand) how long these things can drag on. I'm just saying maybe whining about it when most of their readers are working traditional office jobs won't grant you much sympathy. And they have to admit, if this was to go away, they'd miss it. The fear is that Netflix pulling out could lead the way for others to do the same. While we are still years away from a ABC, CBS or NBC making that drastic of a move, smaller (but equally \"of note\") networks could take the approach. The door basically becomes open and you begin to wonder, if Netflix did it could someone else? In fact not long after Netflix cancelled, Starz dropped out as well. I find the Starz news even more shocking because unlike the streamer they could use all the exposure they could get. Not to mention its newest (and very high profile) tentpole series American Gods is set for an early 2017 debut. It is surprising the network is passing on this opportunity for a show which is getting a lot of the network's resources. Maybe like Netflix it is a scheduling thing, or maybe the network just wants to watch its spending, or maybe its executive is questioning the return on investment. Whatever the reason, having two traditional mainstays like these come off the board is something we haven't really seen as of late. TCA is a spin session for networks. Usually Netflix provides fodder for the meetings as rivals like NBC love to take aim at the streaming leader. You'll remember a few years ago this is where NBC released what it claimed to be Netflix ratings information. It often times becomes the big story even if it's not trying to be. Yet with them staying on the sidelines this year it takes some of the fun out of it because most of the time what we get is canned answers from heavily media trained executives. When a network tries to go rogue (for better or worse) it creates a conversation and that was really part of the point for TCA back when it first started. It was a place where executives would have this open venue to peddle its programming but also own up to bad decisions and pickups. It is also an important time for investors to hear about a company's upcoming slate and how the media believes it will be received. This is where shareholders can get a gauge about the programming that will eventually move those stocks one way or another. Then again when you're a company like Netflix maybe this type of event doesn't matter as much anymore. Times have changed and so does how the industry gets its information. And yes Amazon, Crackle and British import Acorn will happily slide into those empty spots and welcome the extra attention. Still it creates a situation where you have question the validity of the model and if that much of the budget should really go to an event that has weaken in relevance as of late. Netflix has always been known to march to its own beat and the industry tends to take note and adapt in its wake. This is a company that has changed the industry in so many different ways, that many rightfully read a lot into its everyday actions. Could that be the case again here?

      "text": "Cox Wants Bullseye For “Daredevil” By -  34 am \nA third season of Netflix and Marvel’s “Daredevil” won’t hit until sometime in 2018, and for now it’s not clear what villains or other characters will appear. \nThe one that everyone is waiting for though is Bullseye, the assassin character Colin Farrell played in the 2002 film version and whom has served as a major antagonist to Matt Murdock in the comics for many years. \nThe show’s star Charlie Cox is all for the idea of his inclusion and speaking at Wizard World in Pittsburgh this past weekend, he told ScreenGeek : \n“It’s no secret, I’ve said it before and I get in trouble every time I say it, I’d like to see Bullseye make an appearance at some point. I think it’s a really interesting opportunity. Deborah Ann Woll obviously does not want Bullseye to show up for obvious reasons. Elodie Yung, who plays Elektra, doesn’t want Bullseye to show up either.” \nCox will first reprise the role for “The Defenders” event series which will air in late 2017. SHARE",

      "text": "Ubisoft And Netflix in Collaboration For A New Series? By Pets Torrefranca ,   06:10 am Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot announced on Monday, that the games publisher is in talks to make a new series with Netflix.(Photo : YouTube/IGN News) \nUbisoft and Netflix, two of the entertainment industry's biggest players, are rumored to start a collaboration to produce a new series. Ubisoft has currently entered the movie scene with the movie adaptation of \"Assassin's Creed\" and now the paid television series market through Netflix. Advertisement \nThe French company Ubisoft has been in the video game industry since 1998, the company formerly known as Ubi Soft Entertainment Software has produced some of the most memorable games and franchises available today. Games like \"Assassin's Creed,\" \"Far Cry,\" \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell,\" \"Watchdogs,\" \"Just Dance,\" \"Prince of Persia\" and \"Ghost Recon\" are just some of the titles under its flagship. It was rumored that the company is experiencing pressure from Vivendi who holds more than 20 percent of the company's stocks. Although Vivendi denies that a hostile takeover is not included in their to-do list, Ubisoft is looking for other ventures and collaborations to maintain the company's independent status, based on a report by IGN . \nOn the other hand, the former DVD-by-mail-turned streaming giant Netflix is currently focused on the production of original content with a budget of $5 billion for this year alone, based on an article by FastCompany . Although producer Scripps, one of the largest producers and distributors of lifestyle programming like HGTV, the Food Network, Travel Channel, the DIY channel, and the Cooking Channel, is going to part ways with the company, COO of Scripps, Ken Lowe, believes that SCRIPPS is \"big enough,\" and \"does not want to shackle itself with the obligation of a streaming partnership,\" per ComicBook.com . \nThe outcome of the upcoming \"Assassin's Creed\" movie will determine Ubisoft's stand in the motion picture industry and perhaps television. A collaboration between Netflix and Ubisoft is something that both gamers and television enthusiasts can look out for, due to the fact that Ubisoft owns some of gaming industry's biggest names with the most ingenious and original storylines.

      "text": "The Queen's real wedding left, and right Netflix drama 'The Crown.' PA/Netflix/Left Bank Pictures Netflix drama \"The Crown\" is winning critical aclaim both in Britain and the US.\nThe Guardian said Netflix's £100 million ($124 million) gamble on the show \"pays off royally,\" while The Hollywood Reporter predicted that it will be in contention for a hatful of awards. \nIt might pack a punch in the drama stakes, but how faithful is it to reality? \nCreator Peter Morgan turned down an audience with the Queen because he wanted the show to have \"complete independence.\" \n\"The Crown\" applies plenty of artistic lisence. But it is also clear that key moments in the Queen's ascent to the throne are carefully recreated in the show's opening episodes. Find out how faithful the Netflix drama is to history by looking through these real images of the Queen juxtaposed with shots from 'The Crown.' View As: One Page Slides \"The Crown\" opens with the Queen's marriage to Prince Philip in November 1947. These two images show the attention to detail in the Netflix drama's costumes. Actress Claire Foy's dress features the intricate embroidery of the real thing. \"The Crown\" also captures the newlyweds' official photo shoot at Buckingham Palace. In the drama, the photographer plays with interchangeable backdrops, but the history books show that a simple curtain made do. The Buckingham Palace balcony is home to iconic royal moments. \"The Crown\" provided an insiders' perspective on the view over the gleeful crowds around the Victoria Memorial. The Queen and Prince Philip had two children: Prince Charles and Princess Anne. Official photos show Philip being playful with the young royals — the spirit of which was recreated by actor Matt Smith in \"The Crown.\" Soon after these idyllic family moments, the Queen's father King George VI became ill with lung cancer. King George was played by Jared Harris in \"The Crown.\" After King George had surgery to remove a lung, the Queen was sent on a tour of the Commonwealth in his place. The trip began in Nairobi, Kenya, where Elizabeth was greeted by local dignitaries. \"The Crown\" captured this moment, staying faithful to the Queen's polka dot dress. During their visit, the Queen and Prince Philip stayed in the Sagana Lodge, which was a wedding gift from the people of Kenya. This is where Elizabeth learned of her father's death and officially became the Queen. The royals cut short their Commonwealth tour to return to the UK. Elizabeth's nervy descent from her BOAC plane marked her first act as Queen on British soil. The image from the time shows she was greeted by then Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The Queen was pictured in mourning in her father's funeral cortege. Her veiled face in the back of a black car is a poignant moment in \"The Crown.\" June 1953 marked Elizabeth's Coronation as the Queen of England. As part of the celebrations at Westminster Abbey, Prince Philip bowed to his wife. \"The Crown\" depicted the Queen sitting for celebrated fashion photographer Cecil Beaton's famous portrait soon after the Coronation.",

The global streaming site has said it will label the show a Netflix Original Series, marking the first time an Israeli series earns this title. \nThe first season of the award-winning show will be available to stream on December 2. The second season, now in production, has also been bought by Netflix. The show will be aired in its original languages of Arabic and Hebrew, with English subtitles. \n“It’s a dream come true,” series co-creator—and former Tower correspondent—Avi Issacharoff told the news website Walla. \nFauda ‘s first season followed the story of an IDF commando unit, whose soldiers were trained to assimilate themselves into the Palestinian community. Their mission: to capture a Hamas operative known as “The Panther.” \nIt was the most-watched series in the history of the satellite channel YES, which commissioned the show, and won six Ophir Awards—the Israeli equivalent of the Emmys—including Best Drama Series. \nBy: TheTower.org Do You Love Israel?

      "text": "The Queen's real wedding left, and right Netflix drama 'The Crown.' PA/Netflix/Left Bank Pictures Netflix drama \"The Crown\" is winning critical aclaim both in Britain and the US.\nThe Guardian said Netflix's £100 million ($124 million) gamble on the show \"pays off royally,\" while The Hollywood Reporter predicted that it will be in contention for a hatful of awards. \nIt might pack a punch in the drama stakes, but how faithful is it to reality? \nCreator Peter Morgan turned down an audience with the Queen because he wanted the show to have \"complete independence.\" \n\"The Crown\" applies plenty of artistic lisence. But it is also clear that key moments in the Queen's ascent to the throne are carefully recreated in the show's opening episodes. Find out how faithful the Netflix drama is to history by looking through these real images of the Queen juxtaposed with shots from 'The Crown.' View As: One Page Slides \"The Crown\" opens with the Queen's marriage to Prince Philip in November 1947. These two images show the attention to detail in the Netflix drama's costumes. Actress Claire Foy's dress features the intricate embroidery of the real thing. \"The Crown\" also captures the newlyweds' official photo shoot at Buckingham Palace. In the drama, the photographer plays with interchangeable backdrops, but the history books show that a simple curtain made do. The Buckingham Palace balcony is home to iconic royal moments. \"The Crown\" provided an insiders' perspective on the view over the gleeful crowds around the Victoria Memorial. The Queen and Prince Philip had two children: Prince Charles and Princess Anne. Official photos show Philip being playful with the young royals — the spirit of which was recreated by actor Matt Smith in \"The Crown.\" Soon after these idyllic family moments, the Queen's father King George VI became ill with lung cancer. King George was played by Jared Harris in \"The Crown.\" After King George had surgery to remove a lung, the Queen was sent on a tour of the Commonwealth in his place. The trip began in Nairobi, Kenya, where Elizabeth was greeted by local dignitaries. \"The Crown\" captured this moment, staying faithful to the Queen's polka dot dress. During their visit, the Queen and Prince Philip stayed in the Sagana Lodge, which was a wedding gift from the people of Kenya. This is where Elizabeth learned of her father's death and officially became the Queen. The royals cut short their Commonwealth tour to return to the UK. Elizabeth's nervy descent from her BOAC plane marked her first act as Queen on British soil. The image from the time shows she was greeted by then Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The Queen was pictured in mourning in her father's funeral cortege. Her veiled face in the back of a black car is a poignant moment in \"The Crown.\" June 1953 marked Elizabeth's Coronation as the Queen of England. As part of the celebrations at Westminster Abbey, Prince Philip bowed to his wife. \"The Crown\" depicted the Queen sitting for celebrated fashion photographer Cecil Beaton's famous portrait soon after the Coronation.",

      "text": "November 10, 2016 | 06:55AM PT Woo Films, Noc Noc Cinema set broad 2016-17 slate, team with Netflix \nMEXICO CITY — Woo Films , whose Noc Noc Cinema produces Mexico’s third Netflix series order, has set a 2016-17 production slate of at least five feature projects, plus Natalia Beristain’s buzzed-up “The Goodbyes,” which plays Los Cabos Work in Progress section, and Manuel Caro’s anticipated TV series for Netflix. \nNew movies link Woo Films to key Mexican new wave figures, ranging from the less conventional – Julio Hernandez Cordon (“I Promise You Anarchy”), Matias Meyer (“The Last Cristeros,” “Yo”), and Kyzza Terrazas (“Manchete Language”) – to directors who have reached out to more female or mainstream audiences: Beristain (“She Doesn’t Want To Sleep Alone”) and Manolo Caro (“Tales of An Inmoral Couple,” “Elvira, I Would Give You My Life, But I’m Using It”). \nDirected by Caro and shooting in 4K in Mexico from early 2017, the not-yet-titled Netflix original series is a 13-part half-hour. Described as a dark comedy, it turns on a dysfunctional upper-class family which owns a flower shop. When the patriarch’s lover dies, he decides to bring his illegitimate children into the family fold. Ley and Stacy Perskie produce for Noc Noc Cinema. Netflix has already commissioned two series out of Mexico: “Club de cuervos” and “Ingobernable.” \nSome producers in Mexico are prolific. And then there’s Woo Films. The movie production arm of Mexico City-based Mr Woo, a production and branded content company, Woo Films’ Ley is “first and foremost a film buff. I like to work with directors I admire,” he said. \nThat’s even when they’re changing direction. Receiving a career tribute at 2016’s Morelia Festival, Meyer, for example, carved out a reputation as wide-ranging auteur, as happy depicting psychological immaturity (“Yo”) as religious faith (“The Last Cristeros”). Woo and Caro are now teaming to produce Meyer’s next, “Los Amores Modernos,” a contemporary coral comedy. “It’s an interesting departure,” says Ley. \nLike many young Mexican movie houses, Woo Films has a string of production alliances. Among the most fertile, Noc Noc Cinema, which produces Meyer’s next, is a joint venture with Caro; Woo and producer Stacy Perskie often collaborate. \n“Given a relationship which goes back several years, most projects I do I invite Stacy to board and he invites me too on his,” Ley said. Collaboration also pares risk and aids across-the-board flexibility, from financing to physical production. \nOne case in point: Terrazas’ next, “Bayoneta,” one of three Ley projects to be presented at Los Cabos Meet-Mart for Gabriel Figueroa Film Fund financing, is a boxing movie, produced by Ley and Maria Jose Cordova, his Woo Films partner, and Perskie and Gerardo Gatica. \n“Kyzza and I agreed that we didn’t like boxing but did like boxing films. And wondered why nobody had made a film about Mexico’s boxing scene,” said Ley. \nWritten with Rodrigo Marquez Pizano, “Bayoneta” picks up on the trend in the ‘70s and the ‘80s, when Mexican boxing was at its zenith, of other countries’ nationalising Mexican pugilists. Here, a Mexican boxer attempts to make it in Finland. \nLey also repeats with directors, as well as attaching new ones to his slate – a quick way to swell its production numbers, as other companies – Wild Bunch, for example – have seen. \n“Bayoneta” is Ley’s second movie with Terrazas after “Machete Language”; Beristain’s “The Goodbyes” ( pictured ) which plays Los Cabos Work in Progress post-production competition, marks her follow-up to the Ley-produced “I Don’t Want To Sleep Alone.” \nAlso selected for Ventana Sur’s Primer Corte pix-in-post showcase in late November, “The Goodbyes” draws a portrait of the romantic vicissitudes and neediness of Mexican poetess Rosario Castellanos, hinting at her deep emotional life and the fragility of her happiness. Beristain’s is also a female gaze. \n“It’s the most singular biopic that I’ve seen in many years, while still reflecting the magnitude of Rosario Castellano’s character,” Ley enthused. \nOf first-time partnerships, Julio Hernandez Cordon’s “Comprame un revolver,” a second Los Cabos project up for possible Gabriel Figueroa Film Fund finance, is a “pretty complex story,” Ley said. “But it has Julio’s tone,” “between drama, comedy and farce which we end up believing,” he added, saying that “Compráme un revolver” is also a father-daughter set against the background of drug cartels, but not a narco tale. \nWoo Films is also backing Caro’s “Extraños que se besan,” which has a completed screenplay and will shoot next year, and “Volcan,” from Santiago Mohar, also at Los Cabos, who caught attention with “Los muertos.” Ley describes it as a “Mexican film noir.” \nLey’s enthusiasm for working with directors he admires is now driving a small but burgeoning slice of Mexico’s film production.

Shot in stunning 4K resolution, Tales by Light Season One is a six-part series that follows five extraordinary photographers as they push the limits of their craft in little-known, little-covered and little-understood corners of the Earth. “Having Tales by Light Season One available on Netflix is a wonderful acclamation of the quality and broad appeal of our Australian-made photography series and we are excited that it will now entertain millions of subscribers around the world,” says Canon Australia Director of Consumer Imaging and Executive Producer of the series Jason McLean. “This series is unique and started from our simple aim of celebrating the amazing visual storytellers who push the creative boundaries and it’s great that this concept resonates so well across regional divides.” Prior to joining the Netflix documentary content line-up, Tales by Light Season One screened initially on the National Geographic Channel subscription network in Australia and New Zealand. Uniting exploration, photography and the natural world, Tales by Light Season One was produced locally in 2015 and offers a rare glimpse into the eyes and minds of some of Australia and the world’s best photographic storytellers.
