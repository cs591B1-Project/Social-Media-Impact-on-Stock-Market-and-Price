      "text": "SHOW LESS Volatile siderophile elements (e.g., As, Sb, Ge, Ga, In, Bi, Zn, Cd, Sn, Cu, Pb) can place constraints both on early differentiation as well as the origin of volatiles. This large group of elements has been used to constrain Earth accretion [1,2], and Earth-Moon geochemistry [3]. Application to Earth has been fostered by new experimental studies of these elements such as Ge, In, and Ga [4,5,6]. Application to Mars has been limited by the lack of data for many of these elements on martian meteorites. Many volatile elements are considered in the pioneering work by [7] but for only the small number of martian samples then available. We have made new measurements on a variety of martian meteorites in order to obtain more substantial datasets for these elements using the analytical approach of [8]. We use the new dataset, together with published data from the literature, to define martian mantle abundances of volatile siderophile elements. Then, we evaluate the possibility that these abundances could have been set by mid-mantle (14 GPa, 2100 C) metal-silicate equilibrium, as suggested by the moderately and slightly siderophile elements [9]. Finally, we examine the possibility that some elements were affected by volatility and magmatic degassing.",

      "title": "Public Access - Expert Guide to 3D Printing",
      "text": "Share Save \nThe world of 3D printing continues to grow. In fact, over the last 6 years, GE has invested about $1.5 billion in 3D printing technology. With companies like GE making such a significant investment, the future of this technology looks bright. Many people have heard of 3D printing, yet most don't really understand what 3D printing actually is. The first item ever made with a 3D printer was not very exciting; it was an eyewash cup. The cup was made by the inventor of 3D printing Chuck Hull in 1983. Since that first creation, 3D printers have been used to make prosthetics for people and animals, musical instruments, and even human tissue like ears. Here is a closer look at what 3D printing really is and where it is going. What is 3D Printing? 3D printing is the process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. This is achieved through additive processes. With additive processes, an object is created when successive layers of material are laid down until the desired object is developed. Every layer is like a thinly sliced cross section of the final product. The process is started when a virtual design is made of the object that is going to be created. The virtual model is divided by software into hundreds or thousands of horizontal layers. After the 3D model is sliced it is ready to be fed to the 3D printer. The sliced virtual design can be submitted through SD, USB, or Wi-Fi. After the file is uploaded, the object is ready to be printed layer by layer. The 3D printer will read the virtual slices and create a 3-dimensional real-life object. The Rise of Personal 3D Printing Personal 3D printing has been mainly reserved for enthusiasts and hobbyists and really started to explode in 2011 . The increased interest in this type of printing has caused the price of printers to continue to decrease. Prices currently fall into the $250 to $2,500 range. As the price decreases, the opportunity for 3D printing becomes more accessible to more people. This makes the reality of personal 3D printing available to regular people. 3D Printing Services Of course, not everyone wants, or can afford, their own personal 3D printer. This doesn't mean they cannot reap the benefits that 3D printing has to offer. Companies currently exist that provide 3D printing services. These services are generally inexpensive and simple to use. Many can even be accessed online by uploading digital files to websites. Some companies even offer the opportunity to sell your 3D object designs to them and earn some money on the side when other people by an object based on the design. There is also an opportunity for business-to-business commerce based on 3D printing. For example, architecture firms can contract out their model creations to 3D printing firms instead of trying to put them together themselves. They can simply send their designs to the 3D printing service and have that business take care of their model needs. Getting ready for a presentation could not be easier. These types of services are already available in other industries such as dental, medical, entertainment, and art. The Future of 3D Printing Many people believe that the development and advancements of 3D printing will forever change the nature of manufacturing and commerce. They believe this because it allows people to do manufacturing of objects themselves. They do not need to buy these products from other people or businesses. 3D printers that are capable of producing different material with full color currently exist and are improving every day. The more they improve the better objects they will be able to produce. This can have a tremendous impact on robotics , energy use, waste output, customization of products, the availability of products, affordability, medicine, art, construction, and even science. 3D printing has the power to change the world as we currently know it. As you can see, 3D printing has the power to be the future of manufacturing. It puts more power in the hands of individuals and businesses. As the practice grows, the costs will be decreased, and the opportunities to receive the benefits will continue to expand. Those who understand the process well will be the ones in the best position to take advantage of the possibilities. 1 Shares ",

      "text": "Last year, General Electric saw a glimpse of marketing&apos;s future in entertainment by harking back to the past. The brand teamed with its agency BBDO New York, and Slate&apos;s Panoply to launch the GE Podcast Theater with an eight-episode, fictional sci-fi thriller podcast called \"The Message.\" The pod, utilizing storytelling techniques reminiscent of 1940s and 50s radio, was a hit , garnering millions of downloads, and a shelf-full of industry awards.\nFollowing up a blockbuster, as any band or film director can tell you, is no guarantee of success. And now GE gets to find out if \"The Message\" was a one-hit wonder. The brand has unveiled its second podcast, \"LifeAfter,\" which it describes as a \" Her meets Ex Machina \" AI adventure, pondering the question of what happens to our digital identities after we pass, and what role AI can play in the grieving process.\nGE&apos;s head of media innovation Alexa Christon says the goal and process behind \"LifeAfter\" follows very closely to that of its predecessor, to tell a really good story that touches on a theme reflecting on the company&apos;s work in science and technology. For \"The Message,\" that was sound-based medical treatments, but this time the broad theme revolves around digital twinning.\n\"Obviously it&apos;s completely fictional in the podcast, but from a business standpoint we talk about digital twins as the virtual twin of a physical product,\" says Christon. \"Like a jet engine will have a digital twin of its physical object, so as that object performs and does things, the digital version will do the same thing. So from an industrial standpoint—gas turbines, jet engines, those types of big iron we talk about—the digital twin is crucial in how our customers and how we will manage efficiencies in those big iron products in a virtual way and in a virtual space.\"\nChriston says the success of \"The Message\" really put a skip in GE&apos;s creative step. \"I think we saw there&apos;s really a white space in storytelling, and we&apos;re pushing that even more in this second podcast,\" she says. \"What we learned is that while the space is flooded with content, there still isn&apos;t a defined space for this fictional, dramatic radio-style storytelling, and people are really enjoying it. We also learned that people feel this one-to-one relationship with their podcast hosts, and in this space, it&apos;s almost literary, in that you set the stage, create this platform and listeners are imagining it with you, and that&apos;s compelling and exciting.\"\nIt&apos;s a basic tenet of branded content which too often, too many marketers ignore—it&apos;s the quality that generates the audience reaction you&apos;re hoping for, not the number of times you can fit a brand mention in. By being up front and clear about its involvement—it&apos;s called GE Podcast Theater, after all—then stepping aside and letting the story do the work, the brand is fostering a valuable trust with listeners.\n\"This is a very interesting space where people are making a very conscious choice—you have to download a podcast, you have to subscribe and listen, and creating that relationship is something that brands in general covet. How do you create that relationship? How do you provide that &apos;value&apos;?\" sats Christon. \"The brand coming across as providing a really entertaining experience that people find fun and smart, is something we&apos;ve been really excited about experimenting with.\"",

      "text": "India’s tech bubble is about to burst Posted GE   \nEditor’s note: Dileepan Siva is chief revenue officer at Moovweb . \nThe Silicon Valley “tech bubble” is a popular topic of discussion among business pundits, entrepreneurs and analysts who have dissected and predicted the upcoming “burst” for nearly the last decade. For all the talk of winter is coming and a slowdown in private capital markets, it’s hard to say if, or when, this will ever come to a head — at least in Silicon Valley. \nBut there’s no question a tech bubble is emerging, just not where you might think. India’s tech bubble \nOvervalued startups focused on growth over revenue are a problem that stretches far beyond U.S. borders, and it’s an even bigger problem in India. Granted, a tech bubble bursting in India isn’t going to send shock waves through the ecosystem worldwide, let alone the public markets in that country, as it would in the U.S. However, it will impact the pace of innovation and investor risk appetite in the short-term in India and other emerging markets (other than China, the behemoth outlier) who share similar market characteristics (like Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria). \nThe successes — or failures — from what works for the Indian consumer in their home market translates to the rest of the world significantly more so than following the successful models of companies like Alibaba , Tencent and others in China. Even if you don’t care about other emerging markets, experts agree India will soon be the most important economy in the world. Rural India goes mobile \nMuch of India’s future success depends on whether the government can leverage its demographic potential by training its workforce and providing adequate infrastructure for businesses. This challenge is compounded by where the growth in mobile consumers is occurring. According to The Economist, India will see more people come online in the next 15 years than any other country, with the majority of that growth coming from rural, not urban areas. \nThese new mobile consumers will generally be poorer and lack the purchasing power needed to support a booming tech sector. While India’s internet and smartphone penetration is growing incredibly fast, this does not directly translate either into users having the ability to buy voraciously like their Chinese counterparts or new companies able to deliver goods in a timely fashion to rural communities. \nMore to the point, mobile data plans in India, like other emerging markets, do not make the robust use of the internet possible for the vast majority of people. That is not a simple problem to fix, but it is certainly easier to resolve than trying to improve livelihoods and logistics from the top down. Plus, the regulatory context in the country leaves a lot to be desired — just ask Facebook about “ digital colonialism ” related to its “Free Basics” initiative. An inevitable burst Morgan Stanley released a report earlier this year estimating e-commerce sales in India of $119 billion in 2020 — a seven-fold increase from its 2015 prediction. Travel is expected to account for 60 percent or more of e-commerce, with electronics coming in at 30 percent, according to the Boston Consulting Group and Retailers Association of India . A four- to seven-fold increase in market size does not seem too crazy — until you pair it with e-commerce startup valuations in India. Look at the top e-commerce company in India — Flipkart , most recently valued at $15 billion. That is just shy of Morgan Stanley’s estimate for the entire e-commerce market in the country, and does not even include the next two competitors, Snapdeal and Amazon India . Flipkart has approximately 45 percent market share, which means the company should have roughly $7 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) in 2015 using Morgan Stanley’s calculations. So the company is basically valued at more than two times its GMV. But GMV is not sales or revenue to Flipkart; it is total sales of online products. Another reason for the flood of investment into India is the fear of missing out — or FOMO. Flipkart likely takes a nominal revenue share or take rate like Amazon does, but they also must shoulder significant user acquisition costs, meaning they are losing money on every transaction for the foreseeable future. Granted, this is not unlike Amazon’s past strategy, but Amazon was never valued at equal to the entire market’s value either. Add on the fact that approximately 40 percent of the market is non-travel and you have to wonder how these numbers add up. It is no surprise that Flipkart saw its valuation marked down by almost a quarter by three fund investors. Another reason for the flood of investment into India is the fear of missing out — or FOMO — on something akin to China’s enormous success. In one camp, you have investors Napster and Softbank whose portfolios include very successful bets in the Chinese and Indian markets (JD.com, Tencent and Flipkart for Napster, and Alibaba and Snapdeal for Softbank). In the other camp, you have the investors like Amazon who misfired on Chinese growth and do not want to repeat past mistakes. Beyond that, there are local and international VC firms like Sequoia and Accel, as well as more opportunistic investors like Tiger Global that sense opportunity and do not want to be left out. What’s next for unicorns in India So what does this mean for the other unicorns in India? Investment in Indian startups decreased in the first half of 2016 to $2.1 billion, a 40 percent decline from the same period in 2015 , when startups raised $3.5 billion. Anecdotally, it seems as though this retrenchment is not due to a reassessment of the startups in question but is part of a global reassessment of investor appetite for tech startups worldwide. It is likely that market leaders like Flipkart, Ola and others will get devalued markedly, but will continue to receive investor interest due to FOMO.

In addition, for some companies, it may be too early to dive into a fledgling market that lacks a needed expansion of the middle class . While e-commerce retailers and marketplaces can leverage technology to achieve low capital costs up and down the value chain, this is less true for food or grocery delivery companies that have to contend with India’s poor infrastructure. When the number of turns per hour is the key metric for success and profit, logistics is critical. Add to that high user acquisition and retention costs thanks to innumerable discounts and subsidies, and it is hard to believe these burn rates can last much longer given the poor unit economics. Consider food delivery startup TinyOwl’s recent termination of 100 employees, shutting down operations in smaller cities and raising prices — that is likely just the beginning. When asked about those changes, TinyOwl CEO Harshvardhan Mandad said earnestly, “The market dynamics changed. People now want to invest in sustainable businesses.” When do they not? Looking ahead A potential bright spot is the crop of Indian startups that are taking the learnings from their home market and applying it to other, more mature markets while waiting for India to become viable. Zomato , for instance, a listings service for restaurants, expanded overseas from its New Delhi headquarters because the Indian market was too limited. Most of India’s restaurants are extremely inexpensive and a customer’s average ticket is too low to justify the support, whereas other parts of Asia and even Europe are much more ripe for the pickings. InMobi , a mobile advertising platform headquartered in Bengaluru is another Indian startup with substantial operations overseas, including the United States. Their motivation is simple: The mobile ad market is bigger outside India. So how bad is the bubble in India? Is it at the point where Silicon Valley was in the dot-com bubble from 1999-2001? No. This is private market overvaluation, not public markets. But compared to the “bubble” we have in Silicon Valley, it is undoubtedly worse. All said and done, India will be one of, if not the biggest, internet market of the future, but I wouldn’t bet on that happening anytime soon. Featured Image: Yamada Taro/Getty Images 0",

Members Sign In GE deepens Silicon Valley push with $915 million cloud deal The Boston Globe Brian Snyder/REUTERS/File 2016 General Electric chief executive Jeffrey Immelt has sold off most finance and consumer businesses to focus on industries such as energy and aviation, as the company attempts to position itself as a “digital industrial” concern. By Richard Clough Bloomberg News November 15, 2016 \nGeneral Electric Co. has agreed to buy ServiceMax, a cloud-based software company, for $915 million to expand its digital operations and enhance equipment maintenance. \nThe deal will help GE automate and digitize the servicing of heavy-duty machinery, the Boston-based company said Monday in a statement. GE expects the acquisition to close in January. Advertisement \n“It’s no secret our services revenue is the bulk of our earnings and is a key part of what makes us successful,” Bill Ruh, chief executive of GE Digital, said in an interview. “We’re moving away from where it’s all on paper to where it’s all becoming fully automated. Services are becoming a key part of the digital economy.” \nGE is investing in software operations and attempting to position itself as a “digital industrial” company that makes equipment outfitted with sensors to improve productivity. CEO Jeffrey Immelt has sold off most finance and consumer businesses while focusing on industries such as energy and aviation. Get Business Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here \nGE Digital, established last year and based on the outskirts of Silicon Valley in California, may become a $15 billion business by 2020, the company has said. GE has developed an operating system called Predix to help run industrial equipment more reliably and efficiently. \n“The addition of ServiceMax better positions GE Digital to accelerate the commercialization of Predix applications by combining GE’s industrial portfolio and domain expertise with ServiceMax’s field service expertise,” Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. \nGerman rival Siemens AG also has been expanding its digital presence. The engineering company on Monday agreed to buy US software maker Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion. Advertisement \nServiceMax provides field-service management software to remotely track equipment maintenance, create work orders, and manage repair schedules. The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company had raised more than $200 million from investors, including GE’s venture arm. \nGE considered developing its own ability to automate and digitize servicing, but opted to buy ServiceMax after using its products over the last two years, Ruh said. Industrial servicing, including maintenance and upgrades of previously sold equipment, could be a $1 trillion global market over the next 10 years, and digitizing the process could account for a significant percentage of that, Ruh said. \n“This is a large opportunity,” he said. \nThe acquisition of ServiceMax extends a recent shopping spree for GE, including a tie-up between the oil division and Baker Hughes Inc., deals in the 3-D printer market, and the purchase of a maker of wind-turbine blades. \nServiceMax also complements other moves GE has made to fill out its digital business, Ruh said. The company in September paid $495 million for Meridium Inc., a software developer focused on asset performance management, or the monitoring of equipment. \nGE will continue to look for “tuck-in” acquisitions for the digital business, he said. “These things fit together as a string of pearls.” \nMorgan Stanley was the financial adviser for ServiceMax and Gundersen Dettmer LLP served as legal counsel, according to the statement. King & Spalding LLP was legal counsel for GE Digital. Loading comments...",

      "text": " Google+\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\nGeneral Electric global ombuds leader Charlene Giacin walks to South Station for her commute home.\nBy Jon Chesto November 16, 2016\nThis story is from the 2016 Top Places to Work issue. You’ll find the full list of winners on BostonGlobe.com on Thursday evening.\nTHE NEWS IN JANUARY that General Electric would move to Boston took veteran employee Charlene Giacin by surprise. But she didn’t expect it to have a direct impact on her family.\n She and her husband and two children had built a life around GE’s corporate headquarters in Fairfield, Connecticut, and most of the workers there would be moving to nearby Norwalk. She had no reason to think she would be joining the 150 or so employees migrating to Boston.\nAdvertisement\nThen Giacin applied for a promotion, and in May, the 48-year-old learned she got the job as GE’s global ombuds leader. The position came with one big complication: Giacin would need to relocate after all. GE’s plans to open temporary offices on Farnsworth Street in Boston’s Fort Point section in August didn’t leave her much time.\nGiacin, a self-described “Type A personality,” and her husband went into overdrive. They set a move deadline that coincided closely with the GE office opening date, which would help their boys get settled in before the new school year. They worked with GE’s internal task force, established to help guide employees through the process. GE’s longtime relocation company, Cartus, provided information about local school systems, reimbursed house-hunting costs, and provided moving and cleaning services to empty out their Connecticut home.\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here At first they looked south of Boston, because they liked the idea of living near the coast. Both GE’s temporary office and the site of its future headquarters are near South Station, which helped them orient the search. Eventually they decided to be closer to the city, in part to experience living in a place with sidewalks and public transportation within walking distance. “I didn’t want to be so far away from the kids that it would take me an hour and a half to get there,” Giacin says.\nView Story Why one company lets employees bring their babies to work New Hampshire’s W.S. Badger has created an unusual policy for employees with infants.\nThat brought them to the suburbs just west of Boston. By early August, they had an agreement on a home in Needham’s Birds Hill section, and she had to say goodbye to her swimming pool and nearly 3-acre lot in Fairfield County. “We had a good piece of property in Connecticut,” she says. “I knew we wouldn’t be able to get that in Boston.” But Giacin can walk to the commuter rail, and her boys can ride their bikes to a Dunkin’ Donuts.\nHer commute’s much longer now — up to an hour and 10 minutes. But she can work on the train. Another upside: all the walking. “Every night when I get home, I have 10,000 steps,” she says.\nAdvertisement\nThe human resources challenges represent the toughest aspect of any corporate move, according to John Boyd, a New Jersey-based relocation consultant. Boyd says GE has a reputation as one of the best companies in terms of handling employee relocations. Nonetheless, he says, executives may have underestimated the difficulties of transferring key personnel a relatively short distance, particularly since Fairfield County’s housing market has not fully recovered from the Great Recession.\nWhen GE relocates workers, it sometimes offers to buy their homes if they’re unable to sell them before they move, an unusual perk that benefited Giacin. Her family’s home was one of several GE bought because of the Boston move, a spokeswoman says. The company expects to sell them eventually.\nFor Giacin and her family, the hardest part was saying goodbye to their tightknit group of friends in Connecticut. But her roughly 200 co-workers on Farnsworth Street are proving to be a great support network. “We’re fortunate because we knew so many people who had already been through the process,” she says.\nThere are still challenges. Her husband has landed a temporary teaching gig at Needham High School but needs to find a long-term position. Giacin is still learning her way around her new hometown and surrounding area. Still, she’s glad she made the move. She likes that her colleagues are no longer spread out across a suburban campus. “It’s so energizing,” Giacin says. “I’m engaging with more people now. It’s a real sense of camaraderie, of everybody coming here on Day One together, starting on this new venture together.”\nJon Chesto is a Boston Globe staff writer.

      "text": "Internet of Things GE wants Predix to be the Windows of industrial IoT GE yesterday launched new applications and partnerships based on its analytics software, which it says helps companies anticipate when critical machines will fail. Related Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry CIO | Nov 16, 2016 10:17 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nGeneral Electric five years ago launched a software platform intended to create applications that could take their cues from sensor-equipped turbines. The idea was that companies could improve productivity by reducing manual check-ups and save millions of dollars in operational costs by anticipating when their planes, trains and other heavy equipment would require maintenance. \nFast forward to today and Predix, as the distributed OS is known, may become for the industrial internet of things (IoT) what Microsoft Windows became for personal computers if GE has its way. The Predix ecosystem includes nearly 20,000 third-party developers while revenues associated with Predix and other software from GE Digital’s business will increase 20 percent to $6 billion in 2016, GE announced at a customer event yesterday. \n[ Related: GE CIO says IT leaders need to focus on customers’ revenue ] \n\"This idea of combining machine data with analytics and enterprise data is where the next level of productivity from companies is going to come from,\" says GE CIO Jim Fowler, adding that BP, Exelon Maersk Drilling have begun using Predix to reduce maintenance costs and unplanned downtime. Analytics on the edge \nAt its annual Minds + Machines event, GE introduced the Predix Edge System, which is designed to help industrial companies host apps and data on machines and edge devices, including anything from medical devices to controllers to network gateways and routers. This strategy incorporates GE devices, such as Field Agent, a component of GE’s Industrial Internet Control System, which connects thousands of machines to the cloud. \nAnother app, currently being tested by Walgreens and McDonald’s, analyzes and optimizes energy use across anything from lighting to HVAC systems. GE also unveiled a Predix app that’s built to provide s continuous inspection data and analytics of pipe conditions via ultrasonic sensors. \nPredix may form the heart of GE Digital’s software strategy but it has a supporting cast. G E also relies on Digital Twins, essentially virtual models to gain insights about performance and operation. \nOne Digital Twin includes a model of an aircraft engine, which includes data about its specifications, test data from the manufacturing line, as well as data about how the product operates in the field. GE’s Global Research Center hosts more than 300 such Twins that pull data from product lifecycle management systems, machine data and ERP systems. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: 12 most powerful Internet of Things companies \nCollectively, Twins form a manufacturing record GE calls a Digital Thread, which can alert companies to how much the engine has deteriorated after each operation. “The Digital Thread is what connects [Digital Twins] together under a serial number to make sure there is a lifeline to that number,” Fowler says. Acquisitions drive digital business \nWhile efforts initially focused on organic growth, GE Digital of late has been acquiring companies that specialize in cloud and analytics tool. The unit in September paid $495 million for Meridium, a maker of asset performance management software. \n[ Related: GE's Jim Fowler on the CIO role in the digital industrial economy ] \nOn Monday, GE agreed to pay $915 million for ServiceMax, a provider of field service management that runs in the cloud. Yesterday, GE Digital acquired Bit Stew intended to help GE to organize large amounts of data at the source of the data, such as a turbine or drilling system. \nGE Digital yesterday also acquired Wise.io, which makes advanced machine learning and data science software designed toenable engineers to ingest data from machines to find patterns and potentially predict new outcomes. Fowler says that incorporating machine-learning capabilities will enable Predix to pull data off of machines in a manufacturing plant to anticipate changes to quality, cycle times or inventory problems. “We let the asset drive that value equation for us,” Fowler says. \n[ Related: How GE software is making its mark on the Industrial Internet ] \nGE also announced a program dedicated to independent software vendors (ISVs), aimed at driving awareness and adoption of the Predix platform. ISV partners, which includes inaugural members such as Box, Pitney Bowes and Ericsson, will be able to use Predix to build maintenance, content development and asset management apps. The ISV program supplements GE’s Digital Alliance program, whose 270 partners include AT&T, Intel and Microsoft. \nFowler says the focus is on driving better execution for customers in 2017. \n“We’ve got to go do what we’re saying we’re going to do for these customers and we’ve got to get their productivity and their benefits across the finish line,” Fowler says. “The proof is going to be in the customers’ outcome.\" This story, \"GE wants Predix to be the Windows of industrial IoT \" was originally published by CIO .

      "text": "Builder Connected GE Kitchen Appliances Now Answer to Voice Commands Homeowners can ask Amazon's Alexa and her new GE counterpart \"Geneva\" to set the oven timer or start the dishwasher. By Lauren Shanesy GE Appliances has added new skills in time for Thanksgiving, including tailored turkey oven temperatures and meat probe settings. \nThanksgiving is coming up next week, and kitchens are about to get hectic as families pile in to cook a myriad of stuffing dishes, sweet potato casseroles, pumpkin pies, and roasted turkeys for the holiday meal. Just in time, GE appliances now give homeowners an on-hand sous chef to tame the kitchen chaos. \nGE Appliances has partnered with Amazon to add Alexa skill sets to its WiFi connected appliances. Homeowners working in the kitchen can now ask Alexa, the voice who \"lives\" inside the automated Amazon Echo system, to assist with tasks around the kitchen, such as preheating the oven, checking the internal temperature of a meat while cooking with an integrated meat probe, or starting the dishwasher, all with a simple voice command. \nBut Alexa isn't acting alone. Meet Geneva, the unique character created by GE Appliances and Monogram for the built-in Alexa skill set. Geneva launched in September of this year and is the first Alexa skill set from the company to control a broad range of kitchen appliances, including refrigerators, dishwashers, wall ovens, ranges, laundry and more. Homeowners can say things like, \"Alexa, tell Geneva to preheat my oven for turkey,\" \"Alexa, tell Geneva to set the oven timer for 10 minutes,\" or \"Alexa, ask Geneva when the dishwasher will be finished.\" \nFor a fun added holiday perk, Geneva is also designed to get into the holiday spirit. When speaking with her on Thanksgiving day, she may reply to users with a \"Happy Turkey Day\" or a \"Gobble Gobble\". \nThis isn't GE's first collaboration with the web services company. In October, GE added Amazon's Dash buttons to their dishwashers , which provide homeowners with a built-in push button that orders more detergent through their online account and has it delivered right to their door.

(Lori Van Buren / Times Union) Exterior of GE Global Research on Friday March 1, 2013 in Niskayuna, N.Y. (Lori Van Buren   Lori Van Buren GE using augmented reality to fix machines 1 / 4 Back to Gallery \nGeneral Electric Co. has started using augmented reality devices as the company takes a major plunge into the use of artificial intelligence and virtual reality. \nAt the 2016 GE Minds + Machines conference held this week in San Francisco, Colin Parris, the vice president of GE Software Research, demonstrated how employees are talking to machines and interacting with them using Microsoft's Hololens augmented reality device. \nGE has created so-called \"digital twins\" of the machines that it sells - a steam turbine for instance - that are digital replicas of actual machines at customer sites. The company has created a software system that allows customers to speak to the digital twin and ask it questions about potential parts breakdowns, financial forecasts and the best way to fix problems. \nThe digital twins are loaded with data they can crunch to provide the best advice - which is given in real language not unlike Siri on the iPhone. \n\"This is happening now,\" Parris who works in Niskayuna said after he talked to a digital twin of a steam turbine at a customer site in Southern California. \"What you saw was an example of the human mind working with the mind of a machine. \nThe digital twin can run thousands of simulations at a time using environmental and operational data to predict breakdowns or other events. \nAnd when a machine needs to be fixed, GE and its customers can use augmented reality to look inside those machines without having to actually touch them. \nParris put on a Microsoft Hololens - an augmented reality headset - to superimpose the digital twin over a picture of the actual steam turbine. The Hololens allowed him to open up the turbine and look at the parts - and see exactly which part may need replacing. \nParris said GE has been partnering with Microsoft on augmented reality technology. He says that AR as it is also called can help GE executives redesign a factory floor by moving parts around in augmented reality. \nIt can also help with training and production, helping to teach workers how to assemble parts even before they ever step on a factory floor. \n\"It's virtual reality,\" Parris said.

      "text": "  4,   Abstract Expanding the versatility of well-defined clusters seeking distinctive physical and chemical behavior in a rational manner is a relevant issue in the design of functional nanostructures. Superatomic clusters through the prominent Au 25 (SR) 18 aggregate offer an ideal template and robust framework to gain understading of the different behavior gained by the inclusion of different endohedral dopant atoms. Our results allow to gain more insights into the role of group XIV elements for both optical and bonding, revealing characteristic patterns to be expected in their low-energy UV-spectrum. The bonding shows an extension of the regular s-type interaction observed in [Au@Au 24 (SR) 18 ] − to a more extended and covalent interaction given by s- and p-type interaction when the central atom is replaced by a group XIV elements, which can be expected of other endohedral p-block elements. In addition, the role of the spin–orbit coupling into the electronic and optical properties is discussed in terms of the new selection rules required by such regime. The characteristic optical and bonding patterns resulting from the p-element endohedral doping of the Au 25 (SR) 18 superatom shed light into the rational variation of the molecular properties upon inclusion of an endohedral p-block element.

      "text": "Boston helipad will most likely land on South Boston pier Platform tied to GE headquarters Rec The city and the state have picked a South Boston pier for the first public-use helipad in downtown Boston in 16 years. The landing platform at the city-owned pier behind the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion is tied to General Electric’s future Fort Point headquarters . As for the mechanics of the actual helipad, that remains ... up in the air. Per Jon Chesto in the Globe : “Options include building on the pier; a floating barge next to the pier; or an adjacent property controlled by the Massachusetts Port Authority.” Other details, including the construction timetable and the cost, are still undecided as well. Officials do estimate that the helipad could accommodate up to 20 flights daily. A task force will look into the project—and reconnoiter with residents nearby—and report back to the city and the state by mid-January.",

      "text": "SHOW LESS The primary focus of this paper is to investigate the loss sources in an advanced GE transonic compressor design with high reaction and high stage loading. This advanced compressor has been investigated both experimentally and analytically in the past. The measured compressor efficiency is significantly lower than the efficiency calculated with various existing tools based on RANS and URANS. The general understanding is that some important flow physics in this modern compressor design are not represented in the current tools. To pinpoint the source of the efficiency miss, an advanced test with detailed flow traverse was performed for the front one and a half stage at the NASA Glenn Research Center. In the present paper, a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is employed to determine whether a higher-fidelity simulation can pick up any additional flow physics that can explain past efficiency miss with RANS and URANS. The results from the Large Eddy Simulation were compared with the NASA test results and the GE interpretation of the test data. LES calculates lower total pressure and higher total temperature on the pressure side of the stator, resulting in large loss generation on the pressure side of the stator. On the other hand, existing tools based on the RANS and URANS do not calculate this high total temperature and low total pressure on the pressure side of the stator. The calculated loss through the stator from LES seems to match the measured data and the GE data interpretation. Detailed examination of the unsteady flow field from LES indicates that the accumulation of high loss near the pressure side of the stator is due to the interaction of the rotor wake with the stator blade. The strong rotor wake interacts quite differently with the pressure side of the stator than with the suction side of the stator blade. The concave curvature on the pressure side of the stator blade increases the mixing of the rotor wake with the pressure side boundary layer significantly. On the other hand, the convex curvature on the suction side of the stator blade decreases the mixing and the suction side blade boundary layer remains thin. The jet velocity in the rotor wake in the stator frame seems to magnify the curvature effect in addition to inviscid redistribution of wake fluid toward the pressure side of the blade.",

      "text": "General Electric is not your grandfather’s power company any longer. The 124-year-old company is now an innovator in the digital transformation, developing software-defined machines and connected, responsive and predictive solutions. To that end, GE Power & Water hired its first Chief Digital Officer Ganesh Bell to be the architect of this digital transformation and drive business growth. Since he began back in February 2014, Bell’s team has grown to approximately 1,800 people who are reinventing the way the world is powered.\nTo understand the explosive growth of how large an impact the digital transformation is having on the industrial sector, look to the increased attendance at the GE Minds + Machines event. While at the event in San Francisco, Bell sat down with Jeff Frick, host of theCUBE from the SiliconANGLE Media team, to elaborate on GE digital initiatives and the Electricity Value Network. This week, theCUBE features Ganesh Bell as our Guest of the Week.\nOne of the reasons the show is more popular and becoming more mainstream is due to the decrease in productivity in the industrial sector over the last few years. According to Bell, it is only 25 percent of what it used to be and that is the motivating factor for industry to seek efficiency and extracting new value through digital transformation. “It’s not just automation, it’s about creating new value, new revenue from digital assets and that’s why you see the excitement across all the industries here,” noted Bell.\nSoftware: eating or transforming the world? Bell spent most of his career in Silicon Alley working in information technology and has long held the belief that all industries would be reimagined with software , however, he now sees that software is transforming the world as well. GE creates the machines that generate power for more than one-third of the world, but they also generate more than two terabytes of data per day.\nAnd for Bell, this data matters. “We can learn a lot from this data and make these machines efficient, more productive,” he stated. “The three sexiest words for industrialists are ‘no unplanned downtime.’ We can eliminate breakdowns which turn into massive productivity and value for our customers,” Bell added.\nAlthough the science in producing machines continues to advance, the output in productivity and efficiency can be further improved by software. By using edge applications across the power network, the machine can be duplicated into what GE calls a “digital twin” which is a virtual representation of the physical machine. This allows real-time simulation, provides operational data and applies algorithms that enhance the asset’s performance.\nGE created the firs combined-cycle power plant outfitted with the company’s HA turbine in Bouchain, France. This plant, recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s most efficient power plant.\nThe digital twin delivers new life Additionally, the company is doing this at older power plants as well. Working with A2A Group , based in Chivasso, Italy, GE upgraded to respond quickly to the changing grid demands required to manage a fluctuating renewable energy (RE) grid. Bell explained in order for the plant to be competitive in delivering ancillary services to the RE market it needed to quickly ramp up power when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine and then shut down right away.\nIn this case, GE used its digital twin technology. “With the additional software, we were able to reopen a power plant that was mothballed, and jobs were reinstated and the power plant is flexible and competitive in the ancillary services market,” said Bell.\nThe GE Electricity Value Network provides visualization capabilities along with predictive analytics and optimization software to help customers integrate assets and operations to reduce costs for the business and customers.\nBell illustrated the way the mix of fuel changes over the world. “The beauty of software is we can help optimize the mix. In the past, we always talked about renewables being the silver bullet or gas is the silver bullet. Now we are saying software is your silver bullet, regardless of the mix of fuel , we can optimize the generation of electrons and we are seeing the entire industry of electricity being transformed around digital,” Bell remarked.\nOne customer, Exelon is a prime example of what happens when and entire utility goes digital. During the Minds + Machines event, both companies announced that there will be a collaboration using the GE Predix platform to provide enterprise-wide digital transformation.\n“Leaders like Exelon have the opportunity to create that tipping point in history…this is the moment the digital transformation of the electricity industry went real,” declared Bell.\nWatch the complete video interview below, and be sure to check out more of SiliconANGLE and theCUBE’s coverage of GE Minds + Machines .\nPhoto by SiliconANGLE ",

      "text": "SEATTLE — Boeing named General Electric executive Kevin McAllister as the head of its Commercial Airplanes unit Monday as part of a corporate reorganization that will add a third pillar to its sprawling aerospace business.\nBoeing intends to elevate its airplane services arm to be a major division on the level of its two premier divisions: defense and space, and commercial airplanes.\nThe reorganization was unveiled Monday along with the announcement that chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplanes unit, Ray Conner, 61, is leaving the post, effective immediately. Boeing said Conner will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017.\nConner will be succeeded by McAllister, 53, who leaves as head of GE’s Aviation services business.\nThe new Boeing Global Services unit will be headed by company veteran Stan Deal, 52, who currently runs Boeing’s commercial aviation services business.\nThe creation of the new dedicated services division has been a longtime ambition for the aerospace giant. Boeing, best known for building jetliners, fighter jets, rockets and satellites, has sought to diversify away from the ups and downs of manufacturing and tap into the steady revenue that comes from servicing aircraft throughout their multi-decade lifetime.\n“Substantial services growth is core to Boeing’s strategy,” said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive.\nSelling services and spare parts to airlines, maintenance shops and governments is an increasingly lucrative business for the company. The company has plotted a steep expansion of its services business aiming to more than triple sales to about $50 billion by 2025, from an estimated $15 billion in 2015, according to Muilenburg.\nBoeing has less than 10% market share in the services operations at both its civil and defense aerospace businesses, providing “ample room to grow,” he said.\nMuilenburg said the new services unit would be up and running in the third quarter of 2017 and based in Dallas.\nBoeing’s push into the spare parts business threatens to further destabilize the business models of many of its own suppliers. Boeing’s own suppliers rely on selling parts at a steep markup to airlines and other buyers to offset the lowest prices that plane makers receive when building airplanes on the assembly line.\nMcAllister inherits a host of challenges at Boeing, including steep production ramp ups of its updated single-aisle 737 Max aircraft and introduction of its long-range 777X jetliner in 2020. McAllister will also helm Boeing as it weighs designing an all-new medium-range aircraft that wouldn’t be ready until around 2025.\nConner, a 39-year Boeing veteran who started as a mechanic building 727s and rose to company vice chairman, will retire at the end of 2017.\nIn a letter to employees, Conner said he would continue to “stay engaged in the ongoing product strategy work that will shape the future of our airplane family.”\nThe Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO role is as much an executive position as it is a U.S. diplomatic role, acting as a highly-visible figure representing the U.S.’s largest exporter at airlines around the globe. The appointment also further cements the relationship between Boeing and GE, which supplies most of its jet engines. Muilenburg’s predecessor, Jim McNerney, came to Boeing from GE and retired in March.\nMcAllister’s appointment as head of Boeing’s commercial business is also a break with tradition. It marks the first time the company has tapped an outsider for that top job.\n“He’s a great partner of Boeing, he knows us well,” said Muilenburg.",

      "text": "You might be surprised to learn that General Electric (NYSE: GE) has something of a history with President-elect Donald Trump. The company owned a stake in NBC Universal during the run of \"The Apprentice.\"\n\"I knew [Trump] a little bit when we owned NBC and did 'The Apprentice,'\" CEO Jeff Immelt told Vanity Fair in August. \"And I always found him to be fun to work with, endearing, competitive, lots of good things.\" However, in that same interview, Immelt questioned the campaign's rhetoric.\nFor his part, Trump was quite critical of GE during his campaign, accusing the company of closing U.S. plants and shipping jobs to Mexico. So, it's worth taking a look at how GE will fare under a Trump presidency. While it's tough to predict exactly what initiatives Trump will prioritize, his broad agenda as articulated thus far gives some hints that GE investors should be cautiously optimistic about what the future holds.\nContinue reading ",

      "title": "Predix, Digital Twin 'Think' About Operations Together",
      "text": "GE's Predix analytics system for the industrial Internet and its platform for constructing a digital twin of an industrial plant asset are often discussed as two separate things.\nAt its Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco Nov. 16, its VP of software research, Colin Parris, gave a video demonstration of how Predix analytics could be combined with information from a digital twin operating in a virtual environment to come up with recommendations for a rapidly growing wear and tear problem.\nA digital twin is a recreation in a virtual environment of a physical asset. GE is creating them for major industrial assets, such as a locomotive, jet engine or power plant turbine. The twin includes the engineering plans, operational history and algorithms that mimic wear under different operating conditions. Each component of the asset has its own twin along with a composite twin that mimics who they work together in the real world. Gartner has named digital twins as one of the top ten technologies of 2017.\nThe video demonstration was triggered toward the end of the second day keynote oby Harel Kodesh, GE's VP for Predix and CTO. The demonstration of a digital twin and Predix working on the same problem was striking in part because Parris could address a natural language query to the digital twin and after a short processing delay, get a natural language response back from Predix. It was a sort of Serious version of Siri for the Internet of Industrial assets. The subject of the demo was a rapidly wearing out generating plant turbine. A YouTube archive of the presentation is available here .\nThe interaction is initiated by \"Twin 6321,\" a virtual replica of a turbine, which alerts the operator responsible for it that it's detected a growing problem with a rotor in the machine. The voice activated part of what turned out to be the OpFlex application that was demonstrated at Minds + Machines is still under development. The query and response from the digital twin is possible with a conventional, command-line interface today, GE spokesmen told InformationWeek after the presentation, an account of which follows.\n<https://inter <p><strong>[Want to learn more about how to work with Predix? Read <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/iot/ge-supplies-iot-developer-kit-for-predix/d/d-id/1326402?itc=edit_in_body_cross\"target=\"_blank\"> GE Supplies IoT Developer Kit For Predix.</a>.]</strong></p>\n\"OK, twin, help me understand the problem,\" responded Parris, standing in for the plant operator in the video.\nTwin 6321 thinks a moment, or perhaps we should say Predix processes the query for a moment, and responds that the number of turbine start/stop cycles has gone up dramatically. \"Over the last six months, my number of cold starts is four; my number of warm starts is eight; my number of hot starts is 39,\" the twin states in somewhat metronomic voice. That represents a 27.5% increase in starts and stops, it concludes.\nParris next asked, \"Tell me about your rotor damage.\"\nThe twin through Predix responded: \"My damage rate has increased by 4.0 times over the last six months. If this were to continue, I would lose 69% of my useful life.\"\nParris then commanded: \"Twin, give me options for mitigating that rotor damage.\"\nThe response: \"Based on weather forecasts, historical data, fuel costs, electricity pricing and my present condition, there are two options. Option 1) is manually slow down my startup ramp rate to reduce wear on my rotor. Option 2 is download the Opflex App (from GE) and apply controls to minimize stress and reduce fuel consumption too.\"\nParris asked how does he know he can depend on the rules and assumptions in the Opflex App.\nTwin responded: \"I used my 15 years of past history. I used fleet learning from 125 other steam turbines, like me. I did 58,900 simulation runs to get this calculation. I am 95% confident of my assumptions.\"\nParris than asked about the costs of option 2: \"Tell me about the numbers.\"\n\"The numbers look good,\" said Twin in response. \"We can reduce stress by 25%, which will reduce damage down to the normal range. Start-up time will come down 40% and start fuel costs will come down by 50%.\" And most of all, the generating plant will avoid an unplanned outage that would have cost it $12 million, the Predix analysis concluded.\nAt the end of the video of this dialogue between Parris and a digital twin, Parris walked out on stage to say such an exchange would be possible with a D11 steam turbine digital twin for a physical turbine that is currently running in Southern California.\n\"What you saw was the human mind working with a machine,\" he told the keynote crowd. About 2,700 attended the conference, held on Pier 48 behind AT&T ballpark where the San Francisco bGiants play.\nA production user of digital twins is Exelon, which GE unveiled Nov. 15 as its largest electricity generation partner and user of Predix . In a follow up to an interview with InformationWeek, Brian Hoff, director of corporate innovation, said the firm is using digital twins of steam generators powered by natural gas at Exelon's Colorado Bend Generating Plant in Wharton County, Texas.\nThe natural gas generating plant has implemented 1,000 tags or instrumented components on 14 physical assets in the plant and \"built analytics models using several combinations of those tags,\" GE spokesmen for Hoff wrote. Exelon operations will use Predix to predict equipment wear and conditions, prevent maintenance problems and lower operational costs and risks. It's built predictive models to show optimum \"heat balance\" in operating conditions, optimum mechanical operating conditions and degree of lubrication, optimum fuel usage and conditions under which performance loss may be observed.\n\"As we deploy Predix across the rest of the fleet, we will extend the digital twin across all generation assets,\" said the email response.\n ",

      "text": "Already a subscriber? Members Sign In GE’s new Boston home will combine past and future with museum of innovation By Adam Vaccaro Globe Staff November 26, 2016 General Electric Co. wants its new Boston headquarters to be a showcase of the innovative technologies it plans to bring to industrial machinery. But the campus being planned for the Fort Point neighborhood will also include a paean to GE’s storied past as inventor of some of the great machinery and innovations of the modern age. \nThe complex will include a gallery or museum of sorts on the lower floors of its planned 12-story building that will mix new discoveries with historical displays of iconic past products. Advertisement \n“I don’t even necessarily like the word museum,” said Peter Cavanaugh, a GE executive who is leading the planning. “We think in this experience that we’ll have a measure of past, a measure of present, and a measure of future.” \nFor example, the space will likely include a table with a computer screen on its surface, showing visitors how data is collected, displayed, and analyzed using Internet-connected machinery. GE is betting big on “digital industrial” products that allow machines to communicate with one another. At the same time, the gallery will probably feature homages to the multinational conglomerate’s 124-year history, which traces back to Thomas Edison. \n“Where we use artifacts, it will be artifacts with a story,” Cavanaugh said. “Every generation has its own game-changing products.” \nIts many inventions and innovations range from lighting to locomotives and jet engines, power generators and X-ray tubes, plastics, and consumers appliances from electric fans to refrigerators. \nThe company’s former headquarters in suburban Fairfield, Conn., did not have public displays, but Cavanaugh said GE does have “innovation centers” at other locations around the world that showcase its work. Advertisement \nGE relocated from Fairfield, Conn., in August, setting up shop in temporary headquarters in Fort Point , while it draws out plans for a $200 million campus that includes two renovated brick buildings and the new 12-story structure. \nBecause the property is located along the waterfront, GE is required to provide public access to much of its ground-level space. Other public amenities will include a harborwalk, a cafe, a bistro, and a STEM education center for students. Cavanaugh said the company would probably plan a museum regardless of its public access requirement. \nGE’s museum would hardly be novel. Coca-Cola, Harley-Davidson, Intel, and Wells Fargo have them. And in Boston, New Balance has a “visitor engagement center” featuring its history at its headquarters, while Massachusetts General Hospital features a medical museum. \nKeri Koehler, a former archivist for Wells Fargo said corporate museums differ from many traditional museums because “everything is about the brand.” \n“It fulfills a marketing or branding initiative,” she said. “But I also think there are corporations that have been around for a long time and they’re proud of their heritage.” \nKoehler said “real museum” professionals sometimes disparage the corporate exhibits as marketing tools. But she defended the corporate versions, arguing that preserving major companies’ pasts helps tell the story of “the making of America.” \nCavanaugh said GE “wouldn’t shy away from” less glamorous moments in corporate history, though those elements would likely be couched to tell a broader story. \n‘I don’t even necessarily like the word museum. We think in this experience that we’ll have a measure of past, a measure of present, and a measure of future.’ \nFor example, the museum could include failed products as an example of how innovation does not guarantee market success. He also said it would be “in-bounds” to reference the company’s own history of corporate pollution as part of a broader message about GE’s environmental goals and green technology. He stressed that the company is not yet sure what the museum will specifically feature. Adam Vaccaro can be reached at . Follow him on Twitter at @adamtvaccaro . Loading comments...",

      "title": "Should You Buy GE Stock After The Recent Rally? General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)",
      "text": "GE stock has outperformed the market since the election result. The recent rally has stretched GE's valuation. The stock is currently in the overbought territory. GE stock remains a long-term buy, though it may face short-term correction. Flickr \nThe surprise election of Donald Trump has fueled a bull rally in the equity market with most major indices reaching all-time highs . The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDX:INDU) is up more than 4.5%, while the Dow Jones Composite (INDX:COMP) and S&P 500 (INDX:SPAL) have gained more than 3%. The bull run is powered by the hope that the President-Elect's policies will spur growth and generate employment. General Electric (NYSE:GE) has been one of the major beneficiaries of this bull run with the stock gaining more than 6% since the election. GE's long-term fundamentals remain strong, but the recent rally has stretched its valuation. So, the major question facing investors is should they buy GE stock now or wait for a correction? Does The Trump Victory Justify The Rally In GE Stock? \nIt is interesting to note that, before the election, the market was wary of a Trump Presidency, with the market showing a high level of volatility whenever Mr. Trump gained in the opinion polls. The rationale for this pessimism was that a Trump presidency would bring a high level of uncertainty in the market. However, after the election, the narrative has turned upside down. Instead of correcting, the market rallied on the hope that Mr. Trump's economic and tax policies will lead to a higher growth and employment. \nMr. Trump has vowed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on building infrastructure . This proposal will boost GE's transportation and infrastructure business. Mr. Trump's proposal to remove restrictions on oil and gas sector will boost growth in this sector and benefit GE. GE has been making heavy investments in this sector, including the recent collaboration with Baker Huges. The recent deal will create the largest oil fields services company in the world. Mr. Trump's proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate and his proposal for tax cash repatriation by US multinationals at a significantly lower rate will also immensely benefit global giants like GE. (Also Read: Does The Baker Hughes Deal Make GE Stock A Buy? ) \nBut on the flip side, Mr. Trump's protectionist policies to limit global trade will severely harm a global company like GE. Also, Mr. Trump's proposal to invest billions of dollars into infrastructure may not find favor with a fiscally conservative Republican-controlled Congress. In a recent interview , the President-Elect has said that he will have an open mind about the Paris agreement (he had earlier promised to scrap the agreement) and also \"acknowledged\" that there might be some link between human activity and global warming. If Mr. Trump decides not to scrap the Paris agreement then he will have limited room to spur growth in the oil sector. On the whole, the policy uncertainties still remain, though they have taken a backseat for the moment, but will likely show up again. Also, the uncertainties surrounding oil prices and global growth continue to remain. So the election result alone can't justify the recent rally in GE's stock price. Investors can expect some likely correction in the short run. The Long Run Fundamentals Remain Strong \nIn the recent earnings call , the management reduced its 2016 organic growth and EPS expectations but kept the long-term targets intact, indicating that GE continues to remain a long-term growth story. The long-term growth will be powered by Alstom and GE's transformation into a digital industrial company. The Alstom acquisition has already started showing results. According to GE, the synergy gains from Alstom have amounted to $850 million YTD and the company expects these benefits to increase going forward. Management expects Alstom to contribute $0.15-$0.20 per share to 2018 earnings. In the third quarter, Alstom contributed $0.01 to the EPS. In the earnings call, GE reported that it continues to see strong order growth in the Alstom business. \nAnother growth area for GE will be its digital business and \"Internet of Things\". GE has been making a strong push in this area and expects its digital arm to generate $15 billion in revenues by 2020, three times the 2015 revenues. It has signed multiple agreements including with BP Plc (NYSE:BP) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) . Based on these growth drivers, analysts expect GE to grow at a 12.5% CAGR for the next five years compared to negative growth in the last five years. Expensive Valuation \nThe recent rally has stretched GE's already high valuation multiples. GE is currently trading at a PE (ttm) of 26.95 and a forward PE of 18.77, which are much higher than its peers. The price to sales ratio is at 2.25 while EV/EBITDA is above 20 . While these multiples look expensive, the strong growth forecast over the next five years does provide some support to the valuation. However, expect some correction in the GE stock in coming days. GE currently has an RSI of over 90. RSI above 70 indicates that the stock is overbought and there can be corrections in the near future. (Also Read: Is General Electric Company Stock A Buy Now ?) Conclusion \nGE stock has outperformed the market since election results on the hope that the new President-Elect's policy proposals will boost the economy and benefit companies like GE who are heavily invested in infrastructure and oil and energy sectors. However, his stance on global trade and recent statements on global warming indicate that significant policy uncertainties remain. Luckily for GE, its vast global presence helps in diversifying its political risks emanating from a single country. \nThe recent rally has pushed GE stock into the overbought zone and has stretched its valuations. Investors can expect a pullback in the coming trading sessions. However, the long-term growth story remains intact. Also, GE stock has a generous yield and the dividend is likely to grow in the future. Long-term investors should use the pull back to go long the stock. Show Full Article",

      "text": "Already a subscriber? Members Sign In GE, Children’s Hospital form medical software venture By Priyanka Dayal McCluskey Globe Staff November 28, 2016 \nBoston Children’s Hospital is teaming up with General Electric Co. to produce software that will help doctors more accurately interpret brain scans of young patients. \nUnder a deal set to be announced Monday, Children’s and Boston-based GE’s health care division will develop the system over the next 18 months, then market it to hospitals around the world. \nThe effort is part of GE’s Health Cloud, which is launching this week and is expected, over the next three to five years, to house hundreds of different “apps” that doctors can use to sort through medical data. \nTerms of the Children’s-GE deal were not disclosed. \nMost MRIs of children’s brains are done in community hospitals, and most of those hospitals do not employ radiologists who specialize in children’s brains, said Dr. Richard Robertson, radiologist-in-chief at Children’s. As a result, doctors can misinterpret the scans — either missing a sign of trouble or diagnosing a problem when there is none. \nBrain images can help detect metabolic problems, genetic abnormalities, tumors, development issues, and more. \n“If you look at the brain, it changes pretty rapidly in the first two to three years [of life],” Robertson said. “It can be really hard to decide whether what you’re seeing is the process of normal development or if something has gone wrong.” Advertisement \nWith the new software, a radiologist sitting in any hospital will be able to compare his or her patient’s brain scan with that of other patients of the same age. \n“If I’m a generalist radiologist in the middle of anywhere, USA . . . I can see what a normal 5-year-old brain should look like,” said David Hale, a senior vice president at GE Healthcare who oversees imaging software. “Or, here are three images of potential diseased brains of children that look very similar to the one you just scanned.” \nFor Children’s, the partnership with GE represents a strategy that other premier hospitals are following: leveraging their expertise into products that can highlight their brand while bringing in new revenues. The hospital also works with IBM, Apple, and startups. \nAnother local nonprofit hospital company, Partners HealthCare, which owns Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s hospitals, has tapped into the digital software market. Partners developed software to help doctors make sense of genetic data , then commercialized the program last year. \n“Digital health . . . gives us the opportunity to download our expertise into software in a way that makes it more accessible to clinicians around the globe,” said Jean Mixer, vice president of strategy and digital health at Children’s. \nThe market for medical software, especially programs that analyze large amounts of data, is growing. It has been a focus for Governor Charlie Baker and other political and business leaders in Massachusetts. The digital health market is expected to grow to $32 billion over the next decade, Baker’s office said last week, after convening a new digital health care advisory council comprised of several business leaders.

      "text": "Boston Children's, GE partner on pediatric diseases By AuntMinnie.com staff writers \nNovember 28, 2016 -- Boston Children's Hospital and GE Healthcare announced at RSNA 2016 a collaboration to develop and commercialize digital solutions to advance the diagnosis and treatment of specific childhood diseases. \nThe first project seeks to improve diagnostic accuracy in pediatric brain scans by providing real-time contextual information. GE and Boston Children's Hospital are working to develop a decision-support platform intended to help distinguish the large variability in brain MRI scans. The system will be preloaded with normative reference scans from young children of different ages for doctors to use as a benchmark when reading scans of pediatric patients. \nBoston Children's Hospital is participating via its Innovation and Digital Health Accelerator (IDHA), led by Jean Mixer, vice president of strategy and digital health, and John Brownstein, PhD, chief innovation officer. IDHA seeks to enable clinicians to access the hospital's expertise and data in pediatric care through digital tools. \nThe brain system will be the first of many digital tools GE is creating for its deep-learning library, the firm said. By 2020, GE plans to have hundreds of apps in the GE Health Cloud.

      "text": "Industrial mega-stock General Electric ( GE ) has seen a nice nearly 8% lift in the past month. But it still has room to grow .\nThe company has three positives that should give investors cause for optimism.\nFor starters, GE has limited financial market exposure. GE Capital may have helped the company grow, but following the Great Recession, finance units had difficulty competing with big banks. Since April 2015, when GE announced a plan to return to its roots, it signed deals to offload over $180 billion in assets from GE Capital. That's practically the equivalent of selling off a major bank.\nBy exiting large parts of the financial maze, GE has avoided the problems faced by large, wholesale-funded financial companies. The initiative should be completed by the end of the year.\nThere's been a small re-rating, with GE now trading at 3.4 times price/book compared to its five-year average of 1.9 times (with GE Capital assets still part of the company). Conglomerate peers like 3M and Honeywell trade at richer multiples .\nA leaner GE Capital gives GE incremental financial flexibility to control its balance sheet for several years. That should help achieve better valuations.\nSecondly, the widening of GE's energy portfolio with its Baker Hughes acquisition is a good move . In fact, the sooner these companies integrate, the better.",

      "text": "Case study: Ocado uses machine learning to help customer services deal with email overload GE pushes ahead into the software market Docker storage: how to get persistent storage in Docker \nAfter lengthy negotiations and a major consultation, telecoms regulator Ofcom has taken a step into the unknown with the announcement it will enforce the legal separation of BT and its heretofore arm’s-length infrastructure division, Openreach.

The first was a full structural separation of BT and Openreach, which many campaigners have lobbied for loudly and at length. This would create a fully independent business beholden to nobody, free to invest without fear or favour, but this option did not come without financial and legal risk. \nThe second option, which is the one Ofcom has now backed, is legal separation. This would require BT to effectively build a firewall between itself and Openreach, guaranteeing the independence of Openreach’s board and giving all other communications service providers (CSPs) a seat at the table when it comes to making strategic decisions. \n“Our view is that an effective and robust form of legal separation, with Openreach as a wholly owned subsidiary of BT, is likely to achieve the greatest improvement for everyone in the shortest amount of time. Therefore, this is the approach with which we are minded to proceed,” said the regulator . \nOfcom now means to notify the European Commission of its decision to impose legal separation on BT and Openreach, with the process expected to begin in early 2017. Not far enough \nBy and large, rival CSPs welcomed the announcement, but implied that the regulator had not gone far enough by opting for legal over structural separation. \n“Let’s not forget why we are here – BT Openreach has continued to fail customers,” said a Sky spokesperson. “This is why we have always said we want a solution that is clear, executable and in the best interests of consumers and industry. We will now watch closely as to how Ofcom executes these proposals.” \nDido Harding, CEO of TalkTalk and a vocal advocate for full structural separation , also said Openreach had let consumers down and become a household name for the wrong reasons. \n“We welcome that the regulator has finally made a decision, and while we do not think legal separation goes far enough to deliver the broadband consumers deserve, it is at least a step in the right direction,” she said. \n“We will continue to push Ofcom to ensure the plans quickly deliver real, meaningful improvements, and if major changes cannot be delivered, they should move to structurally separate Openreach once and for all.\" \nVodafone hit out at what it perceived as BT’s excessive profit-making from Openreach, and produced figures purporting to show that BT has made excess profits of £1bn from regulated services last year, equalling the amount set aside by the government for digital infrastructure in the Autumn Statement. \nDirector of external affairs Helen Lamprell said BT had shown it was reluctant to undertake the transformation needed to ensure the UK has a competitive fibre broadband market, and reiterated Vodafone’s previous calls for full structural separation. \n“It beggars belief that BT felt it could increase its excess profits at this time, and further underlines the need for an independent Openreach. We believe Openreach needs to be a standalone business, headed by a truly independent board of directors and bound by statutory duties to treat customers equally and give an accurate view of Openreach’s underlying assets, costs and profits,” said Lamprell. Cooler heads prevail \nBroadband sector analysts remained sanguine at Ofcom’s announcement. Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at comparison website uSwitch.com, characterised it as more of a warning shot to BT to improve its offer on how legal separation would actually work. \n“Ofcom isn't changing its position at all. The regulator is still gunning for legal separation rather than full structural separation, and is using a potential notification to Brussels in an attempt to ensure it can get this over the line,” he said. “Those calling for structural separation, including Sky and TalkTalk, will be disappointed this option still isn't being considered more closely. \n“But this is one step closer towards finding a version of Openreach that maximises investment in new digital infrastructure while still allowing effective competition,” he said. “Many agree that is what’s needed, but disagree on how to do it. Ofcom is clearly seeking to strike a balance.” \nCCS Insight’s Kester Mann also said steering clear of a structural split was not a surprise, as it would have been the most controversial and costly option, and would not necessarily have offered guaranteed improvements for customers. \n“No doubt, BT’s rivals will criticise Ofcom for not being brave enough to push for structural separation. But after many months of campaigning, they should see the regulator’s efforts to engage with Brussels as a partial victory,” he said. “The move toward legal separation and greater independence will bring important benefits to companies such as Sky and TalkTalk in the long-term.” \nAndrew Ferguson, editor at Thinkbroadband.com, agreed legal separation was a more sensible option, and avoided the difficult issues that would have been thrown up by the creation of a structurally separate Openreach. \nKeeping the business as a wholly owned subsidiary would give it more room to manoeuvre in the constraints Ofcom hopes to impose. \nOvum’s Matthew Howett said leaving the door open to a voluntary agreement was a sensible move by Ofcom. \n“In many ways, a voluntary agreement remains a better outcome than a forced legal separation, not least because the EU [European Union] route is uncertain, untested and likely to take much longer to achieve. It is also made more complex by the decision from the UK to leave the EU,” he said. \nHowever, for a voluntary agreement to be struck, Howett said the onus would be on BT to focus on delivering something that assuaged Ofcom’s remaining concerns around independence and ownership of people and assets. Enthusiasm for FTTP \nMeanwhile, the government’s U-turn on full fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) broadband since Theresa May took over as prime minister in July 2016 was again cemented the other week, when chancellor Philip Hammond announced funding for small broadband providers, or altnets, and a tax holiday for new fibre networks , in the Autumn Statement. \nThe sudden enthusiasm from the government for FTTP has been welcomed by broadband campaigners after so many years of arguing for more investment in the technology, which has considerable merit in that it guarantees broadband speeds far beyond what is currently needed, and is therefore future-proofed for years to come. \nHowever, others, including BT’s director of next-generation access Bill Murphy, and Conservative MP Ed Vaizey – the former minister in charge of broadband at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport – have argued the government’s previous enthusiasm for fibre-to-the-cabinet (FTTC) services was a question of economics and risk . It has since been suggested that its pro-FTTP stance is merely a reflection that FTTP and ultrafast broadband services are becoming cheaper and easier to deploy. Read more about Ofcom and BT Experts from the London office of global law firm Morgan Lewis examine Ofcom’s review of BT’s Openreach . \nIt is important to note that BT has been more vocal in throwing its backing behind FTTP services , announcing a number of new commitments in recent months. However, quite how much of this change of heart has come about because of Ofcom’s threats of separation is a factor BT consistently refuses to be drawn on . \nFormer BT CTO Peter Cochrane , however, said it was high time for BT to fully back FTTP in the wake of Ofcom’s decision. \n“Doing so will allow BT to sell off 80% of its building estate, which would no longer be needed, and to recover vast sums in redundant copper cables. A fibre network will require drastically fewer people to maintain, and will ultimately generate significant shareholder returns. Board attention should turn to the FTTP business case without delay.” \n“20 years ago, I advised BT to split into three operating companies focused on international, long lines and the local loop to focus and invest in the FTTP infrastructure it was clear the UK economy would so desperately demand,” he said. “It is a sad state of affairs it has taken so long and such regulatory pressure. Billions have been wasted in the interim on marginal upgrades to the copper infrastructure that was never going to be fit for purpose.” Technology mix \nHowever, a number of networking equipment suppliers believe this focus on FTTP is somewhat misplaced. In the wake of Ofcom’s announcement, they have called for this strategy to be rethought. \nNeil Fraser of satellite solutions provider ViaSat said as long as the national broadband rollout was centred on fibre, the needs of every user would not be met. \n“Any new fibre strategy, like those before it, will have the same issues later down the line, including the cost of reaching those forgotten premises that aren’t already within easy reach. At the most basic level, the current technology backbone of the UK’s broadband network cannot provide the reliability or quality of service that modern users demand to every single part of the country at an acceptable cost,” he said. \nJaime Fink, co-founder of Mimosa Networks, a supplier of fixed-wireless broadband equipment, agreed the underlying infrastructure problems facing the UK still remained, despite Ofcom’s move towards separation. \n“The digital subscriber line (DSL) foundations that underpin much of the UK’s broadband network simply do not offer the bandwidth and reliability to support today’s internet applications and meet the demands of tomorrow’s services,” he said. \n“The rollout of fibre also continues to present challenges in rural and dense urban areas, leaving consumers and businesses with low-performance broadband solutions. Openreach and other UK service providers must change their approach and look at new technologies that can profitably deliver a superfast sustainable broadband network,” said Fink. What next? \nHowever, those hoping Ofcom’s decision will result in a step change in broadband provision around the UK would be wise to bide their time, according to Thinkbroadband.com’s Ferguson. \n“Those with poor broadband may think today’s news is an early Christmas present, but we would warn it is too early to celebrate if you are living or working in one of the 2.3 million properties without access to a superfast broadband option today. \n“Existing BDUK commitments are so time constrained that the FTTC rollouts are not going to change,” said Ferguson. “The big difference is likely to happen in areas where the Openreach network competes with companies such as Virgin Media.” \nThere was some cause for optimism, however. The solution has always been FTTP, and the debate up to now has usually been concerned with the timeframe, which formed the core of most of the anti-BT campaign arguments. This might now start to change, with more emphasis coming on delivering it. \n“It is going to be exciting to see how things change. Or whether they change at all,” he said. \nMatthew Evans, CEO of the Broadband Stakeholder Group, also said it was hard to predict the eventual effects of Ofcom’s intervention. The three key metrics it would be judged by, he said, were a more responsive Openreach, more competition, investment and innovation, and better consumer and business outcomes. \n“Hopefully these objectives can be met,” wrote Evans in a blog post , “but ensuring the UK has a great standard of connectivity will require other operators, as well as Openreach, to continue to invest.” CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

      "title": "Apple, GE Suppliers May Have Ties to Rebel-held Myanmar Tin Mine",
      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple, GE Suppliers Linked to Rebel-held Myanmar Tin Mine From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world’s largest consumer companies. More than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple aapl , coffee giant Starbucks sbux and luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co tif , list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar’s border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found. The mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters. This potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric @General Electri ge , at risk of violating sanctions that forbid “direct or indirect” dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement. Several sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions “generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities” on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances. The situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex. Following a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa. But the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones. Apple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfill those regulations they looked to an audit program designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). A CFSI program director said the group was “aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar.” The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include “a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas.” Tin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa. “Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,” she said. Civil War Most of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating. The Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high-grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal. The mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organization to do so. Interviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies. Tin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar’s peace process. “There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,” the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. “Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It’s the biggest source of income.” While Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents. Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence. “The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,” Kucik said. Two companies in Apple’s supply chain, the world’s No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine. Mandy Gan, a tin analyst from China’s leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine. Sanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters’ findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA. Still, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said. Supply Chain The chain connecting some of the world’s best-known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. One key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys “a long-term, stable strategic partnership” with the UWSA statelet. YCII declined several interview requests. YCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world’s top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan. Yunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology and, indirectly, Pegatron, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron. “Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI…As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that’s acceptable for us,” said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. In the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva. More than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, Calif.-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Two members of Yunnan Tin’s board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a “portion” of the company’s tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. “We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,” Pan told Reuters. “We don’t specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.” Yunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste. That means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin’s purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons. Apple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, “and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain.” “While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we’ll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,” it said. Foxconn said it “enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers.” It added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a “single, non-U.S.-based customer.” Pegatron said it carried out “annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains.” “Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,” the company added. From Jewelry to Appliances Companies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals. Among the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a “very small amount of tin” from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewelry and hollowware. The company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, “use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy.” Starbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had “noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners.” A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target tgt said in a statement it was “committed to responsible business conduct.” “We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,” the statement said.

      "text": "Any thoughts on rescinding a GE appeal? Upon further thought, I've realized I don't really need or want it, am unlikely to be successful with my appeal, and due to my destination history, simply don't meet the stringent requirements of this elite program. \n\nIs it worth writing in again to simply cancel my appeal to save them the trouble? Or will they be more annoyed that I've sent in yet another email or letter which they will still have to process. \n\nJust figured that it would be easier to just end the whole thing rather than spend 8+ months waiting for decision which may or may not arrive.

      "text": "Case study: Ocado uses machine learning to help customer services deal with email overload GE pushes ahead into the software market Docker storage: how to get persistent storage in Docker \nIn the TV show The West Wing , President Bartlett, played by actor Martin Sheen, would often round off a discussion with his staff by saying “What’s next?” to indicate he had grasped the issue and wanted to move on.

You also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the United States, and that you have read and agree to the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy . \nIn a different governmental context, those two words sum up where we are today with open data in the public sector . We have lots of data and we are now exposing and sharing some of it. We have grasped the issue and need to move on. So what’s next? \nIn 2010, the then Prime Minister David Cameron renewed the agenda on transparency in the public sector in an open letter, in which he said: “Greater transparency across government is at the heart of our shared commitment to enable the public to hold politicians and public bodies to account; to reduce the deficit and deliver better value for money in public spending; and to realise significant economic benefits by enabling businesses and non-profit organisations to build innovative applications and websites using public data.” \nBut the subject of transparency around government data has been around for a lot longer than that. \nIn 2005, the Freedom of Information Act came into force, requiring the public sector to make any non-personal information available on request, subject to certain conditions. This was great for the public but also for the media, which could access data to hold government to account. \nIn 2007, the European Union’s Inspire Directive was implemented, which, among other requirements, facilitated the sharing of geo-spatial data across the public sector. Following a newspaper campaign in 2010, Ordnance Survey made significant amounts of geographic data available as open data . \nIn the same year, the Greater London Authority launched the London Datastore , offering 200 datasets, stimulating development of many of the public transport apps used to travel round the capital. \nIn 2011, Cameron followed up his 2010 letter by documenting the open data achievements during the year . The central government Data.gov.uk platform was launched the same year. The right data \nToday, if you go on any government or public sector website, you should be able to see what data has been published. But is it data that answers our questions as citizens and taxpayers? \nDoes it tell us what we want to know in terms of value for money and improving our quality of life, or is it just the convenient datasets that those organisations find easy to provide? \nDo the organisations that supply the data consult or engage with us to determine what we want to know and how we want it presented? \nAll too often, the answers are not what we want to hear. Public sector organisations need to make data-sharing and understanding of data relationships a key organisational priority, with smart goals and outcomes linked to data. \nWe in the UK could look for guidance to the US, where some state authorities have grasped the opportunities to create and share open data. Some of the best practice is emerging from cities such as New York and Seattle, where they are using data transparency tools to engage in citizen dialogue. \nOf course, to ensure that we who work in the public sector gain citizen engagement in open data, we must maintain security and privacy. This seems like an oxymoron on the face of it, but the two go together. \nIn the age of cloud computing, it is critical for organisations to apply thought to their c loud information architecture . \nAs an organisation starts to apply policies and tools to manage its information and data, it needs to consider how to segment its cloud information model to keep separation within its architecture design as it starts to develop data-as-a-service platforms. The diagram below offers an example. \nThe classification of data suggested here works as follows: Private secure data must stay protected behind the unsecure network zone, or DMZ , and includes any personal or commercially sensitive data. Private anonymised data is also behind the DMZ, and includes data such as health records which, even when anonymised, may need some data-sharing protocol in place to share across organisations. Public secure shared data is data about me that I can access but which needs a security layer because it is personal information. Public anonymised shared data sits on an open platform, is pervasive and web accessible in an easy-to-consume format with open application programming interfaces (APIs) to access the data. So what’s next? \nThe open data and information agenda is a public necessity – savvy citizens, journalists and businesses want to see the data and information held by government. \nThe public sector needs to invest resources and skills in giving stakeholders what they want, not just because it is the democratic and right thing to do, but also because it will help to make better targeted resource decisions and create more empowered and resilient communities that can take charge of their data. Read more about open data The Open Data Institute (ODI) spent two years funding startups to build applications that could solve socio-economic problems. Public data needs to be open and protected , and should be treated as part of our critical national infrastructure, says the ODI’s Nigel Shadbolt. \nActivities such as hackathons can improve engagement with developers and citizens to help solve public sector problems in ways we haven’t thought of yet. \nAnd emerging initiatives such as London’s Supercloud offer opportunities for public sector organisations to collaborate on successful open data programmes. \nThis article reflects the personal opinions and views of Sean Green and not those of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets or London Grid for Learning.

      "text": "\nMaybe I am the last global optimist. I have worked across GE’s businesses around the world for more than 30 years. I’ve seen the difference that trade, economic growth and investment have made. When we’re investing in a country, one of the questions we ask ourselves is: Do we have the right people with the right capabilities? But in return, we get asked about the facility and job creation—never about skills and training.\nTraining and development programs are essential for building local capability and ensuring we achieve our long-term vision in every country we operate in. We need a balanced approach to address re-skilling for those in the U.S. and developed markets, and the vocational skilling needs of those in developing countries, to ensure our global workforce of the future is educated, resilient and flexible.\n\nMost educational systems around the globe are not prepared for the future skills challenge brought on by digitization. As a business, we could throw up our hands and do nothing. But as optimists, we should instead double-down on being part of the solution.\nPrivate companies must play a part in enhancing education and skills training in partnership with governments, other private companies and educational institutions.\nFocusing on training and “upskilling” when the shovels go in the ground can lead to even more jobs over time. In established facilities, workers potentially displaced by tech can learn to operate robots and become comfortable with automation. Businesses can develop work-study programs based on company-tailored curricula. Or provide essential machines to universities or vocational programs so that students can learn them. Or even construct healthcare partnerships in India to skill 10,000 youth in their own facilities. I know this is possible—not just because of optimism, but because I see it happening at GE .\nIn this light, the goals of private companies and the people are the same: a business supports those whose jobs are impacted by technology. By combining traditional vocational with digital skills, it ensures those in developing markets have better livelihood opportunities. It creates loyal relationships with talent and a pipeline of resilient workers with flexible skills—ones that it and other companies will demand. More jobs are created. And everybody wins.\nRead more articles from the TIME/Fortune Global Forum at the Vatican on the role of business in solving the world’s greatest problems. \n",

      "title": "A top GE executive says organizations must prepare for the “Emergent Era”",
      "text": "In the wake of Brexit and the election of US president Donald Trump, it’s clear that big global changes are afoot. But before we can begin to explain how these unexpected , tumultuous events will impact our lives, we have more fundamental questions to answer. How has our widely accepted picture of reality fallen so far behind the true scope and pace of change? How can the systems we use to synthesize our collective opinions and motivations keep pace? What other major, near-term events might be in our blind spot?\nThe answer is so large that it has become difficult to see, yet it has urgent implications for everything we do. It’s this: as our planet-wide, instantaneous digital nervous system grows, it is causing a mass reorganization of people, money, information, and things. Our digital information flow has become the main driver of change—and we need new frameworks to understand and anticipate what’s coming next.\nOne of those frameworks is known as emergence . Up until recently, it’s been used primarily to explain natural systems. Basically, the term describes how, when individual agents interact en masse according to a set of simple rules, highly complex structures and behaviors emerge. The billions of neurons that join together in a brain, the multitude of birds in a flock, and the individual ants in a colony are all examples of emergent systems in nature.\nWe’re seeing this same dynamic everywhere today—but in human systems. Emergent properties are what allow the ranks of individual circuits, weak on their own, to join together into a powerful computer. And because of computers, and especially their continuing extension into the physical world via the Internet of Things, emergence has become one of the key forces reshaping our institutions and essential systems.\nWelcome to The Emergent Era. And fasten your seat belt, because it’s going to be a wild ride.\nOne characteristic of emergent change is that it seems impossible until it happens, at which point it feels overwhelming, sudden, and inevitable. The moment when water droplets and wind combine into a hurricane is one example. Another example is the moment when, at about 11:00pm Eastern Time in the United States, election predictions made a wild and irrevocable swing in favor of Trump.\nIn business, emergence explains the huge leaps in value and expansions in functionality that have punctuated the lives of successful start-ups. When a network of people, linked by a new information stream in the form of an app or connected device passes a certain threshold in size, emergence kicks in, and the network doesn’t just get bigger, it transforms.\nAs of 2016, for example, Facebook has grown so populous that it is no longer just a social network. Through changes in the atomic content contributions of its two-billion plus users, it has become a de facto political organizer, advertiser, news company, video company, and a marketplace for goods and even jobs. By the time you are reading this, it is likely to have acquired or evolved even more functions. Similar things are happening across the world as other networks, like Tencent’s WeChat in China, continue to expand rapidly. Together, these platforms link together 2.55 billion people, just a little over a third of the world’s population.\nFor business, the environment created by this massive shift toward connectivity means that the most valuable companies for some time to come will continue to be those presiding over the reorganization of assets and experiences around the digital information flow.\nTwo of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated and studied start-ups, Uber (worth $62 billion as of this writing) and AirBnB (worth $25 billion), are precisely these types of companies. Neither invented or makes the key asset they trade in (transportation in the case of Uber and lodging in the case of AirBnB). But both provided a new stream of information that equipped individual agents (people with smartphones) to respond in new but consistent ways to the real time location of those assets. The interaction of Uber and AirBnB users as a network lead to the emergence of new behaviors and new markets built on them.\nIt’s as if ants were given a new set of rules by which to respond to their immediate environment, or brain cells a new set of commands to relay signals. In any system with the potential for emergence, a small change in what economist Thomas Schelling calls micromotives can lead to radically different macrostructures. And in The Emergent Era, with its profusion of new, ambient information streams, human micromotives are changing all the time.\nTo get a sense of the sheer scale of our new information streams, consider that in the next 18-24 months, a full one-third of the global population will be going online for the first time. By 2020, there will be over 50 billion machines connected to the internet.\nThis presents a unique challenge to those who have to shepherd organizations through this period of change. All the rules and subsequent benefits that have come with command-and-control style bureaucracies no longer apply. The word bureaucracy itself is an artifact of old information technology. A bureau is a writing desk, a physical enclosure for information, fixed in one place, around which power and people tend to accumulate like fat around a cell.\nBureaucracies were necessary when information was scarce. But in The Emergent Era, bureaucratic structures act as bottlenecks for information and inevitably throttle change. Organizations should instead use these six concepts to adapt to life in The Emergent Era.\nOrganize around information flows; ditch hierarchy and bureaucracy. An adaptive business culture begins with a radically open communication system. It’s only when people have access to real-time data and believe they have permission to both pass it on and act on it, that you get the speed and resiliency that characterize emergent structures.\nEmergent systems in nature are a good reminder of what the stakes are. If you erase the pheromone trails left by ants, the colony loses direction. Disrupt the human nervous system, and the result is confusion or paralysis.\nUnlike natural systems, there is no automatic mechanism in human institutions to keep the lines of communication open. That job falls to everyone who is responsible for shaping a company’s culture and core beliefs, at every level, and often at every moment of the day.\nEmpower individuals Really empower them. No matter what our official title in an organization may be, everybody needs to get over the illusion that by controlling others, we can control outcomes. Because of accelerated change, we are all, by necessity, becoming collaborators rather than merely managers and employees.\nIn the Emergent Era, it’s best for organizations to mimic emergent systems in nature by distributing the decision making process as widely across the network as possible. In effect, to empower individual “cells” to relay signals and respond to their local conditions as they see fit, when they see fit.\nReplace long lists of rules with a good M.O. By M.O. I don’t just mean modus operandi , a characteristic way of doing things. I also mean “mission objective” and “mindset orientation.” A good M.O. is an intuitive habit of mind that connects the larger vision of an organization with the immediate, tactical objectives of a person or team. It is part habit and part intuition, somewhere between mission and mindset.\nLeaders provide a vision while allowing their teams to find their own route to achieving it, with room to experiment along the way.\nAn M.O. can be a powerful tool for unleashing creativity within an organization, because it combines skilled perception with speed and fluidity of execution. An employee with a well-developed M.O. will have a knack for recombining the skills and assets of their organization in new ways in the same way that a jazz improviser recombines notes. Both make decisions partly according to a kind of muscle memory of the established rules and partly according to the unique possibilities and requirements of the moment.\nEstablish feedback loops. They are critical. Don’t be afraid of feedback—seek it, give it, use it—but make sure it’s the right feedback.\nHealthy, adaptive systems tend to be highly feedback tolerant. That doesn’t mean they merely amplify the signals that flow through them; they sometimes dampen those signals by incorporating “negative” feedback. Despite the negative connotation of the phrase, the results of negative feedback are actually positive. It’s the mechanism our bodies use to maintain the right temperature and blood sugar levels, and it’s the way people and processes in organizations stay in accord with larger strategies and goals.\nIn a company where the information flow is obstructed by bureaucracy, or by managers who create a culture which disproportionately rewards people who confirm existing beliefs, healthy feedback is impossible. For a system to be adaptive, it needs to create regular conditions tolerant of both positive and negative feedback.\nGet Used to Living in the “In Between.” Learning to live in the In Between is a mindset change—perhaps the defining mindset change—of The Emergent Era. It means abandoning the idea that we can operate with total knowledge, or even with the certainty that the tools we have are sufficient to address the possibilities and problems that face us.\nAs these new digitally-shaped structure formed, what’s emerging is also disrupting. It isn’t fully clear, and it hasn’t scaled. But emerge it will. There will be many new things that emerge, even if they aren’t fully formed, or we dismiss them as too insignificant, or worse, too crazy.\nMore data faster is creating more options, but not absolute certainty. We must be creative how we deal with constant change, track early signals int he noise, create multiple options and most importantly, keep moving forward.\nTap into the power of minds and machines together. The work of the future won’t be dominated by people or technology. It will emerge from the collaboration between people and technology.\nAs tools, the progress of AI and machine learning in all industries is starting to follow a pattern. Repetitive work is being obviated, freeing up humans to provide the finesse, creativity, or strategic thinking needed to finish the job.\nFor companies and individual employees, the combination of a good M.O. and a powerful A.I. will seem at first impossible, then inevitable, and finally invincible. In the Emergent Era, companies that combine a transparent, reliable information flow, a sound feedback system, and meaningful intelligence will see solutions to their problems consistently and spontaneously emerge—before they become a catastrophe or emergency to confront. Emergence-ready organizations need to adopt an agile, adaptive decision-making formula optimized for our accelerating world—with its unprecedented levels of speed and unpredictability.\nBut even in this new era, some things will remain the same. Emergent organizations will still need leaders to hire the right people, define goals, values, and beliefs, and provide and point to sources of inspiration and renewal. Ant colonies and brain cells don’t need visionaries—but human institutions always will.\nThis is the first article in an ongoing series on the Emergent Era . Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas .

      "text": "Email \n“Throughout most of American history, commercial interests have played a central role in foreign policy, and vice versa. During the next few decades the interaction between them will become more intense, more important, more difficult to manage … The second Clinton administration should lay out a framework for this interaction to provide the necessary guide for setting priorities …” \n— Jeffrey Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade 1993-95, ‘Business and Foreign Policy’, Foreign Affairs , May/June 1997 \nIn late 2015, General Electric swallowed the energy division of the French multinational Alstom. The issue was highlighted mid-battle by Tom Gill on Counterpunch in May 2014. \nAlstom had two prongs – energy (power and grid) and transport, with the former constituting over 70% of its business. The GE pr machine described it as ‘GE’s largest industrial deal ever’. \nThis is not your average takeover. Alstom’s trajectory incorporates larger dimensions. \nIt is a case study in the character of the peculiarities and vulnerability of the electric power and heavy engineering sectors – large-scale and extraordinarily complex output, irregular demand, and an inevitable close involvement with states as dominant purchasers. \nIt is a case study in the significant diminution of France’s industrial sector and of the deteriorating capacity of the French state. \nIt is a case study, by contrast, in the capacity of the US state and its strategic support of US corporate commercial interests. \nIt is a case study in the structural inhibition of the European Union’s institutions to ensuring European industrial vitality. \nChronology of the takeover \nGE and Alstom senior personnel meet in Paris 9 February 2014. At head of GE is Jeffrey Immelt, at head of Alstom is Patrick Kron. The deal is cemented in secret in March and April. On 23 April, the day that finds Kron at GE’s Annual General Meeting, Bloomberg discloses the deal. \nThe French government is furious, not least Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for the Economy and Industrial Renewal ( Redressement productif ). GE, under pressure, makes a formal offer on 30 April. Montebourg elicits a counter offer from Siemens, which comes in (with Mitsubishi on board) with a joint venture offer on 16 June. \nThe Alstom Board approved the GE deal on 20 June, and the contracts signed the 21 st . A last minute ‘compromise’ is effected. \nCarbon-based gas and steam turbines are integrated directly into GE. These components represented €9 billion of the €14 billion turnover of Alstom Energy, employing 40,000 of its 65,000 employees. \nIn addition, three co-enterprises were created – Grid (Alstom) & Digital Energy (GE); hydro, offshore wind and marine energy; and nuclear (Alstom’s French turbines). Formally, they are joint ventures, but the control of all of them lies with GE. The French supply technical expertise. More, the prospect is that the co-enterprises will be absorbed by GE on its own terms in several years. \nThe state takes 20 per cent of Alstom, out of the 29 per cent shareholding of the construction giant Bouygues. There is conflict over the price to be paid, and the shareholding remains on loan as Bouygues wants top dollar. Formally a means to exert influence, it will be of zero consequence under GE’s management. \nOn 24 August Montebourg resigns/is pushed on the occasion of the establishment of a new austerity-focused Ministry under Prime Minister Manuel Valls. Montebourg is replaced by Emmanuel Macron, and the tinpot ‘industrial renewal’ sub-portfolio goes out the window. On 5 November Macron formally OKs the GE takeover. \nOn 19 December, at an Extraordinary General Meeting, Alstom shareholders approve the GE takeover, albeit with much hostility expressed. Nevertheless, Alstom’s Board awards Kron 150,000 shares, then worth €4 million, for his ‘exemplary’ stewardship of the takeover. The Board also awards itself an extra €300,000 in remuneration (on top of the existing €1 million) for the ‘extra work’ involved. \nAt the same time as GE was pursuing Alstom, so also was the US Department of Justice (DoJ). On 13 April 2013 Alstom senior manager Frederic Pierucci (sometime head of Alstom US) was arrested at JKF airport and held in high security. He would spend 14 months in jail, having been abandoned by his employer. Pierucci is to be the lead fall guy for a DoJ investigation into Alstom bribery for an infrastructure contract in Indonesia. \nOn 27 March 2014 Bloomberg announces that the DoJ has extended its Alstom investigation to other countries involving suspected bribery. On 23 April (the same day that the deal is being forged) Alstom’s former Vice-President Asia, David Rothschild, is arrested in the American Virgin Islands, and imprisoned for several months. \nOn 22 December The DoJ imposes a $772 million fine on Alstom. The early hope within Alstom, sold to all and sundry, was that GE would pick up the tab. The DoJ thought otherwise. \nThe GE takeover required ratification from Brussels, concerned about competition on the European landscape, particularly in gas turbines. Belatedly on 8 September 2015 Brussels confirms the GE takeover, subject to concession of some of Alstom assets to the lesser Italian firm Ansaldo Energia. On 26 February 2016 the takeover is finally consummated, with Ansaldo Energia garnering some choice morsels of Alstom’s intellectual property. \nThe initial GE offer was of €12.35 billion. For that, GE readily picked up €1.9 billion of Alstom’s cash reserves. Alstom had to fork out €2.6 billion for its share of the three co-enterprises over which it has no control. GE unilaterally deducts another €300 million from the price because of the drawn out deliberations by Brussels. After paying off debt, the DoJ fine, Alstom shareholders were left with something less than €3.7 billion. \nFrom whence comes Alstom? \nAlstom’s complex trajectory is representative of the evolution of late 19 th Century technology-dependent corporations providing what would become essential national infrastructure. The story in brief. \nThe American General Electric company is formed from a merger of Thomson-Houston and Edison in 1892. GE immediately implants an affiliate in France in 1893, the Compagnie Française Thomson-Houston (CFTH). \nIn 1928, Alsthom (Als-thom) is formed from components of CFTH (later Thomson) and the Société alsacienne de constructions mécaniques (SACM, 1872), forging a combination of electronic and metallic expertise. Ironically, Alsthom is a step-child of GE, profiting in its early years from the use of GE patents. SACM bequeaths to Alsthom an iconic Belfort factory (where its first steam locomotive was produced in 1880). \nAlsthom’s national significance was established in the early years of post-War reconstruction. Its equipment supplied nationalized electricity infrastructure (EDF) and a nationalized rail network (SNCF). It was an important cog in France’s particular post-War ‘long boom’. \nFrom the start, Alsthom has exhibited a peculiar duality. On the one hand, via internal innovation and via myriad alliances and takeovers, Alsthom has enjoyed the most extraordinary technological success. Alsthom’s diesel locomotives have been sold worldwide. Its development of the Very Fast Train ( TGV ) for SNCF is legendary. The EDF’s nuclear power plants depend heavily on Alstom’s steam turbines, including the advanced Arabelle design. Alsthom’s equipment for hydroelectric power generation has been seminal. It has committed research to pollution-reducing infrastructure. \nThe vulnerability of Alstom \nOn the other hand, Alsthom has been perennially financially vulnerable. This vulnerabity arises from a combination of historical turbulence, the intrinsic nature of the industry/ies, periods of bad management, and difficulties in obtaining capital backing appropriate for its product lines. \nIn these sectors, companies are faced with the necessity to make strategic takeovers or alliances to avoid cyclicality of earnings and to build scale. But those moves are fraught with potential danger. Thus did Thomson hand over control of Alsthom to competitor CGE (Compagnie générale d’électricité, 1898) in 1969; after several years of successful joint ventures between the rivals. \nCGE was nationalized and de-nationalized during the Mitterand 1980s. Following de-nationalization, CGE moved to internationalize Alsthom’s activities. In 1988 CGE initiated a 50-50 merger between Alsthom and GEC Power (the British General Electric Co, 1886, no relation). The desired scale is enhanced, with better leverage against Siemens in mind. By the early 1990s, Alsthom was a world leader in its specialties. In 1991 CGE is re-named Alcatel-Alsthom to transcend confusion with GE and GEC. \nBut in 1995, CEO Pierre Suard was indicted on several counts and forced to resign (the charges were dismissed over a decade later). Suard was replaced by one Serge Tchuruk, with no background in Alsthom’s arenas. Tchuruk divests Alcatel-Alsthom of multiple companies and competences and orients its budget towards telecommunications, losing billions of euros. \nAlsthom becomes a deprived child and privatized on several exchanges in 1998 and after, not before Tchuruk cleans out its treasury. In this process, the ‘h’ is dropped, catering to anglo pronunciation. \nSuard, permanently bitter, accused Tchuruk (who resigns, well remunerated, in 2006) in April 2015 of having destroyed €24 billion from Alcatel-Alsthom assets over 12 years and 100,000 jobs. \nSimultaneously the cross-channel fusion of Alsthom with GEC had become a conflicted mixed marriage. There was simmering a longer dissonance. GEC had declined to adhere to a previous Alsthom/GE market sharing agreement whereby Alsthom manufactured gas turbines at Belfort under license, GEC intruding into GE’s overseas territory. This conflict led to the Belfort large gas turbine plant being sold to GE in 1999, a significant loss to Alstom. \nIn the backwash, Alstom seeks to formalise a growing partnership with Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri regarding energy assets (particularly to recover its place in gas turbine markets), soon acquiring ABB’s share. The takeover is a disaster. The equipment, norms and cultures are chalk and cheese. ABB equipment failure leads to repair bills, demand for damages from customers and a subsequent loss of orders. Alstom writes off billions of euros and acquires significant debt. Bank lenders take fright. Alstom calls in the French state in 2003 to rescue it, which requires agreement from Brussels. Brussels allows the state’s entrance into Alstom’s capital but at the cost of Alstom divesting itself of more assets (shipbuilding and electricity grid), with thousands of its workforce retrenched. \nThe French state’s shares (under pressure from Brussels) are sold to the Bouygues construction group in 2006, which becomes Alstom’s dominant shareholder (29.4 per cent). This shareholding was in turn a mis-match. The Bouygues shareholding, with the company having other priorities in 2014, was ripe to be readily gifted to GE when the time came. \nRemarkably, Alstom recovered from 2004 through to 2009, its good health reflected in key indicators – the order book, turnover, net profit, cash flow – which led to a solid rise in the share price. Alstom engages in new hirings of skilled staff, in enhanced R&D, and in new acquisitions and strategic alliances. In particular, in conjunction with Schneider Electric, it buys back the grid division that it had sold to Areva in 2004. The good times are symbolized by Alstom’s V150 TGV loco achieving a record rail speed on 3 April 2007 of 574.8 km/h. \nAlas, late 2008 brought the GFC. Alstom management hopes for a ready recovery, but it doesn’t arrive. Europe, especially France, is permanently in the doldrums. Internationally, home grown national champions arrive to enhance the temperature of global competition in Alstom’s fields. Thousands of Alstom employees are retrenched in 2010 and 2011. During these bad times, Alstom continues to pay out dividends, feeding the now ravenous short-termism and seemingly detached trajectory of the French bourse. \nThis is bad timing for the ‘good news’ history of Alstom, Mw & Km/h , produced in coffee table picture book style, commissioned in happier times. The book finishes on an optimistic note: “The future is not a smooth freeway. But when one has already, like Alstom, scaled some Everests, one is capable of negotiating the ups and downs of the obstacles that present themselves. Only one option: never give in. This is the spirit of Alstom.” The spirit of Alstom would soon be deflated by forces both without and within. Like Alstom itself, Mw & Km/h has come to be remaindered. \nHow GE (and the American state) does business \nIt is salutary that the US Department of Justice’s pursuit of Alstom ran parallel to GE’s pursuit of Alstom. Alstom’s Kron denies that the issue was a factor in his desire to sell to GE, although it was let about that GE would pick up the tab. \nCertainly, Alstom had got into the habit of handing out the baksheesh , indifferent to the long term implications. We know that corruption is endemic in business, facilitated by the black box that is the joint-stock corporation. Neglected, however, is that the character of the sectors in which Alstom has been involved impels the players forcibly into money under the table – rare to irregular prospects, huge sums involved, layered access to the state apparatus, do or die. \nSo are the Americans above all this smelly stuff? The Americans are merely better at it, with a broader range of options, courtesy of the US’ hegemonic status. \nThe aggressive use of the intelligence services for commercial leverage was revved up in 1992 under Bush senior. Bill Clinton took it up immediately upon taking office. Jeffrey Garten (as above) and James Woolsey, Clinton’s first CIA Director until forced from office, were at the centre of what Garten rightly called economic warfare. Garten need not have worried that his leaving office would lessen the enthusiasm. Thus Clinton’s February 1995 A National Security Strategy of Engagement and Enlargements declaims: \n“The collection and analysis of intelligence related to economic development will play an increasingly important role in helping policy makers understand economic trends. That collection and analysis can help level the economic playing field by identifying threats to U.S. companies from foreign intelligence services and unfair trading practices.” \nThe US is past master at ‘unfair trading practices’. This is the country that undermined GATT (the institution conceived in optimism in 1947, supposed to break the global propensity for protectionism) from day 1, taking agriculture and later textiles out of the equation. In other domains try the Jones Act and the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (which incorporates the Buy American Act). Etc. \nIn 1988 British researcher Duncan Campbell uncovered and exposed the existence of the US-UK initiated ECHELON intelligence-gathering system. Upon invitation from the European Parliament, Campbell produced a report titled Interception Capabilities 2000 (IC2000) in April 1999. The report was published in French in 2001 as Surveillance électronique planétaire. There we read: \n“In 1970, according to its former Executive Director, the US Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board recommended that “henceforth economic intelligence be considered a function of the national security, enjoying a priority equivalent to diplomatic, military, technological intelligence”. On 5 May 1977, a meeting between NSA, CIA and the Department of Commerce authorised the creation of secret new department, the “Office of Intelligence Liaison”. Its task was to handle “foreign intelligence” of interest to the Department of Commerce. Its standing orders show that it was authorised to receive and handle SCI intelligence – Comint and Sigint from NSA. The creation of this office thus provided a formal mechanism whereby NSA data could be used to support commercial and economic interests. After this system was highlighted in a British TV programme in 1993, its name was changed to the ‘Office of Executive Support’. Also in 1993, President Clinton extended US intelligence support to commercial organisations by creating a new National Economic Council, paralleling the National Security Council. The nature of this intelligence support has been widely reported.” \nIn early 2001 Campbell followed up his 1999 IC2000 with ICIE2001 papers 1 & 2. In paper 2 (‘Comint impact on international trade’) we read: \n“By July 1994, CIA director Woolsey was asserting that ‘several billion dollars a year in contracts are saved for American business by our conducting that type of intelligence collection. We intend to continue to do it. It is relatively new. We are very – frankly – very good at it, and we have had some very positive effects on contracts for American businesses.’ … \n“By the end of the 1990s, the U.S. administration claimed that intelligence activity against foreign companies had gained the U.S. nearly $150 billion in exports. \n“Although U.S. intelligence officials and spokespeople have admitted using Comint against European companies, this admission has been limited to occasions on which it is alleged that European contractors have offered or paid bribes. However, examination of U.S. policy developments indicates that such intelligence collection is much more broadly focussed, and can include ‘subsidies, government-to-government lobbying, schemes to promote exports and restrain imports, unwritten agreements, strange financial links and unusual commercial deals’. The definition of corrupt or ‘unfair’ practices is not limited to illegality, but includes any occasion on which American companies believe that their products are better and cheaper than their competitors and should have been purchased by the overseas buyer. Other documents show that the CIA has been directly involved in obtaining competitor intelligence for business purposes.” \nThe booty for US companies is listed in a complementary 2001 Campbell document labelled ‘ Selected U.S. Advocacy Center “Success Story” claims, 1993-2000 ’. \nWith reference to the state-GE partnership, in particular, Leslie Varenne and Eric Denécé note: \n“Besides, the politicians themselves don’t hesitate to do the hard work for their national companies on international markets. In her last book, Hard Choices , Hillary Clinton discloses that, as Secretary of State, in October 2012, she has lobbied for GE with Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The result? A 2.5 billion dollar contract.” \nThe Algerian contract was for gas turbines (to be manufactured in the US, not France), with Siemens being the then top-ranked loser. Clinton also flogged GE in China, a key Alstom market. \nJean-Michel Quatrepoint highlights that, during the DoJ pursuit of Alstom, GE itself had in its employ around thirty former DoJ functionaries. The Wall Street Journal reported in February 2015 that GE had seen all the documentation regarding DoJ litigation against Alstom. What a coincidence! With all this legal muscle and insider knowledge, no-one in GE sought to disabuse Alstom heavies that the latter’s hope that the DoJ would cease its pursuit or that GE would pay a DoJ-inflicted penalty wasn’t going to happen. \nQuatrepoint also notes that at least five companies known to be pursued by the DoJ have been snapped up by GE – Invision (US, 2004), Ionics (US, 2005), Amersham (UK, 2004), Nycomed (Norway, 2004) and Vetco Gray (UK, 2007). GE was well primed to pick up Alstom. \nMoreover, GE was readily able to come up with the do-re-mi for the Alstom purchase because of its huge tax-evading cache offshore, courtesy of official tolerance. GE’s CEO since 2001, Jeffrey Immelt, pursued tax evasion as a specialist arm of GE’s activities. Quatrepoint notes that the relevant division of GE, under a former US Treasury specialist (what a coincidence!), employed around 950 staff. Quatrepoint also notes that, by end of 2012, GE had accumulated $108 billion offshore. Between 2002 and 2011, GE generated $80 billion in gross profits, but paid only $1.4 billion to the US exchequer. Taxes paid in other countries were negligible. \nThe French state \nThe French state engaged in major nationalizations and consolidations post-World War II (courtesy of the Conseil Nationale de la Résistance) and after François Mitterand’s election in 1981. The post-war developments resulted in key public infrastructure, such as the Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF), Electricité de France (EDF) and Gaz de France. The Mitterand experiment, blanket in coverage and ultimately short-lived, was heartily opposed by some French industrialists and has received almost universal obloquy in anglo commentary. But it appears that the Mitterand nationalizations did generate some efficiencies (c/f Vivien Schmidt’s 1996 From State to Market ). \nBut France has jettisoned its perennial flirtation with dirigisme and gone down the neoliberal path – the incapacity post-GFC is glaring. This evolution has been given a peculiarly French twist with the degradation of the public purpose of the elite écoles and their ‘output’ via pervasive non-meritocratic nepotism and large-scale revolving door-ism ( pantouflage ) of publically-educated public servants into investment banks, law firms, consultancies, etc. In particular, the Finance Ministry, pivotal to good governance, is treated as a stepping stone to personal advancement. \nAlstom CEO Patrick Kron is representative of the new breed. CEO/Chairman since 2003, Kron set about hiring a new breed of managers – pro neoliberalism, contempt for the state, with no concept of the national interest. Yet Alstom, by the nature of its business, has as its major customers state-owned instrumentalities and has been the ongoing beneficiary in its overseas sales with receipt of export credits. It’s a one-way process for Kron’s generation. \nRepresentative of revolving door-ism is David Azéma, then head of the Agence des participations de l’État (responsibility for managing state shareholdings), who decided to quit APE in mid 2014 at the height of the imbroglio over Alstom’s future. Azéma departed for Bank of America Merrill Lynch London so that he could evade the state’s (puny) constraints on revolving door-ism. Azéma’s remarks: “Why am I leaving the state? To earn more money.” Thus the stampede. \nSo also Emmanuel Macron. Product of the École nationale d’administration (an énarque ), he joins the Finance Ministry, then becomes co-author of the neoliberal Attali report on regenerating the French economy, then to Rothschild , then joins the Hollande Presidential election team, then into Hollande’s office in the Élysée, then into the Economy Ministry following Montebourg’s departure in 2014. \nWith Montebourg feverishly trying to find means to save Alstom Energy from GE’s clutches, Macron (as Élysée apparatchik) lectures the former: “A private enterprise on which one imposes terms – that’s not on, save in Venezuela.” \nMacron’s crowning achievement in office was the omnibus and opaque Loi Macron, oriented to deregulating everything that moves, thus fiercely resisted by the vox populi . But his signature tune was the bizarre privatisation of the Toulouse-Blagnac airport (down the road from Airbus HQ) to a Chinese consortium located in a tax haven. L’état, ce n’est certainement pas moi . \nIt is not irrelevant that Macron was designated as a ‘Young Leader’ as part of the crop of 2012 inaugurated into the French-American Foundation. What? The FAF was founded in 1976 during the US bicentennial – France gives the US the Statue of Liberty and the US gives France a Trojan Horse! The FAF introduced the ‘Young Leader’ program in 1981. Hollande himself was ‘chosen’ in 1996, even Montebourg in 2000 (along with myriad other Ministers in Hollande’s and previous governments). \nSoft power at work. Thus the US pincer strategy – gunboat diplomacy (NATO, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, sanctions, etc.) and soft power. De Gaulle in his grave, Gaullism quasi-extinct, the French are now easy prey. \nGE has itself mopped up some of these pantoufleurs in their new roles to help push the bid for Alstom before French authorities. GE even pushed the idea that GE is more French than Alstom. Fronting GE’s French thrust was the well-connected Clara Gaymard, GE France’s CEO (another énarque ). GE and Gaymard are both active in the French-American Foundation, with Gaymard on its Board. (Gaymard has since left GE after the embarrassment of GE not keeping its promises on employment retention in France.) \nNo better reflection of France’s abject subjugation is in its kowtowing to the American agenda through the latter’s unilaterally determined sanctions regime. France’s cancellation mid-stream of the project of building two Mistral class ships for Russia will cost it in the order of €2 billion. The impact of the loss of agricultural exports to Russia remains to be evaluated. \nAdd another significant and under-publicized example – the French auto industry, already struggling post-GFC. This issue has got one François Asselineau (fierce anti-‘Atlanticist’, with his miniscule party, Union Populaire Républicaine) very hot under the collar. Asselineau notes the disastrous impact of the entry of GM (then under partial government ownership) into Peugeot’s register in February 2012. Peugeot is subject to an immediate demand to pull out of Iran, location of its largest export market. In July, Peugeot announces the forthcoming retrenchment of 8000 workers and the planned closure of its plant in Aulnay, suburban Paris. Renault is also pressured and succumbs to the same threats. Asselineau queries – high treason or idiocy? They complement each other. \nUnderstanding how the game is played \nIt is distressing to confront how little ‘the rules of the game’ are understood – by the subject decision-makers themselves and especially by the ‘expert’ commentators. \nAcademics are generally incapacitated by virtue of their imprisonment in artificial silos called ‘disciplines’. How to analyze the symbiotic relationship of state and capital? First one has to recognize it, and that it exists elsewhere than in those odd ‘authoritarian’ countries that break ‘the rules’ (viz. previously Japan, Singapore, now China). Impossible within the silos. \nA sub-genre specialization plays with an appetizingly labelled ‘Varieties of Capitalism’ idea. Well intentioned indeed, but its output is replete with banalities at best and rubbish at worst. Not least in its characterization of US capitalism, the heart of the beast. Budding students, do not go there. \nBy default, telling it how it is has been left to journalists who suffer no such artificial strictures and look to understand the big picture. Thus has Jean-Michel Quatrepoint written Alstom: scandale d’État , the definitive account of the story. Even then, it takes a courageous journalist to do the hard yards, as the mainstream media (now mostly owned by billionaires and administered by their flunkies) has been consigning such ‘big picture’ writers to the margins. They complement the handful of research centre-based ‘big picture’ academics like Jacques Sapir and Frédéric Lordon who are constrained to write for dissident media. \nEconomics is the worst of the ‘silo’ disciplines, with meaningless parlor games as its forte . Thus respectable French economists join with the celebrities who clog the respectable media outlets in advising both the authorities and the untutored public that the malaise in France is to be remedied merely by deregulating the ‘over-regulated’ labour market and reforming the burdensome welfare state. One might think that already dramatic deregulation of labour rights in the workplace and the handing over of billions of euros to employers might have given French industry renewed buoyancy. But no. The unemployment figures refuse to relent. And the strictures of the experts remain the same. \nThus has the respectable crowd in France replicated the hoary old chestnuts that are standard fare in the anglo financial media regarding the French ‘malaise’. \nThe New York Times ’ Roger Cohen has reinforced over the years the correct line for the NYT ’s would-be enlightened readers. He has lived in Europe for decades, and he is still steeped in his nativist stereotypes. This in September 2014 : \n“More than any other party of the center-left in Europe, the French socialists have had trouble jettisoning ideological baggage ill-adapted to 21st-century global competition. More than any other Western country, France has resisted modernity, at least in the way it thinks of itself. So my feeling listening to Valls talk about ”effectiveness” could be summed up in two words: Good luck! The prime minister is up against something deeper than the resistance of labor unions or his own party: a culture that views the prizing of efficiency as almost vulgar.” \nFrance has a problem, but it’s not what the anglo-centric The Economist or Financial Times or Roger Cohen thinks it is. France’s problem is that its current elites and its pundits haven’t grasped how multi-state global capitalism works. Its ancestors understood it, practised it (often badly), but the current breed has lost the plot. US soft power, rampant personal opportunism, the inbuilt strictures of the European Union, the omnipresence of the English language per se , has addled their brains. \nThe French elite has imbibed the eulogized Anglo-Saxon model, but it has incorporated it only partially. It has internalized the ideology as much as the real thing. \nIt has absorbed its dysfunctional destructive elements – notably, an omnipresent financial sector that is incompetent, predatory and/or oriented to short-termism. Thus have the French authorities coddled as de facto ‘national champions’, with no quid pro quo whatsoever, the dysfunctional key players in the banking sector that gave Europe its own GFC. \nThe current French elite has not accommodated how the American (and British) ‘Anglo-Saxon’ models work in practice. \nThe British state, with the Empire long gone, is fundamentally oriented to ensuring the global pre-eminence and profitability of the City of London, and, as a side plate, the support of its military-industrial-intelligence complex. \nFor the US, from its inception, state and capital have been brothers . Manifest Destiny has been rooted in the worship of the Holy Dollar. \nThus did the French authorities not see the crushing power of the GE pursuit of Alstom Energy. They still don’t. \nBrussels \nBrussels is also part of the problem. Brussels’ economic policy apparatus is structured on the European Central Bank and on Maastricht. Both are repressive. These institutions have been publicly defended on the erroneous presumption that their underlying principles were the source of Germany’s rise as an industrial and economic powerhouse. Joke. Brussels has no positive mechanisms to support industrial development and revitalisation. \nA sometime notion of breaking down national boundaries and fostering intra-European mergers to forge ‘European champions’ has now been supplanted by the overarching principle that competitive markets must prevail. European champions like Airbus/EADS have now been rendered impossible by Brussels’ assertive competition authority and its refusal to countenance state-led strategies of industrial development and national responses to economic and industrial crises. Inter-EU national rivalries complement Brussels’ animosity. Thus the paralysis of Europe since the GFC. \nAlthough this mentality in Brussels might have been premised on the ambition to prevent the abuse of market power and corruption (it hasn’t), nation states are hampered in maintaining effectively their national infrastructure, for much of which publicly-owned natural monopolies are appropriate, and in forging a revitalisation of key firms that provide products essential to the national interest. \nSome of Alstom’s problems can be readily slated home to management’s hubris, but a company vital to the national interest should not be allowed to be subject to the vicissitudes of management incompetence and market turbulence. Brussels’ intervention over the terms of the French state’s capital injection in 2004 in Alstom was misconstrued and destructive, further weakening Alstom’s ability to recover. \nBrussels has further weakened Alstom by subservience to and aggressive oversight of US-directed sanctions against Russia. \nThe takeover’s significance \nQuatrepoint and others tell a sombre story. It is just the latest liquidation of a flagship of French industry. And will not be the last. It is a scandal. And it is an indictment of the French political, bureaucratic and business elite. \nSome losses are significant and irrecoverable. Alstom’s considerable technology and patents are lost to the national domain. \nGE announced in January 2016 that it would retrench 6,500 Alstom jobs in Europe, 760 in France. GE had promised the Government that it would ultimately create 1,000 jobs in France, but that’s pie in the sky. \nThe past interlinked skilled workforce of Alstom and state-owned instrumentalities is fractured. Skills and workplace cultures cannot be dismantled and readily reconstructed if the need arises. Only academic economists believe in malleable capital and labour. The panoply of subcontractors lose business and possibly the business itself. Nobody in authority cares about the input-output matrix or the potential knife edge between virtuous industrial circles (sustainable) and vicious circles (downwards to oblivion). These concepts are not taught, and rarely grasped by those in authority. The past is a foreign country. In particular, the considerable public and civic investment in Belfort, regenerated following the ABB disaster with the vision of reinforcing a local ‘energy valley cluster’, has been devalorized in the takeover. \nKey dimensions of the French national interest are now under GE control. Supply and maintenance of key components of nuclear power plants are now in GE’s hands. Defence interests itself are compromised with GE’s role in the provisioning of the nuclear component in France’s maritime forces. Alstom’s subsidiary Satellite Tracking Systems, based in Grenoble, has been of crucial significance in French security interests. Satellite Tracking has provided infrastructure and expertise to French military intelligence directly and to key defence contractor Thales. \nThe Alstom Transport remnant \nAlstom has now been reduced to Alstom Transport – vulnerable, with thin capitalisation. Alstom has a tolerable order book for the next several years, but nothing from within France. In September Alstom announced a €2 billion contract for a Washington-Boston TGV setup. Good if it transpires but, courtesy of local protectionism (as above), production will take place in the US. \nIn early 2016, the capital-strapped SNCF ceded 50% of Akiem, its locomotive procuring subsidiary, to a Deutsche Bank fund. Lo and behold, Akiem awards a locomotive contract to Bombardier in June and another one in July to the German Vossloh – the latter for production at a new site in Germany. The contract that went to Vossloh could have kept the Belfort site in business for several more years. \nIn early September, Alstom Transport’s CEO, Henri Poupart-Lafarge, announced that it would close the Belfort plant at the end of 2018 and move the totality of production to another Alstom site in Reichshoffen, in the north-east corner of France. The Belfort site has experienced a long decline – from 1400 workers in 1990, 630 in 2013, now reduced to 480. \nThe government had taken no interest in the future of Alstom Transport, not least with the useless anti-statist Macron at the Economy Ministry (fortunately he resigned in August). Coming from behind in the face of protests, the Government stepped in in early October with a multi-faceted rescue package. \nThe very expensive package includes a proposed order for 15 high speed trainsets for future use on the Bordeaux-Marseille routes whose infrastructure is not ‘up to speed’. The government, forestalling ridicule, claims that the proposed order is ‘in anticipation of the future completion of the Bordeaux – Toulouse and Perpignan – Montpellier high speed lines’. The weekly Le Canard Enchaîné calls the logic more electoralist than industrial or economic. \nFade to a longstanding project on the drawing board in the same vein – a TGV line between Poitiers and Limoges. It was first proposed by Prime Minister Raffarin in 2004 (his fiefdom a ‘beneficiary’). Long simmering, it was knocked down by the Cour des comptes in October 2014 (huge expense for minimum benefit, indeed downsides). President Hollande (as for Raffarin) resurrected the idea in January 2015. It was knocked down again by the Conseil d’État in April 2016. Hollande resurrected it again in visiting his fiefdom this October. \nThe high speed trainsets order for non-existent infrastructure and the phantom Poitiers-Limoges TGV line are quintessentially representative of the parlous state of what currently constitutes ‘industry policy’ in France. \nThe big numbers in France don’t add up, and the immediate prospect is no better. The sticky 10 per cent unemployment rate (and that’s merely the official rate). The drag on tax revenue (and on social welfare budgets) wrought by unemployment, enhanced by ongoing de-industrialization. The complementary drag on tax revenue due to pervasive tax evasion of corporations and individuals. The consequent budget deficit that is never going to meet Brussels’ Maastricht handcuffs. The entrenched deficit on current account. Add the certain deleterious impact of the cancerous Canada-EU free trade agreement (CETA), pending. \nMuch angst has been generated by the claimed existential threat to the European ‘project’ of Brexit. The most significant current threat to the European Union comes from France itself, at the heart of the animal. Brussels doesn’t see it, doesn’t care, because the structures on which the EU were built and remodelled are sacrosanct. Brussels’ own rampant revolving door-ism highlights that, contrary to the rhetoric, nobody in charge of the show has their eye on the long term. \nIf the current trajectory of France continues, it’s ultimately goodbye to the European Union. And not before time. \nReferences: \nJean-Michel Quatrepoint, Alstom, Scandale d’État: dernière liquidation de l’industrie française , Fayard, August 2015. \nJean-Michel Quatrepoint, ‘Des missionaires aux mercenaires’, Le Monde Diplomatique , November 2016.",

      "text": "General Electric (GE) Presents at Credit Suisse 4th Annual Industrials Conference (Transcript) Dec. 1.16 General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) Credit Suisse 4thAnnual Industrials Conference December 01, 2016 02:00 PM ET Executives Steve Bolze - President & CEO, GE Power Analysts Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Julian Mitchell Thanks everyone. So, it’s my pleasure to introduce Steve Bolze, in charge of GE’s power business. Steve’s going to talk for 15-20 minutes and then will do questions. Steve Bolze Perfect. Thank you. And pardon my voice, at least I have one a little bit today. But, what I’d like to go through is what’s going on with the power business at GE. What I would say is in many ways, it’s been a transformational year for GE, particularly so in our power business. I’d say, there are three key areas that have really been the most transformational, one of which is Alstom integration, which is well underway which you will see. The HA is proceeding very well. I’ll talk through that. And I’d say the third of which is the investments that are playing through on services and digital and how all that’s positioning us for growth. So, just as a reminder, our power business is about $28 billion of annual revenue for GE in 2016. It represents today about one-third of the world’s electrical generation with our customer base. So, it’s big part of the world’s power; it’s a diverse mix. And one of the things you have noted earlier this year is with the announced transaction with Baker Hughes, we will be announcing -- or we will be selling our water business later in 2017. So, that’s our power franchise. If you think about what we do and how we differentiate ourselves for our customers, it’s really on these three areas. One is differentiated products and solution services, one of which is global presence and talent, and one of which is digital capability. And as far as just highlights, what I would say is the Alstom acquisition, well underway. I would say, as I go around the world, and about 70% of our revenue is outside the U.S., strong customer acceptance on the rational of these two companies being together. And you all know about our global footprint and capabilities but the integration and synergies are well on track. Expanded plenty of capabilities, what we’ve got there in terms of scope, in terms of our steam business which I will talk through and then service upgrades. And last of which is big ongoing opportunities for margin enhancement and vertical integration, in-sourcing, and you see the brilliant factory work from GE and digital coming through. So, very much a more valuable business than it was a year ago and also well-positioned to lead. Now, setting back and looking at in the environment that we participate in, I was just recently at the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, just a perspective on the market. I’d say, it’s a dynamic market but it’s characterized by slow growth. But within that slow growth, there are pockets of growth. And I’d say areas that we see right now are in pockets of Latin America; we see it in sub-Saharan Africa; we see it in spots of Asia, but there are places to win in a slow growth environment. Energy demand continues to grow 2% to 3% a year. Obviously the parts of the world are more so than others, particularly in the developing regions. And still remember, today, 1.2 billion people in the world do not have any electricity access, so still a lot of demand. The right hand side of this chart lays out where the kilowatt hours of power come from today. So, you see very much today is centralized power. But the point I know here even by 2025, a lot of the power in the world, over 85% will still be centralize. And you see the role that gas, coal play. And also while renewables is a big growth area, gas is actually the single biggest area of new power in the world. The other area that comes up, if you talk about the global power demand, this is the world of the impact of efficiency. That’s coming out of the top 21 standards as people are focusing to see on how to reduce their carbon emissions footprint, the big opportunity for our business stepping forward, as well as continuing to get more out of new installed based through services. And our digital investments have really positioned us well given more productivity solutions. So, talking about gas on this next page. The gas outlook, people always ask me about this. It’s largely a flat market in terms of gas new units, but it’s heavily switching towards each H-Class machines. You see roughly 32% of the market has been H-Class, we see that growing to close to 46% and closing around 50%. So, people are buying larger units. And if you think about half GE wins with the customer in this space, it’s really four key areas, it’s capital cost efficiency or dollars per kilowatt; it is footprint size, you want it to be smaller; third, which is flexibility, which gives you responsiveness to respond in cycles with renewable; and fourth of which is efficiency. What we have with the HA technology right now is the best dollars per kilowatt, the best power gen today, our operating flexibility is now at industry leadership, and you saw the world record performance announced earlier this year with EDF at our plant in Bouchain in France, which is 62.2% combined cycle efficiency was the highest of any plant in the world. Now, if we step through what Alstom brought to GE, it really strengthened our gas franchise. On the left hand side of this chart, you see a typical gas plant. That’s what our customers buy. And the blue represents where GE has historically been strong, the gas turbine, some of the control areas, some of the steams in the areas. What we’ve got from Alstom is a much bigger presence on the total plant. Many cases, we used to be 20% on order transaction for gas plant and now we’re close to 60%. The value of this is tremendous, in terms of almost half a point more efficiency performance, in terms of what we did and guarantee to customers. Cycle times and how we deliver, it’s very important to certain customers in terms of emergency power situations and our virtual plants and module areas really help us there. And third of which is more scale for volume and product cost out. By the way, each of the business areas in power on track for their synergies. Our overall target within GE was $1.1 billion of synergies this year; power was $777 million and we’re on track to meet if not beat that. Gas power way is significant on their track there and you see the expanded offering and improved performance coming through for customers. And HA platform, we launched this about 18 months ago. This platform is coming to market. We have 17 units that we’ve delivered through the third quarter; 25 will be the number for this year, that’s what we’re on track for. And when we talk about total margins being positive that’s on the U.S. side. And in the third quarter, we were positive and for the total year, we’ll be positive. And for a product scale investment like this to be positive and it’s really first year of introduction is a good thing. I would say all -- both our 50 hertz and 60 hertz units are now tested and the returns for 2017 will be better because we already see the product cost positions better for the U.S. and backlog that we’ll ship in 2017. You see the numbers there that we should be estimated to exit this year with for next year. And when you think about the HA, it’s not just the gas turbine but it’s the steams, the generators and the boilers that makes up the total plant. So, the HA platform, what I would tell you is it’s the right product at the right time in the market in it is delivering. This next one is our steam business. It’s one that some of you that were at our recent investor visits through [indiscernible] you heard the presentation from Andreas. He joined us from Alstom. This is largely the Alstom based business that we acquired but we also put our steam business from GE in it. We now have GE closed to a $3 billion equipment steam business and the associated service business is with our services business. But what’s interesting about this is roughly 30% of the world’s power is coal, so therefore steam power; and 30% of the world’s steam turbines is now GE; and 30% of the world’s boilers is now GE; and 50% of the steam turbines and all nuclear plants are GE. So, in terms of servicing, efficiency and such, this is the offering we have and that we’re very happy with the technology. If you think about how this business is positioned to win; it’s really two key areas, the first of which is the most efficient coal plant technology. You see this one listed here at EnBW. This is at 47.5% thermal efficiency; that’s the highest of any class of any steam plant in the world. You see that rolling through in the some of the big wins, you saw also from us earlier this year. On the other side, something that investors always worry about is the project execution capability here. It was very strong within the steam business and portfolio within Alstom, and you can see here the team just received the award from Asian Power for the Tanjung Bin project in Malaysia for the execution of that project. So, we’re happy with the technology here but not only does it play for new units, it plays for services, which is where I want to go to next. One of the core reasons why we made the investment of capital allocation in Alstom was for the service portfolio. Now, it gave us much stronger presence in the plant but it also gave us broader access to install base. If you think about the plant, the blue there is again is where historically GE was strong in services. And by the way, the combined service business now, if you look at the red, that’s where Alstom added strength. So, not only in gas for the Alstom units, but also much bigger in generator stream, boilers, total plant capability and also other OEM which is non-GE Alstom. We have now launched this year, less than now one year, we are little over one year in integration, but the Fleet360 is our total plant optimization service solution to our customers, and this is already having big impact. Now, our services business within power is about $16 billion of revenue and it represents a large part of our profitability. If you think about how we win in the marketplace, it’s through services technology. Now, a lot of you know, we focus significantly on providing upgrades to our install base. We have a continuing, very robust program for Advanced Gas Paths, AGPs. Last year 104 were shipped; we’re on track do the 135 to 150 this year. But, this program is broadly in GE. Paul McElhinney talked about this when you all were at -- those that were there in Baden. We have broader upgrades for non-F-Class machines, we have that also covering the combustion systems, the compressors, the flange units and now the steam units. If you look at the right hand side, this is how we are together with Alstom and GE coming together. We can now provide more gas upgrades for the Alstom gas from the facilities. In some cases, we are already under contract at two points of efficiency and extended life. Steam turbine upgrade areas are area of big focus for the historical Alstom business but within GE that’s expanding. You’d see the total plant solutions there. And I’m going to come back and talk a little more about what Predix is doing for our installed base because we are starting to see some big wins on that side. So, the service technology continues to expand. And when you think about where we take the business, this is one of the reasons why we bought Alstom. We got 50% more installed base in a single investment, basically 50 years of installed base in one investment. If you look at our investment in maximum installed base, it shifted there from just GE. You see GE and Alstom together, it’s a very nice diversified, and you see -- look at the opportunity that exists in the market, outside of GE and Alstom units, it’s bigger than the existing GE units. So, we have a much more capable service business, large installed base and it’s expanding for the total book. Now, in addition to the three core businesses, cost competitiveness is a key focus within power. We have talked to you historically about SG&A, which is cut down in the legacy business from 12% to 9%, that drove about $460 million of cost out to the operating line. Obviously, we went up a little with Alstom came to 11% of our sales and we’ll be working that down as we complete our restructuring. Product cost is really the bigger entitlement area as we go forward from margin accretion. I just pulled one example here. This shows you our product cost reduction curve for the last introduction of the 7F.O5 gas turbine versus how we are launching now the new HA. You can see that when the H was launched, the first unit was already at 10% less cost than the dollars per kilowatt in the F. And now today, our tank units [ph] shipping from the HA is already at the cost position of the 1,000 F machine. So, we are starting to see the benefits from the should cost work, our combined centers of excellences which is suppliers, product management, manufacturing and things all looking together, and this is a big margin accretion opportunity as going forward and it’s enabled even more so by the digital thread. Now, at the sometime, we are investing globally in our operations. To get lead in this business, you have to be local. And some of these are our historical factories but we do have factories all over the world. This matters to win. And the three things I’d just highlight here different from some of the previous discussions, one of which is our Dammam, Saudi Arabia facility, has now made its first heavy duty F-Class machine that is now shipped. Korea has now joined us because of the Doosan acquisition for the boilers that’s now part of GE. And the third piece is the Algeria facilities are coming up. So, will be able to continue to position for that large market opportunity. So, this is all about being local, high-quality and cost competitive. And as we look to the future, one of the areas is driving more variable cost productivity. And this is really where all of the investments from GE on additive and advanced manufacturing come in. On the left hand side, you see our new additive advanced manufacturing facility in Greenville, South Carolina. It is right next to our largest single heavy duty manufacturing plant in the world. So, we are already scaling up our first additive parts that are operational. And this technology is going to be well into the H-Class. If you look at the right hand side, Digital Thread, this is really more productivity enabled by some very large ERPs and simplifying our IT systems. In 2016 alone, this is $250 million dollars of productivity and we are connecting the whole enterprise here. So, these are big investments. This is about capturing that next level of margin accretion going forward. Now, the area I wanted to kind of close in on is really the last big area of transformation. But in my 23 years in GE and roughly 17 years in the energy industry, this is the biggest transformation that’s happening in the industry right now and will be over the next 20 years. This was really the topic of my keynote discussion at the World Energy Congress back in Istanbul. This is some work here that was done by the World Economic Forum. The $10 trillion of value can be unlocked by getting at digital and industrial coming together for more productivity in the industry. The view is that more than 75% of the unplanned downtimes can be avoided. There is more than 3 to 4 points -- or 3% to 4% of all electrical generation that never makes it to the consumer and industrial; it’s lost in transmission. And there are a lot of new business models coming up here. So, tremendous opportunity for more productivity in the space. In terms of the Power Digital offering, and you hear about the industrial internet, this is all about better outcomes for our customers. If you look at the left hand side of this chart, with hardware and software coming together, we are working with our customers on existing units getting to 5% better starting reliability, 10% less startup fuel, 1% more total plant availability, 1% more efficiency. These are big numbers for the installed base units and for our customers. And when you look at now applying this to our service backlog, our service backlog and power in $60 billion, only a small piece of that today is digital. But what we went through in terms of our contractual service model, multi-year models is where we’re going to deliver outcomes. And I thought the best example I can give from you is this next one in the case study at HUBCO. HUBCO is a Pakistan facility. And this is really a great case example of the power of the digital industrial impact and with one of our customers. In this case, we took Predix, we took the Digital Twin, we took understanding of a -- by the way, this is an installable [ph] plant. We went in there and we applied all of the thinking, and we’re talking about four points more efficiency out of the same plant today. If you look at that, it’s also a case example of using not only Predix, but Asset Performance Management, APM; outage optimization, this is the first major deployment of Neuco, a smaller company acquisition we did in Boston, and you see how that four points breaks out. What’s also we did here, this is the first example where we experimented with the new business model. As opposed to just selling subscription as a service, we actually guaranteed an outcome. And in this case, four points of efficiency over a 10-year period is worth $240 million to the customer. We will share in that savings. If we sold this under the prior model of license only, this would have probably been less than $15 million. There is tremendous value for our customers here. What’s nice about this one too, HUBCO is a subsidiary of Engro. Engro as a company in Pakistan is deploying Predix now across parts of their fleet, as well as in their operations for fertilizer, for food and other industrial businesses. These products scale not only in power, but across the industrial franchise. And the chart I’d leave you with on Power Digital is the same chart used recently, and we talked about it mine and machine is. This is real and is happening. Just within the power business, the power business is close to 40% of the entire revenue of GE’s digital franchise. And within that, a big chunk of that is our software enabled AGPs, but what I show you here is our pipeline of our services, our software oriented business within that number. We have this year -- we are going to be at $500 million of software only orders in power that were driven by digital, and you see the first half numbers there. This is growing over 50%. This is good margin business and those customers on the right, the majority of those were not with us as digital customers just a year ago. And you heard the announcement recently from Exelon, largest utility in U.S. is going to take Predix and scale across their gas, coal and renewables and nuclear franchise. So, just to come back to where I started, it’s really been a transformational year for us. But this is all about building a new GE Power business with Alstom and GE together. You know what the numbers were last year. This year with Alstom, we will go double-digit, both top and bottom-line. The legacy business will grow single digits this year, as we’ve discussed. You see what the margins rates look like there, attractive. And what I’d sum it up is it’s a great high return business within the Company, some clear competitive advantages in terms of technology leadership, globalization, services, digital, simplification and culture. And I would say the other of which is if we look at our capital allocation within the power business over the course of the last number of years is good returns on our investment and we’re positioning the business for not only the short but the long-term. So, with that, thanks for the time. And Julian, I’ll open it up for you and questions. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Julian Mitchell Thanks, Steve. Maybe, I guess firstly, talk a little bit about the AGPs. That’s an area we get a lot of questions on ourselves. The confidence in that 135, 150 number for the very short-term. And also I guess if you could try and scale -- you talked about the overall size of services, but then you talked about upgrades. Roughly what percent of your services revenue is upgrade specific activity, just say long term? Steve Bolze I would say this, on the AGP side, the AGPs, we did 104 last year, we’ll do between 135, 150; I think we’re 86 through the third quarter. Yes, they’re light in the fourth quarter but we know where they are, we know what we’ve got to do. So, I would also say as why has there been so much AGP growth is because it’s a very good return on investment for our customers. The 7S or 60 hertz AGPs are very good investment returns for our customers. Therefore, they’re deploying them across their fleets. So, I’d say yes, feel good about the 135, 150. Your discussion on larger upgrades, I’m not going to get into how much more revenue is that. But what I would tell you is AGPs are really, historically talking about, more on the F fleet, but you could apply them to the Bs and the E class which are the smaller units. The other thing we have a lot of update programs going for the combustion system. People have to do that given the emissions issues today, also have to upgrade your compressors which allows you get more life and output. And the other of which people are getting into is a lot of the F units that were put in during the “U.S. bubble”, are approaching towards their end of rotor [ph] lives. Those are now coming up to major upgrades. And then you see people doing what’s called Julian flange the plant where they literally take open units up, take the whole rotor compressor out and put a new one in. And in top case, they get 2, 3 points of efficiency. So, this upgrade program is a same philosophy we’re applying to Alstom units, same philosophy we’re thinking about as we think through how we proceed at other OEMs. Julian Mitchell Alstom, cost synergies, you sound very comfortable with. Revenue synergies, I think initially were targeted at about 200 million that’s sort of total Alstom inclusive of grid and so forth. Now, you’ve had it for about a year, how you’re thinking about the revenue synergy number? Steve Bolze What I would say is the Alstom integration is really getting traction. I would say to your point, the cost is how we built this synergy model. That’s well on track. I think we said $1.1 billion this year, $1 billion to $3 billion by 2020. I think it’s 2.5 by 2018 and power is 1.7 of it. And I can tell you, we’ll hit our synergies this year, maybe exceed, probably exceed. And then, we have good line of sight going in 2018. So, cost is straightforward to your point. The revenue: We always said revenue synergies would be an upside. What I would tell you this is already in 2016 in power, we have $85 million of revenue synergies. So, we are already seeing it coming into the business. A lot of revenue synergies, everybody else, as you go through these deals, when you get an order, you got to get it to flow through, the backlog and out. So, I think if we use this year as an indication, we are starting to get some. It was always positioned to be incremental. But as we look forward over the next two or three years, it’s happening. I would say that $200 million is reasonable number across the GE portfolio. And I would say in the power business, the area [ph] that we are getting them the most, one is selling them what’s called the steam turbine and this generates [ph] the bottoming cycle with the combined cycle gas, number one. Number two is selling more services to existing contracts we have. And the third of which is really as we start to think about of our three to five-year period, how we expand on the other OEM. So, I think right now, we feel pretty good about the revenue synergies; it’s starting to happen, I think it’s positioned to expand that. Julian Mitchell Within other OEM work, Alstom was somewhat unusual in the emphasis they placed on that type of activity; you know how good Alstom the biggest installed base in thermal power by a distance. So, is there a danger that as you try and get the other OEM book up, the industry and aftermarket gets dragged into some kind of price war on aftermarket? Steve Bolze Julian, I understand the concern. I would say a couple things, one of which is customers kind of while we have a certain portion of the world installed base with our customers, when you go to a customer, it could be a higher level. And I would say customers are pushing us to get involved with servicing on GE equipment, number one. Number two is not only did Alstom do it, and they had a very sizable business to do that, so do us. [Ph] So, it’s not like -- this is a capability that customers are looking for. But I would say that third thing is we are focused on a point of differentiation and it’s really going to be technology. So, how do you apply an AGP or and upgrades like thinking, not only the GE equipment and Alstom equipment, but anybody’s equipment. And there is a lot of our programmed investments that’s going and how we are able to do that. But, we want to have points of differentiation. And I think over time, you will see us be able to do that on even the higher technology on anybody’s installed base. What I would say is that we are expecting this to be a slower ramp up in some of our other business areas, because we got to make sure we do it right. It’s a $600 million business for us this year. Julian Mitchell Got it. And then, you touched on the more project type work that Alstom has brought. You have looked through the backlog that they brought for about a year now. How comfortable do you feel with the state of execution of that backlog and how has GE managed that transition to that EPC type activity? Steve Bolze We did an investor call on November last year. And we talked about when we closed, we had about 18 billion of the backlog. That is power but also grid, renewables et cetera. And about call out it, 25%, 30% of backlog is in power. I would say that the backlog in power has largely played out as expected. We knew everything -- not everything is perfect, but I would say, it’s largely played out as expected, number one. Number two is we brought and we built up a projects management process within GE. We hired a person in Colorado [ph] who did that for [Indiscernible] and put a big focus on this because we recognize there is risk. What I’d say is in power, we were concerned about the steam portfolio, some of the gas portfolio and extended scope but it’s largely played put as expected. And I would say, Julian, I would say, we’ve turned around and said this is now an added capability we have. Because when you bid some of these plant offering in the world, they want you to take more projects. Now, at the end of the day, not everybody wants to go as far as turnkey but to make it into a consortium or what’s the broader -- a credit package, but we see it right now -- it’s largely played out as expected and we’ve built the new capability in the Company. Julian Mitchell If you look at the -- you provided those maps on a typical gas, typical steam front and Alstom brought to you. Some of it, the equipment that broad includes things like boilers where I guess most of you in this room would probably assume the margin profile in the long run is lower OEM, so vis-à-vis a gas turbine. How does GE think about the very long run margin profile of power? Do you think that you will able to drag up those non-IGT product margins sort of same level as the IGT margins have been? Steve Bolze I would say this is our margin rates in aggregate in GE you saw on the charts where we’ve been around 20% for long time. If you look at boiler work, if you look at kind of steam work and things like that, it is a lower margin rate than gas, but it’s still good. Number two is what we worry. Having boilers as part of the GE portfolio, you do more of a total plant optimization. That’s why you saw the HUBCO example 4 points of efficiency. We could not have that if we just looked the gas turbine or machine turbine. [Ph] Same thing if we bid a new HA plant. The 62.2% at Exelon or at EDF is not where we started -- stopping, we’re keeping going. It’s giving us a really viewpoint into where we can increase our equipment business. I would say back to the margin rate of our total power business, we took a dip this year because Alstom came in. What we said out at synergies to improve it in services and gas, I think that’s happening. I think we’ll always be above the GE average because of scale, service portfolio, because of digital, we just got to run the right balance in the long-term. Julian Mitchell Okay. And I guess Jeff Immelt has talked firm-wide about this 50 bps plus gross margin improvement per year. If you strip out Alstom and you look at the base business, you had a headwind this year with HA, maybe $300 million or something EBIT hit; that goes away next year. So, should you be running at well above these things as 50 bps increase on the base business? Steve Bolze What I would is we -- the gross margin focus on the Company is one of the highest I’ve been in -- seeing in the Company since I’ve been here for 23 years. I would say, within power, Julian, you’re right, we did take a headwind this year with the HAs going through. We are seeing the units profitable in the third quarter but we are profitable as we look into total year. As we look at next year, we will see margin rate increase next year because of that. I would say listen, this is a big ongoing opportunity for us. A lot of it is -- the cost is in direct material, it’s sourcing. And I would say the other piece is I showed you on the chart some of the impacts we’re having on product costs on the HA. That is spreading out within the whole portfolio, steam, generators et cetera. So, I think we’ve got to work through some of the mix dynamics with services and equipment and Alstom and such. But given the focus on gross margin rate and product costs, you’ll definitely see an increase, because of the HA next year and then we just got to sort through the rates with mix. Julian Mitchell I don’t know if there are any questions in the audience. If not for now, one more from me would be around free cash conversion, it’s something people are sort endlessly fascinated by. In power specifically, where is that conversion roughly and maybe you can talk about Alstom because that’s sort of the headline number. And how much scope do you think there is for that cash conversion to improve? Steve Bolze I would say this, Jeff Bornstein our CFO said we’re at 85% of free cash flow conversion of the company, we power or below that. What’s driving that below that right now is one is a heavy investment cycle in the HA. One of that is also the restructuring we’re doing with Alstom. Those are two key drivers. Now, Jeff has also said that we’re trying to get to and we are committed to get 95% free cash flow conversion. We are a key part of getting there within the power business. The key tracks to get there, one, we are working through the restructuring. So, those are costs that do not repeat over time obviously. We get the benefits from that in cash conversion. Two of which is the HA investments start to come down. And I would say the third which is the backlog of new business. That’s how you get progress collections. And by the way, we talked about projects. Our backlog in our projects where business is now up close to over 40% this year. So we’re building backlog that gives you progress collections. So, it’s a combination of things but some of the headwinds go away restructuring HA, you get more cash and progress from backlog. And I’d say the last of which is this digital thread investment is getting us more line of sight between the order and the execution. And by the way a lot of the cash can be tied up in inventory or also in the supply chain with suppliers. And as we work cycle time, my counterpart in Alstom was Philippe Cochet, he is now driving productivity and global supply chain excellence in digital trends for the Company. So, those are the steps we have to walk through and will be a key part of the company to get to 95%. Julian Mitchell And on equipment manufacturing, you had -- the competitor is maybe a little bit behind on efficiency of steam and gas turbine in terms of efficiency rates. You’ve seen what’s the reaction on price or do you think price deflation has been pretty stable in recent years? Steve Bolze I would say is what we’re seeing is -- and we’ve discussed it when we go through our quarterly calls is we’re seeing it fairly stable right now. I think we’ve shown 1% to 1.5% of positive price for the last two, three quarters, that will move around on a little bit based on what on looks. But I would say it’s stable. You definitely need differentiation to drive price, and because there still is excess capacity in this. But we’re seeing a bit of -- we’re seeing stability, we’re seeing a little bit of left obviously, mostly driven by the HA. Julian Mitchell And water business is on the way out, where are we sort of in that sale process, expressions of interest? Steve Bolze To be clear, water is a good business and people recognize that. The interest in the water business has been very good. What I would say is it’s a business that is profitable; but it also is a business that we made a decision when we did Baker Hughes for capital allocation that it was better to sell the water business. It’s a good team; it’s a great platform but very good interest and it makes good EBITDA. So, I think it should be a good capital allocation move for GE; it will also be a good move for the business because at the end of the day, it also needed more scale to play in the market, it needed more scale. That’s where we were headed. And so, as we get the final proposal back, we can tell you little bit more about how that’s coming together. Julian Mitchell ",

      "text": "If it continues increasing dividends (which is likely), GE will become a Dividend Achiever in 2019. Dividend Achievers are stocks with 10 or more consecutive years of dividend increases. \nBusiness overview \nIt should not be understated how massive GE’s transformation has been. Last year alone, GE realized $104 billion in asset sales. The goal is to reach $200 billion for GE Capital asset dispositions. \nGiven what a huge restructuring this is, it may rattle the nerves of GE investors a bit. GE Capital was a major contributor to GE over the years. But this is about to change in a big way. \nSource: 2015 Annual Report , letter to shareholders \nGoing forward, GE Capital will generate less than 10% of GE’s annual earnings. Clearly, GE will be a vastly different company as a result of the divestment of its financing arm. \nBut this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. \nWhile reducing the impact of GE Capital may reduce GE’s growth potential, it will also significantly reduce GE’s risk profile. And that is great news for shareholders who prioritize dividends. \nIt is not an exaggeration to say that GE Capital nearly bankrupted GE. The explosive growth of GE’s financing business in the early 2000s also saddled the company with more than $500 billion of debt, just before the Great Recession hit. \nMoreover, the post-recession era is one likely to be defined by stricter regulations. GE will still retain a small financial services arm, to promote growth within the industrials core. \nAt the same time, GE’s smaller financial segment will allow the company to apply to de-designate GE Capital as a “systemically important financial institution.” This would be an added step toward reducing regulatory risk. \nAs a result, this is the right time to exit financial services. \nNow, GE will be able to concentrate on what it does best—manufacturing. GE spends significantly on R&D each year. R&D spending over the past three years is as follows : 2015 R&D expense of $5.2 billion 2014 R&D expense of $5.2 billion 2013 R&D expense of $5.4 billion \nGoing forward, this spending will be allocated toward the most attractive opportunities. \nGrowth catalysts \nGE’s industrial businesses are performing well and have a lot of momentum heading into 2017 and beyond. \nLast year , industrial earnings per share increased 19%. Segment profit margin expanded by 80 basis points, and return on capital expanded 290 basis points. \nFocusing on the industrials segments not only de-risks GE, but gives the company a clear path for growth going forward. There are several major segments still performing very well for GE. \nGE’s operating profit, excluding its oil and gas segment, rose 8% through the first three quarters of 2016. \nFuture growth is likely to be led by health care, industrials and power. \nWhen it comes to health care, the demographics for GE are very favorable. Aging populations across the world will result in national health care spending to outpace GDP growth in the years ahead. \nThrough the first three quarters of 2016, health care revenue rose 4% while operating profit rose 10% due to margin expansion. \nAnother area of future growth is GE’s power business. \nSource: GE Power Presentation , page 4 \nPower is a particular area of focus in the emerging markets, where millions of people still lack basic electricity. This will open up new markets for growth. One market ripe for entry is China, which has a high-growth economy and a population of 1 billion. \nGE is making huge investment into China, made easier by its focus on industrial operations. GE is eyeing significant growth in China moving forward, across its various businesses. \nSource: GE China Investor Forum , page 8 \nGE generated 17% of its revenue from China last year, and this only stands to grow in the future. \nGE’s oil and gas segment continues to weigh on the company. The steep drop in commodity prices over the past two years has resulted in deep cost cuts from major oil and gas customers. Oil and gas segment revenue declined 25% last quarter. \nFortunately, GE’s successful aviation business is helping to offset weakness in oil and gas markets. \nSource: Third-Quarter Earnings Presentation , page 10 \nDividend analysis \nNow that GE is a more streamlined, efficient company, its growth is expected to accelerate. Analysts currently expect GE’s EPS to increase 16.7% next year, to $1.75. \nIf GE meets these forecasts, its EPS will sufficiently cover its dividend with room to spare. GE’s current annualized dividend is 92 cents per share. This represents 52% of next year’s projected EPS. \nA payout ratio close to half of earnings is comfortable enough to support a return to steadier dividend growth. A side benefit is that when the next recession does occur, GE will be far more capable of maintaining its dividend without its risky capital arm. \nAt its current share price, GE stock offers a 2.9% dividend yield. This is above the 2% average dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index. \nFinal thoughts \nGE has had an uneven recovery since the Great Recession brought it to the brink. It has raised its dividend since, but has still not reached pre-crisis levels. \nThat said, GE stock has an above-average dividend yield. And thanks to its decision to sell GE Capital, it is on a firmer path for steadier, sustained dividend growth each year. \nDisclosure: I am not long any of the stocks mentioned in this article. \nPublished Dec. 3 by Bob Ciura About the author: Ben Reynolds I run Sure Dividend, a website that finds high quality dividend stocks for long term investors using the 8 Rules of Dividend Investing.",

It also wants to strengthen the public finances to help pay for its social benefits policies. \nExecutives for Germany's Lufthansa Technik and for the U.S. General Electric (GE) Aviation said Poland offered the desired mix of highly qualified employees, favorable economic environment and easily accessible location. GE has been present in Poland for 25 years in the engineering sector, also developing aircraft engines. \nThe plant in Sroda Slaska, in the southwest, is to test and repair state-of-the-art engines for the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jets for Lufthansa and for other airlines, starting in September 2018. It will operate for at least 30 years and will create some 600 new jobs and train new personnel, recruiting from Poland. \n\"The technology that will be required to maintain (the newest GE9X) engine is one of the reasons why we selected this site here in Poland,\" said Bill Millhaem, senior executive at GE Aviation. \nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo said that large investments will be made across Poland in roads, railways and other infrastructure as the government aims to re-build Poland's industry and production potential. \n\"We are doing this to make Poland develop faster and more evenly, to give our country a good future,\" she said. \nUnder communism, before 1989, Poland had a strong heavy industry sector that supplied the Soviet bloc countries. It was largely phased out as Poland began integrating with western Europe, but the government wants to now rebuild Poland's economic capacity focusing on modern technologies.

      "text": "ge lighting c by alexa lamp More Here’s a switch. There are plenty of smart lights that can be controlled by Amazon Alexa voice commands, but now GE Lighting is about to integrate Alexa Voice Service (AVS) components into its C by GE LED smart table lamp so you can talk to it to control both the lamp and all your other Alexa-enabled smart home devices and appliances. You’ll also be able to ask the lamp about the news and weather, and even have it tell you a joke.\nThe C by GE smart lamp is the first lighting product with Alexa built in to be announced. Alexa already has more than 5,000 locally enabled, cloud-based skills. The library of Alexa skills is building fast, so there will soon be a seemingly unlimited selection of actions at your command. With Alexa-enabled smart appliances, you could sit and read by the lamp light while cooking a meal or change your mind and use the lamp to place an order and have your dinner delivered.\nMore: Leaving home? These smart light bulbs repel robberies by mimicking your patterns\nGE Lighting’s C by GE brand is focusing on building its own line of connected home devices for convenience, control, and security. GE sees the Alexa-integrated lamp as a “first step in unleashing the ultimate living experience.” GE is developing applications in-house, working with outside firms such as Amazon, and inviting homeowners to share their ideas.\nThe circular LED C by GE table lamp has a contemporary geometric form designed in part by Richard Clarkson, who designed The Cloud, a ceiling fixture that responds to motion with lightning and thunder.\nPre-orders for the as-yet-unnamed C by GE Alexa-enabled table lamp will be available starting in early 2017 on the C by GE website . Shipping is scheduled for the second quarter of 2017. To learn more about the table lamp with Alexa inside and to sign up for ordering notification, you can go to this site .\nBlink adds Alexa-enabled outdoor smart cam to its indoor security systems Alexa is about to get a lot smarter thanks to hundreds of new commands Ask Alexa, and she’ll turn on your GE appliances for you",

      "text": "GE liked Amazon's Alexa so much they put a ring on it Alexa, light the way! Ashley Barry December 07, 2016 \nAlexa's a pretty cool invention, right? Amazon's virtual assistant tells jokes, dims your living room lights, and responds to famous Star Wars quotes. I mean, what more can you ask for? In addition to rattling off compelling news stories, she also entertains the masses wherever she goes. My sister, for example, stores the portable Echo device in her kitchen because she likes playing music while she cooks. But whenever I'm over her house, I always end up having a wild dance party with her two young children in the kitchen. I think I've discovered Alexa's real purpose. \nAt the end of the day, the digital assistant improves people's lives. Whether she's controlling smart home devices or answering a scientific question, Alexa plays a crucial role in day-to-day routines and activities. And she's about to get even better thanks to General Electric. \nThe tech giant's releasing an unusual looking LED lamp that's attached to a device that looks like the Echo Dot. The table lamp's circular design is unique and somewhat futuristic. It actually reminds me of the glowing identity disc from the Tron franchise. This adorable light relieves stress and makes kids happy \nThe lamp works like an Echo device. The always-on microphone will listen for commands and questions. All you have to do is say the magic word. It seems neat, but the sound quality is less than stellar. The speakers are on par with the Echo Dot speakers. If it's quality speakers you're after, you'd have better luck buying the original Echo. \nWhat you're seeing is a prototype. The final product might be a different story altogether, but I'm no prophet. Right now there's no release date, but GE expects the lamp to ship sometime in late 2017. Is it cool? Definitely. Is it practical? Maybe. I like the design, but it might be too big to store on a table. I can see myself knocking the decorative lamp over by mistake.

      "text": "It's nearly time for General Electric ( GE ) and Baker Hughes ( BHI ) to show analysts what the \"new\" Baker Hughes will look like next year.\nThe two companies are hosting an analyst day Thursday to cover the pending merger of GE Oil and Gas and Baker Hughes. Shares of the oilfield services company as well as industrials giant fell on Wednesday in a broadly higher market.\nAt the end of October, the two companies agreed to combine GE's oil and gas (GE O&G) business and Baker Hughes to create the \"new\" Baker Hughes. Under the terms of the agreement, Baker Hughes shareholders will receive a one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share. GE will own 62.5% of the company, with Baker Hughes owning 37.5%. The transaction is expected to close mid-2017.\n\"We think the increased scale and stability of the 'New Baker Hughes' afforded through the transaction enhances the company's competitive position and further aligns BHI with its vision of shifting its focus to products and technology and away from fully integrated services,\" RBC Capital Market's Co-Head of Global Energy Research, Kurt Hallead, wrote in a research note Wednesday.\nThe firm expects the analyst day event to cover the pro forma company profile, along with long-term targets beyond the framework of $34 billion in revenues, $8 billion of EBITDA and $0.08 of earnings accretion by 2020.\n\"The amount of commentary around integrating digital solutions into the oilfield/wellbore and an enhanced ability to address greater scope of projects leads us to wonder if greater revenue opportunities are available,\" Hallead said. He expanded on his comments, saying that the combined entity will tap into the GE store and provide solutions that \"should help the oil industry increase production and reduce costs.\" RBC rates BHI shares at Outperform with a $61 price target.",
