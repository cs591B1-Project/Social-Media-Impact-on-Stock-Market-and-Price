      "text": " 40PM from the breakthrough dept. Toyota thinks it's found a way to create more efficient EV batteries. The car company is calling its method, which allows a free flow of lithium ions from the cathode to the anode, the \"world's first behavior observation method for lithium ions in electrolyte.\" CNET adds: Charging and discharging batteries can create lithium ion deviation. Some of these ions can get bunched up, which can affect a battery's performance over time. In order to help reduce that bunching, scientists need to see what's happening as the ions flow through the battery's electrolyte. That observation wasn't possible until now. Toyota made has replaced the phosphorous in a traditional lithium-ion battery electrolyte with heavier elements. These heavier elements, which ferry the ions through the electrolyte, are then bombarded with powerful x-rays, which allows researchers to observe how the ions flow through. So what does this all mean? By observing the lithium ions in the electrolyte, research and development dollars can be spent on preventing the bunching that degrades battery performance. Toyota believes its breakthrough can improve electric vehicle range by up to 15 percent and improve the battery's life simultaneously.",

      "text": "With Toyota's ( TM ) reported breakthrough in lithium-ion battery chemistry, the Japanese automaker's strategic shift toward creating more battery-powered electric vehicle models comes into clearer focus.\nThis week, Toyota invited reporters to its Tokyo headquarters where the automaker's head of research and development, Hisao Yamashige, explained how and why the automaker believes it can improve the range of vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries by about 15%.\nUsing an enormous synchrotron near Kobe, Toyota scientists were able to observe the movement of lithium ions in order to understand why they slow down and a battery loses its effectiveness. With this understanding, the company believes it can improve the design and create a better battery within two to three years.\nToyota until now has downplayed the role of rechargeable batteries for zero-emission vehicles, asserting that the technology was too costly, ineffective and unsafe. Instead, Toyota has been pushing fuel cells, which also generate electricity using hydrogen as a basic fuel; the automaker is leasing a small number of Mirai fuel-cell sedans in California.\nEarlier this month, Toyota disclosed that it was changing direction and intended to mass produce a new electric vehicle, or EV, in time for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The automaker will create a four-person team to answer basic questions such as what kind of vehicle architecture to use and to devise a battery manufacturing strategy.\nToyota has said it remains focused on developing hydrogen fuel-cell-powered vehicles.\nTwo other factors likely are influencing the automaker's strategic thinking. One is competitive. Volkswagen's ( VLKAY ) diesel-emission scandal has created a cloud over the entire diesel engine industry, with VW now undertaking a massive initiative to de-emphasize diesels and simultaneously to expand EVs to 25% of its output by 2025.",

      "text": "Ogier completes first post-season test with Toyota 9,360 views By: David Gruz , Editorial assistant 24/11/2016 10:22 Less than a week after his last rally with Volkswagen, Sebastien Ogier has tested for Toyota as he continues to weigh up his options for a 2017 WRC campaign. \nThe four-time champion, who finished second in last weekend's Rally Australia, drove the Yaris WRC on both tarmac and gravel roads in the Tarragona region of Catalunya. \nWhile reportedly Ogier recognised the potential of the car, he was not fully satisfied, marking out the suspension as a weak point. \nToyota has only announced Juho Hanninen for its line-up so far, and while WRC2 champion Esapekka Lappi is considered likely to join, Jari-Matti Latvala and Teemu Suninen are also in the frame. \nOgier is also expected to try out the M-Sport-built Ford Fiesta this week, another career avenue that is considered by the Frenchman in the wake of Volkswagen's pull-out. \nWhile a move to Malcolm Wilson's team remains a strong possibility, Ogier has indicated he will not make a decision until he has tested the Ford Fiesta RS, as well as Citroen's machinery.

UPDATED: 11/23/2016 2:50 pm -- Adds Transport Canada \nToyota is recalling about 60,000 Sienna minivans in Canada and 744,000 in the United States because of a defect that can cause the motorized sliding doors to open while the vehicle is moving. \nThe recall covers Siennas from model years 2011 through 2016, according to a statement posted on the company’s Canadian website. \nA Toyota Canada spokesman said in an email that the company is not aware of any injuries. \nToyota said it is currently developing a remedy for the problem and would notify the affected owners of the recall by first-class mail. \nTransport Canada also issued a recall notice on its website. \n\"On certain vehicles equipped with power sliding doors, under certain conditions which impede the opening of the door (such as if the door becomes frozen with ice), the sliding door motor could stall when the door is operated. If the motor stalls, high current in the door motor circuit could be generated, operating the circuit protection for the door motor. If this occurs with the sliding door latch mechanism in an unlatched position, the door could open while driving, increasing the risk of injury to a vehicle occupant,\" Transport Canada said. ",

      "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery \"in a few years\" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently. “Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, told a media briefing in Tokyo on Thursday.\nImproving the performance of lithium-ion battery technology is a pressing issue for traditional automakers such as Toyota and new entrants such as Tesla Motors Inc because of its limiting characteristics.\nProducers of all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well as conventional gas-electric hybrids are all striving to source or develop more advanced battery technologies to improve range, battery life and safety.\nToyota, Japan’s biggest automaker by volume, has pioneered gasoline-electric hybrid technology and is gearing up to launch a new, near-all-electric plug-in hybrid called the Prius Prime. It is also aiming to come up with an all-electric battery car by about 2020.\nUsing techniques developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota engineers were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes, Yamashige said.\nThis should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, something that currently limits battery life and vehicle range and can be a factor in causing overheating, he said.\n(Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Stephen Coates)",

      "text": "\nI was sitting in the service department of my Toyota dealer, staring at a book without seeing it as I waited for my car. God was next to me, watching “The Price is Right.” \n“Eight-hundred forty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents,” he said. \n“Huh?” I said. \n“The retail price of a stainless-steel Kenmore 4.2 cubic foot freestanding gas range,” said God, pointing to the television. \nOn the screen, an excited young woman blurted, “Twelve hundred dollars!” \nDrew Carey looked sad for her as he revealed the price. God shook his head. “I tried to tell her,” he said. “If people would only listen to me …” \n“Oh,” I said, and returned to the book I wasn’t reading. \nGod regarded me a moment. Then he said, “Transmission?” \nI looked up. “What?” \nGod said, “I asked if you brought the car in because your transmission went blooey. Obviously, something’s got you down.” \nI sighed and closed the book. “Trump,” I said. \n“Trump?” \n“The guy that’s going to be our new president,” I said. \n“Oh, yeah,” said God. “With the hair, right?” \n“Yeah,” I said. “That guy.” \n“Well, what about him?” \nOn the screen above us, some man had Drew Carey in a bear hug. I sighed. “He’s the worst excuse for a leader I’ve ever seen,” I said. “What kind of ‘president’ spends his time whining about how he’s treated on ‘Saturday Night Live’? Or has to pay out $25 million to resolve a fraud case en route to inauguration? Not to mention that he’s assembling a cabinet only a Klansman could love.” \n“Frightening,” said God. \n“Yes,” I said. “Now here it is Thanksgiving and I find that, well, I’m just not feeling very thankful.” \nGod was incredulous. “But look at all I’ve given you. You’ve got that great wife, you have a house, you have health and you’ve got that new granddaughter toddling around.” \n“Yeah,” I said. “Of course, I’m thankful for all that. But the country…” \n“You should thank me for the country, too,” he said. \n“How?” I said. “Like I just told you, there’s nothing to be thankful for.” \n“I disagree,” said God. “I did some of my better work here.” \n“Oh?” I said. “Which part? The bigotry, the stupidity or the misogyny?” \nGod gave me a level look. “You’re angry,” he said. \n“Yeah,” I admitted. “I probably will be for the next few years.” \n“Why?” asked God. \n“Why?! Didn’t you hear what I said about the dope we elected? About the Masters of Evil he’s surrounding himself with? I expect better from this country.” \n“You expect better,” said God. On the screen above, some lady shrieked and bit her fingernails as the Big Wheel spun. \n“Yeah,” I said. “I do.” \n“And what gives you this expectation?” \n“This is America,” I said. \nGod laughed. “You people always say that word like a magic spell,” he said. “But there is no magic in it. Certainly no guarantee. You may expect better in America only because here, you have the freedom to demand better — and to work toward better. That’s all ‘America’ means. You had that freedom before this Trump person was elected, and you have it still. Not everyone does.” \n“So you’re saying the fight to form a more perfect union is always ongoing? And that even in our current predicament we can draw strength from knowing that? You’re saying that God abides even now, and that these are things to be grateful for on Thanksgiving Day?” \nGod smiled. “I’m saying thanksgiving is not a day.” \n“Wow,” I said. “I never thought about it like that.” \n“You’re welcome,” said God.

      "text": "By YURI KAGEYAMA\nAP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles - an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent.\nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones.\nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery.\nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations.\nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy.\nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers.\nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold.\nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager.\nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings.\n___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama\nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Toyota's Battery 'Breakthrough' Can Lead To More Range, Longer Life Published by Slashdot on Sat, 26 Nov 2016 Toyota thinks it's found a way to create more efficient EV batteries. The car company is calling its method, which allows a free flow of lithium ions from the cathode to the anode, the \"world's first behavior observation method for lithium ions in electrolyte.\" CNET adds:Charging and discharging batteries can create lithium ion deviation. Some of these ions can get bunched up, which can affect a battery's performance over time. In order to help reduce that bunching, scientists need to see what's happening as the ions flow through the battery's electrolyte. That observation wasn't possible until now. Toyota made has replaced the phosphorous in a traditional lithium-ion battery electrolyte with heavier elements. These heavier elements, which ferry the ions through the electrolyte, are then bombarded with powerful x-rays, which allows researchers to observe how the ions flow through. So what does this all mean' By observing the lithium ions in the electrolyte, research and development dollars can be spent on preventing the bunching that degrades battery performance. Toyota believes its breakthrough can improve electric vehicle range by up to 15 percent and improve the battery's life simultaneously. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

      "text": "With Toyota's ( TM ) reported breakthrough in lithium-ion battery chemistry, the Japanese automaker's strategic shift toward creating more battery-powered electric vehicle models comes into clearer focus.\nThis week, Toyota invited reporters to its Tokyo headquarters where the automaker's head of research and development, Hisao Yamashige, explained how and why the automaker believes it can improve the range of vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries by about 15%.\nUsing an enormous synchrotron near Kobe, Toyota scientists were able to observe the movement of lithium ions in order to understand why they slow down and a battery loses its effectiveness. With this understanding, the company believes it can improve the design and create a better battery within two to three years.\nToyota until now has downplayed the role of rechargeable batteries for zero-emission vehicles, asserting that the technology was too costly, ineffective and unsafe. Instead, Toyota has been pushing fuel cells, which also generate electricity using hydrogen as a basic fuel; the automaker is leasing a small number of Mirai fuel-cell sedans in California.\nEarlier this month, Toyota disclosed that it was changing direction and intended to mass produce a new electric vehicle, or EV, in time for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The automaker will create a four-person team to answer basic questions such as what kind of vehicle architecture to use and to devise a battery manufacturing strategy.\nToyota has said it remains focused on developing hydrogen fuel-cell-powered vehicles.\nTwo other factors likely are influencing the automaker's strategic thinking. One is competitive. Volkswagen's ( VLKAY ) diesel-emission scandal has created a cloud over the entire diesel engine industry, with VW now undertaking a massive initiative to de-emphasize diesels and simultaneously to expand EVs to 25% of its output by 2025.",

      "title": "Toyota Prius Prime Arrives In US: Will It Be The Plug-In Sales Champion For 2017",
      "text": "16 mins ago by Jay Cole 0 Comments New copies of the Toyota Prius Prime (such as this one at Expressway Toyota) arrived at US dealers starting on November 8th \nDespite some hiccups getting production underway on the new Toyota Prius Prime in Japan this Fall due to some difficulty manufacturing componentry unique to the plug-in version, Toyota still managed to land the car on US soil this month ahead of the company’s original schedule. A Prius Prime (with optional 11.6 inch HD multimedia screen) at Toyota of Oakland waits to find a home \nThe 25 mile plug-in hybrid Toyota ( details ) was only expected to arrive just before year’s end, but car’s starting arriving on dealer lots in limited quantities on November 8th nonetheless. Also of note, and some of those cars have already made it out to states that aren’t California. /refreshing \nThis pleasant delivery surprise from Toyota means that not only will the company manage to log some plug-in sales of consequence this year, but the plug-in is in no danger of finishing last on our monthly plug-in scorecard for US sales ( just 52 of the long out-of production 1st generation Prius PHV had been sold thus far in 2016 ). \nCurrently as of press, Toyota has already managed to build inventory of the PHEV up to around 200 units nationally ( but still mostly in California ). \nAnd if the 2017 Prius Prime heads into 2017 well stocked, it could move all the way from the bottom of the plug-in sales charts ni the US to the very top, as the $27,950 price-point is extremely attractive to not only thrifty EV buyers, but traditional consumers of the standard Prius. \nDiscounting the $4,500 federal credit the Prime is eligible for ( thanks to its new, larger 8.8 kWh battery ), the new plug-in Prius has an effective price of $23,450 – which is $1,000 less than the base petrol Prius model…of which Toyota historically sells anywhere from 7,000 to 10,000 a month of those. Inside the 2017 Toyota Prius Prime \nExcluding new plug-in offerings, the Tesla Model S was forecast to sell around ~30,000 to 35,000 copies in the US next year, which translates to a monthly sales rate of 2,500 to 2,900 EVs, while the Chevrolet Bolt EV is estimated to move around 25,000 copies in the US for full year 2017 ( ~2,100/month ). \nThe original Prius plug-in (which was not competitively priced, and with just 11 miles of electric range ) was the #2 best seller in 2012, and #4 in 2013 and 2014 before being discontinued mid 2015. So what do you think? Can the much improved, priced-right Toyota Prius Prime be the best selling plug-in for the US? We think it has a good shot…if properly stocked to demand. \nAnd even if it doesn’t hit the top of the charts, one thing is for certain – the Toyota Prius Prime is here…and it is going to put a lot of new customers behind the wheel of a plug-in car in 2017. \nHat tip to David M!",

      "text": "Toyota Working On Advanced Electric Car Battery That Could Improve Range By 15% Toyota Working On Advanced Electric Car Battery That Could Improve Range By 15% By CarandBike Team (With Inputs from Reuters) Nov 27, 2016 View Photos The performance of lithium-ion battery technology has constrained the growth and development of electric vehicles because of its restricted characteristics. However, taking that challenge head on, Toyota recently announced it aspires to develop a greater electric-car battery that will allow its vehicles to offer up to 15 per cent greater range and battery life than they do currently. Prius Hisao Yamashige, a battery technology researcher at Toyota, said, \"Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more.\" The Japanese carmaker that lay the groundwork for hybrid technology has collaborated with a Japanese publicly-financed laboratory and four universities in Japan as it braces to roll out an all-electric battery car by about 2020. In fact, Toyota engineers recently had a breakthrough - they were able to better see in \"real time\" how lithium ions moved inside electrodes. Yamashige explained this should lead to new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly and bunching up in the electrodes, a phenomenon that currently limits the life of lithium-ion batteries and vehicle range. It can also be a factor in causing overheating, he said.",

      "text": "Tweet \nIt doesn’t take a wind god and a thunder god to explain how good your car is, but it certainly helps. \nCar makers have to compete with a lot of other companies to get people to buy their cars. Not only are they battling against outsiders, but they also compete against themselves as plenty of prospective buyers aren’t attached to one particular make or style. One of the best ways to distinguish themselves is to make an undeniably cool car commercial, but with so many commercials already out there, what is an advertising executive supposed to do? How about looking way into the past for inspiration? \nThe Toyota Mark X is classified as an executive car which means it’s larger than a family car, so they are up against a lot of stiff competition. Plenty of European car manufacturers make an executive car so Toyota already has to compete with the “coolness” factor of a Mercedes or BMW. \nThat’s OK though, because Japan’s biggest car manufacturer went to its cultural roots to show how the Mark X is extra special. Filmed in the dark with three different colored cars, drivers and artists worked together to paint the instantly recognizable Fujin Raijin-zu (Wind God and Thunder God painted screen) with lights and fast-moving executive cars. ▼ On your Mark (X)! ▼ Get set… ▼ Paint! \nThis intricate ballet in the darkness is played out over the two minute clip, but it’s still enough time to marvel at just what it is they are doing. ▼ Ta da! \nEven if you aren’t an historical Japanese art aficionado, you still can marvel at the driving skills necessary to pull this off. Needless to say, if RocketNews24 is in the market for a new car, or a gigantic paintbrush, no other car has proven itself quite like the Toyota Mark X. \nAnd if you want to see other interpretations of Fujin Raijin-zu , check them out re-imagined as the Super Mario Brothers , or as cookies . It’s certainly the most delicious way to enjoy the artwork that we’ve ever seen. ",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nThe world needs a lot more lithium mines, after Toyota said on October 29 that it has mastered the Lithium-Ion battery.\nAnd that’s a problem for the fast growing Electric Vehicle (EV) market, because even though finding lithium is relatively easy, getting a mine into production is not. Adding Toyota’s huge global demand to an already tight market…will make lithium investors very happy.\nToyota is one of (and often is) the largest car companies in the world, and certainly has the most hybrid/electric cars–in April 2016 they surpassed 9 million sold.\nThey are now focused on lithium for the next 9 million. So if you think this is the most bullish chart in energy right now–and it is–you just wait. I think we ain’t seen nothing yet:\nLithium prices soared in the last year—more than quadrupling from $5,000 per metric tonne to a peak of $24,000/t. This happened as the Market realized that lithium battery demand would ramp up huge in the next decade–and the market realized lithium supply could not keep up.\nThat kind of gain rarely holds and indeed lithium prices have cooled some since.\nBut the fundamentals remain very bullish.\nLithium demand is set to grow 80% in the next four years. The driver: Electric Vehicles (EVs). In 2015 less than 1% of cars sold worldwide were EVs. By 2025 that is expected to rise to 14%.\nThat would mean EVs alone will need more lithium in 2025 than the entire market needs today.\nOne factor driving demand is that better technology is reducing lithium costs dramatically—six years ago lithium batteries cost $1,400 per kilowatt-hour (KWH); today they are less than $400 per KWH, a steep 70% decrease that is expected to continue.\nBy 2022 an unsubsidized EV will be cost competitive with a traditional internal combustion engine car. And it will be cool to own one. What does this all mean in terms of demand?\nThe market was 176,000 tonnes lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2015. It is expected to reach 347,000 tonnes in 2020 and 687,000 tonnes by 2025– a 260% increase in ten years .\nChris Berry is President of House Mountain Partners; an independent commodity analyst that services institutional clients, and a lithium expert. His estimates for needed new capacity are a bit lower but remain very bullish regardless: “We will need to bring one new lithium mine on-stream every year between now and 2025 to meet projected demand. ” (Emphasis mine-KS)\nOne new mine a year! Is that possible? Just like oil and gas, there is lots of lithium in the world – defined resources are enough to carry us for 460 years! – but lithium mines are notoriously difficult to build and operate.\nThat applies to both kinds of lithium mines, brine and hard rock operations. New mines often fail and operating mines regularly produce way below nameplate capacity.\nWhy?\nBecause there aren’t many lithium geologists/metallurgists/engineers Because the world’s best brines are where water is problematic Because the world’s best brines are where permits are difficult to get Because it’s hard to raise money for an unusual metal with opaque pricing. Because lithium is an oligopoly, and the four companies in control, work to stop others from gaining market share. Berry says lithium prices will remain strong because “demand will outpace supply ensuring a tight market and it is remarkably difficult to bring a new lithium mine on-stream.”\nAll those challenges mean only two of the 60-odd lithium projects around the world are expected to actually start producing this year or next and only another four have a chance of achieving production by 2020.\nThat leaves us with a very tight market.\nThe yellow line shows base case demand. The bars show supply. You can see modest supply surpluses over the next few years and then supply has to push to keep up.\nThe dark blue bars show base case lithium surpluses or deficits while the light blue bars show a bull case market–big deficits in supply. Either way, one thing is clear: there is not a lot of room to give.\nThis is a market that needs a (much) stronger production pipeline.\nAnd there is the opportunity: the market needs some lithium success stories, a few companies that can assemble the right people, projects, and capital to feed that production need.\nThe bull market in lithium is early days—the 2 nd or 3 rd inning—but already the Market has changed, says Berry.\n“What we need are management teams that can raise the capital to bring new mines on-stream…”\nThe stock market winners have been the teams building a great property portfolio. The next set of winners will be the teams who can develop the right properties quickly–then permit and build the mines.\nThat has me excited about a new lithium company—one with prime assets, an award-winning geologist and a board that has built and sold junior companies before. Now they are focused on lithium and are raising millions of dollars very quickly.\nWhat’s more, the biggest catalyst of its short life is happening within the next 30 days.\nYou can throw a baseball from their property to a producing well at North America’s largest producing lithium asset. They have the water rights. They have the drilling permits.\nThis company will be getting back their own very first drill results within 30 days—setting the stage for a potential re-rating by the Market.\nIn two days I’ll give you the name and symbol—for free.

That can cause the circuit to overload and open a fuse in the car, which prevents the door from latching shut properly. \nToyota is still working on a fix and anticipates notifying owners of the problem in mid-January.

      "text": "Toyota battery R&D will allow all-electric car in 'a few years,' likely 2020 Email This Page   Enlarge Photo \nThe signals are now unmistakable: Toyota will offer a battery-electric car for sale in 2020. \nAfter a decade of condemning electric cars as suitable only for the smallest vehicles in around-town use, the world's largest car company is changing its tune. \nYet another news story out of Japan has company executives suggesting that it has finally decide lithium-ion batteries are suitable for real cars. DON'T MISS: Toyota to offer electric car in 2020 as fuel-cell sales struggle \nIn this case, the message was delivered by Hisao Yamashige, one of the company's many researchers into battery technology, who spoke at a briefing for Tokyo media on Thursday. \nLithium-ion cells, he said, are \"a key technology\" and their performance must improve even more than it has going forward, he said, according to the Reuters news service . \nToyota will be able to build cars with longer battery life and up to 15 percent more range than they have today, he suggested, \"in a few years.\" \nStructure and principles of an automotive lithium-ion battery [Toyota] Enlarge Photo \nThe meat of the presentation had to do with new techniques that allows Toyota to observe in real time how lithium ions move inside the electrodes of battery cells, Yamashige said. One new technique replaced the usual electrolyte, containing phosphorous, with one that used heavy elements instead. \nWhen lithium ions bind to electrolyte ions with heavier elements, their shadows are darker on X-rays, letting researchers see the deviation of those ions better within the electrolyte. \nThe techniques were developed in a collaboration among Toyota's central R&D laboratories, four Japanese universities, the publicly funded Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, and the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute. ALSO SEE: Now Toyota can make electric cars: it's tamed lithium-ion batteries, it says (Oct 2016) \nThe upshot of the observations may be new designs that prevent ions from moving unevenly and \"bunching up\" within the electrodes, causing excess heat and affecting cell life. \nThis is likely one of the technologies mentioned last month by Koji Toyoshima , the chief engineer for the latest Prius—and its Prius Prime plug-in hybrid version—in a separate presentation last month. \nHe mentioned Toyota's work on lithium-ion battery packs, including sophisticated real-time monitoring software to observe the temperature and operating characteristics of each cell; shrinking cell size for greater energy density and better battery packaging; and better precision in cell manufacturing to eliminate impurities. \n2017 Toyota Prius Prime \nThe upshot of that presentation: \"Developing lithium-ion batteries for both hybrids and plug-ins will enable us to also produce all-electric cars in the future,\" Toyoshima said. \nAnd that's the message we've been hearing from the company since early summer. \nBack in June, Prius chief engineer Toyoshima hinted that the Prius Prime plug-in hybrid could form the basis for future battery-electric Toyota models. CHECK OUT: Toyota hints it may be more friendly toward electric cars: report (Jun 2016) \nThat car's 8.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack gives it a rated electric range of 25 miles, and the second-highest energy efficiency rating (133 MPGe) of any car sold in the U.S. this year. \nMoreover, its engineers made the unexpected choice of defaulting it to run solely on battery power without letting the engine start up at all while there is still battery capacity left. \nIt differs from the behavior of other plug-in hybrids from Ford, Hyundai, Kia, and others—but replicates the driving experience of the Chevrolet Volt, which now has 53 miles of all-electric range. \n2017 Toyota Prius Prime test drive, Ojai, California, Sep 2016 Enlarge Photo \nThe Prius team has already indicated that a battery upgrade for the Prius Prime could come sometime during the car's probably six-year model life—perhaps at the halfway point, which would be the 2020 model year. \nEarlier reports have suggested that Toyota will introduce a small, all-electric SUV at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, which it will use to showcase its green-car accomplishments. \nCould we expect an all-electric version of the Prius then as well? \nLet us hope.",

      "text": "2016 Toyota FJ Cruiser TRD Text: Inigo S. Roces / Photos: Inigo S. Roces   The civil bushwhacker \nWith its rugged throwback looks, spacious interior and comfortable yet go-anywhere ability, it’s should come as no surprise that the FJ Cruiser has become quite a popular model in the local market. The vehicle has won over many new fans into the Toyota stable, appealing to female drivers, some Jeep and Land Rover faithfuls, as well as a few that have never considered 4x4s until its arrival. The wide availability of aftermarket parts has also helped boost its popularity and it’s not uncommon to see a fully dressed up FJ Cruiser on the streets or in car shows. \nIn time with the arrival of TRD accessories for the new Fortuner and Hilux, so too have TRD options for the FJ Cruiser been launched. Toyota Motor Philippines even had their own test unit dressed up in full kit, so we thought we’d borrow it for a few days for a test drive. \nWith already such an imposing façade, the full TRD kit serves only serves to further emphasize the FJ Cruiser’s rugged abilities. Underneath the front is a new aluminium skid plate with TRD cut out. Riveted wheel arches bolt over the standard flairs wheel polished black wheels and all-terrain tires serve as the new shoes. Underneath the wheelbase is a new steel bar to serve as protection when going off-road. Behind the wheels are larger mudflaps and a sleek new tailpipe finisher. There’s also the optional TRD side graphic. \nInside is the same throwback interior has seemingly been designed with hard core off-roaders in mind. No carpeted floors here, just an easy-to-clean rubber lined floorboard perfect for those muddy days on the trails. Indeed, there’s an abundance of plastics, yet given the vehicle’s rugged purpose, it seems rather fitting. With the car being yellow, I can’t help but be reminded of my old Tonka toy trucks, and the rounded child-safe handles only further the illusion. \nIt’s all propelled by the same 4.0-liter DOHC 24-valve V6 that delivers an impressive 268 PS and 366 Nm of torque. A 5-speed automatic gated shifter delivers power to the rear wheels. There may be no overdrive button but the automatic mode lets you limit the top gear to each of the 5 speeds. A second gearshifter controls the transfer case, letting you shift to 4H and 4L. \nBeing primarily designed for the American market, the FJ Cruiser has a naturally lofty and boat-like feel. Expect lots of dips, squats and rolls when you accelerate, brake and turn. It all results in a very comfortable ride that is not very confidence inspiring when you drive fast. And while it seems soft, the vehicle is still fairly stable at highway speeds, even with the more off-road geared TRD kit. That soft ride pays even more dividends when going off-road, muting much of the harsh terrain. \nEasily the best part of the FJ Cruiser is how it appears to be such a hard-core off-roader yet is incredibly forgiving to newbies. The high ground clearance and steep approach angles ensure you’re not likely to snag on any rocks or ruts. And while the V6 delivers plenty of power, it’s very easy to regulate once in 4H and 4L, being very progressive and hardly returning any unwanted wheel spin. Add to that the standard inclinometer and there’s very little worry about toppling over. \nFinally, the TRD kit does little to diminish the FJ Cruiser’s practicality. It may appear to be a three door, but a set of suicide doors can also open up to grant access to the wheel. The rear door swings out instead of up, and reveals a cavernous cargo area even with the seats up. \nThe only downside to this vehicle is getting it around town. It may appear compact, but it’s incredibly wide. With such a high hood and window line, it’s rather difficult just how close obstacles are to the left side. Behind, the thick pillars obscure much of the view behind, making for some pretty huge blind spots. Toyota has helped address this by equipping the vehicle with a back-up camera display into the rearview mirror. Finally, expect an average consumption of 5-6 km/L in heavy traffic in the city. That will improve significantly in the highway to 10 km/L travelling at 100 km/h average. \nIn spite of its bulky appearance, the soft ride, quirky yet flexible interior, tons of space, and high clearance have helped the FJ appeal to quite a broad demographic. You’ll see it being driven by students, to young professionals to even a few senior citizens. The TRD kit may not appeal to all of them, yet strikes a good balance between keeping it civil yet still highlighting its off-road abilities. It ticks all the prerequisites for those that want to go off-roading yet aren’t as permanent and irreversible as parts like a snorkel or bull bar. \nThat said, the FJ Cruiser can be a great intro vehicle into the joys of off-roading, yet still serve the daily driving duties quite comfortably. Just be prepared for the high fuel consumption. \nNote: Toyota Motor Philippines has not yet released the final and official prices of the TRD accessories for the FJ Cruiser IMAGE GALLERY",

According to the report, Toyota engineers were able to witness the behavior of lithium ions inside the electrodes in real time with the help of techniques developed by a publicly-financed Japanese laboratory as well as four universities based in Japan. With this scientific breakthrough, the automaker would now be able to produce new designs which will prevent the lithium ions from moving unsteadily and crowding in the electrodes. A matter that limits both the vehicle range and battery life today which may lead to overheating. EVs and plug-in hybrids' automakers, including Toyota, are now trying to develop a more advanced battery technology to provide longer range and battery life. In relation to this, the Japanese automaker will also launch the Prius Prime, a new plug-in hybrid vehicle which applies the gasoline-electric hybrid technology.",

      "text": "Toyota brings transportation relief to rural school \nMonday, November 28, 2016 \nSanta Cruz, St Elizabeth — Aberdeen High and Primary School in St Elizabeth recently took the grand prize, a 2017 Toyoto Hiace bus in the Toyota Jamaica Bus Di School competition. \nSchool principal Prim Lewis said the vehicle was badly needed to assist students involved in extra-curricular activities. \n“This bus is needed to take the students to various competitions and activities safely and cost effectively. This helps us to make another important step as we strive to be seen as a school of choice,” said Lewis. \nIn addition to the grand prize for Aberdeen, three other rural schools won cash awards towards school development programmes. \nSt Albans Primary & Infant School in Stanmore, Malvern St Elizabeth won $150,000 for placing second, while Garlogie Primary & Junior High in Banana Ground, Clarendon and Mannings Hill Primary in rural St Andrew each won $100,000 for placing third. \nTom Connor, managing director explained that Toyota Jamaica recognized the importance of having access to safe and reliable transportation as part of the education experience for students across the island. \n“Bus Di School competition is an important programme for us as we are able to make a significant contribution to education which is a major challenge in Jamaica. Our area of expertise is transportation and as such assisting schools with this need was very fitting. Ensuring that our students can commute safely to and from school, also attend competitions, special events, along with other academic programmes are important to us,” he said. \n“There are far too many stories of risky modes of transport that some schools have to rely on, and the unfortunate outcomes that result.” \nSchools across the island were invited to submit their pitch for why they should win the Toyota Jamaica Bus Di School grand prize. The winner was selected by a combination of judging by a panel and a public vote of the schools' proposals on the Toyota Jamaica Facebook page. ADVERTISEMENT",

      "text": "Toyota Gazoo Racing competes in the World Endurance Championship\n\nGazoo Racing motorsport arm has already produced hot models for the Japanese market\n\nToyota is considering transforming its Gazoo Racing motorsport arm into a performance road car brand to rival the likes of BMW M and Mercedes-AMG.\n\nIn addition to co-ordinating Toyota’s international motorsport activities in, for instance, the World Endurance Championship and World Rally Championship, Gazoo Racing fettles road cars that are sold on the Japanese market. It sells limited-edition machines under two banners: GRMN (Gazoo Racing Masters of Nürburgring) and G’s.\n\nKoei Saga, the boss of both Gazoo Racing and Toyota’s powertrain division, said it “is my intention” to increase Gazoo’s presence in road car markets other than Japan to promote the link between its racing and road car activities.\n\nHe said: “In Europe, the challenge is bigger because we have more competitors here, and it is also an issue of cost. However, I am very much working on that so we can have a brand like the M brand.”\n\nThe latest Gazoo-tuned car was the GT86 GRMN. It featured a raft of changes, including modest power and torque increases, tweaked suspension and aerodynamics and a weight reduction through the use of lightweight panels. Limited to 100 units, it quickly sold out.\n\nAnother GT86, the GRMN Sports FR Concept, was showcased at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2012. It had a 2.0-litre engine that was turbocharged and supercharged to 315bhp.\n\nSaga would not comment on whether Gazoo Racing has a role in the project between Toyota and BMW that will spawn the next Supra and Z5.",

A majority of the minivans — 744,000 — were sold in the U.S. \nToyota says the problem happens when the door’s opening is impeded and the motor’s circuit gets overloaded. If the door is unlatched, it could open while the minivan is driving. \nToyota will repair the doors for free. It is still developing a remedy for the problem. \nThe company said it will notify owners about the fix by mid-January. Toyota is recalling more than 700,000 Sienna minivans in the U.S. because of problems with the latch that can cause the sliding doors to open while the car is in motion. 33.019843 -96.698886 ",

      "text": "Toyota Pondering AMG-Rivalling Performance Brand | By Share Toyota could soon have a new performance division tweaking its models in a similar vein to Mercedes-AMG and BMW M. As it stands, the Japanese company already offers a host of performance models from its TRD sub-brand (Toyota Racing Development). However, there’s a possibility that the firm’s Gazoo Racing motorsport arm will be expanded into an even more comprehensive tuning arm. Gazoo Racing already sells modified Toyota models in Japan and handles the brand’s activities in the World Rally Champion and World Endurance Championship and according to Autocar , is looking to extend its road car brand. In an interview, Gazoo Racing and Toyota’s powertrain division boss, Koei Saga, said that he wants to see Gazoo expand its road presence outside of Japan, potentially turning the motorsport division into a company like BMW M.“In Europe, the challenge is bigger because we have more competitors here, and it is also an issue of cost. However, I am very much working on that so we can have a brand like the M brand,” Saga said/ It isn’t known if top executives at Toyota are in favor of the plan and Saga refused to comment about Gazoo Racing’s potential involvement in the next-generation Toyota Supra and BMW Z5.

      "text": "Toyota brings transportation relief to rural school \nMonday, November 28, 2016 \nSanta Cruz, St Elizabeth — Aberdeen High and Primary School in St Elizabeth recently took the grand prize, a 2017 Toyoto Hiace bus in the Toyota Jamaica Bus Di School competition. \nSchool principal Prim Lewis said the vehicle was badly needed to assist students involved in extra-curricular activities. \n“This bus is needed to take the students to various competitions and activities safely and cost effectively. This helps us to make another important step as we strive to be seen as a school of choice,” said Lewis. \nIn addition to the grand prize for Aberdeen, three other rural schools won cash awards towards school development programmes. \nSt Albans Primary & Infant School in Stanmore, Malvern St Elizabeth won $150,000 for placing second, while Garlogie Primary & Junior High in Banana Ground, Clarendon and Mannings Hill Primary in rural St Andrew each won $100,000 for placing third. \nTom Connor, managing director explained that Toyota Jamaica recognized the importance of having access to safe and reliable transportation as part of the education experience for students across the island. \n“Bus Di School competition is an important programme for us as we are able to make a significant contribution to education which is a major challenge in Jamaica. Our area of expertise is transportation and as such assisting schools with this need was very fitting. Ensuring that our students can commute safely to and from school, also attend competitions, special events, along with other academic programmes are important to us,” he said. \n“There are far too many stories of risky modes of transport that some schools have to rely on, and the unfortunate outcomes that result.” \nSchools across the island were invited to submit their pitch for why they should win the Toyota Jamaica Bus Di School grand prize. The winner was selected by a combination of judging by a panel and a public vote of the schools' proposals on the Toyota Jamaica Facebook page. ADVERTISEMENT",

      "text": "Measuring Battery Cell Degradation: An Interview with Josh Cirillo \nReuters quotes Toyota battery technology researcher Hisao Yamashige saying that there is “a clear need” to improve the lithium-ion battery technology as the generally accepted standard battery type for electric cars. The performance of this battery type needs improvement, Yamashige said. \nUsing technologies developed in collaboration with a Japanese publicly financed laboratory and four universities, Toyota engineers were able to better monitor in real time how lithium ions moved inside the battery’s electrodes, Yamashige said. This finding should trigger new designs that prevent lithium ions from moving unevenly between the electrodes and “bunching up” within them – an effect that in current designs limits battery life and driving range. In addition, this effect can cause overheating, the researcher explainded. \nActually, improving the battery is the pivotal issue for the acceptance of electric vehicles and their manufacturers including Toyota. The Japanese carmaker is currently planning to roll out an all-electric car by 2020.",

      "text": "2 mins ago by Eric Loveday 0 Comments Toyota Prius Prime CU-ICAR / Toyota uBox concept \nA team of battery engineers over at Toyota say that they’ve made a breakthrough in battery tech that will allow the automaker to safely pursue rivals in the long-range battery-electric segment. \nQuoting Reuters: \n“Engineers at Toyota Motor Corp say they have tamed volatile lithium-ion battery technology, and can now safely pack more power at no significant extra cost, giving the Japanese automaker the option to enter the growing all-electric car market.” \n“While rivals including Tesla Motors and Nissan Motor Co began adopting lithium-ion battery technology nearly a decade ago, Toyota has largely held back due to concerns over cost, size and safety.” \nIn our eyes, batteries from rivals have long been safe, but apparently Toyota is taking it a step further on the safety front. \nKoji Toyoshima, chief engineer for the Prius, stated: \n“It’s a tall order to develop a lithium-ion car battery which can perform reliably and safely for 10 years, or over hundreds of thousands of kilometers.” \n“We have double braced and triple braced our battery pack to make sure they’re fail-safe … It’s all about safety, safety, safety.” \nHiroaki Takeuchi, senior Toyota development engineer, adds: \n“Our control system can identify even slight signs of a potential short-circuit in individual cells, and will either prevent it from spreading or shut down the entire battery.” \nToyota is actively working with Panasonic to develop batteries for a yet-unknown long-range electric car from the Japanese automaker. Apparently, the cells under development are unique to Toyota though. \nQuoting Reuters: \n“Toyota has also been able to shrink the size of each cell, for example, closing the distance between the anode and cathode, where active ions travel when charging and discharging.” \n“This has doubled battery capacity to around 8.8 kilowatt hours, while only increasing the battery pack size by around two-thirds and its weight by a half.” \nToyota still sees the fuel-cell vehicle as part of the future, but that future hasn’t come to fruition yet and, as such, the automaker will continue down the hybrid, plug-in hybrid and now all-electric path in the near future. As Prius chief engineer Toyoshima states: \n“Developing lithium-ion batteries for both hybrids and plug-ins will enable us to also produce all-  future. It makes sense to have a range of batteries to suit different powertrains.”",

      "title": "Toyota's Gazoo Racing brand could target BMW M and Mercedes-AMG",
      "text": "By : Graham King , Editor The factory race team's head says a range of performance road cars is being planned. \nA couple of years ago, Toyota brought its various factory racing programs together under the Toyota Gazoo Racing banner. Like BMW’s M Division and AMG, Toyota is reportedly considering launching a range of performance road cars under the Gazoo brand to rival the aforementioned Germans. \nGazoo Racing coordinates Toyota’s German-based World Endurance Championship program, its Finnish-based World Rally Championship team , and the South African-based Dakar Rally outfit , as well as running its own experimental cars in the Nurburgring 24 Hours. Read also: Gazoo Racing Toyota 86 and Lexus LFA take class victories at Nürburgring \nOn top of that, it also sells limited numbers of tuned GRMN (Gazoo Racing Masters of Nurburgring) and G’s models in Japan - not to be confused with the TRD (Toyota Racing Developments) models sold elsewhere in the world. \nSpeaking to Autocar , Gazoo Racing head Koei Saga said it “is my intention” to branch out into road cars, drawing a link between that side of the Toyota business and its racing activities. \nSaga added: “In Europe, the challenge is bigger because we have more competitors here, and it is also an issue of cost. However, I am very much working on that so we can have a brand like the [BMW] M brand.” \nSaga would not comment on whether or not Gazoo has any involvement in the development of the upcoming Supra. \nToyota first used the Gazoo name in the mid-1990s for an innovative online used car search tool, one of the first to feature images - indeed, Gazoo derives from the Japanese word “gazo”, which means “image”. The word has since evolved to mean “garage” in Toyota-speak. \nGRMN editions have included a lighter, more powerful GT86 coupe , a Mark X sedan with a carbon roof , and a turbocharged Vitz/Yaris . Sadly, the bonkers, 128 horsepower (95 kilowatts), supercharged iQ never made it to production. \nMost of Toyota's road cars aren't exactly known for being exciting, but do you think a new performance brand could turn that image around?

      "title": "Toyota Hopes C-HR Crossover Will Help Re-Balance US Portfolio",
      "text": "Toyota Hopes C-HR Crossover Will Help Re-Balance US Portfolio | By Share Toyota is currently looking to adjust its car-truck sales ratio in the US to 60-40 in favor of light trucks, as opposed to the roughly 50-50 split it has now. Its newest weapon for this push is of course the sporty-looking C-HR crossover, which made its US debut at the LA Auto Show earlier this month. The C-HR currently fills a big hole in the Japanese automaker's lineup, and word around the industry has it that it's likely to make a big splash come spring time, as reported by Autonews . \"It's not always that Toyota has a product that will stand out in the market,\" said Bill Fay, Toyota General Manager. \"But we're optimistic based on the feedback we've gotten so far.\" Once out, the C-HR crossover will compete against rivals such as the Chevy Trax, Nissan Juke, Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3. How well it does against these other models will by critical seen as how small crossovers are now the entry point to many brands when it comes to young new-vehicle buyers looking to trade up from small cars, but also to people downsizing from larger cars and utility vehicles. \"I'm very optimistic for 2017, because we'll have a better supply of RAV and Highlander,\" added Fay. \"We'll launch this beautiful C-HR and will be in a much better position to meet customer demand on the sport-utility side of things.\" While the automaker still plans on selling more pickup trucks in 2017, its expansion of the Tacoma plant in Tijuana won't happen until late next year or even early 2018 - meaning shortages will continue. Still, Fay has confirmed that Toyota shouldn't struggle with adjusting their production from sedans to light trucks seen as how its North American plants have been stretched to capacity already. \"We've been able to move the production around in a way that we haven't needed to lay anyone off, which is good.\" This is of course in contrast to GM announcing it would cut over 2,000 factory jobs due to slowing demand for small cars.

(Bloomberg via Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, November 28, 2016, 11:43 AM \nThe holiday weekend is over, you’re back to work and the Daily Drive-Thru is too. \nWe’ve got news about electric cars, biofuels, Fidel Castro’s death and more in today’s edition, so before you bust out that leftover-turkey sandwich, feast your eyes on this juicy round-up of automotive news. \nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. ‘LIKE’ US HERE. Tesla to roll out Enhanced Autopilot Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed on Twitter that his company will launch its Enhanced Autopilot system next month. (Bloomberg via Getty Images) \nTesla will activate its Enhanced Autopilot system next month, enabling new versions of its Model S to drive themselves in parking lots and offer additional driver assistance during non-freeway driving. Tesla Motors Chief Executive Elon Musk took to Twitter this weekend to announce the Autopilot 8.1 update would go live in three weeks. \nWhile previous iterations of the Model S and Model X offered steering assistance during Autopilot driving, they will never achieve full autonomy. Optional radars and cameras available in the new Model S will empower Autosteer+, which will add steering assistance to surface road driving, and a Seek mode, which will enable the car to search for a parking spot on its own and go to its driver when summoned. First Pictures: 2018 Toyota C-HR \nNext year the world’s number 1 automaker will adjust its production ratio to better suit U.S. sensibilities. Toyota will adjust its U.S. production portfolio to skew slightly more toward light trucks in an effort to match its competitors. \nToyota, which currently has an even 50-50 split of cars and trucks for sale in the U.S., will shift that ratio to about 60-40 in favor of trucks, an effort that should benefit from the introduction of the all-new C-HR crossover. \nThe Japan-based company will also ramp up production of the RAV4 compact crossover and the Highlander three-row SUV. An expansion plan is in the works for Toyota’s Tacoma production plant in Tijuana, Mexico, but that isn’t expected to be online until late 2017 or early 2018. \nSource: Automotive News Daimler to invest $11 billion in electric cars The hybrid-electric IAA concept from Mercedes-Benz, which debuted last September at the Frankfort Motor Show, was featured at CES 2016, in part because of its EV battery that ranges up to 40 miles. (NewspressUSA) \nDaimler will invest 10 billion euros, or roughly $11 billion, into the research and development of 10 electric-powered vehicles by 2025. Though Daimler has lagged behind some of its competitors in the EV market, the surging popularity of Tesla and Audi’s “Dieselgate”-inspired shift to battery power have spurred the luxury automaker to make the move. \nA spokesman for the company said three of the vehicles will be released under the Smart brand, and they will have single-charge driving ranges of more than 400 miles. Last week Daimler said it would stay committed to selling diesel engines in the U.S.—a common means for automakers to improve fleet-wide fuel economy—but this investment indicates that the German company is looking to broaden its gasoline-free offerings. \nSource: Reuters Dealer offers $15k off to celebrate Castro death A Miami car dealer offered discounts of up to $15,000 on various new models, including the 2016 Chevrolet Corvette. (Chevrolet) \nThe death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro was met largely with celebration among Cuban-Americans this past weekend. One car dealership owner in Florida was so moved by the dictator’s death that he extended a rather generous offer to his customers: a $15,000 discount. \nWhat better way is there to commemorate the death of a long-time communist dictator than by slashing prices on the weekend after Black Friday? While $15,000 was the high-water mark at Bomnin Chevrolet in Miami, the discounts varied depending on the vehicle and its suggested retail price. Included in the offer were some Corvettes, Silverado trucks along with Tahoe and Suburban SUVs. The sale ended at the close of business last night. \nArnaldo Bomnin, owner of the South Florida Chevy dealership, fled Cuba at the age of 26, working as a farmer and landscaper before becoming a car salesman and, eventually, owning his own dealership. He said he hopes Castro’s death will lead to more opportunities for his fellow countrymen to find success without having to leave their island nation. Trump interests at odds in fuel debate The Obama administration signed off on higher ethanol blend requirements for U.S. gasoline. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) \nU.S. biofuel targets are on track to reach record highs the next year after the Obama Administration signed off on its final plan for the Renewable Fuel Standard program. This move has also set the table for an internal conflict for President-elect Donald Trump. \nTotal renewable fuel volume, which includes ethanol blended into conventional fuels as well as biomass-based diesel, cellulosic biofuel and other types of fuel, will increase by 1.2 billion gallons next year, pitting Trump between a rock and hard place known otherwise as Big Corn and Big Oil. On the campaign trail, Trump ran on promises to both embolden the ethanol programs that benefit Midwestern corn growers and strip away regulations on the oil industry. As president, he will have to weigh these two interests against one another. \nStarted by President George W. Bush, the Renewable Fuel Standard program was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Opponents, including the oil industry and business collectives, such as the National Council of Chain Restaurants, argue that requirement makes fuel more expensive, thus increasing prices for consumers, not only at the pump but also on any good shipped by truck. \nSources: Reuters , Farm & Dairy \nCheck the Daily Drive-Thru every weekday morning to get the latest on the most important news and trends in the automotive world. \nYou can find Friday’s installment of the Drive-Thru here and view the rest of our archives here . \nGot a news tip or a comment?

      "text": "Monday, Nov 28th, 2016 @ 9:23 am Toyota's car/truck mix is currently running at an even 50/50 split, but the Japanese automaker is hoping to skew that ratio in favor of light trucks during the 2017 calendar year.Toyota has traditionally been a car-heavy manufacturer, but the company will adjust its production mix 60/40 in favor of light trucks to keep up with market demands. Toyota will lean on its all-new C-HR compact crossover to spearhead that transition. Unveiled at this year's Los Angeles auto show, Toyota is already expecting big things from the little crossover.\"It's not always that Toyota has a product that will stand out in the market,\" Bill Fay, general manager of the Toyota division, told Automotive News , \"but we're optimistic based on the feedback we've gotten so far.\" The C-HR will compete in the popular compact crossover segment against vehicles like the Honda HR-V , Mazda CX-3 and Nissan Juke .Toyota will also boost production of its RAV4 and Highlander crossover in 2017 to keep up with demand. Supplies of those vehicles have been tight in recent months.\"I'm very optimistic for 2017, because we'll have a better supply of RAV and Highlander,\" Fay said. \"We'll launch this beautiful C-HR and will be in a much better position to meet customer demand on the sport-utility side of things.\" Toyota's truck offerings, the Tacoma mid-size and Tundra full-size, continue to sell at a good clip, but both nameplates will be production constrained in 2017. The factories that make the Tacoma and Tundra are already running at full speed, and a plant upgrade won't come on line until late 2017 at the earliest. \n ",

      "text": "Volvo S90 / V90 Of the seven finalists, all but two are European models (the Nissan Micra and Toyota C-HR), and just one marque (Volvo) has never won the award. To make things more interesting, neither an American or Korean marque made the final cut, nor any EV or hybrid models . The new Alfa Romeo Giulia with its handsome styling and advanced Giorgio platform seems like an early front-runner. But the new Volvo S90 and V90 sedan and wagon shouldn’t be discounted, nor the new tech-heavy Nissan Micra. The Toyota C-HR meanwhile is brand new for the 2017 model year. The award, which has been honoring vehicles and marques since 1964, was first given to the Rover 2000, and has led to 52 others winners since then. Fiat is the most decorated manufacturer in the award’s 52-year history, taking home nine wins with cars like the 124, 128, and 500, while Renault, Ford, and Opel follow close behind with six and five wins respectively. The winner will be announced at the Geneva Motor Show on March 6, 2017, with each of the 58 jury members dividing 25 points among at least five of the candidates. Last year’s award was given to the new Opel Astra, while 2015 saw the VW Passat, 2014 saw the Peugeot 308, and in 2013, the VW Golf took home the award. Question is, which one would you choose?

Toyota Supra Mule Now Wears More FT-1 Styling Cues When we first saw prototypes for the upcoming Toyota Supra , the cars bore little resemblance to the FT-1 concept of 2014 . Now, the camo is coming off and the sports car jointly developed by Toyota and BMW is starting to look more like that radically sculpted show car.\nResearch toyota 86 See All Model Years See Pricing These latest shots reveal a more production-ready front fascia, with intake openings that have a similar shape to those of the FT-1. This car also has an unsightly bump on its nose, which could be hiding the Formula 1-inspired beak of the concept. It's difficult now to see how that design element would mesh with the rest of the car's design, but maybe it'll all come together once the camo comes off.\n© Motor Trend Staff Toyota Supra prototype spied rear end The FT-1 cues don't stop at the front. In back, we see slender taillights and a molded ducktail spoiler that could almost be lifted straight off the FT-1. We don't have the diffuser or F1-style third brake light, but the car is definitely starting to look more like the FT-1 concept from behind.\nAs we previously reported, the Toyota Supra will share its platform with the BMW Z5, and both cars are expected to be built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria . Engine options are unknown, but six-cylinder and hybrid drivetrains have been rumored.\n© Motor Trend Staff Toyota Supra prototype spied front three quarter 02 Check out the latest Toyota Supra spy shots in the gallery below and tell us if you think the car will be a worthy successor to the Japanese supercar icon.\nPhoto Source: KGP Photography\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Your next Toyota might also be your personal trainer A new Toyota patent suggests future cars may fat-shame you into healthy living. Liam Norris, Getty Images \nI wonder if there will be a setting for more, um, aggressive suggestions. \"Get to walking or end up on a TLC show.\" Photo by Freepatentsonline screengrab \nDriving is a great way to stave off fitness. But before we all get too fat to fit into cars, Toyota 's whipped up a system that allows our cars to help us stay healthy. \nOne of Toyota's most recent published patents is all about putting health goals inside the vehicle. A user can input a predetermined health goal into the car, and it will suggest ways to meet that goal -- for example, parking farther away from a destination and completing the last leg on foot. \nThe system uses both a car and a smartphone. A person can use an app to set a health goal, and that goal can be checked against the car's navigation destination. If it's possible to alter the route slightly to suggest a method of meeting that health goal, provided it hasn't already been met, the car will offer up suggestions for doing so. Since it's just a suggestion, a user that's feeling particularly lazy has no obligation to actually complete that goal. \nWith all the attention being paid to Fitbits and other fitness-oriented wearables , this seems like a natural way to adapt that lifestyle angle into the car-ownership experience. Not everyone has the option of walking from home to work, but if an owner can fit in a bit of exercise along the way, it could save both time and effort at other points in the day. \nOf course, there's no guarantee that this will ever reach production. Automakers apply for and receive patents all the time, even though there might be zero intent to actually put it in cars. It's simply insurance that prevents other automakers from stealing and implementing the idea first. In the future, should it seem like a good idea, Toyota could then make moves to actually put the system in its vehicles. Share your voice",

But you'll have to wait about a year. \nCooper and Cohen trade gossip, stories and more during AC2 Live: Deep Talk and Shallow Lies. It's an unscripted, interactive show that touches on news, pop culture and, yes, the \"Real Housewives\" franchise. \nThe Houston show is Dec. 2, 2017 at Smart Financial Centre in Sugar Land. That's next year. Tickets go on sale July 14, 2017. \nCNN's Cooper and Bravo's Cohen will interview each other and take questions from the audience. Both men are wildly popular with a wide swath of fans, so expect this one to sell out quickly. \nThe show isn't on the venue's website but is listed on the official tour site and on Pollstar.

      "text": "Interview: Katsuya Inoue, 2017 Toyota Highlander Project Manager Safety First For Toyota’s Midsize Crossover Gary Witzenburg –   1 Photos Toyota Highlander project manager Katsuya Inoue has worked at Toyota Motor Corporation since graduating from the University of Tokyo in 2002 with a master's degree in mechanical engineering. Born in Tokyo and now living in Kyoto, Japan, he loved playing with remote-control cars as a child and always dreamed of working in the auto industry. His undergraduate degree, also from the University of Tokyo, is also in mechanical engineering. Mr. Inoue started in Toyota's Body Engineering Division, and then moved to its Advanced Computer-Aided Engineer Division in 2003 as a simulation engineer working on crash safety, including pedestrian crash safety. He eventually worked up to lead simulation engineering and worked on a variety of global and home-market vehicles, including the Toyota Auris, Porte, GS, and Crown. In 2014, he was promoted to Product Planning as a project manager, essentially \"right-hand man\" to the vehicle chief engineer. Through an interpreter, we interviewed Mr. Inoue by phone about his most recent project, the more powerful, more fuel-efficient, and significantly updated ’17 Toyota Highlander. Truck Trend: What is your product philosophy? Katsuya Inoue: My first priority is customer focus—what kind of car our target customer is looking for. Second, how can we build that car to meet Toyota engineering standards for its target markets? And [my product philosophy] has been shaped by my early experience in crash safety simulation engineering. If the car crashes, what happens to the occupants? TT: What were the most difficult challenges in meeting those priorities? KI: This ’17 Highlander is a minor model change, not a total model change, but the powertrain—the engine and transmission—has completely changed from ’16. So it was a huge task to apply this new engine and transmission to this new Highlander. Because it was a minor model change, the scale was much different from a major model change, so it was a very big challenge to effectively apply those changes within the minor model change level while achieving perfect conditions for the new powertrain to make sure we could meet customer expectations. We wanted the media, and especially the customers, to really feel the differences [we achieved] from changing the powertrain. TT: Most impressively, it delivers both improved performance, with more power and torque, and improved efficiency. How was that achieved? KI: One is the engine. We used a direct injection system for more power and more fuel economy. Second is the eight-speed direct-shift automatic transmission, which also gives us more feeling of power and more efficiency. TT: You added direct fuel injection but retained port injection as well. Is that combination of port and direct injection working together the primary factor enabling you to achieve both performance and fuel efficiency improvements? KI: Yes. Also, using the best direct-shift eight-speed automatic transmission helps us achieve more power and efficiency compared to the ’16 model. Both are helping each other. TT: While your team was developing the new gas-engine powertrain, it was also doing an improved hybrid system. That must have added to the challenge. KI: Yes, because both the engine and the transmission were significantly changed for both, so it was not easy. The hybrids use [much of] the same powertrain as the gas versions, and their efficiency is even better. They also have a much nicer sound inside the cabin, especially during hard acceleration, compared to previous Highlander Hybrids. And we have expanded the grades for the hybrid, so now LE and XLE grades are available to expand its affordability for more customers. TT: Any other features you would like to mention? KI: The Toyota Safety Sense System is standard on every grade for ’17, from LE up through Platinum. Also the style. We have introduced the all-new SE grade with the different front grille design and a lot of other enhanced styling elements. By Gary Witzenburg",

      "text": "Comradery and Adventure Fuel The Overlanding Movement A group of Toyota owners give us a glimpse into the Overlanding lifestyle. twitter.com/evanyates_ instagram.com/evan__yates \nThe beauty of Overlanding is the lack of boundaries, definitions or absolutes. It’s not an exclusive club that requires a special handshake, snobby wave or even a particular vehicle for that matter. If you’re exploring the outdoors with your rig (and it’s equipped properly for the trip), you’re accepted – no questions asked. This unique combination of freedom and inclusion has created a community in which comradery is key and the sharing of information, tips and appreciation is paramount. \nAlong with Expedition Georgia , I recently spent some time with the No Limits Overland crew. This group of Toyota truck enthusiasts banded together to form a club of sorts that would ride together and help each other when in need. For fun, I brought a Nissan Titan 4x4 because that’s the press truck I was driving that week. ( Read the review here ). Expedition Georgia \nThe first rendezvous point was a Home Depot parking lot in Blairsville, GA. All the trucks present varied considerably from each other in age and equipment but this diversity didn’t matter. The common bond was everyone was there to do the same thing and made the most out of what they had. From a first-generation Tacoma regular cab to a 2017 Tacoma TRD Pro , all were from the same tribe. \n\nAfter a pit stop at Chick-Fil-A, we were en route to the first leg of our excursion. Even though there are plenty of trails, mountains and woods in North Georgia, locating a passable path can be difficult. The hearsay information isn’t always current and there’s no website to confirm current conditions. Sometimes, you just have to wing it. Expedition Georgia \n@tcaldwell92 \nEven though we spent the first hour chasing a trail that we ultimately couldn’t access, there was still plenty of fun had being a part of the Tacoma convoy. I can’t iterate this enough; it’s about the journey and sometimes the pre-journey more than the destination. It was enjoyable to caravan through the small town with a fleet of heavily-equipped Tacomas. The looks and reactions from the locals were that of awe, amazement and even a bit of confusion. The parade of Toyotas looked more like an Army convoy headed to battle than anything. @josh_cook13 @bray1197 \nThe next stop was Bell Mountain, which was previously considered one of the most challenging trails in Georgia. However, the trail and landing at the summit have been paved by the county so it’s become a bit of a tourist attraction today. Expedition Georgia \nTypically, the view is amazing from atop Bell Mountain as you can see for miles but because of raging forest fires in North Carolina and Georgia, the view was deduced to an ominous, smoky haze. \n@tacoma_brad90 \nYearning to get off-pavement, the next destination was Charlie’s Creek, a certainly challenging and amusing trail in its own right. We began our ascension as the sun struggled to break through the thick smoke cover. The trail was full of loose, dry dirt, rocks and other obstacles. Enough to have a little fun with but nothing that would get you in trouble. \nUnfortunately, after a couple miles the crew ran into another road block. Presumably, the forest fires had deemed this particular section of mountain unsafe and some of the experts that were with us stated that if this trail was shut down, it was must have been serious. \nSquad Goals.",

      "text": "Subaru, Toyota And Mazda Increasing EV Development | By Share Japanese automakers Subaru, Mazda and Toyota are all ramping up the development of electric vehicles despite their previous hesitations about such models. As recently announced, Toyota , which has long pursued hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, is turning its attention towards electric models, already preparing to launch an in-house venture company to develop them. Mazda meanwhile plans to launch its first EV in 2019 while Subaru will do the same in 2021. Speaking with Automotive News , the chief executive of Subaru’s parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries, Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said the industry is shifting to become more focused on EVs than ever before.“The overall industry is now shifting its electrification focus toward EVs. We are in the age where we cannot just go on launching EVs only as regulation compliance cars,” he said. Compared to rival firms, Toyota, Subaru and Mazda have been either resistant or slow to introduce electrified models. Up until recently, Subaru only offered one hybrid model, based around the XV Crossover , but dumped it for the 2017 model year. Similarly, Mazda only sells a hybrid Mazda3 in Japan. As Toyota owns a stake in Fuji Heavy Industries and has an alliance with Mazda, Subaru and Mazda are expected to collaborate with the world’s largest automaker to accelerate the development of their respective EVs.

Electric Vehicles \nToyota hopes that you like cheesy commercials, because they've released a cluster of them. This snippet promotes the Prius Prime's pre-collision system, but it's hardly objective -- and that's okay. A little bit of humor never hurt anyone. The new bundle of promos join a host of previous features starring famous internet personalities like Rhett and Link, adding a little bit of light-heartedness to the serious and sensible lineup.",

      "text": "Email \nPLANO, Texas — Toyota recently announced a safety recall of approximately 744,000 Sienna minivans due to a sliding door malfunction that could put passengers in danger, according to a news release. \nThe recall affects Sienna models between 2011 and 2016. In certain vans, there is a possibility that the sliding door motor circuit can become overloaded, which means doors can open while the vans are being driven. If a sliding door motor is impeded and overloaded, and the door’s latch is in an unlatched position, that means the doors could open up, putting passengers inside the vans in danger. \nToyota is currently developing a solution for the issue and said owners of all affected vans will be notified by mail in January. \nCheck your vehicle’s status by visiting the Toyota recall site or call a Toyota rep at 1-800-331-4331 for additional questions. 33.019843 -96.698886 ",

      "text": "Toyota's eco-friendly saviour of the planet, the Prius, will kick off its second innings in India with the onset of the new year. Sources close to the Japanese automaker have confirmed a probable launch in the second week of January. The hybrid saloon is a monumental cornerstone in Toyota's journey of being among the world leaders in automobile technology.\nIndia got its first taste of the Prius in 2010, when the hybrid was first unveiled to the masses at the Delhi Auto Expo. Over the years, it had limited takers, thanks to its high sticker price. Dial in the fact that our market isn't as environmentally savvy as a few in the west, and you know the Prius isn't something that will fly off the shelves in India.\nTrivia: The Prius had an exorbitant price tag even in 2010. Ex-showroom prices started at Rs 26.5 lakh! \nToyota isn't hoping it will be a sales blockbuster either. The Prius will be a halo product for the Japanese brand, serving as a reminder of their technological prowess. It draws power from a 1.8-litre petrol motor paired with an electric powerhouse, that pump out 121PS of power put together. The party trick for the Prius has always been fuel-efficiency; which should be around 25kmpl for the new generation.\nWe do not expect the price to be anything close to what we would call affordable, and it is safe to assume an ex-showroom price of around Rs 30 lakh after accounting for the taxes and duties that are levied on fully imported cars. That said, what you get for the price, is the world's best-selling hybrid saloon that is in its best avatar yet.\nThe positioning of the Prius keeps it free from competition, at least in India. The prices are likely to overlap with popular D2 segment sedans such as the Skoda Superb and its own sibling - the Toyota Camry Hybrid . Would you choose the Prius over a conventional big sedan? Let us know through the comments below!\nRead More on: Prius price \nRead full article on cardekho.com",

      "text": "Lexus will finally be setting up shop officially in India. The luxury division of Toyota is likely to launch its cars in the first quarter of 2017 and the deliveries will begin soon after as the cars are being imported as CBUs. However, the carmaker has started offering test drives to potential customers and is accepting bookings as well. Initially, two SUVs – the RX450h and LX450d – and one sedan, the ES300h, will be launched in the country. Although the automaker wants to assemble them locally in future, for now, the cars will be directly imported from Japan. Let's check out what the upcoming cars have to offer.\n\nLexus RX450h \nThe RX450h, the ‘h’ in whose name stands for ‘hybrid’, is one of the most popular Lexuses in the international market. This SUV accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the total sales of Lexus worldwide. Globally, it competes with the likes of the BMW X3 and Audi Q5. However, since it is being imported as a CBU, it will be priced much higher than its rivals. It is likely to have a price tag of around Rs 1 crore. Powered by a 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine along with three electric motors, the total combined output of the SUV is 308PS. The AWD (all-wheel drive) drivetrain consists of an e-CVT gearbox. However, there isn't any mechanical link between the two Axles.\n\nLexus LX450d \nLexus will also introduce its mighty flagship SUV – the LX450d – in the country. Based on the Toyota Land Cruiser, it is offered with two engine options in the international market. Here, the diesel variant is likely to be launched first, followed by the petrol sometime later. The diesel is powered by a 4.5-litre V8 engine which produces 273PS and a massive 650Nm of torque and is coupled to a six-speed automatic gearbox, while the petrol variant has a 5.7-litre V8 engine under the hood which produces 388PS and 546Nm of torque and is coupled to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The LX competes with other flagship SUVs like Range Rover and Audi Q7, and is expected to be priced around Rs 2 crore.\nLexus ES300h \nThe ES300h will probably be the most affordable offering from Lexus in the country. It is based on the Toyota Camry and will be offered in a hybrid avatar, like the RX450h. The luxury sedan is powered by a 2.5-litre petrol engine, assisted by an electric motor, and is mated to a CVT gearbox. The sedan mainly focuses on comfort rather than performance and would mostly appeal to the chauffeur-driven ones in cities. Globally, it competes with the likes of the BMW 5-series and Audi A6. However, since it’s a direct import, it is likely to be priced around Rs 75 lakh, which is higher than its rivals.\n\nLexus cars are widely popular in the luxury car market for their reliability. In spite of being a young brand in this segment, they have a good following. However, being direct imports, they are priced much higher than their rivals and aren't a value-for-money deal. However, the hybrid drivetrains in RX and ES set them apart in their segments and will definitely attract a lot of attention.\nRead full article on cardekho.com",

      "text": "Spied! Toyota Supra Mule Now Wears More FT-1 Styling Cues Japanese supercar successor takes shape Alex Nishimoto – SHARE View Photo Gallery | 14 Photos When we first saw prototypes for the upcoming Toyota Supra , the cars bore little resemblance to the FT-1 concept of 2014 . Now, the camo is coming off and the sports car jointly developed by Toyota and BMW is starting to look more like that radically sculpted show car. These latest shots reveal a more production-ready front fascia, with intake openings that have a similar shape to those of the FT-1. This car also has an unsightly bump on its nose, which could be hiding the Formula 1-inspired beak of the concept. It's difficult now to see how that design element would mesh with the rest of the car's design, but maybe it'll all come together once the camo comes off. Photo 2/14 | Toyota Supra prototype spied rear end The FT-1 cues don't stop at the front. In back, we see slender taillights and a molded ducktail spoiler that could almost be lifted straight off the FT-1. We don't have the diffuser or F1-style third brake light, but the car is definitely starting to look more like the FT-1 concept from behind. As we previously reported, the Toyota Supra will share its platform with the BMW Z5, and both cars are expected to be built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria . Engine options are unknown, but six-cylinder and hybrid drivetrains have been rumored. Check out the latest Toyota Supra spy shots in the gallery below and tell us if you think the car will be a worthy successor to the Japanese supercar icon. Photo Source: KGP Photography",

      "text": "To showcase its prowess in alternative fuel technology, Toyota also showcased the new Prius at the venue. On November 23, along with the Indian Government, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) organised a ‘Toyota Caravan’ at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi. The event, organised by the Japanese Automaker, included a number of interactive sessions between government officials, engineering experts from Toyota Motor Corporation Japan, Toyota Motor Asia Pacific, Singapore and the senior management of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM). The sessions were focused on making the environment clean and safe through safe and eco-friendly technology.\nTo showcase its prowess in alternative fuel technology, Toyota also showcased the new Prius at the venue. Undoubtedly, the carmaker has been among the pioneers who used hybrid technology successfully in their cars. The globally acclaimed and highly successful Prius signifies that, if neatly designed and efficiently powered, even hybrid vehicles can be a grand success.\nAt the event, subjects like ‘Commitment to Safety with Technology & Education’ and ‘Creating a Clean & Sustainable future through environment friendly technologies’ were discussed by senior officials from the state and central government, along with top bosses from TKM.\nGirish Shankar, secretary, Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India, said, “We appreciate Toyota Kirloskar Motor for adopting an encompassing approach towards its pursuit to educate and spread the importance of adopting safer & eco-friendly technology. This platform has helped to reflect, share knowledge and enhance understanding on the various challenges with regard to road safety and the need for achieving a sustained environment.”\nSpeaking on the occasion, Akito Tachibana, managing director, TKM, said, “Toyota believes that we have to play a greater role than just manufacturing world class cars. We are here to solve the bigger issues in the society leveraging our technology and innovation. We aim to offer the newest technology towards creating a sustainable earth for the next generation. Toyota takes the ownership in building a safer, cleaner & greener world for our children.”\n‘Toyota Caravan’ will be held in different parts of the country, with the next seminar scheduled to take place in Jaipur on November 26, 2016.\nSource: CarDekho.com",

Photo: Kai Feng, Associated Press Image 31 of 31 '80s pop star Rick Astley is coming to Houston 1 / 31 \nYou're not being Rickrolled. Or are you? \nRick Astley is back on tour and coming to Houston. \nThe English singer performs Jan. 31 at Warehouse Live. Tickets are $30 and go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday . This is his first U.S. tour in almost 30 years. \nPREMIERE: Spice Girls reunite for new single \nAstley was a pop force in the late '80s, reaching No. 1 on the U.S. charts with \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" and \"Together Forever.\" His deep, rich baritone was immediately recognizable. He also scored top 10 hits with \"It Would Take A Strong Strong Man,\" \"She Wants to Dance With Me\" and \"Cry for Help.\" \nAstley released a new album, \"50,\" earlier this year that topped the U.K. charts. The title refers to his age. \nRickrolling turned Astley into an internet meme a few years ago. Links to other videos and sources were replaced with the clip for Astley's signature hit \"Never Gonna Give You Up.\"",

      "text": "Toyota Supra Mule Spied Wearing FT-1 Styling Cues Japanese supercar successor takes shape By: Alex Nishimoto November 28, 2016 \nW hen we first saw prototypes for the upcoming Toyota Supra , the cars bore little resemblance to the FT-1 concept of 2014 . Now, the camo is coming off and the sports car jointly developed by Toyota and BMW is starting to look more like that radically sculpted show car. \nThese latest shots reveal a more production-ready front fascia, with intake openings that have a similar shape to those of the FT-1. This car also has an unsightly bump on its nose, which could be hiding the Formula 1-inspired beak of the concept. It’s difficult now to see how that design element would mesh with the rest of the car’s design, but maybe it’ll all come together once the camo comes off. \nThe FT-1 cues don’t stop at the front. In back, we see slender taillights and a molded ducktail spoiler that could almost be lifted straight off the FT-1. We don’t have the diffuser or F1-style third brake light, but the car is definitely starting to look more like the FT-1 concept from behind. \nAs we previously reported, the Toyota Supra will share its platform with the BMW Z5, and both cars are expected to be built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria . Engine options are unknown, but six-cylinder and hybrid drivetrains have been rumored. \nCheck out the latest Toyota Supra spy shots in the gallery below and tell us if you think the car will be a worthy successor to the Japanese supercar icon. \nPhoto Source: KGP Photography",

      "text": "Monday, Nov 28th, 2016 @ 3:39 pm Toyota's upcoming Supra sports car has been spotted undergoing shakedown testing in Europe with a little less camouflage covering its production body. The r evived Supra is expected to arrive in Toyota dealerships sometime in 2018.Although the Supra's vinyl wrap remains, it looks as though the latest prototype is now fitted with production-intent head and taillights. We can also see some of the Supra's production bodywork taking shape.Up front we can see new headlights and air inlets that were previously concealed. It looks as though the Supra will adopt the pronounced nose from the FT-1 concept , which itself was a nod to Formula 1 car design. In profile it's clear that the Supra will feature a long hood with a sloping roofline reminiscent of the previous BMW Z4 coupe. That shouldn't come as a huge surprise as Toyota is jointly developing the Supra's platform with BMW; the German automaker will use it as the basis for its Z5 sports car.The rear of the Supra features a pronounced ducktail spoiler and an overall look that isn't that far removed from the Lexus RC . A pair of dual exhaust outlets are visible in the car's lower bumper area.It remains unknown just what powertrain will power the Supra. It's possible that the Supra could use a turbocharged inline-six from BMW. We've also heard rumors of a hybrid setup that would pair a turbocharged four-cylinder gas engine with an electric motor at each axle. Whatever the case, expect the Supra to be quick.Toyota is expected to formally unveil the Supra sometime next year. Production will begin in 2018. \n ",

They first experimented with digital signage back in 2014, but found out it was expensive using the method they chose. In late 2015, they replaced their equipment with Asus Chromeboxes connected to 42-inch flatscreen TVs and have been able to cut down on costs while improving the customer's experience. ",

      "text": "SHARE These sedans, trucks, and SUVs hold their value over time. \nWhen considering which car to buy, resale value may affect your decision. The average small car loses about $7,400 in its first year on the road, according to the automotive research site Edmunds.com — and cars tend to lose more of their original value than do SUVs or trucks. Luxury cars also tend to lose more value, at least initially, than do mid-market brands, largely because there’s more money to lose. \nSo what kinds of cars retain their value the best? To find out, MONEY took a look at Edmunds.com’s Best Retained Value Awards , which highlight which auto brands and specific models can be resold for the highest percentage of their original cost. Instead of simply glancing at the latest awards, we examined each year’s winners dating back to 2011, the earliest available year, to find the brands and cars that tend to retain their value best over time. We also included two vehicles from each given category — for example, there are two SUV winners — to cover various price ranges. \nThe information is relevant no matter what kind of car owner you are. Obviously, if you’re a driver who buys a new car every few years and needs to sell or trade in the old model, it’s wise to know what cars are likeliest to retain their value — because your ultimate resale price affects the overall cost of ownership. The typical car depreciates by 60% or more over five years. But certain vehicles, like the Honda Civic and Ford Mustang, only depreciate by an average of 35% over five years — so they can be much cheaper to own, over the long term, compared to cars whose value tanks over time. \nDrivers who plan on hanging onto their vehicles for the long haul should also be interested in this information, because part of the reason these cars retain their value so well is that they’re durable and can generally stay safely on the road for hundreds of thousands of miles. Americans are holding on to their cars for an average of nearly 12 years, an increase of 15% from pre-recession levels. In addition to durability, you may want to consider what the value of your car would be when you do eventually try to sell it. \nEven drivers who lease should pay attention to what vehicles retain value best. Why? A car’s resale value helps determine monthly lease payments, according to Edmunds. So check out our list of vehicles with the best resale value to help you make decisions that are smart now–and perhaps even smarter down the road. ",

      "text": "Blog This Toyota received eight awards for topping the various crash tests, for its safety technology, and for its efforts to improve safety standards in Southeast Asia. KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 29, 2016 - (JCN Newswire) - The New Car Assessment Program for Southeast Asian Countries (ASEAN NCAP) held its second bi-annual awards ceremony, the ASEAN NCAP Grand Prix 2016, at Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. The ASEAN NCAP Grand Prix commemorates the achievement of vehicles that have participated in the ASEAN NCAP assessment over the last two years. There are three main award categories: best occupant protection, best safety technology, and special awards given to vehicles/companies which contributed to enhancing safety in the region.Toyota won six awards for best occupant protection. Here, vehicles are judged based on frontal and side crash tests conducted by ASEAN NCAP on vehicles which are fitted with crash test dummies of different sizes that represent adult and child occupants1. During the crash test, the damage sustained by the vehicle and the crash test dummies are carefully assessed and quantified. This assessment is then translated into a numerical score. Based on this, the vehicle with the highest score is awarded the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and/or Child Occupant Protection (COP) title respectively for each vehicle category.The six awards for the best occupant protection classifications are:- Toyota Sienta -Best Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) for MPV Category- Toyota Agya -Best Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) for Mini Car Category- Toyota Agya -Best Child Occupant Protection (COP) Mini Car Category- Toyota Innova -Best Child Occupant Protection (COP) for MPV Category- Toyota Rush -Best Child Occupant Protection (COP) for SUV Category- Toyota Hilux -Best Child Occupant Protection (COP) for Pickup CategoryToyota was also presented with an award for its safety technology, the Blind Spot Monitor. This technology was recognized for its ability to help avoid accidents by alerting drivers of oncoming vehicles that may not be within their field of vision.Additionally, Toyota received a special recognition award-the Rising Star Recognition, for its efforts at improving safety standards in the ASEAN region with the Toyota Corolla. Toyota was recognized for its efforts, where the carmaker made the Corolla standardized with Vehicle Stability Control (VSC)2 and 7-airbags for all grades, in all ASEAN countries, from November 2016 onwards3.The awards for safety technology and special recognition are: - Blind Spot Monitor -Safety Technology Award (Car Manufacturer)- Toyota Corolla -Rising Star RecognitionApart from these awards, Toyota has also received AOP 5-star ratings for three models sold in Southeast Asia-the Hilux, the Innova and the Sienta, which were tested between 2015 and 2016.Toyota considers safety as its top priority, and aims to eliminate traffic fatalities altogether. To achieve this goal, Toyota has been developing safety features and conducting extensive R&D on safety, which involves conducting crash tests and simulations on its own, and then analysing the results to continually improve its safety features. Toyota is proud to achieve these awards from ASEAN NCAP, and will continue to work with stakeholders in the ASEAN region to achieve its goal of attaining zero traffic fatalities.(1) The vehicle with the highest score for its category class within the last two years is awarded by ASEAN NCAP at the Grand Prix. To assess Child Occupancy Protection, crash test dummies representing a 3-year old and an 18-month old are used in child seats(2) VSC: Electronic Stability Control(3) For the Model Year 2017 Corolla; availability is subject to introduction schedule for the various Southeast Asian marketsAbout ToyotaSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

      "text": "2018 Toyota Supra Mule Spotted Rolling In The Wild! 275 SHARES \nIt’s been a long time since Toyota let their iconic high end tuner die off after its price put it out of reach. For the average person who wanted one, there was no way we could snag one and still pay the mortgage. Now we’re seeing mules rolling in the wild as testing takes place for the 2018 model year. \nWhile there have been superficial changes to the overall shape and details, there’s a Supra under there. The front end has taken on a better shape than the original mules that were spied (silver wheels). The newer version we’re seeing now (black wheels) looks like it could practically hit dealerships tomorrow. \nWe know it won’t because there are still some fitment issues that look to be getting sorted out. This is most prominent when you look at the back end around the trunk and rear window. There also seems to be some kind of aero styling along the door but this could just be a test shape. \nThe styling of the rear lights looks to be paying homage to the original with its stoplight design. Twin exhaust tips hint that we may be seeing a turbocharged six cylinder under the hood. Of course, most of the design cues we’re seeing are also reminiscent of the FT-1 concept car before its release. \nIf this ends up being an elaborate ruse and Toyota isn’t bringing back the Supra, there will be so many disappointed people. There have been rumors of the Supra’s return practically from the day it went out of production. These have ramped up much more since 2012 when Toyota and BWM paired up to work on a Supra project. \nNow we have to wait and see if any sharp eyed spotters catch more possible Supra sightings for nearly a whole year. Until then, there’s loads of speculating to do on any and all features the 2018 Supra would have. \nLet us know in the comments below what design improvements as well as engine configurations you’d like to see. What else should be added to or stripped away from the Japanese sports car? Related Posts",

      "text": " 18am EST Toyota chief shifts gear, to boost electric vehicle division Toyota Motor Corp President Akio Toyoda speaks during their joint news conference with Suzuki Motor Chairman and CEO Osamu Suzuki (not in picture) in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nTOKYO Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday appointed its president to lead their newly formed electric car division, flagging its commitment to develop a technology that the automaker has been slow to embrace. \nThe change comes as the United States, China and European countries are encouraging automakers to make more all-electric battery cars as they push alternative energy strategies. \nAkio Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder Kiichiro Toyoda, has been at the helm of the world's largest automaker since 2009. He will head the company's electric vehicle (EV) planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi. \n\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company. \n\"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\" \nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota's strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company's efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations. \nToyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius petrol-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division's engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers - Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corporation. \nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ) and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. \nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favored EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which the company considers as the ultimate \"green\" car. \nEarlier this month, Toyota said it will develop cars with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life in the next few years. \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)  ",

      "text": "Technology News | Wed Nov 30, 2016 | 10:18am GMT Toyota chief shifts gear, to boost electric vehicle division Toyota Motor Corp President Akio Toyoda speaks during their joint news conference with Suzuki Motor Chairman and CEO Osamu Suzuki (not in picture) in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nTOKYO Toyota Motor Corp on Wednesday appointed its president to lead their newly formed electric car division, flagging its commitment to develop a technology that the automaker has been slow to embrace. \nThe change comes as the United States, China and European countries are encouraging automakers to make more all-electric battery cars as they push alternative energy strategies. \nAkio Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder Kiichiro Toyoda, has been at the helm of the world's largest automaker since 2009. He will head the company's electric vehicle (EV) planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi. \n\"By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars,\" said Toyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi, following a personnel change announcement by the company. \n\"The president will directly oversee the department's operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.\" \nThe department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota's strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company's efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations. \nToyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius petrol-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division's engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers - Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corporation. \nRivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ) and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles. \nHowever, Toyota until recently said it favored EVs for short-distance commuting given their limited driving range and lengthy charging time. It has been investing heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), which the company considers as the ultimate \"green\" car. \nEarlier this month, Toyota said it will develop cars with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life in the next few years. \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips) Next In Technology News",
