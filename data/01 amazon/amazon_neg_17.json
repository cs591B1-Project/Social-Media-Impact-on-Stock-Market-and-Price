      "text": "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 03:45 UTC \"He thinks I'll go after him [Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos] for antitrust,\" Trump said in May. The stock market's post-election bifurcation sharpened Monday as technology shares extended their worst performance since the start of the bull market on speculation Donald Trump's trade and immigration policies will translate into lower earnings. Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. led the S&P 500 Information Technology Index down 1.7 percent for the biggest retreat since September. The group stands out as the only industry that normally benefits from a rising economy not to rally on speculation Trump's policies will stoke domestic growth. Tech stocks in the benchmark equity gauge have slumped 3.1 percent over four days, trailing the S&P 500 Index by 4.2 percentage points, the most since May 2009. Small caps in the Russell 2000 Index surged 1.2 percent to an all-time high. No single fact explains the tech rout though everything from trade and immigration policy to industry rotation to flat-out campaign retaliation have been cited. Technology is the biggest group in the S&P 500 by far and one of the only ones to consistently post earnings growth over the last 18 months. \"Technology provides the productivity gains for the global economy and many of the large-cap names like Apple and Amazon were carrying the torch for the market,\" Channing Smith, a managing director at Capital Advisors Inc. in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said by phone. The firm oversees about $1.8 billion. \"Without their participating, that's definitely going to create a headwind for the market.\" The S&P 500 slipped less than one point for a second day of losses, with tech giants bearing the worst of the rout. The FANG block of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet each fell more than 2.4 percent. The group has dropped every day since Trump's victory, sinking 8 percent for the worst retreat since February amid concern about the impact of Trump's policies on trade overseas, where U.S. technology companies thrive. The industry, which largely supported Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign, may also face higher hurdles for expanding their footprints after some high-profile business leaders including Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos clashed with Trump during the election. Trump, responding to negative coverage in the Washington Post , which is owned by Bezos, maintained Bezos purchased the news organization to gain political influence and avoid antitrust scrutiny. Shares of the online retailer have lost more than $30 billion in value since Tuesday's vote. \"It's a big deal with what potentially Trump could do,\" said Blake Harper, an analyst that covers internet stocks at Loop Capital Markets LLC in Chicago. \"If you look at investors in Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, they're stacking some type of operationality for them to continue to expand internationally and also expand into other different categories outside their core markets,\" he said. \"He definitely indicated he would pursue antitrust measures against companies like Amazon. You'd have more restrictive policies to prohibit expansion.\" Any slowdown in tech earnings may deal a blow to a market that just emerged from a five-quarter profit slump, the longest since the global financial crisis. While S&P 500 income rose 2.7 percent in the third quarter, profit at tech firms expanded almost 8 percent, actual results and analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The decline in tech shares came after they extended their leadership at the fastest rate in four years, raising their representation in the S&P 500 by more than 1 percentage point to a 15-year high of 21.4 percent in the third quarter. From Apple to Facebook, mega techs now occupy half of the top 10 spots in ranks of the most valuable American companies, matching the number at the peak of internet mania. For now, the market seems to be holding up, with S&P 500 trading within 1.2 percent of an all-time high, as the retreat in tech stocks has been countered by rallies in financial and industrial companies, shares expected to benefit from Trump's plans to boost fiscal spending and ease regulations. Banks climbed 2.3 percent Monday, extending their gains since Trump's victory to 11 percent, while industrial stocks have added 5.2 percent in that time. \"The market is getting ahead of itself here and selling off and being hard on tech,\" said Timothy Ghriskey, who helps manage $1.5 billion as chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management LLC in New York. \"Tech is where a lot of gains were, so as money gets shifted around to different sectors, meaning into financials and into health care and industrials, it has to come out of somewhere and a lot of it has come out of tech.\" Comment: These companies are terrified they won't be able to fatten their bottom lines by exploiting cheap overseas labour.",

      "text": "Requirements for Amazon Headline Search Ads \nHeadline Search Ads are only available to Amazon Vendors. \nThese types of ads can send traffic to: An AMS brand page A custom URL (made of three parent products) A best-selling product \n\nThere really is no right answer for which one works best–it all depends on your strategy and keywords. However, since these ads usually attract top-of-the-funnel searchers, we usually see the best results with the first option, a brand page . \nIf you’re targeting queries that are further down the funnel–for instance, prAna yoga pants–you should certainly consider sending traffic to a custom url with three types of yoga pants. That will make it easier for them to find what they clearly want than a brand page would. \nAMS Brand Page \nYour brand page allows customizable features such as a Hero image, Hero Product, Selection of Best Sellers, and Text Box. This is the most popular landing page, and for good reason–you can showcase your entire catalog. \nHere’s an example of what this might look like on mobile: \n\nAs you can see, there’s quite a good selection to see here, along with some stellar reviews. This is great for a purchaser who’s heard great things about Ester-C, or has tried it before, but is open to browsing through their best-sellers or trying something new. \nCustom URL \nCustom URLs should be made from three of your parent products–so make them good ones! \nCreate a custom landing page by entering 3+ ASINs in the Amazon search bar, separated by a “|” symbol. You can simply take the URL from the search results and copy and paste it in the appropriate location when creating your ad. \nHere’s where you would do this: \n\nAs we said before, it’s very powerful to match your products to customer queries if you use this format. \nBest-Selling Products Page \nThis is a landing page featuring your brand’s best-selling products. This is another more top-of-the-funnel format but gives the customer additional trust in those products when they can see others have taken the leap and bought them. Targeting Amazon Headline Search Ads \nIf you couldn’t tell by now, the golden rule with Headline Search Ads is to reduce friction for your shoppers and put the most relevant products in front of them. \nJust as with Sponsored Product Ads, you can choose to use the suggested keywords or use your own. However, there are a few limitations for supported keywords on Headline Search Ads vs. Sponsored Product Ads. Here’s what Amazon says : \nHeadline Search Ads supports Exact and Phrase match, but without variations such as stemmings, plurals and/or misspellings. At this time synonyms of the terms are not supported. Sponsored Products Ads allow Exact/Phrase/Broad matches, including negative matching for exact and phrase, considering variations of the terms. \nNow, there’s one additional thing we should point out about Headline Search Ads. \nAlthough they are keyword-driven like Sponsored Products, they also use ad copy to surface an ad. \nThe headline and text in your ad copy should match the keywords that are the MOST important for your product. That way, you should see increased relevancy and a more productive click through. \nBecause Headline Search Ads require more creativity than other types of Amazon ads, It’s probably worth A/B testing them. \nYou can adjust all of the following: Headline",

      "title": "AWS Makes Amazon QuickSight Available to all Customers",
      "text": "Blog This \nAmazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), today announced that Amazon QuickSight is now available to all customers. Amazon QuickSight makes it easy for all employees within a company – regardless of their technical skill – to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from their data. More than 1,500 AWS customers, including global enterprises and startups from a range of industries, have been using Amazon QuickSight during its preview. These customers have experienced how seamlessly Amazon QuickSight connects to AWS and non-AWS data sources, and how fast the query performance is for its robust Super-fast, Parallel, In-Memory Calculation Engine (called SPICE). Pricing for Amazon QuickSight starts at $9.00 per user, per month – one-tenth the cost of traditional BI solutions – so customers of all sizes can make rich business analytics functionality available to all of their employees. To get started with Amazon QuickSight, visit https://quicksight.aws \nThe volume of data businesses create and process is growing every day. To get the most value out of this data, customers need to make it easy for all employees, regardless of their technical skill, to analyze data and share insights with others to drive decisions. However, the cost and complexity of traditional BI solutions prohibit most companies from making analytics ubiquitous across their organizations because these solutions require investments in costly on-premises hardware and software, weeks or months of data engineering time to build complex data models, and ongoing investments in additional infrastructure to maintain fast query performance as data sets grow. Amazon QuickSight is built from the ground up to solve these problems by bringing the scale and flexibility of the AWS Cloud to business analytics. Getting started with Amazon QuickSight is simple and fast. Customers simply log in to Amazon QuickSight, and Amazon QuickSight automatically discovers their data stored in AWS services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon QuickSight also connects to third-party data sources such as Microsoft Excel or Salesforce.com. Amazon QuickSight formats the data and moves it to SPICE so it can be visualized in Amazon QuickSight, and customers can choose to keep the data in SPICE up-to-date as the data in the underlying sources change. \n“Amazon QuickSight makes business analytics much easier, more accessible, cost effective, and faster than ever before,” said Raju Gulabani, Vice President, Database Services, Amazon Web Services. “Because so many companies store data in AWS, it’s very appealing to these customers that Amazon QuickSight can automatically discover their data in AWS, move it to SPICE, and return query results so quickly – all for one-tenth the cost of traditional BI solutions.” \nBuilt from the ground up for the cloud, SPICE uses a combination of columnar storage, in-memory technologies enabled through the latest hardware innovations, and machine code generation to allow users to run interactive queries on large datasets and get rapid responses – even with thousands of users all simultaneously performing interactive analysis across a wide variety of AWS data sources. As users explore their data, Amazon QuickSight infers data types and relationships, issues optimal queries to extract relevant data, aggregates the results in the SPICE engine, and provides suggestions for the best possible visualizations of the data – from bar and line graphs to pie charts and scatter plots or heat maps and pivot tables. \nMLB Advanced Media (MLBAM) is a leader in digital media and content infrastructure, powering an ever-growing number of massively popular media and entertainment properties. “We have been using the preview version of Amazon QuickSight to get insights into our digital content business,” said Brandon SanGiovanni, Traffic Manager, MLBAM. “Amazon QuickSight and the SPICE engine allowed us to tear down and explore our data in a fraction of the time we expected, making it easy for us to tap into the value inside our data. Amazon QuickSight made it easy to slice and dice our data by simply pointing Amazon QuickSight to our AWS data sources. With just a few clicks, Amazon QuickSight provided us with a real-time, 360-degree view of our business without being constrained by pre-built dashboard and metrics, which allowed us to expand our use of data to make informed decisions regarding our products.” \nEdmunds.com is a leader and one-stop resource for automotive information online, and provides everything from prices for new and used vehicles, vehicle reviews, and true cost of ownership to tips and advice for car purchases. “At Edmunds.com, we have large amounts of data generated every single day in AWS, from website clickstream logs, vehicle transaction and inventory data, and third party datasets to our server and infrastructure logs,” said, Ajit Zadgaonkar, Head of Cloud Infrastructure, Edmunds.com. “Today, we use various tools to generate reports for the entire organization. However, there’s an increasing need to equip our business users with the ability to do their own ad-hoc data discovery and analytics to complement our centralized reporting. We are excited that Amazon QuickSight supports this self-service use case very well. Now that it is generally available, we’re looking forward to giving access to Amazon QuickSight to all of our business users because of its ease-of-use, fast analytics, deep integration with AWS data sources, and affordable price point.” \nInfor provides business applications specialized by industry and built for the cloud, to its more than 90,000 customers and 66 million cloud users. “We have been using Amazon QuickSight during preview to analyze large datasets from our customers and we are excited about the speed of SPICE and the ease of use of Amazon QuickSight,” said Steve Stahl, Senior BI Development Manager, Infor. “Amazon QuickSight’s SPICE engine is very fast and lets us quickly process these datasets and visualize the results while greatly simplifying integration with Amazon RDS and Amazon Redshift.” \nHotelbeds is a global distributor of accommodations serving more than 185 destination countries worldwide and more than 25 million room nights annually. “Hotelbeds’ platform that connects travel partners around the world is built on top of AWS and generates massive amounts of data every day, but our existing BI solution limits how we make these data and insights available to our business users,”said Miguel Iza, Head of Data and Analytics, Hotelbeds. “Amazon QuickSight is the ideal service to make this data available to our business users. After testing this new service in preview, we found Amazon QuickSight to offer great performance with its SPICE engine, and an easy-to-use user experience when it comes to analytics. Amazon QuickSight simplifies the way our users access their data, perform self-service analysis, and share insights with others. We plan to adopt Amazon QuickSight for our new data solutions and look forward to Amazon QuickSight democratizing business analytics in our company.” \nAmazon QuickSight is free for one user and one GB of SPICE capacity. The Standard Edition of Amazon QuickSight starts at $9 per user per month, includes 10 GB of SPICE capacity, and is now available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) and will expand to additional Regions in the coming months. The Enterprise Edition of Amazon QuickSight includes all Standard Edition features as well as support for Active Directory integration and encryption at rest and will be available in the coming weeks. \nAbout Amazon Web Services \nFor 10 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 70 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, analytics, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT) and enterprise applications from 38 Availability Zones (AZs) across 14 geographic regions in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and India. AWS services are trusted by more than a million active customers around the world -- including the fastest growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies -- to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn Stifel’s David Ross and J. Bruce Chan cut FedEx ( FDX ) to Hold from Buy–and it has nothing to do with Amazon.com ( AMZN ):\nAgence France-Presse/Getty Images We upgraded the shares of FedEx Corp. a little over a year ago , with the thesis that we would see one last run before either 1) settling into a global economic pullback, or 2) becoming immersed in a challenging TNT integration. From there, FedEx didn’t go straight up and its path has been a bit of a roller coaster. And while we do not see an imminent global recession—in fact, we believe there could be further market upside due to multiple expansion in the pre-Trump euphoria—FedEx has hit our $186 target price, causing us to step to the sidelines rather than raise our estimates for the target multiple. For investors with a more bullish thesis, every P/E multiple point is worth >$12 in the share price, and we understand the rationale for a $200 target price. But in what we believe to be a still-fragile global economic environment with the heavy-lifting of the TNT integration ahead, we are choosing to take profits here and wait to re-enter at a later point…\nThis downgrade has nothing to do with Amazon or any other perceived competitive threat , as we believe there is significant growth ahead for FedEx, Amazon, and UPS ( UPS ) in the U.S. parcel market\nShares of FedEx have fallen 1.2% to $183.97 at 11:53 a.m. today, while Amazon.com has climbed 3.2% to $742.39, and UPS is off 0.6% at $112.22.",

      "text": "AWS Makes Amazon QuickSight Available to all Customers   \nAmazon Web Services ( News - Alert ), Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), today announced that Amazon QuickSight is now available to all customers. Amazon QuickSight makes it easy for all employees within a company - regardless of their technical skill - to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from their data. More than 1,500 AWS customers, including global enterprises and startups from a range of industries, have been using Amazon QuickSight during its preview. These customers have experienced how seamlessly Amazon QuickSight connects to AWS and non-AWS data sources, and how fast the query performance is for its robust Super-fast, Parallel, In-Memory Calculation Engine (called SPICE). Pricing for Amazon QuickSight starts at $9.00 per user, per month - one-tenth the cost of traditional BI solutions - so customers of all sizes can make rich business analytics functionality available to all of their employees. To get started with Amazon QuickSight, visit https://quicksight.aws \nThe volume of data businesses create and process is growing every day. To get the most value out of this data, customers need to make it easy for all employees, regardless of their technical skill, to analyze data and share insights with others to drive decisions. However, the cost and complexity of traditional BI solutions prohibit most companies from making analytics ubiquitous across their organizations because these solutions require investments in costly on-premises hardware and software, weeks or months of data engineering time to build complex data models, and ongoing investments in additional infrastructure to maintain fast query performance as data sets grow. Amazon QuickSight is built from the ground up to solve these problems by bringing the scale and flexibility of the AWS Cloud to business analytics. Getting started with Amazon QuickSight is simple and fast. Customers simply log in to Amazon QuickSight, and Amazon QuickSight automatically discovers their data stored in AWS services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon QuickSight also connects to third-party data sources such as Microsoft ( News - Alert ) Excel or Salesforce.com. Amazon QuickSight formats the data and moves it to SPICE so it can be visualized in Amazon QuickSight, and customers can choose to keep the data in SPICE up-to-date as the data in the underlying sources change. \n\"Amazon QuickSight makes business analytics much easier, more accessible, cost effective, and faster than ever before,\" said Raju Gulabani, Vice President, Database Services, Amazon Web Services. \"Because so many companies store data in AWS, it's very appealing to these customers that Amazon QuickSight can automatically discover their data in AWS, move it to SPICE, and return query results so quickly - all for one-tenth the cost of traditional BI solutions.\" \nBuilt from the ground up for the cloud, SPICE uses a combination of columnar storage, in-memory technologies enabled through the latest hardware innovations, and machine code generation to allow users to run interactie queries on large datasets and get rapid responses - even with thousands of users all simultaneously performing interactive analysis across a wide variety of AWS data sources. As users explore their data, Amazon QuickSight infers data types and relationships, issues optimal queries to extract relevant data, aggregates the results in the SPICE engine, and provides suggestions for the best possible visualizations of the data - from bar and line graphs to pie charts and scatter plots or heat maps and pivot tables. \nMLB ( News - Alert ) Advanced Media (MLBAM) is a leader in digital media and content infrastructure, powering an ever-growing number of massively popular media and entertainment properties. \"We have been using the preview version of Amazon QuickSight to get insights into our digital content business,\" said Brandon SanGiovanni, Traffic Manager, MLBAM. \"Amazon QuickSight and the SPICE engine allowed us to tear down and explore our data in a fraction of the time we expected, making it easy for us to tap into the value inside our data. Amazon QuickSight made it easy to slice and dice our data by simply pointing Amazon QuickSight to our AWS data sources. With just a few clicks, Amazon QuickSight provided us with a real-time, 360-degree view of our business without being constrained by pre-built dashboard and metrics, which allowed us to expand our use of data to make informed decisions regarding our products.\" \nEdmunds.com is a leader and one-stop resource for automotive information online, and provides everything from prices for new and used vehicles, vehicle reviews, and true cost of ownership to tips and advice for car purchases. \"At Edmunds.com, we have large amounts of data generated every single day in AWS, from website clickstream logs, vehicle transaction and inventory data, and third party datasets to our server and infrastructure logs,\" said, Ajit Zadgaonkar, Head of Cloud Infrastructure, Edmunds.com. \"Today, we use various tools to generate reports for the entire organization. However, there's an increasing need to equip our business users with the ability to do their own ad-hoc data discovery and analytics to complement our centralized reporting. We are excited that Amazon QuickSight supports this self-service use case very well. Now that it is generally available, we're looking forward to giving access to Amazon QuickSight to all of our business users because of its ease-of-use, fast analytics, deep integration with AWS data sources, and affordable price point.\" \nInfor provides business applications specialized by industry and built for the cloud, to its more than 90,000 customers and 66 million cloud users. \"We have been using Amazon QuickSight during preview to analyze large datasets from our customers and we are excited about the speed of SPICE and the ease of use of Amazon QuickSight,\" said Steve Stahl, Senior BI Development Manager, Infor. \"Amazon QuickSight's SPICE engine is very fast and lets us quickly process these datasets and visualize the results while greatly simplifying integration with Amazon RDS and Amazon Redshift.\" \nHotelbeds is a global distributor of accommodations serving more than 185 destination countries worldwide and more than 25 million room nights annually. \"Hotelbeds' platform that connects travel partners around the world is built on top of AWS and generates massive amounts of data every day, but our existing BI solution limits how we make these data and insights available to our business users,\"said Miguel Iza, Head of Data and Analytics, Hotelbeds. \"Amazon QuickSight is the ideal service to make this data available to our business users. After testing this new service in preview, we found Amazon QuickSight to offer great performance with its SPICE engine, and an easy-to-use user experience when it comes to analytics. Amazon QuickSight simplifies the way our users access their data, perform self-service analysis, and share insights with others. We plan to adopt Amazon QuickSight for our new data solutions and look forward to Amazon QuickSight democratizing business analytics in our company.\" \nAmazon QuickSight is free for one user and one GB of SPICE capacity. The Standard Edition of Amazon QuickSight starts at $9 per user per month, includes 10 GB of SPICE capacity, and is now available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) and will expand to additional Regions in the coming months. The Enterprise Edition of Amazon QuickSight includes all Standard Edition features as well as support for Active Directory integration and encryption at rest and will be available in the coming weeks. \nAbout Amazon Web Services \nFor 10 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon 1/2 left right A delivery lorry is parked by a Morrisons supermarket in south London, Britain August 19, 2016. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls 2/2 \nLONDON British supermarket Morrisons has further developed its wholesale relationship with Amazon, launching a store pick service for the online retailer's customers, it said on Wednesday. \nIn February Morrisons sealed a deal with Amazon that saw it begin wholesale supply to the Internet firm in June. It said that service had started well and been extended to thousands of Morrisons' products. \nThe British supermarket operator said the new \"Morrisons at Amazon\" service will allow Amazon Prime customers in selected areas to order from Morrisons on Amazon's app. \nOrders will be picked at a local Morrisons store and delivered the same day by Amazon either within one hour for 6.99 pounds ($8.72) or within a two-hour slot for free. \nThe service will launch in selected postcodes in London and Hertfordshire, north of the capital. \n(Reporting by James Davey; Editing by Susan Fenton) Next In Technology News",

This means that you can't have purchased a gift card previously in the past 2 years which sadly means that not everyone will be able to take advantage of this offer. Deal Tags:",

      "text": "Amazon is adding lots of fulfillment centers in order to deliver packages faster. (Photo: The Motley Fool)\nAmazon, the sleeping giant as other retailers unveiled their Black Friday plans, is back with a vengeance, rolling out a slew of rock-bottom deals on television sets.\nWhile not every deal has been detailed, the company has put out a list of some items customers can expect to see discounted at various points over the 35 days. Among the notable are a variety of cheap TV deals:\nA 32-inch 720p LED TV for $69.99. A 43-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart TV for $199. A 32-inch TCL 720p Smart TV, Amazon’s Choice, for $125. A 55-inch LG 4K Smart TV for $398. USA TODAY\nTips for getting deals for the Black Friday weekend\nOther deals include a Denon Heos 1 speaker for $99.99 and Sennheiser's HD 598 Cs Closed Back Headphones for $99.95, both roughly $100 off.\nHyundai is how owners can now use Amazon's Echo home connectivity system in conjunction with their cars (Photo: Hyundai)\nAs has already been seen at other retailers, Amazon will be giving its own devices some hefty discounts. The Echo smart speaker will be $139.99, and the portable Tap Bluetooth smart speaker will be $89.99.\nThe Echo Dot speaker accessory will be $39.99, a $10 discount. The Fire TV streaming stick will see a similar discount and drop to $29.99. Various Kindle eBooks and Fire tablets will also see discounts ranging from $20 to $30.\nEarlier this month, the online giant announced it would begin offering deals from Nov. 1 in the build-up to the shopping holiday. Early Wednesday morning the company further explained what it'd be doing for the major holiday shopping weekend, providing details for its plans in the days leading up to, during and after Black Friday.\nUSA TODAY\nAmazon's Black Friday deals start today\nAmazon will begin offering discounts as early as November 18 and run until December 22. The company promises that new deals will be available as often as every five minutes, and is advising shoppers to keep an eye on the \"Turkey 5,\" or the five days of shopping starting Thanksgiving Thursday and running through Cyber Monday, for the best deals.\nBeyond electronics, Amazon will be offering up to a 60% discount on \"Disney favorites\" including toys and apparel as well as up to 50% off on \"select toys from Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price.\" A Blu-ray gift set of season 6 of the The Walking Dead will be $50 off and the complete series of the Game of Thrones books will get a 20% cut.\nSimilar to Prime Day and other recent sales, Amazon is employing its intelligent digital assistant, Alexa, to help drive purchases through special \"Alexa exclusive\" deals. Simply asking the digital assistant “Alexa, what are your deals?” will reveal specials of the day.\nAmazon is promising over 70 deals through this method including a brand unknown 40-inch 1080p LED TV for $125 and the TP-Link Smart Plug, which can allow you to control traditional appliances through Alexa, for $17.95, or $12 off.\nAlexa is just the latest Amazon service to be deployed for the shopping holiday, though the best deals and values remain to subscribers of the company's premium Prime service. In addition to giving subscribers a 30-minute head start on the company's \"Lightning Deals\" and free two-day shipping, Amazon has expanded the service to now offering free one-day shipping on over 1 million items in 29 cities.\nUSA TODAY\nBest Buy storms Black Friday with deep discounts on TVs\nIf you're in an area that has access to the company's Prime Now same-day delivery service you'll be able to shop on \"more than a hundred\" Black Friday deals and have them delivered in one to two hours.\nAmazon's Black Friday plans cap what is expected to be a busy season for holiday shoppers. According to the National Retail Federation, the average American consumer is expected to spend $935.58 during the holiday shopping season, with 56.5% of shopping being done online.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal ​​\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fweF5w",

      "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket Morrisons has set up a new service that will offer Amazon Prime customers same-day deliveries of groceries from its stores, deepening the relationship between the two companies.\nShares in Morrisons, up 50 percent so far this year, added 0.7 percent by 0830 GMT, valuing the business at 5.2 billion pounds. Shares in online grocery company Ocado, which has its own agreement with Morrisions, fell more than 5 percent.\nIn February Morrisons agreed a deal with Amazon that saw it begin wholesale supply to the Internet firm from June. It said that service had started well and been extended to thousands of Morrisons' products.\nThe new \"Morrisons at Amazon\" service will allow Amazon Prime customers in and around London to order the full range of Morrisons' products online via Amazon's Prime Now app. The service was launching on Wednesday.\nAmazon is promoting its Prime service heavily ahead of the launch on Nov.18 of motoring show \"The Grand Tour\" presented by Jeremy Clarkson.\nMorrisons is the smallest of Britain's \"big four\" supermarkets which have come under pressure from the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nHowever, the online food market is expanding quickly and is expected to grow by 68 percent to 17.9 billion pounds ($22.35 billion) in the five years to 2021, according to industry research group IGD.\nOrders will be picked by shop staff at a local Morrisons store and delivered the same day by Amazon either within one hour for 6.99 pounds ($8.72) or within a two-hour slot for free.\nThe service will launch in selected postcodes in London and Hertfordshire, north of the capital.\nMorrisons said its partnership with Amazon will contribute to a 50-100 million pounds profit boost it has previously targeted.\n\"For Morrisons this broadens the offer and gives them more ways to reach customers online where they are still in the early stages of development. For Amazon this is one of a vast number of things they are trialling,\" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who has a \"market perform\" rating on Morrisons.\nThe partnership put pressure on Ocado shares. Morrisons also has a distribution deal with Ocado that sees Morrisons products delivered to customers from Ocado's distribution centers.\nThat agreement was renegotiated in August allowing Morrisons to extend home delivery to its customers across the country using its own stores to provide products. Morrisons has said it will commence that service next year.\n\n\n\n(Reporting by James Davey; Editing by Susan Fenton/Keith Weir)",

      "text": "Amazon Sues Counterfeit Sellers (AMZN, BABA) By Rakesh Sharma   3:00 AM EST \nAmazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) is going to court. \nThe e-commerce behemoth, which has recently been accused of carrying counterfeits on its site, filed two cases against sellers of fake products on its site. The first case involves sellers of training equipment that was originally developed and patented by Fitness Anywhere but is being sold by third-party sellers, and the second case involves infringers of patented technology for forklift equipment. “When customers purchase counterfeit goods, it undermines the trust that customers, sellers and manufacturers place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon's brand and causing irreparable reputational harm,\" the company stated in its suit. (For more, see also: Is Amazon Stock Still A Bargain At All-Time Highs? ) \nCounterfeit products have become a problem area for Amazon in recent times. In July, CNBC ran a report that described the effect of Chinese manufacturers for U.S.-based sellers on Amazon’s site. The report described Amazon as the world’s largest flea market: \"a chaotic, somewhat lawless, bazaar with unlimited inventory.” Even companies like Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) are not immune from Amazon’s counterfeit problem. The Cupertino company complained last month that most Apple products on Amazon’s website were fake. \nBack in 2014, the Wall Street Journal ran a story that highlighted results of the company’s policy of “commingling” original and knockoff products for better space management at its warehouses. “A product ordered from a third-party seller may not have originated from that particular seller. If the barcode matches, any one that is on the shelf will do,” the story’s authors wrote. Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) stopped sales of its products on Amazon in 2013 after accusing the company of not clamping down on sales of counterfeits on its site. \nThe Counterfeit Report released a report earlier this month that stated that the market for such goods was worth $1.7 trillion. Along with Amazon, eBay Inc. ( EBAY ) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ( BABA ) are the three biggest sites for counterfeit goods. For example, the report stated that eBay had over 1.7 million counterfeit and fake items. (For more, see: How Counterfeiting Affects Alibaba's Business .)

      "text": "Jeff Bezos and Amazon Used Exactly 2 Sentences to Teach Us All a Major Lesson Amazon's recent statement teaches you how to grow as a person. By Justin Bariso Justin Bariso is an author and the founder of INSIGHT , a consultancy that helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact. In 2015, LinkedIn named him one of their top three management writers of the year. His first book, scheduled for release late 2016 , serves as a practical guide to developing emotional intelligence and making it work for you. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nOver a year ago, The New York Times published a scathing piece portraying Amazon , the world's largest retailer, as a brutal employer that puts innovation and company performance above the well-being of its people. The authors painted a picture of \"unreasonably high\" standards, colleagues sabotaging one another, and managers who deal callously with workers enduring family tragedies and serious health problems. \nNow, the company has revealed significant changes in how it assesses employees. A spokesperson provided the following statement to multiple news outlets: \n\"We're launching a new annual review process next year that is radically simplified and focuses on our employees' strengths, not the absence of weaknesses. We will continue to iterate and build on the program based on what we learn from our employees.\" \nSome may see this as a carefully crafted PR stunt, but you can be sure it was reviewed, revised, and redrafted multiple times before getting approved--no doubt by Bezos himself. \nAnd it contains a major lesson for all of us. How Bezos Got It Right \nSo, what makes this statement so great? \nOne major reason: \nAmazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos demonstrated remarkable emotional intelligence in his ability to process feedback. \nFrom the beginning, I appreciated Bezos's quick response to the allegations of the Times story. \nHe may have felt the criticism was unduly biased. (\"I don't recognize this Amazon and I very much hope you don't, either,\" Bezos told employees.) But through an internal memo, Bezos nonetheless encouraged Amazon employees to read the Times story, and to \"escalate to HR\" any stories they knew of like those reported--even inviting individuals to email him directly. \nOnly those on the inside really know what it's like working for Amazon, and even then there's bound to be varying perspectives. (Amazon currently employs over 300,000 people worldwide.) \nBut with Bezos's initial response, and now the announcement of changes in the company, Amazon's founding father shows the ability to set emotions aside and learn from criticism--even if it's not delivered in the most ideal way. \nWe can all learn from that attitude. \nWhether you're an employer or employee, criticism is never easy to take. You've invested blood, sweat, and tears in your work; it's natural to be offended when someone else says you're wrong. \nBut the truth is, criticism is often rooted in truth. When you receive negative feedback, there are two choices: You can put your feelings aside and try to learn from the situation. You can get angry and let emotion get the best of you. \nGuess which one's going to benefit you? \nEven if negative feedback turns out to be mostly unfounded, it can still give you a chance to see from an alternate perspective. (My forthcoming book, which serves as a practical guide to emotional intelligence, outlines more specific strategies for how you can make sure you benefit from criticism.) \nTo be clear, I'm not excusing criticism that's hurtful or poorly delivered. If your feedback is thoughtful and empathetic, the chance is greater that the recipient will benefit. (You should also be generous with sincere and specific commendation. ) \nBut if you're on the receiving end of negative feedback, don't waste time thinking how about how the other person made you feel. Instead, set your emotions aside, and ask: How can I use this feedback to help me or my team improve? Putting my personal feelings aside, what can I learn from this alternate perspective? \nAfter that original Times story was published, I saw a great opportunity for Bezos and his team to look carefully at what Amazon is, where it's heading, and what needs fixing. \nBravo to Bezos and co., for using that negative feedback as a catalyst to grow. \nIf you do the same, you'll only keep getting better.

      "text": "An Ocado distribution centre Ocado/Cambridge Consultants \nAmazon just signed another major distribution deal with Morrisons, one of Britain's biggest supermarket chains, which threatens online grocery group Ocado. \nOcado's shares are crashing as a result. OCDO stock is down more than 6% around 10.30 a.m. GMT (5.30 a.m. ET) as investors try to figure out the potential damage that Amazon might do to Ocado. \nUnder the agreement — which extends Amazon's existing relationship with Morrisons — Amazon Prime customers will be able to order same-day grocery deliveries from Morrisons via Amazon. \nThe new \"Morrisons at Amazon\" service will allow Amazon Prime customers in and around London to order the full range of Morrisons' products online via Amazon's Prime Now app. \n\"As food maker and shopkeeper, we have unique skills to help build a broader new Morrisons through capital light growth. 'Morrisons at Amazon' is another exciting joint opportunity and makes Morrisons good quality, great value-for-money products available to even more customers,\" Morrisons' Chief Executive David Potts said. \nThis has pushed Ocado's famously sensitive stock off a cliff on Wednesday, as the chart below illustrates: \nInvesting.com \nInvestors in the online-only grocer are terrified of Amazon's movements in the food shopping market for one simple reason — namely that when Amazon enters a new business area, it normally wins. \nIn its history, whenever Amazon has turned its hand to new businesses, it has generally enjoyed huge success — other than of course the Fire tablet. The American retail giant has such a huge resource pool that should the initial experiment prove a success, it has the capacity to cause a huge disruption to Ocado. \nAmazon is a multi-billion dollar global giant, whereas Ocado — while pretty successful in its current business — has yet to expand outside the UK, and is still largely focused in one small part of the nation. \n\"For Morrisons this broadens the offer and gives them more ways to reach customers online where they are still in the early stages of development. For Amazon this is one of a vast number of things they are trialling,\" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, according to a Reuters report. \nOcado also has a deal with Morrisons that incorporates the delivery of Morrisons products to customers, but as previously mentioned, it does not have the financial clout of Amazon, so the deal is less significant. \nAnother driver of the fall on Wednesday is the fact Ocado is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the UK, reflecting fears about its future prospects in the markets. Almost a fifth of its shares are held by investors betting the price will fall, according to Castellain Capital's Short Tracker site .Blackrock, Discovery Capital, GMT Capital, JP Morgan Asset Management, and Marshall Wace are among the big holders of short positions in the com \nNOW WATCH: Here's how much $100 is worth in every state   Ocado Ocado Shares Morrisons",

Most people would picture a package wrapped up in paper, maybe with a bow, right? That’s not what Amazon customers are getting in their boxes this holiday season: for the same price, shoppers are getting velvet gift bags of various sizes. \nThe bags solve two key gift-wrapping problems for the unfathomably large e-commerce company: they’re re-usable multiple times, and they’re also a lot faster than having someone wrap the gifts the old-fashioned way. \nWhile we wouldn’t put it past Amazon to develop a gift-wrapping robot, the company is emphasizing the eco-friendly aspects of the change. “Our guiding North Star is the minimization of packaging,” the company’s director of worldwide sustainability and social responsibility explained to Fortune magazine . “Wrapping paper has no value.” \nSpeaking of value, the velvet bags do end up costing Amazon less than the traditional wrapping paper, which is a nice side benefit to the change. The company’s frustration-free packaging and attempts to banish the Stupid Shipping gang can be wrapped in a cloak of eco-friendliness, but they’re also about saving money and creating smaller packages to load on planes and trucks.

      "text": "Britain's Morrisons extends Amazon deal with same-day service 11/16/2016 3:57 \nLONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket Morrisons has set up a new service that will offer Amazon Prime customers same-day deliveries of groceries from its stores, deepening the relationship between the two companies. \nShares in Morrisons, up 50 percent so far this year, added 0.7 percent by 0830 GMT, valuing the business at 5.2 billion pounds. Shares in online grocery company Ocado, which has its own agreement with Morrisions, fell more than 5 percent. \nIn February Morrisons agreed a deal with Amazon that saw it begin wholesale supply to the Internet firm from June. It said that service had started well and been extended to thousands of Morrisons' products. \nThe new \"Morrisons at Amazon\" service will allow Amazon Prime customers in and around London to order the full range of Morrisons' products online via Amazon's Prime Now app. The service was launching on Wednesday. \nAmazon is promoting its Prime service heavily ahead of the launch on Nov.18 of motoring show \"The Grand Tour\" presented by Jeremy Clarkson. \nMorrisons is the smallest of Britain's \"big four\" supermarkets which have come under pressure from the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. \nHowever, the online food market is expanding quickly and is expected to grow by 68 percent to 17.9 billion pounds ($22.35 billion) in the five years to 2021, according to industry research group IGD. \nOrders will be picked by shop staff at a local Morrisons store and delivered the same day by Amazon either within one hour for 6.99 pounds ($8.72) or within a two-hour slot for free. \nThe service will launch in selected postcodes in London and Hertfordshire, north of the capital. \nMorrisons said its partnership with Amazon will contribute to a 50-100 million pounds profit boost it has previously targeted. \n\"For Morrisons this broadens the offer and gives them more ways to reach customers online where they are still in the early stages of development. For Amazon this is one of a vast number of things they are trialling,\" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who has a \"market perform\" rating on Morrisons. \nThe partnership put pressure on Ocado shares. Morrisons also has a distribution deal with Ocado that sees Morrisons products delivered to customers from Ocado's distribution centers. \nThat agreement was renegotiated in August allowing Morrisons to extend home delivery to its customers across the country using its own stores to provide products. Morrisons has said it will commence that service next year. \n(Reporting by James Davey; Editing by Susan Fenton/Keith Weir) 11/16/2016 3:57 © Copyright Reuters Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is just Out of Stock, meaning no delivery until after Christmas :) This is still a pre-order. Pre-ordering is simply ordering something before it is avaliable to purchase. This isn't avaliable to purchase on Amazon, at the moment. :) Pre-ordering in Consumer Electronics and Games refers to unreleased products. This has been released, and is therefore not considered a pre-order. Hence why Amazon don't offer their Pre-Order Price Guarantee with this. Because it isn't one :P",

      "text": "Morrisons expands Amazon deal offering delivery in an hour \nShares in Ocado plunge more than 5% following announcement of new service for Prime Now members Morrisons began supplying goods from its warehouse to Amazon in June. Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PA Wednesday 16 November 2016 12.07 GMT Last modified on Wednesday 16 November 2016 12.12 GMT Share on Messenger \nMorrisons has extended its relationship with Amazon, enabling shoppers to order a full shop for delivery within an hour in London and Hertfordshire. \nThe announcement of the new service for Amazon’s Prime Now members sent shares in Ocado , the online grocery specialist which supports Morrisons’ website, diving more than 5%. \nMorrisons began supplying goods from its central warehouse to Amazon in June and already offers thousands of products via the US company’s Fresh grocery delivery service, which currently only operates in London. \nUnder the Prime Now service, which will be called Morrisons at Amazon, orders will be picked at a local Morrisons store by the supermarket’s staff and picked up and delivered by Amazon either within one hour for £6.99 or in a two-hour slot for free in selected areas of London and Hertfordshire. \nMariangela Marseglia, the director of Prime Now EU, said the deal would add 10,000 items to its ultra-fast delivery service. Amazon and Morrisons tie-up: a customer's guide Read more \nDavid Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons, said: “As foodmaker and shopkeeper, we have unique skills to help build a broader new Morrisons through capital-light growth. Morrisons at Amazon is another exciting joint opportunity and makes Morrisons’ good quality, great value-for-money products available to even more customers.” \nOcado has handled the distribution network and IT behind Morrison’s website since it launched in 2014 . It delivers in north London and most of the rest of England but not East Anglia, the north-east or Scotland. \nEarlier this year the two companies agreed to jointly develop a new distribution centre in Erith, south London, and a new IT system to allow the supermarket to serve online shoppers from its stores . Both arrangements are intended to help Morrisons extend its delivery network. But the new warehouse will not open until 2018 and the store-picking system will not start being tested until next year. \nThe agreement with Amazon gives Morrisons a headstart on delivering groceries from its stores, potentially boosting sales. \nBruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said: “It’s unclear at this stage what the deal means for the prospect of in-store picking with Ocado, but it will certainly give Morrisons much better negotiation power in the discussions. It should also improve the bargaining position for any other retailer looking to sign a deal with Ocado.” \nClive Black, at Morrisons’ broker Shore Capital, said: “We believe this announcement suggests that Morrisons’ initial experiences with Amazon (and vice versa) have been encouraging, whilst the store-based retailer’s broader ambitions and capabilities online appear to be extending … If successful, it could also catapult Morrison’s access to the convenience market where it has no physical presence.” \nHowever, Monteyne said Morrisons would only be supplying Amazon via an extension of its wholesale agreement so the US company would be able to set prices. \n“Without being able to control pricing this puts a material risk on the Morrisons brand and the risk of Amazon undercutting Morrisons’ offer,” he added.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan AWS sets its sights on the BI market as it makes Amazon QuickSight generally available The cloud computing giant launches a tool aimed at letting non-technical, business users rapidly extract useful information from corporate data. \nThe Amazon QuickSight dashboard. Image: Amazon \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has made its data analysis tool Amazon QuickSight available to all customers. \nThe new cloud service is designed to allow all employees to rapidly derive useful business information from data, regardless of an individual's technical skill. \nAmazon QuickSight provides graphical tools that allow users to more easily build data visualizations, charts, graphs, and tables. Data can be pulled from various AWS sources, including AWS Redshift, Amazon Relational Database Service, and Amazon Simple Storage Service, while third-party sources include Microsoft Excel and Salesforce.com. \nData can be synced with sources so it reflects the latest changes, and the speed of queries via QuickSight is boosted by SPICE (Super-fast, Parallel, In-Memory Calculation Engine). Read More \nAmazon says it designed QuickSight to be easier to use and access than traditional Business Intelligence (BI) tools, as well as to be competitive on pricing. \nWhile the service's ease of use challenges traditional BI tools provided by Qlik and Tableau, analysts have pointed out that in prioritising simplicity, QuickSight has sacrificed advanced features and it could be held back by corporate unease about sensitive datasets being handled in the cloud . \nQuickSight has been trialled by more than 1,500 AWS customers, including global enterprises and startups from a range of industries. \n\"Amazon QuickSight and the SPICE engine allowed us to tear down and explore our data in a fraction of the time we expected, making it easy for us to tap into the value inside our data,\" said Brandon SanGiovanni, traffic manager for MLBAM. \nOnline automotive information site Edmunds.com says it will use QuickSight to allow business users to rapidly analyse data drawn from clickstream logs, vehicle transaction, and inventory data, alongside third-party datasets. \nPricing for the Standard Edition of Amazon QuickSight starts at $9 per user, per month, including 10GB of SPICE capacity. It is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland), and will expand to additional AWS regions in the coming months. \nThe Enterprise Edition of Amazon QuickSight includes all Standard Edition features, as well as support for Active Directory integration and encryption at rest and will be available in the coming week. \nAmazon also announced another price drop for its EC2 service, which offers access to compute resources in the cloud. \nFrom December 1, prices will be cut by up to 25 percent across all AWS regions for the following instances: C4 -- an instance aimed at tasks requiring high performance processor; M4 instances -- a general purpose instance, with a balance of compute, memory, and network resources; and T2 instances -- which provide moderate performance but can ramp up performance in times of high demand. \nThe price drop will apply to On-Demand, Reserved Instance (Standard and Convertible) and Dedicated Host prices for these instances. \nPrices for C4 instances will drop five percent in US East (Northern Virginia) and EU (Ireland) and 20 percent in Asia Pacific (Mumbai) and Asia Pacific (Singapore). M4 instances will be cut by up to 10 percent in US East (Northern Virginia), EU (Ireland), and EU (Frankfurt) and 25 percent in Asia Pacific (Singapore). T2 instance prices will fall by up to 10 percent in US East (Northern Virginia) and 25 percent in Asia Pacific (Singapore). Read more about AWS",

      "text": "Amazon has teamed up with British supermarket chain Morrisons to deliver your grocery shopping in just one hour. It’s part of the retail giant’s Prime Now service, and it comes at the usual price of £6.99 (approx. $8.70) per delivery.\nAmazon first joined forces with Morrisons back in February, adding more than 4,000 of the supermarket’s grocery goods to Amazon Pantry for next-day delivery. Now those living in Prime Now locations — London and Hertfordshire — can get their shopping in just one hour.\nOrders can be placed using the Prime Now app for Android and iOS, which now boasts a dedicated Morrisons section, just a week after Amazon added pharmacist John Bell & Croyden and wine seller Spirited Wines .\nOne-hour deliveries are charged at £6.99 — the usual rate for Prime Now — but you can select a two-hour time slot between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. for free if you don’t mind waiting just a little bit longer.\nAmazon is now seen as a major rival to British supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury’s — especially now that it offers same-day delivery throughout London. However, Morrisons is one partner that will be delighted by the company’s focus on Prime Now in the U.K.\n\n\nSource : Amazon \nVia : Engadget ",

ÂŠ Beck Diefenbach / Reuters April 21, 2016 10:00am EDT \nEarlier this year, Amazon introduced a new tablet to the market in the form of the Fire HD 8, and it's time to know what this device can do. \nStarting off with its display, as its name implies, this tablet offers high-definition resolution spanning across an 8-inch screen that is designed to minimize glare. \nAmazon has also beefed up the Fire HD 8's internal components, providing more RAM inside the tablet to help it perform even better. \nAmazon has also upped the amount of internal storage space available in the newest Fire tablet. Potential buyers can now choose from two different models, with one offering 16GB of internal storage, and the other doubling that with 32GB. Advertisement \nThe tablet also comes with a microSD card slot that owners can use if they still need more space. \nAmazon has also touted the durability and improved energy-efficiency of the Fire HD 8, the latter of which should allow the tablet to remain functional for up to 12 hours. \nThe new Amazon tablet also comes with some features that may not be very familiar with some potential buyers. \nFor instance, depending on which variant of the tablet buyers get, they may see that it displays things known as Special Offers on the lockscreen. These Special Offers are actually ads, according to Forbes . Again, people can opt to get a variant of the new tablet that doesn't come with Special Offers, though it will cost $15 extra. \nThe tablet is also expected to get Alexa, a new feature that is designed to give device owners easier access to certain apps. Device owners can also ask Alexa questions and receive quick answers. \nLastly, the new Amazon tablet is also on the cheaper side as the base model with 16GB of storage and Special Offers included is available for $89.99. The 32GB model with Special Offers is available for $119.99. The 16GB and 32GB variants that don't come with Special Offers can be had for $104.99 and $134.99 respectively. Copyright ÂŠ   Like Us",

      "text": "\nAs you’ve probably heard, Amazon is doing Black Friday a little differently this year . Rather than just offering deals on November 25 and the Monday following, Amazon has 35 days of deals available, starting today and ending on December 22.\nThere’s a massive list of the best deals available here , but do note that they aren’t all live now. There will be a steady stream of new deals going live as often as every five minutes, so be prepared to have a permanent Amazon tab open in your browser or download the Amazon shopping app from Google Play.\nAmazon does note that “many of the best Black Friday deals on Amazon heat up during the ‘Turkey 5’ – those five popular days of online shopping starting on Thanksgiving Day and continuing through Cyber Monday”. So if you want to avoid completely destroying your bank balance, you may want to restrict your impulse shopping to that time period.\n\nSome of the nicest deals on offer include big savings on various Kindles and Fire tablets, $40 off the Amazon Echo and more Amazon gear reductions. If you’re in the market for a new TV there’s plenty on offer from the likes of Samsung, Sony and LG. There’s also a bunch of discounts on toys, tools, kitchen appliances, pet products, video games, sports equipment and of course: books.\nCheck out the latest Black Friday deals from Amazon . Stay tuned for our mammoth roundup of all the best Black Friday deals from around the internet.",

Taking off the backing paper left white tear marks on the box, 2. the \"book\" was not much good, plus there was some silly polystyrene in there, 3. Trays contained overlapping discs which I hate, and 4. It wasn't obvious what disc was what film! Pretty OCD I'll admit, but I'm happier with the swing trayed individual cases. The only thing that bugs me now is to store Batman Begins with the other \"B\"s, or keep it with the two Dark Knight films in \"D\"!! I'm actually referring to the latest set which is housed in wafer thin card. The book edition went oop a while back Edited By: fuzzydunlop on Nov 16, 2016 13:48",

      "title": "Gundlach: Avoid Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google At All Costs",
      "text": "  07:35 AM EST Gundlach: Avoid Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google At All Costs \nIn his first webcast following last week’s shocking presidential election, fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital made a very bearish call on the group of so-called “FANG” stocks. \nIn case you’re unfamiliar, FANG is an acronym coined by TheStreet’s Jim Cramer a few years back that stands for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google — four of the biggest and best performing technology stocks over the past five years or so. Analysts and pundits like to group these companies together, despite the fact that they operate mostly in different businesses and their share prices aren’t really correlated. \nAnyway, Gundlach first noted that FANGs seemed to have predicted the result of the presidential election, rolling over about a week ahead of Donald Trump’s historic victory. Their downward slide has continued since the election as well, although yesterday saw a nice-sized bounce in all four names. \nAs for the future, Gundlach wouldn’t touch any of those names, echoing his comments to CNBC a few days ago: \nOn what to avoid on Trump’s election: “One thing about Trump’s win, there’s something about it [where] people just want something real. They want to see things being made. They want to see policies being changed … which means the financial engineering stocks and the momentum stocks, the FANGs, I would stay away from them in a big way.” \nLater he added, “I think the FANGs [stocks] are a bubble frankly.” \nGundlach believes the FANG names are still too expensive right now, and noted that the “fundamental machine” helping the companies disappeared over a week ago. \nOn what to avoid on Trump’s election: “One thing about Trump’s win, there’s something about it [where] people just want something real. They want to see things being made. They want to see policies being changed … which means the financial engineering stocks and the momentum stocks, the FANGs, I would stay away from them in a big way.” \nFacebook Inc ( NASDAQ:FB ) shares fell $0.42 (-0.36%) to $116.78 per share in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, FB has still gained 11.98%, but the stock is down more than 10% since the start of November. You are viewing an abbreviated republication of ETF Daily News content.

      "text": "Related Content View Photo Shopping trolleys are parked at a Morrisons supermarket in south London, Britain, August 19, 2016. REUTERS/Peter …\n\nBy James Davey\nLONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket Morrisons has launched a new service offering Amazon customers same-day deliveries of goods from its stores, deepening the relationship between the two firms but hitting shares in online grocer Ocado.\nOcado has its own distribution agreement with Morrisons and its shares fell 5 percent on concerns the extension of the Amazon partnership will mean it faces more competition.\nThe new \"Morrisons at Amazon\" service, launched on Wednesday, will allow Amazon Prime customers in and around London to order the full range of Morrisons' products online via the Prime Now app.\nIt builds on a deal Morrisons struck with Amazon in February that saw it begin wholesale supply to the Internet firm from June. Morrisons said that arrangement had started well and been extended to thousands of products.\nThe new service, which remains part of the wholesale agreement, will see orders from Amazon Prime subscribers picked by shop staff at a local Morrisons store and delivered the same day by Amazon either within one hour for 6.99 pounds or within a two-hour slot for free.\nAs with the existing wholesale deal, Amazon is able to charge its own prices. The new service will launch in selected districts in London and Hertfordshire, north of the capital.\nIt will run alongside the supermarket chain's existing online retail operation. Products ordered on the Morrisons.com website have been distributed by Ocado from its fulfilment centres around the country since 2014.\n\nOCADO RESPONDS\nOcado said it was looking into the implications of the latest Morrisons-Amazon agreement.\n\"Although we are not aware of the details, we have been assured by Morrisons that they acknowledge and respect the exclusivity provisions in our agreement, which oblige Morrisons to operate their online grocery business only through the Ocado arrangements,\" said a spokeswoman for Ocado.\nAmazon is promoting its Prime service heavily ahead of the launch on Nov.18 of motoring show \"The Grand Tour\" presented by former Top Gear front man Jeremy Clarkson.\nShares in Morrisons, up 50 percent this year as a turnaround under new boss David Potts gains pace, were little changed.\nMorrisons is the smallest of Britain's \"big four\" supermarkets which have come under pressure from the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nHowever, the online food market is expanding quickly and is expected to grow by 68 percent to 17.9 billion pounds in the five years to 2021, according to industry research group IGD.\nMorrisons said its partnership with Amazon will contribute to a 50-100 million pounds profit boost it has previously targeted.\n\"For Morrisons this broadens the offer and gives them more ways to reach customers online where they are still in the early stages of development. For Amazon this is one of a vast number of things they are trialling,\" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who has a \"market perform\" rating on Morrisons.\n\nMorrisons renegotiated its deal with Ocado in August to extend home delivery to its customers across the country using its own stores to provide products. Morrisons has said it will commence that service next year.\n($1 = 0.8010 pounds)\n\n(Editing by Susan Fenton/Keith Weir)",

      "text": "on Wednesday November 16, 2016 @09:05AM from the baby-steps dept. For the first time, Amazon is taking counterfeit sellers to court . The move comes after several sellers expressed strong concerns about their businesses getting ripped off by Amazon , which is not doing anything to curb distribution of fake, poor quality products on its ecommerce platform. Notably, even Apple had said recently that a lot of its accessories listed on Amazon are fake products . From a CNBC report: On Monday, Amazon filed suit against a group of sellers for infringing on athletic training equipment developed by TRX. In a second case, Amazon sued sellers who are offering fake versions of a patented moving product called Forearm Forklift. [...] There's no way Amazon can litigate away the problem. The company generates over $75 billion a year in commerce, and about half the volume now comes from third-party sellers. However, with Amazon showing its willingness to take abusers to court, the company can at least hope to deter counterfeit sellers with the threat of potential legal action. ",

      "text": "  09:00 AM EST Onestop Internet Survey Proves Amazon is the Threat Apparel Brands Never Saw Coming this Holiday Season \nLOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - November 16, 2016) - Onestop Internet , a leading full-spectrum eCommerce and Omni-channel solutions provider, today released survey results validating the very real threat that Amazon brings to apparel brands banking on online sales this holiday season. \nOf the 57 percent of respondents saying they plan to purchase apparel online this holiday season, 64 percent said they intend to buy apparel from Amazon. This puts significant pressure on brands already facing constant challenges in today's competitive retail climate. \n\"We always hear about Amazon being a threat to retailers like Wal-Mart, but we rarely discuss the web giant as a viable competitor to individual fashion brands,\" said Michael Wang, President and CEO of Onestop. \"We are advising our portfolio of premium apparel brands to take note and adjust their holiday strategies accordingly.\" \nPer the survey results, social media should play a key role in apparel brands' digital strategies heading into holiday. 55 percent of respondents who plan to purchase apparel online this holiday season said they would be much more likely to purchase apparel if they saw a discount promoted on social media. \nOnline shopping will play a key role in retail sales, in large part because of the transparency it provides shoppers. 44 percent of shoppers who prefer to buy apparel online value the ability to compare prices. Brands need to make sure their online inventory is priced competitively and that value is clearly communicated to drive direct sales. \nTo view complete results from the Onestop survey please click here . For more information on Onestop and its services please visit www.onestop.com . \nMethodology Details \nOnestop partnered with Survata to conduct a study to learn about consumer online shopping habits for apparel. Survata interviewed 501 online respondents ages 18 and older between October 14, 2016 and October 17, 2016. The margin of error for this study at a 95% confidence level is 4.4%. Survata is an independent consumer research firm that reaches consumers through a network of online publishers. Respondents do not receive cash or any other \"collectible\" incentive (miles, points, credits, etc.) Read more at survata.com/methodology . \nAbout Onestop Internet \nFounded in 2003, Los Angeles-based Onestop Internet is a full-spectrum eCommerce partner backed by blue-chip investors Bessemer Ventures and Fung Capital USA (Li & Fung.)

      "text": "Source: Wikimedia Commons By now everyone has noticed how Black Friday has been stretched by retailers from a single day to a weekend to a week or even more. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), a company that could never be accused of thinking small, announced Wednesday morning that it has kicked off a 35-day Black Friday event.\nFrom November 16 through December 22, the online retailer will offer new deals as often as every five minutes, culminating in what Amazon calls the “Turkey 5,” the five-day period beginning Thanksgiving Day and running through Cyber Monday.\nAmazon executive Steve Shure said:\nCustomers want to shop anywhere, any time, and any way, especially during the five super popular days for online shopping running from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. At Amazon, we keep finding new ways to make holiday shopping fun, easy, and accessible including new innovations in voice shopping with Alexa, super-fast Prime shipping, and mobile shopping with the free Amazon shopping app.\nHere are a few of the items Amazon has added to its Lightning deals for November 16:\nA Fender acoustic guitar bundle (model #0950816021-COMBO-DLX) for $111.99, a savings of 20% from the regular price of $139.99. Free shipping is available.\nA Lynec portable mini wireless remote keyboard and mouse (model #C120) that also serves as a 3D somatic handle and an Android remote multi-function handle for $11.99, a savings of 52% from the regular price of $24.99. Add this to an order totaling more than $49 and get free shipping.\nA variety of Crocs footwear is also available as a Lightning deal. Among the selections are a women’s Sarah Clog Mule (model #Sarah Clog) for $27.99, a savings of 44% from the regular price of $49.99, and a kid’s winter clog (toddler/little; model #Winter Clog -K) for $16, a savings of 45% from the regular price of $34.99. Returns are free, but an order total of at least $49 is required for free shipping from Amazon.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",
