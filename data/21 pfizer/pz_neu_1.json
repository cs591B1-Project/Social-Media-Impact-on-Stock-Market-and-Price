REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nLONDON U.S. drugs company Pfizer said it was closing two sites in Britain that employ a total of 370 people following a review of its global supply network. \n\"It is important to note that these proposals are in no way related to the result of the Brexit decision,\" the company said on Tuesday. \nIts Hospira UK (Aseptic Services) Compounding site in North London, where it employs 100 people, will close in the middle of next year, a spokesman said, while a packaging and distribution site in Havant, southern England, which employs 270 people, will close by the end of 2020. \nThe company said it would where possible mitigate against job losses resulting from the closures. \n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Alexander Smith) Next In Business News",

      "text": "\nresident and Pfizer scientist who died of esophageal cancer in 2007, delivered a message how he and other \"obsessive doctors\" and researchers are increasing the survival rates of even the toughest cancer patients by sequencing the DNA of individual tumors at a cost of about $1,000 -- a small fraction of what it cost a decade ago. \n\"This is changing the way tumors are treated,\" he said. With the new understanding that cancer cells can shut off the body's immune cells, he said, drug therapies are being used that block the cancer cell-immune cell interaction, and allow the immune system to fight back. Other drugs are being used to target the DNA of the cancer cells. \n\"The goal of the therapy is to destroy the DNA of the cancer cell,\" he said. \nBindra, who grew up in Groton , delivered his talk to more than 100 people in honor of his father, who he said \"always embodied strength and hope.\" His was the second annual lecture in the series organized by his mother, Ranjna, in honor of her husband, author of six books and several scientific papers and an active member of the local community. In his research and clinical work, Dr. Bindra , a radiation oncologist, specializes in adult and pediatric brain tumors. \nHe shared three recent cases that illustrate how patients who 15 years ago \"would have been sent right to hospice\" are now being treated successfully. \nThe first was a 9-year-old Pakistani boy with a large brain tumor caused by Ewing's Sarcoma. After a massive seizure, the boy was flown to this country for treatment, where Bindra and four other Yale doctors performed surgery, radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy and then gamma knife radiosurgery on him. \n\"Now, three years later, he's doing really, really well,\" Bindra said, showing a photo of him with the boy. \"We're Facebook friends.\" \nWith the genome of the boy's tumor sequenced, Bindra said, doctors have already identified drugs they will use if the tumor returns. \nThe second case involved a 56-year-old man with a brain tumor caused by metastatic melanoma. After the tumor was \"gamma-knifed,\" the man was given targeted drug therapies based on gene sequencing. Eight years later, the man is doing well and enjoying his grandchildren, Bindra said. \nOn a third patient, a 40-year-old man with a \"high-grade\" aggressive brain tumor, a \"repurposed\" drug originally developed for hypertension has been used to successfully drive the cancer into remission. Three years after treatment, the man is doing well. \n\"In 2013 he was only given one year to live,\" Bindra said. \nHe urged members of the audience to support funding for cancer research, emphasizing the contributions of small nonprofits such as Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation , which has raised more than $1 million for childhood cancer research. It was founded by Alexandra Scott ",

      "text": "Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding. Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding, including aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs. Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. There is no established way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, which can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). A specific antidote for ELIQUIS is not available. Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture: Patients treated with ELIQUIS undergoing spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture may develop an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.Monitor patients frequently and if neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Physicians should consider the potential benefit versus the risk of neuraxial intervention in ELIQUIS patients. Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is not recommended in these patients. Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy: Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. \nADVERSE REACTIONS The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with ELIQUIS were related to bleeding. \nTEMPORARY INTERRUPTION FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be noncritical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established. \nDRUG INTERACTIONS Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. For patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose of ELIQUIS by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Strong Dual Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with strong dual inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo. \nPREGNANCY CATEGORY B There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in pregnant women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and fetus. \nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNINGS and \nMedication Guide, available at www.bms.com . \nAbout ACROPOLIS™ \nACROPOLIS™( A pixaban Experien C e Through R eal-W O rld PO pu L at I on S tudies) is the Eliquis (apixaban) global real-world data program designed to generate additional evidence from routine clinical practice settings to further inform healthcare decision makers, including healthcare providers and payers. The ACROPOLIS program will include retrospective, outcomes-based analyses from over 10 databases around the world, including medical records, medical and pharmacy health insurance claims data, and national health data systems. \nAnalyses of real-world data allow for a broader understanding of patient outcomes associated with Eliquis outside of the clinical trial setting, as well as insight into other measures of healthcare delivery, such as hospitalization and costs. \nAbout ARISTOTLE \nARISTOTLE ( A pixaban for R eduction I n ST roke and O ther T hromboembo L ic E vents in Atrial Fibrillation) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. In ARISTOTLE, 18,201 patients were randomized (9,120 patients to Eliquis and 9,081 to warfarin). ARISTOTLE was an active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-national trial in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomized to treatment with Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients, representing 4.7 percent of all patients) or warfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), and followed for a median of 1.8 years. \nAbout the Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer Collaboration \nIn 2007, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban, an oral anticoagulant discovered by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

By inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis decreases thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis is approved for multiple indications in the U.S. based on efficacy and safety data from seven Phase 3 clinical trials. Eliquis is a prescription medicine indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF); for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery; for the treatment of DVT and PE; and to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, following initial therapy. ELIQUIS Important Safety Information WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA (A) Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. (B) Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: use of indwelling epidural catheters concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures is not known Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated. Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding. Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding, including aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs. Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. There is no established way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, which can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). A specific antidote for ELIQUIS is not available. Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture: Patients treated with ELIQUIS undergoing spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture may develop an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. \nThe risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours. \nMonitor patients frequently and if neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Physicians should consider the potential benefit versus the risk of neuraxial intervention in ELIQUIS patients. \nProsthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is not recommended in these patients. Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy: Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with ELIQUIS were related to bleeding. TEMPORARY INTERRUPTION FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be noncritical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established. DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. For patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose of ELIQUIS by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Strong Dual Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with strong dual inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo. PREGNANCY CATEGORY B There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in pregnant women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and fetus.

About ACROPOLIS™ ACROPOLIS™ ( A pixaban Experien C e Through R eal-W O rld PO pu L at I on S tudies) is the Eliquis (apixaban) global real-world data program designed to generate additional evidence from routine clinical practice settings to further inform healthcare decision makers, including healthcare providers and payers. The ACROPOLIS program will include retrospective, outcomes-based analyses from over 10 databases around the world, including medical records, medical and pharmacy health insurance claims data, and national health data systems. Analyses of real-world data allow for a broader understanding of patient outcomes associated with Eliquis outside of the clinical trial setting, as well as insight into other measures of healthcare delivery, such as hospitalization and costs. About ARISTOTLE ARISTOTLE ( A pixaban for R eduction I n ST roke and O ther T hromboembo L ic E vents in Atrial Fibrillation) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. In ARISTOTLE, 18,201 patients were randomized (9,120 patients to Eliquis and 9,081 to warfarin). ARISTOTLE was an active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-national trial in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomized to treatment with Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients, representing 4.7 percent of all patients) or warfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), and followed for a median of 1.8 years. About the Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer Collaboration In 2007, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban, an oral anticoagulant discovered by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

      "text": "Pfizer and the American Lung Association have ditched their celeb spokesman on a joint disease awareness push for pneumococcal pneumonia, the disease targeted by the drug giant's vaccine, Prevnar. The duo put a patient at the center of the \"Who Pneu?\" campaign instead.\nActor Tim Daly is sitting out the new \"Who Pneu?\" TV campaign as it shifts focus to a 51-year-old woman named Pam who contracted the disease. In the new ad, Pam and her two daughters talk about her experience with the infection--and how surprised they were when she was diagnosed.\nAmerican Lung Association TV Spot, 'Who Pneu: Pam’s Story' The ad continues the mission of the \"Who Pneu?\" effort started last year to make people 50 and older aware of their increased risk for contracting pneumococcal pneumonia, which results in hospitalizations for 250,000 adults 50+ every year.\n\"Adults age 50 and older typically believe that you have to be older and sicker to be at risk for pneumococcal pneumonia,\" a Pfizer spokeswoman said via email. \"We hope a key takeaway from Pam’s story is the reality that even if they feel healthy, adults 50 and older are at increased risk for this potentially serious lung disease due to their age alone.\"\nThe TV ad began airing in September, and to date Pfizer has spent $4.3 million in TV time, according to data from real-time TV ad tracker iSpot.tv.\nActor Daly was the face of the initial ad campaign when it was launched last September. In the ad, which also ran in movie theaters, he spoke about his mother's bout and hospitalization with pneumococcal pneumonia. It prompted some unusual responses on Twitter, including a Doctors Without Borders call for Pfizer and GSK to cut the cost of their pneumococcal shots.\nGlad to know if I run into @TimmyDaly at a coffee shop he'll be SUPER open to discuss health issues with me. #whopneu\n— Suzanne Abate (@suzanneabate) October 11, 2015 #WhoPneu over 148K people want @Pfizer @GSK to drop the price of the pneumonia 💉 #AskPharma https://t.co/yvgiPaufvV pic.twitter.com/Yy6Z5agodW\n— Doctors w/o Borders (@MSF_USA) January 13, 2016 Pfizer has a Prevnar 13 branded campaign currently running on TV and in print, with TV spending totaling $9.3 million since that effort began in October, according to iSpot.tv data.\nA blockbuster drug for Pfizer, Prevnar 13 tallied $6.3 billion in sales last year, but is expected to face gradual declines over the next five years as more people get the vaccine and the audience size shrinks.",

By inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis decreases thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis is approved for multiple indications in the U.S. based on efficacy and safety data from seven Phase 3 clinical trials. Eliquis is a prescription medicineindicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF); for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery; for the treatment of DVT and PE; and to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, following initial therapy. \nELIQUIS Important Safety Information WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA (A) Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. (B) Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: use of indwelling epidural catheters concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures is not known \nMonitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated. Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding. Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding, including aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs. Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. There is no established way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, which can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). A specific antidote for ELIQUIS is not available. Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture: Patients treated with ELIQUIS undergoing spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture may develop an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.Monitor patients frequently and if neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Physicians should consider the potential benefit versus the risk of neuraxial intervention in ELIQUIS patients. Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is not recommended in these patients. Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy: Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. \nADVERSE REACTIONS The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with ELIQUIS were related to bleeding. \nTEMPORARY INTERRUPTION FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be noncritical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established. \nDRUG INTERACTIONS Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. For patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose of ELIQUIS by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Strong Dual Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with strong dual inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo. \nPREGNANCY CATEGORY B There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in pregnant women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and fetus. \nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNINGS and \nMedication Guide, available at www.bms.com . \nAbout ACROPOLIS™ \nACROPOLIS™( A pixaban Experien C e Through R eal-W O rld PO pu L at I on S tudies) is the Eliquis (apixaban) global real-world data program designed to generate additional evidence from routine clinical practice settings to further inform healthcare decision makers, including healthcare providers and payers. The ACROPOLIS program will include retrospective, outcomes-based analyses from over 10 databases around the world, including medical records, medical and pharmacy health insurance claims data, and national health data systems. \nAnalyses of real-world data allow for a broader understanding of patient outcomes associated with Eliquis outside of the clinical trial setting, as well as insight into other measures of healthcare delivery, such as hospitalization and costs. \nAbout ARISTOTLE \nARISTOTLE ( A pixaban for R eduction I n ST roke and O ther T hromboembo L ic E vents in Atrial Fibrillation) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. In ARISTOTLE, 18,201 patients were randomized (9,120 patients to Eliquis and 9,081 to warfarin). ARISTOTLE was an active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-national trial in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomized to treatment with Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients, representing 4.7 percent of all patients) or warfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), and followed for a median of 1.8 years. \nAbout the Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer Collaboration \nIn 2007, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban, an oral anticoagulant discovered by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

By inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis decreases thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis is approved for multiple indications in the U.S. based on efficacy and safety data from seven Phase 3 clinical trials. Eliquis is a prescription medicineindicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF); for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery; for the treatment of DVT and PE; and to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, following initial therapy. \nELIQUIS Important Safety Information WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA (A) Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. (B) Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: use of indwelling epidural catheters concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures is not known Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated. Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding. Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding, including aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs. Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. There is no established way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, which can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). A specific antidote for ELIQUIS is not available. Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture: Patients treated with ELIQUIS undergoing spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture may develop an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.Monitor patients frequently and if neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Physicians should consider the potential benefit versus the risk of neuraxial intervention in ELIQUIS patients. Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is not recommended in these patients. Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy: Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. \nADVERSE REACTIONS The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with ELIQUIS were related to bleeding. \nTEMPORARY INTERRUPTION FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be noncritical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established. \nDRUG INTERACTIONS Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. For patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose of ELIQUIS by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Strong Dual Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with strong dual inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo. \nPREGNANCY CATEGORY B There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in pregnant women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and fetus. \nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNINGS and \nMedication Guide, available at www.bms.com . \nAbout ACROPOLIS™ \nACROPOLIS™( A pixaban Experien C e Through R eal-W O rld PO pu L at I on S tudies) is the Eliquis (apixaban) global real-world data program designed to generate additional evidence from routine clinical practice settings to further inform healthcare decision makers, including healthcare providers and payers. The ACROPOLIS program will include retrospective, outcomes-based analyses from over 10 databases around the world, including medical records, medical and pharmacy health insurance claims data, and national health data systems. \nAnalyses of real-world data allow for a broader understanding of patient outcomes associated with Eliquis outside of the clinical trial setting, as well as insight into other measures of healthcare delivery, such as hospitalization and costs. \nAbout ARISTOTLE \nARISTOTLE ( A pixaban for R eduction I n ST roke and O ther T hromboembo L ic E vents in Atrial Fibrillation) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. In ARISTOTLE, 18,201 patients were randomized (9,120 patients to Eliquis and 9,081 to warfarin). ARISTOTLE was an active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-national trial in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomized to treatment with Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients, representing 4.7 percent of all patients) or warfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), and followed for a median of 1.8 years. \nAbout the Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer Collaboration \nIn 2007, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban, an oral anticoagulant discovered by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

      "text": "Pfizer CEO Ian Read may have decided not to split the company up, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t looking at divesting units. Word is the company is considering doing something with its consumer health operations and that it could bring in $14 billion or more.\nAccording to a Reuters exclusive, unnamed sources caution that a deal is not a certainty for the unit, which holds iconic brands like Advil and Centrum and which generated $3.5 billion in sales last year. There was no indication whether Pfizer ($PFE) was thinking of a sale, or maybe a tax-free spinoff like it used for its animal health unit Zoetis ($ZTS) some years back, or some kind of an asset swap.\nEvercore ISI analyst John Scott told investors that the unit could potentially bring in even more than $14 billion. He pointed to the fact that when Merck ($MRK) sold its consumer health unit in 2014, it put it on the block at $10 billion. But the unit drew a lot of interest, and Bayer ended up paying more than $14 billion for it.\nScott said the Reuters report points to Pfizer’s continued “willingness to engage in corporate restructuring transactions,” even though its earlier inversion attempt and deal to merge with Allergan didn’t work out.\nRead said as much in Pfizer’s third-quarter earnings call recently when he specifically addressed whether the company might sell the consumer health operation. He called it a valuable business that was growing well, “but like all our businesses, we all look at them and we subject them to tests of are they worth more inside or outside of Pfizer?” He said Pfizer will continue to run those tests.\nThat came as Pfizer was talking about third-quarter results in which sales grew 8% to $13 billion during the quarter but earnings fell 38% to $1.32 billion (21 cents per share) as company spending increased. Take out charges for acquisitions and other one-time events, and EPS totaled 61 cents per share, which missed analysts’ estimates by a penny, according to Zacks.\nA number of companies have made significant efforts to grow their consumer health businesses, so if Pfizer does decide to divest--and goes the sales route--there might be any number of interested buyers.\nWhen the option of breaking up Pfizer was still on the table last year, Rakesh Kapoor, CEO of OTC specialist Reckitt Benckiser, declared he would be \"very interested\" in Pfizer’s consumer health products if they went up for sale.\nGlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) has put a big emphasis on consumer health since creating a JV with Novartis in an asset swap in 2014. But outgoing CEO Andrew Witty was then badgered by investors who believed the U.K. company should sell off the unit because of its slim margins. Witty has said the unit was big enough to “have a life of its own,\" but said if anything happened, it wouldn’t be this year or next. And this year the unit has outperformed earlier projections, quieting some of that talk.",

      "text": "Pfizer lowers cost of Prevnar vaccine for some charity use By The Associated Press 5 hrs ago ( … ) \nDrugmaker Pfizer says it's reducing what it charges humanitarian groups for its blockbuster vaccine against pneumonia, ear and blood infections. \nPfizer Inc.'s move to reduce Prevnar 13's price to $3.10 per dose — but only for the groups' use with refugees and in other emergency settings — follows pressure since 2009 by groups such as Doctors Without Borders. \n\"This is definitely a step in the right direction and will help to protect millions of vulnerable children,\" the charity said. \nThe biggest U.S. drugmaker previously preferred tax-deductible donations, which don't impact Prevnar's much-higher price. Pfizer's top-selling product, which requires three doses, brings it some $5 billion a year. \nBritain's GlaxoSmithKline Plc in September reduced the price of its rival Synflorix pneumococcal vaccine to $3.05 per dose for use in humanitarian emergencies.

      "text": "With the potential repeal of Obamacare, pharmaceutical firms will be the biggest winner. Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Teva and Amgen offer the best value within the sector.\nAvoid the hospital companies and choose carefully among distributors and insurance firms.\nIf you follow the healthcare sector, you probably know that many companies within the sector had sluggish performance leading up to the election. During the three months prior to the election, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA: XLV ) and the SPDR Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA: XBI ) tumbled over 10%.\nThe decline of many healthcare companies leading up to the election is primarily a result of Hilary Clinton's plan to regulate the prices in the drug market and tighten restrictions on drug delivery firms. This not only hit drug companies like Merck (NYSE: MRK ) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ), but also drug distributors like McKesson (NYSE: MCK ), Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH ), and CVS (NYSE: CVS ). McKesson's stock plunged in late October by 22% after the firm posted earnings that missed estimates and offered poor guidance based upon less brand name drug pricing increases and future pricing scrutiny with the new administration. The CEO of McKesson, John Hammergren, opined on the news release : \"Our updated outlook for Fiscal 2017 reflects McKesson's expectation of a lower profit contribution resulting from recent customer pricing activities and lower operating profit as a result of further moderating branded pharmaceutical pricing trends compared to previous expectations.\" The company lowered its full-year outlook to a range of between $12.35 a share and $12.85 a share, from a previous range of between $13.43 a share and $13.93 per share. McKesson's stock has been the worst performing large-cap company within the industry in the last three months. Here is the list of the double-digit price losers since early August.\nCompany 3-Month Return Novo Nordisk ADR -27.43 McKesson Corp. -24.47 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries -23.21 Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. -21.72 Mylan NV -21.54 CVS Health Corp. -19.98 Edwards Lifesciences Corp. -18.57 AstraZeneca PLC -17.94 AstraZeneca PLC ADR -17.5 Illumina Inc. -16.63 Allergan PLC -14.19 Cardinal Health Inc. -13.62 Smith & Nephew PLC -13.38 Amgen Inc. -10.9 Novartis AG ADR -9.98 Click to enlarge Since Donald Trump has won the election for President, he has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This puts a new focus on providers of healthcare that have benefited from Obamacare such as the hospital and insurance companies. If 12 million people lose health insurance, they will not be able to pay their hospital bills much less afford new insurance or even pricey medications.\nWhile dividend investors should not typically examine short-term events in their stock portfolios, it is a good idea to have a general scheme of what companies you're invested in and which are the most attractive under the election of Donald Trump.\nWednesday morning after the election, the market spoke in volumes. Investors bought up the beat-up pharmaceutical and biotech companies as investors felt that under the Republican administration and Congress, regulations would be cut back and any drug pricing dictums would be off the table. And although the election is of paramount importance to the healthcare sector's future, revenue growth for 2016 has been solid all this year for most of all industries outside of the drug distributors. According to FactSet, the healthcare sector is reporting the second highest revenue growth of all eleven sectors at 7.1%. Among some of the big gainers since the election are the firms I favor, primarily drug and biotech firms that will continue to benefit from new product innovation and a lack of pricing control. These 10 favored firms by my ranking system also pay out generous dividends.\nMy Rank Company Symbol Industry Yield Day After Election Performance 1 Pfizer PFE Drug Manufacturers 3.92% 7.06% 3 GlaxoSmithKline ADR GSK Drug Manufacturers 4.70% 3.21% 7 Teva Pharmaceutical ADR TEVA Drug Manufacturers 3.14% 3.10% 10 Amgen AMGN Biotechnology 2.88% 5.75% 17 Cardinal Health CAH Drugs Wholesale 2.62% 5.97% 37 Novartis NVS Drug Manufacturers 3.81% 4.22% 64 Merck MRK Drug Manufacturers 3.13% 6.06% 77 UnitedHealth Group UNH Healthcare - Insurance 1.80% -0.70% 85 Quest Diagnostics Inc. DGX Medical Laboratories & Research 1.98% -3.71% 89 Medtronic MDT Medical Equipment 2.12% -1.75% Click to enlarge My number one selection in the sector , Pfizer , surged in price this week. The New Jersey-based drug maker hit its highest stock price since September. Pfizer's pipeline of new drugs is one of the best within the industry, including Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis and Ibrance in breast cancer. The company just received EU approval for Ibrance in a specific type of breast cancer. Additionally, according to a Reuters article , Pfizer is considering the sale or spin-off of its consumer health segment for as much as $14 billion. These new funds could be utilized to enhance its research division or make an acquisition of another growing biotech company. The company will pay its next $0.30 dividend on December 1. Pfizer is expected to increase its dividend during early 2017. It typically raises its dividend by about 7% per year.\nUK-based GlaxoSmithKline followed its peers in the drug manufacturer industry and saw an increased share price this week. The company had positive Q3 earnings results that beat consensus by 8%. It has several key offerings including Bexsero in vaccines and respiratory drugs Incruse and Breo. Although it will lose Advair to generics in late 2017, its wide product mix and strong vaccine position will allow GSK to continue to grow by single digits. It is also well positioned for any adverse pricing in the U.S. as it maintains a lower revenue exposure to our country than most other pharmaceutical firms. The company has a very attractive dividend yield for investors of about 4.7%, which is well covered. It trades as an ADR on the New York Stock Exchange. The company will pay its next dividend on January 12 and is ranked #3 in our Top 100 Dividend Stocks. \nTeva Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: TEVA ) is the largest generic drug firm in the world. The Israel-based generic drug maker also reacted positively to the election result. The stock has done poorly this year primarily due to the faltering generic drug growth. It is also open to generic competition on its premier product Copaxone. But the firm continues to grow and recently acquired the generic unit of Allergan. It has a $2 billion cost savings plan in place and modest single-digit growth. The company now offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.14% and has held its quarterly dividend of $0.2890 steady since 2015. Since the company is foreign, its dividend can be slightly less predictable than domestic stocks. TEVA is expected to declare its next dividend later this month.\nAmgen (NASDAQ: AMGN ) , ranked #10 overall, jumped nearly 10% following the election results. The company, which focuses on drug manufacturing in therapeutics areas and biotechnology, has seen its dividend grow much faster than the industry and now offers a compelling yield for dividend investors. The firm has suffered recently from weaker sales growth, but we believe that its new product line of Prolia, Repatha, Xgeva, and Krprolis will offset the bio-similar generic losses of Neupogen and Neulasta. The firm has been increasing its dividend continuously for five years. Amgen will pay its next quarterly dividend of $1.00 on December 8. Following its next dividend payout, the company is expected to raise its dividend. Historically, the company's dividend increases are close to 25% per year.\nHealthcare product company, Cardinal Health , jumped nearly $7 a share since the election results on Wednesday. But the price is still well below the $90.50 level from May of 2015. It is the only non-pharmaceutical firm in my Top 50 companies. Cardinal is my favorite pharmaceutical distributor. As with McKesson, it became another drug distributor to warn that the slowing pace of branded drug-price increases along with lower generic-drug pricing has had an impact. It forecast annual adjusted earnings per share of between $5.40 and $5.60, down from $5.48 to $5.73 previously. But the firm does not have a multitude of customer renewals in the next few years, which should help keep revenue more steady than its competitors. The firm has not altered its commitment to 10% plus earnings growth over the next five years. The stock has a dividend yield of about 2.6% and has been raising its annualized dividend every year since 2005 (typically by over 10% per year). Cardinal Health will pay its next dividend of $0.4489 on January 15.\nNovartis (NYSE: NVS ) is also one of my preferred healthcare stocks and ranks #37. The Switzerland-based healthcare company offers a dividend yield of nearly 4% and will pay its next annual dividend of $2.718 on April 15. Novartis was recently featured in a detailed article .\nOther Stocks to Consider \nMerck ( MRK ) joined the drug maker rally this week, surging over 6% on Wednesday alone. The company has a dividend yield over 3% and raises its dividend by about 2.5% every year. Merck currently pays a dividend of $0.46 quarterly but will likely increase the payout during its November declaration. It has stellar opportunities in cancer and was one of my top three pharmaceutical firms last year. However, the price rise has dropped Merck's ranking below other drug firms like Pfizer, Glaxo, Amgen, and Novartis.\nShares of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH ) dipped on Wednesday, but rebounded on Thursday, jumping more than 3%. The healthcare insurance provider currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.625 and will pay its next dividend on December 15. It will be more impacted by the repeal of Obamacare, but does trade at a low valuation and maintains a solid dividend. The company has been raising its dividend since 2010, typically by about 25% annually, one of the highest rates in the healthcare industry. Its yield is just under 2%.\nQuest Diagnostics Inc. (NYSE: DGX ) declined after the initial news of the election but was able to partially rebound on Thursday. The company currently has a dividend yield of about 2% and has a $0.40 quarterly payout. It is likely that the company will declare its next dividend in December. It should be less impacted by the new healthcare laws that will go into effect next year as it provides testing services and its revenue is more stable.\nMedtronic (NYSE: MDT ) is a medical technology company that sells its products to hospitals and other healthcare institutions. Shares of Medtronic dropped after the election, which is likely due to its affiliations with establishments that are directly impacted by the future of the Affordable Care Act. The company has a yield over 2% and currently pays a $0.43 dividend. It is likely that the company will declare its next dividend in December. The stock is not priced as cheaply as it was three years ago but offers a solid yield and a lower beta. There is also the opportunity for the firm to benefit from the repeal of the medical device tax.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long AMGN, CAH, GSK, MDT, MRK, NVS, PFE, TEVA. \nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

By inhibiting Factor Xa, a key blood clotting protein, Eliquis decreases thrombin generation and blood clot formation. Eliquis is approved for multiple indications in the U.S. based on efficacy and safety data from seven Phase 3 clinical trials. Eliquis is a prescription medicineindicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF); for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery; for the treatment of DVT and PE; and to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE, following initial therapy. \nELIQUIS Important Safety Information WARNING: (A) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF ELIQUIS INCREASES THE RISK OF THROMBOTIC EVENTS, (B) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA (A) Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, increases the risk of thrombotic events. If anticoagulation with ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. (B) Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with ELIQUIS who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures. Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: use of indwelling epidural catheters concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery optimal timing between the administration of ELIQUIS and neuraxial procedures is not known Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary. Consider the benefits and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated. Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant. Bleeding Risk: ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding. Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding, including aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs. Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. There is no established way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of apixaban, which can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose (i.e., about two half-lives). A specific antidote for ELIQUIS is not available. Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture: Patients treated with ELIQUIS undergoing spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture may develop an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis.The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours.Monitor patients frequently and if neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Physicians should consider the potential benefit versus the risk of neuraxial intervention in ELIQUIS patients. Prosthetic Heart Valves: The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves and is not recommended in these patients. Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy: Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. \nADVERSE REACTIONS The most common and most serious adverse reactions reported with ELIQUIS were related to bleeding. \nTEMPORARY INTERRUPTION FOR SURGERY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONS ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be noncritical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established. \nDRUG INTERACTIONS Strong Dual Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) increase exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of bleeding. For patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose of ELIQUIS by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, or clarithromycin). In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Strong Dual Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp: Avoid concomitant use of ELIQUIS with strong dual inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s wort) because such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban and increase the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo. \nPREGNANCY CATEGORY B There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ELIQUIS in pregnant women. Treatment is likely to increase the risk of hemorrhage during pregnancy and delivery. ELIQUIS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and fetus. \nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNINGS and \nMedication Guide, available at www.bms.com . \nAbout ACROPOLIS™ \nACROPOLIS™( A pixaban Experien C e Through R eal-W O rld PO pu L at I on S tudies) is the Eliquis (apixaban) global real-world data program designed to generate additional evidence from routine clinical practice settings to further inform healthcare decision makers, including healthcare providers and payers. The ACROPOLIS program will include retrospective, outcomes-based analyses from over 10 databases around the world, including medical records, medical and pharmacy health insurance claims data, and national health data systems. \nAnalyses of real-world data allow for a broader understanding of patient outcomes associated with Eliquis outside of the clinical trial setting, as well as insight into other measures of healthcare delivery, such as hospitalization and costs. \nAbout ARISTOTLE \nARISTOTLE ( A pixaban for R eduction I n ST roke and O ther T hromboembo L ic E vents in Atrial Fibrillation) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Eliquis versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. In ARISTOTLE, 18,201 patients were randomized (9,120 patients to Eliquis and 9,081 to warfarin). ARISTOTLE was an active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-national trial in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomized to treatment with Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients, representing 4.7 percent of all patients) or warfarin (target INR range 2.0-3.0), and followed for a median of 1.8 years. \nAbout the Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer Collaboration \nIn 2007, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb entered into a worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban, an oral anticoagulant discovered by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

In addition, patients treated with celecoxib experienced significantly fewer gastrointestinal events as compared with those receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen or naproxen. The PRECISION trial helps to refute the assumption held by many physicians that naproxen treatment results in better cardiovascular outcomes as compared to other NSAIDs, including celecoxib. It is important to note that given the trial’s design – prescription doses and chronic use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors – no inferences are possible regarding the safety of intermittent use of low-dose, over-the-counter NSAIDs. \nThe results of the PRECISION study were presented today at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association in New Orleans by Dr. Steve Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and principal investigator of the PRECISION trial. In addition, the results were published today in the New   . \nPRECISION was a prospective, long-term non-inferiority trial of 24,081 patients designed to assess the cardiovascular safety of Celebrex (celecoxib) versus prescription strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen in patients with chronic pain from OA or RA. The trial, designed in 2005 based on discussions with the U.S.   was funded by Pfizer but directed independently by the Cleveland Clinic and governed by an executive committee composed of cardiology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology specialists. \n“We are pleased with the results of this landmark study. Questions about the cardiovascular safety of prescription NSAIDs have persisted since the withdrawal of Vioxx (rofecoxib) from the market in 2004,” said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc. “The study demonstrated that patients treated with prescription doses of celecoxib, ibuprofen or naproxen had similar rates of cardiovascular events and dispels the long held perception of excess cardiovascular risk associated with long term use of Celebrex.” \n  PRECISION was to assess the effects of celecoxib (100-200 mg twice daily) compared to prescription strength doses of ibuprofen (600-800 mg three times a day) or naproxen (375-500mg twice a day) on the first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke in subjects with OA or RA and who have established cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Pre-specified secondary objectives including assessments of additional cardiovascular endpoints, significant gastrointestinal events, renal events and arthritis pain improvement will be published at a later date. All subjects were provided with esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to be taken once daily as a gastro-protective agent. Patients also had the option of continuing low-dose aspirin for additional cardio-protective effects regardless of their CV risk. \nTop-Line Results: \nThe final PRECISION trial results provide statistically strong evidence that cardiovascular risk with approved doses of celecoxib is not greater than that of prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. The study showed that patients with chronic arthritic conditions and CV risk factors taking celecoxib experienced numerically fewer cardiovascular events as compared to patients receiving prescription strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. More specifically, a primary endpoint occurred in 2.3 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 2.5 percent for patients receiving naproxen and 2.7 percent for patients receiving ibuprofen. \nIn addition, regarding secondary analyses, significantly fewer GI events occurred among patients treated with celecoxib as compared with those receiving prescription doses of either ibuprofen or naproxen. More specifically, serious gastrointestinal events occurred in 1.1 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 1.5 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of naproxen and 1.6 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen. The gastrointestinal safety findings were observed despite providing all patients enrolled in the study with a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acids. In addition, the secondary endpoint involving renal events occurred with a lower frequency in patients treated with celecoxib as compared to prescription doses of ibuprofen. \n“NSAIDs are an important treatment option for millions of arthritis patients around the globe. The results of the PRECISION study underscore the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of Celebrex for the long-term treatment of chronic arthritic conditions,” said Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., chief medical officer and executive vice president of Pfizer Inc. \nAbout Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: \nArthritis is a chronic, progressive medical   inflammation, swelling and pain in and around the joints. The two most common forms of arthritic disorders are OA and RA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arthritic conditions affect more than 50 million adults in the US and are a leading cause of disability. Today, more than 80 percent of OA patients have limited mobility and 25 percent of patients are unable to perform daily tasks. \nNSAIDs : \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are among the most widely prescribed medicines in the world due to their effective anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties which enable patients to function more normally. However, there have been concerns over the chronic, long-term use of prescription NSAIDsbecause of potentially serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications such asmajor and minor bleeding, ulcers, and perforations. GI complications resulting from prescription NSAID use are among the most common drug side effects in the United States due to the use of these medications for chronic pain management in conditions such as OA and RA. \nImportant Celebrex (celecoxib) Safety Information \nAll prescription NSAIDs, like CELEBREX, ibuprofen, naproxen, and meloxicam, increase the risk of heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This may happen early in treatment and may increase with increasing doses of NSAIDs and with longer use of NSAIDs. \nCELEBREX should never be used right before or after a heart surgery called “coronary artery bypass graft” (CABG). \nAvoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to do so. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack. \nNSAID medications, like CELEBREX, cause an increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, at any time during treatment, which can occur without warning and may cause death. \nPrescription CELEBREX should be used exactly as prescribed at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time needed. \nDo not take CELEBREX if you have had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reactions to aspirin, any other NSAID medicine, or certain drugs called sulfonamides. \nBefore you take CELEBREX, inform your healthcare provider of any medical conditions you may have and of all of the medications you take, including prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements as they may increase the risk for serious side effects. \nTell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have liver or kidney problems have a history of ulcers or bleeding in the stomach or intestines have high blood pressure or heart failure have asthma are pregnant or plan to become pregnant—CELEBREX, and other NSAIDs should not be taken in late pregnancy (after 29 weeks) are breastfeeding or plan to breast feed \nCELEBREX can cause serious side effects, including: new or worse high blood pressure heart failure liver problems including liver failure kidney problems including kidney failure",

      "text": "By: Pfizer via Business Wire News Releases   16:57 PM EST Landmark Study Demonstrates Pfizer’s Celebrex (Celecoxib)Has Similar Cardiovascular Risk As Compared To Prescription Doses Of Ibuprofen and Naproxen Results of the landmark Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety vs. Ibuprofen Or Naproxen (PRECISION) demonstrated similar rates of cardiovascular risk in patients treated with prescription doses of celecoxib, ibuprofen and naproxen who had a clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), were at high risk for cardiovascular disease, and required daily treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control symptoms of arthritis. In addition, patients treated with celecoxib experienced significantly fewer gastrointestinal events as compared with those receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen or naproxen. The PRECISION trial helps to refute the assumption held by many physicians that naproxen treatment results in better cardiovascular outcomes as compared to other NSAIDs, including celecoxib. It is important to note that given the trial’s design – prescription doses and chronic use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors – no inferences are possible regarding the safety of intermittent use of low-dose, over-the-counter NSAIDs. \nResults of the landmark P rospective R andomized E valuation of C elecoxib I ntegrated S afety vs. I buprofen O r N aproxen (PRECISION) demonstrated similar rates of cardiovascular risk in patients treated with prescription doses of celecoxib, ibuprofen and naproxen who had a clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), were at high risk for cardiovascular disease, and required daily treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to control symptoms of arthritis. In addition, patients treated with celecoxib experienced significantly fewer gastrointestinal events as compared with those receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen or naproxen.

It is important to note that given the trial’s design – prescription doses and chronic use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors – no inferences are possible regarding the safety of intermittent use of low-dose, over-the-counter NSAIDs. \nThe results of the PRECISION study were presented today at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association in New Orleans by Dr. Steve Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and principal investigator of the PRECISION trial. In addition, the results were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine . \nPRECISION was a prospective, long-term non-inferiority trial of 24,081 patients designed to assess the cardiovascular safety of Celebrex (celecoxib) versus prescription strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen in patients with chronic pain from OA or RA. The trial, designed in 2005 based on discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was funded by Pfizer but directed independently by the Cleveland Clinic and governed by an executive committee composed of cardiology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology specialists. \n“We are pleased with the results of this landmark study. Questions about the cardiovascular safety of prescription NSAIDs have persisted since the withdrawal of Vioxx (rofecoxib) from the market in 2004,” said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc. “The study demonstrated that patients treated with prescription doses of celecoxib, ibuprofen or naproxen had similar rates of cardiovascular events and dispels the long held perception of excess cardiovascular risk associated with long term use of Celebrex.” \nThe primary objective of PRECISION was to assess the effects of celecoxib (100-200 mg twice daily) compared to prescription strength doses of ibuprofen (600-800 mg three times a day) or naproxen (375-500mg twice a day) on the first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke in subjects with OA or RA and who have established cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Pre-specified secondary objectives including assessments of additional cardiovascular endpoints, significant gastrointestinal events, renal events and arthritis pain improvement will be published at a later date. All subjects were provided with esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to be taken once daily as a gastro-protective agent. Patients also had the option of continuing low-dose aspirin for additional cardio-protective effects regardless of their CV risk. \nTop-Line Results: \nThe final PRECISION trial results provide statistically strong evidence that cardiovascular risk with approved doses of celecoxib is not greater than that of prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. The study showed that patients with chronic arthritic conditions and CV risk factors taking celecoxib experienced numerically fewer cardiovascular events as compared to patients receiving prescription strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. More specifically, a primary endpoint occurred in 2.3 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 2.5 percent for patients receiving naproxen and 2.7 percent for patients receiving ibuprofen. \nIn addition, regarding secondary analyses, significantly fewer GI events occurred among patients treated with celecoxib as compared with those receiving prescription doses of either ibuprofen or naproxen. More specifically, serious gastrointestinal events occurred in 1.1 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 1.5 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of naproxen and 1.6 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen. The gastrointestinal safety findings were observed despite providing all patients enrolled in the study with a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acids. In addition, the secondary endpoint involving renal events occurred with a lower frequency in patients treated with celecoxib as compared to prescription doses of ibuprofen. \n“NSAIDs are an important treatment option for millions of arthritis patients around the globe. The results of the PRECISION study underscore the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of Celebrex for the long-term treatment of chronic arthritic conditions,” said Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., chief medical officer and executive vice president of Pfizer Inc. \nAbout Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: \nArthritis is a chronic, progressive medical condition characterized by inflammation, swelling and pain in and around the joints. The two most common forms of arthritic disorders are OA and RA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arthritic conditions affect more than 50 million adults in the US and are a leading cause of disability. Today, more than 80 percent of OA patients have limited mobility and 25 percent of patients are unable to perform daily tasks. \nNSAIDs : \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are among the most widely prescribed medicines in the world due to their effective anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties which enable patients to function more normally. However, there have been concerns over the chronic, long-term use of prescription NSAIDs \nImportant Celebrex (celecoxib) Safety Information \nAll prescription NSAIDs, like CELEBREX, ibuprofen, naproxen, and meloxicam, increase the risk of heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This may happen early in treatment and may increase with increasing doses of NSAIDs and with longer use of NSAIDs. \nCELEBREX should never be used right before or after a heart surgery called “coronary artery bypass graft” (CABG). \nAvoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to do so. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack. \nNSAID medications, like CELEBREX, cause an increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, at any time during treatment, which can occur without warning and may cause death. \nPrescription CELEBREX should be used exactly as prescribed at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time needed. \nDo not take CELEBREX if you have had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reactions to aspirin, any other NSAID medicine, or certain drugs called sulfonamides. \nBefore you take CELEBREX, inform your healthcare provider of any medical conditions you may have and of all of the medications you take, including prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements as they may increase the risk for serious side effects. \nTell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have liver or kidney problems have a history of ulcers or bleeding in the stomach or intestines have high blood pressure or heart failure have asthma are pregnant or plan to become pregnant—CELEBREX, and other NSAIDs should not be taken in late pregnancy (after 29 weeks) are breastfeeding or plan to breast feed \nCELEBREX can cause serious side effects, including: new or worse high blood pressure heart failure liver problems including liver failure kidney problems including kidney failure low red blood cells (anemia) life-threatening allergic reactions life-threatening skin reactions \nOther side effects of NSAIDs, including CELEBREX are stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. \nGet emergency help right away if you have any of the following symptoms: shortness of breath or trouble breathing, chest pain, weakness in one part or side of your body, slurred speech, swelling of the face or throat. Discontinue CELEBREX at first sign of skin rash, or blisters with fever. \nClick here for full prescribing information , including BOXED WARNING and Medication Guide. \nWorking together for a healthier world® \nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

The gastrointestinal safety findings were observed despite providing all patients enrolled in the study with a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acids. In addition, the secondary endpoint involving renal events occurred with a lower frequency in patients treated with celecoxib as compared to prescription doses of ibuprofen. \n\"NSAIDs are an important treatment option for millions of arthritis patients around the globe. The results of the PRECISION study underscore the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of Celebrex for the long-term treatment of chronic arthritic conditions,\" said Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., chief medical officer and executive vice president of Pfizer Inc. \nAbout Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: \nArthritis is a chronic, progressive medical condition characterized by inflammation, swelling and pain in and around the joints. The two most common forms of arthritic disorders are OA and RA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arthritic conditions affect more than 50 million adults in the US and are a leading cause of disability. Today, more than 80 percent of OA patients have limited mobility and 25 percent of patients are unable to perform daily tasks. \nNSAIDs : \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are among the most widely prescribed medicines in the world due to their effective anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties which enable patients to function more normally. However, there have been concerns over the chronic, long-term use of prescription NSAIDsbecause of potentially serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications such asmajor and minor bleeding, ulcers, and perforations. GI complications resulting from prescription NSAID use are among the most common drug side effects in the United States due to the use of these medications for chronic pain management in conditions such as OA and RA. \nImportant Celebrex (celecoxib) Safety Information \nAll prescription NSAIDs, like CELEBREX, ibuprofen, naproxen, and meloxicam, increase the risk of heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This may happen early in treatment and may increase with increasing doses of NSAIDs and with longer use of NSAIDs. \nCELEBREX should never be used right before or after a heart surgery called \"coronary artery bypass graft\" (CABG). \nAvoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to do so. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack. \nNSAID medications, like CELEBREX, cause an increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, at any time during treatment, which can occur without warning and may cause death. \nPrescription CELEBREX should be used exactly as prescribed at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time needed. \nDo not take CELEBREX if you have had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reactions to aspirin, any other NSAID medicine, or certain drugs called sulfonamides. \nBefore you take CELEBREX, inform your healthcare provider of any medical conditions you may have and of all of the medications you take, including prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements as they may increase the risk for serious side effects. \nTell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have liver or kidney problems have a history of ulcers or bleeding in the stomach or intestines have high blood pressure or heart failure have asthma are pregnant or plan to become pregnant—CELEBREX, and other NSAIDs should not be taken in late pregnancy (after 29 weeks) are breastfeeding or plan to breast feed \nCELEBREX can cause serious side effects, including: new or worse high blood pressure heart failure liver problems including liver failure kidney problems including kidney failure",

In addition, patients treated with celecoxib experienced significantly fewer gastrointestinal events as compared with those receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen or naproxen. The PRECISION trial helps to refute the assumption held by many physicians that naproxen treatment results in better cardiovascular outcomes as compared to other NSAIDs, including celecoxib. It is important to note that given the trial’s design – prescription doses and chronic use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors – no inferences are possible regarding the safety of intermittent use of low-dose, over-the-counter NSAIDs. \nThe results of the PRECISION study were presented today at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association in New Orleans by Dr. Steve Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and principal investigator of the PRECISION trial. In addition, the results were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine . PRECISION was a prospective, long-term non-inferiority trial of 24,081 patients designed to assess the cardiovascular safety of Celebrex (celecoxib) versus prescription strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen in patients with chronic pain from OA or RA. The trial, designed in 2005 based on discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was funded by Pfizer but directed independently by the Cleveland Clinic and governed by an executive committee composed of cardiology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology specialists. “We are pleased with the results of this landmark study. Questions about the cardiovascular safety of prescription NSAIDs have persisted since the withdrawal of Vioxx (rofecoxib) from the market in 2004,” said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc. “The study demonstrated that patients treated with prescription doses of celecoxib, ibuprofen or naproxen had similar rates of cardiovascular events and dispels the long held perception of excess cardiovascular risk associated with long term use of Celebrex.” The primary objective of PRECISION was to assess the effects of celecoxib (100-200 mg twice daily) compared to prescription strength doses of ibuprofen (600-800 mg three times a day) or naproxen (375-500mg twice a day) on the first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke in subjects with OA or RA and who have established cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Pre-specified secondary objectives including assessments of additional cardiovascular endpoints, significant gastrointestinal events, renal events and arthritis pain improvement will be published at a later date. All subjects were provided with esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to be taken once daily as a gastro-protective agent. Patients also had the option of continuing low-dose aspirin for additional cardio-protective effects regardless of their CV risk. Top-Line Results: The final PRECISION trial results provide statistically strong evidence that cardiovascular risk with approved doses of celecoxib is not greater than that of prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. The study showed that patients with chronic arthritic conditions and CV risk factors taking celecoxib experienced numerically fewer cardiovascular events as compared to patients receiving prescription strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. More specifically, a primary endpoint occurred in 2.3 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 2.5 percent for patients receiving naproxen and 2.7 percent for patients receiving ibuprofen. In addition, regarding secondary analyses, significantly fewer GI events occurred among patients treated with celecoxib as compared with those receiving prescription doses of either ibuprofen or naproxen. More specifically, serious gastrointestinal events occurred in 1.1 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 1.5 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of naproxen and 1.6 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen. The gastrointestinal safety findings were observed despite providing all patients enrolled in the study with a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acids. In addition, the secondary endpoint involving renal events occurred with a lower frequency in patients treated with celecoxib as compared to prescription doses of ibuprofen. “NSAIDs are an important treatment option for millions of arthritis patients around the globe. The results of the PRECISION study underscore the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of Celebrex for the long-term treatment of chronic arthritic conditions,” said Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., chief medical officer and executive vice president of Pfizer Inc.

This may happen early in treatment and may increase with increasing doses of NSAIDs and with longer use of NSAIDs. CELEBREX should never be used right before or after a heart surgery called “coronary artery bypass graft” (CABG). Avoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to do so. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack. NSAID medications, like CELEBREX, cause an increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, at any time during treatment, which can occur without warning and may cause death. Prescription CELEBREX should be used exactly as prescribed at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time needed. Do not take CELEBREX if you have had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reactions to aspirin, any other NSAID medicine, or certain drugs called sulfonamides. Before you take CELEBREX, inform your healthcare provider of any medical conditions you may have and of all of the medications you take, including prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements as they may increase the risk for serious side effects. Tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have liver or kidney problems have a history of ulcers or bleeding in the stomach or intestines have high blood pressure or heart failure have asthma are pregnant or plan to become pregnant—CELEBREX, and other NSAIDs should not be taken in late pregnancy (after 29 weeks) are breastfeeding or plan to breast feed CELEBREX can cause serious side effects, including: new or worse high blood pressure heart failure liver problems including liver failure kidney problems including kidney failure",

Questions about the cardiovascular safety of prescription NSAIDs have persisted since the withdrawal of Vioxx (rofecoxib) from the market in 2004,\" said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc. \"The study demonstrated that patients treated with prescription doses of celecoxib, ibuprofen or naproxen had similar rates of cardiovascular events and dispels the long held perception of excess cardiovascular risk associated with long term use of Celebrex.\" \nThe primary objective of PRECISION was to assess the effects of celecoxib (100-200 mg twice daily) compared to prescription strength doses of ibuprofen (600-800 mg three times a day) or naproxen (375-500mg twice a day) on the first occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke in subjects with OA or RA and who have established cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Pre-specified secondary objectives including assessments of additional cardiovascular endpoints, significant gastrointestinal events, renal events and arthritis pain improvement will be published at a later date. All subjects were provided with esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to be taken once daily as a gastro-protective agent. Patients also had the option of continuing low-dose aspirin for additional cardio-protective effects regardless of their CV risk. \nTop-Line Results: \nThe final PRECISION trial results provide statistically strong evidence that cardiovascular risk with approved doses of celecoxib is not greater than that of prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. The study showed that patients with chronic arthritic conditions and CV risk factors taking celecoxib experienced numerically fewer cardiovascular events as compared to patients receiving prescription strength doses of ibuprofen and naproxen. More specifically, a primary endpoint occurred in 2.3 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 2.5 percent for patients receiving naproxen and 2.7 percent for patients receiving ibuprofen. \nIn addition, regarding secondary analyses, significantly fewer GI events occurred among patients treated with celecoxib as compared with those receiving prescription doses of either ibuprofen or naproxen. More specifically, serious gastrointestinal events occurred in 1.1 percent of patients receiving celecoxib as compared to 1.5 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of naproxen and 1.6 percent for patients receiving prescription doses of ibuprofen. The gastrointestinal safety findings were observed despite providing all patients enrolled in the study with a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acids. In addition, the secondary endpoint involving renal events occurred with a lower frequency in patients treated with celecoxib as compared to prescription doses of ibuprofen. \n\"NSAIDs are an important treatment option for millions of arthritis patients around the globe. The results of the PRECISION study underscore the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety of Celebrex for the long-term treatment of chronic arthritic conditions,\" said Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., chief medical officer and executive vice president of Pfizer Inc. \nAbout Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis: \nArthritis is a chronic, progressive medical condition characterized by inflammation, swelling and pain in and around the joints. The two most common forms of arthritic disorders are OA and RA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arthritic conditions affect more than 50 million adults in the US and are a leading cause of disability. Today, more than 80 percent of OA patients have limited mobility and 25 percent of patients are unable to perform daily tasks. \nNSAIDs : \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are among the most widely prescribed medicines in the world due to their effective anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties which enable patients to function more normally. However, there have been concerns over the chronic, long-term use of prescription NSAIDsbecause of potentially serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications such asmajor and minor bleeding, ulcers, and perforations. GI complications resulting from prescription NSAID use are among the most common drug side effects in the United States due to the use of these medications for chronic pain management in conditions such as OA and RA. \nImportant Celebrex (celecoxib) Safety Information \nAll prescription NSAIDs, like CELEBREX, ibuprofen, naproxen, and meloxicam, increase the risk of heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. This may happen early in treatment and may increase with increasing doses of NSAIDs and with longer use of NSAIDs. \nCELEBREX should never be used right before or after a heart surgery called \"coronary artery bypass graft\" (CABG). \nAvoid taking NSAIDs after a recent heart attack, unless your healthcare provider tells you to do so. You may have an increased risk of another heart attack if you take NSAIDs after a recent heart attack. \nNSAID medications, like CELEBREX, cause an increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, at any time during treatment, which can occur without warning and may cause death. \nPrescription CELEBREX should be used exactly as prescribed at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time needed. \nDo not take CELEBREX if you have had an asthma attack, hives, or other allergic reactions to aspirin, any other NSAID medicine, or certain drugs called sulfonamides. \nBefore you take CELEBREX, inform your healthcare provider of any medical conditions you may have and of all of the medications you take, including prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or herbal supplements as they may increase the risk for serious side effects. \nTell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have liver or kidney problems have a history of ulcers or bleeding in the stomach or intestines have high blood pressure or heart failure have asthma are pregnant or plan to become pregnant-CELEBREX, and other NSAIDs should not be taken in late pregnancy (after 29 weeks) are breastfeeding or plan to breast feed \nCELEBREX can cause serious side effects, including: new or worse high blood pressure heart failure liver problems including liver failure kidney problems including kidney failure",

      "text": "Pfizer Announces Results from Phase 3 OPAL Clinical Development Program Investigating XELJANZ ® (Tofacitinib Citrate) for Psoriatic Arthritis\nDetailed Results from Two Phase 3 Studies Featured in Oral & Poster Presentations at 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that new results from the Phase 3 O ral P soriatic A rthritis Tria L (OPAL) studies, Broaden and Beyond, will be presented at the 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting (November 11-16, Washington, DC). OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond evaluated the efficacy and safety of XELJANZ ® (tofacitinib citrate) in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who had an inadequate response (IR) to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), respectively. Detailed results from OPAL Broaden will be presented during a plenary session [#2983] for the first time at ACR/ARHP. Additionally, results from OPAL Beyond will be presented during a late-breaking abstract poster session [#10L].\n“Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic condition that can have a significant and potentially debilitating impact on people with the disease, who currently have limited treatment options,” said Michael Corbo, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “As the only JAK inhibitor being investigated in psoriatic arthritis, tofacitinib, if approved, would provide patients and healthcare professionals the first medicine in a new class to treat this disease. We continue to progress the OPAL clinical development program globally and look forward to possible future regulatory filings.”\nOPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond met their primary efficacy endpoints showing a statistically significant improvement with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily (BID) compared to treatment with placebo at three months as measured by American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.0001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001, respectively), and change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). 1a,2a\nOPAL Broaden, which was a 12-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=107) and 10 mg (n=104) BID compared to placebo (n=105) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one csDMARD and who were TNFi-naïve. 1b,1c OPAL Broaden included an active control arm of adalimumab 40 mg (n=106) administered subcutaneously every two weeks (q2 wk). The study was not designed for non-inferiority or superiority comparisons between adalimumab and tofacitinib. OPAL Beyond, a six-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=131) and 10 mg (n=132) BID compared to placebo (n=131) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one TNFi. 2b OPAL Beyond focused exclusively on the TNFi-IR patient population. In both studies, patients who were initially randomized to placebo advanced to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID in a blinded manner at three months.\nEfficacy Results\nIn OPAL Broaden, 50.5% and 60.6% of patients achieved an ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 33.3% of patients taking placebo at three months. 1d Patients taking adalimumab 40 mg q2 wk achieved an ACR20 response rate of 51.9%. 1d In OPAL Beyond, 49.6% and 47.0% of patients achieved ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 23.7% of patients taking placebo at three months. 2c In both studies, changes from baseline in HAQ-DI score were statistically significantly greater with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID compared to placebo at three months. 1d,2c\n“The findings from OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond showed that treatment with tofacitinib improved symptoms and decreased disease activity in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who do not respond well to currently available therapies, including DMARDs and TNFis,” said Philip Mease, M.D., Swedish Medical Center and University of Washington. “Tofacitinib, if approved, may be an important treatment option for people with active psoriatic arthritis.”\nSafety Findings\nThe most common adverse events (AEs) in OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond over 12 and six months, respectively, were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. 1e,2d In OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond, serious AEs were reported in 3.8% and 6.1% of patients taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and 7.5% and 3.8% of patients taking tofacitinib 5 mg BID. Among patients who received placebo for the first three months and then switched to tofacitinib, 5.8% and 3.0% of patients who went to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 7.5% and 1.5% of patients who went to tofacitinib 10 mg BID, at 12 and six months respectively, experienced serious AEs. 1f,2e In OPAL Broaden, serious AEs were reported in 8.5% of patients taking adalimumab q2 wk. 1f Overall safety findings in these studies were consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology clinical development program for tofacitinib. 1g,2f\nAbout Psoriatic Arthritis\nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disease. 3 PsA causes joint pain and stiffness, skin and nail psoriasis, swollen toes and fingers, persistent painful tendonitis and irreversible joint damage. 4 An estimated three million people in the U.S. and Europe combined have active PsA. 5 Disease prevalence may even be higher because it is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed altogether. 6,7\nAbout XELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate) and XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release\nXELJANZ ® /XELJANZ XR ® (tofacitinib citrate) is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ is not currently approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.\nPfizer is committed to advancing the science of JAK inhibition and enhancing understanding of XELJANZ through a robust clinical development program. The efficacy and safety profile of XELJANZ has been studied in approximately 6,300 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), amounting to more than 21,000 patient-years of drug exposure in the global clinical development program. 8\nXELJANZ/XELJANZ XR U.S. Label Information\nXELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate)/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may be used as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in combination with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, is not recommended.\nIt is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in people with hepatitis B or C. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not for people with severe liver problems. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in children. Important Safety Information\nXELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor them closely for signs and symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if they have any kind of infection unless their healthcare provider tells them it is okay. People may be at a higher risk of developing shingles. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR therapy. Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestines. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis), or who have a narrowing within their digestive tract. Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away or a change in bowel habits. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can cause changes in certain lab test results including low blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before starting patients on XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR and while they are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results. Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, a registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972.\nPatients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR or breastfeed. They should not do both. In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Healthcare providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).

      "text": "Pfizer Announces Results from Phase 3 OPAL Clinical Development Program Investigating XELJANZ ® (Tofacitinib Citrate) for Psoriatic Arthritis Detailed Results from Two Phase 3 Studies Featured in Oral & Poster Presentations at 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting November 15, 2016 08:00   \nNEW YORK- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that new results from the Phase 3 O ral P soriatic A rthritis Tria L (OPAL) studies, Broaden and Beyond, will be presented at the 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting (November 11-16, Washington, DC). OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond evaluated the efficacy and safety of XELJANZ ® (tofacitinib citrate) in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who had an inadequate response (IR) to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), respectively. Detailed results from OPAL Broaden will be presented during a plenary session [#2983] for the first time at ACR/ARHP. Additionally, results from OPAL Beyond will be presented during a late-breaking abstract poster session [#10L]. \n“Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic condition that can have a significant and potentially debilitating impact on people with the disease, who currently have limited treatment options,” said Michael Corbo, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “As the only JAK inhibitor being investigated in psoriatic arthritis, tofacitinib, if approved, would provide patients and healthcare professionals the first medicine in a new class to treat this disease. We continue to progress the OPAL clinical development program globally and look forward to possible future regulatory filings.” \nOPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond met their primary efficacy endpoints showing a statistically significant improvement with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily (BID) compared to treatment with placebo at three months as measured by American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.0001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001, respectively), and change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). 1a,2a \nOPAL Broaden, which was a 12-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=107) and 10 mg (n=104) BID compared to placebo (n=105) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one csDMARD and who were TNFi-naïve. 1b,1c OPAL Broaden included an active control arm of adalimumab 40 mg (n=106) administered subcutaneously every two weeks (q2 wk). The study was not designed for non-inferiority or superiority comparisons between adalimumab and tofacitinib. OPAL Beyond, a six-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=131) and 10 mg (n=132) BID compared to placebo (n=131) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one TNFi. 2b OPAL Beyond focused exclusively on the TNFi-IR patient population. In both studies, patients who were initially randomized to placebo advanced to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID in a blinded manner at three months. \nEfficacy Results \nIn OPAL Broaden, 50.5% and 60.6% of patients achieved an ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 33.3% of patients taking placebo at three months. 1d Patients taking adalimumab 40 mg q2 wk achieved an ACR20 response rate of 51.9%. 1d In OPAL Beyond, 49.6% and 47.0% of patients achieved ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 23.7% of patients taking placebo at three months. 2c In both studies, changes from baseline in HAQ-DI score were statistically significantly greater with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID compared to placebo at three months. 1d,2c \n“The findings from OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond showed that treatment with tofacitinib improved symptoms and decreased disease activity in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who do not respond well to currently available therapies, including DMARDs and TNFis,” said Philip Mease, M.D., Swedish Medical Center and University of Washington. “Tofacitinib, if approved, may be an important treatment option for people with active psoriatic arthritis.” \nSafety Findings \nThe most common adverse events (AEs) in OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond over 12 and six months, respectively, were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. 1e,2d In OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond, serious AEs were reported in 3.8% and 6.1% of patients taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and 7.5% and 3.8% of patients taking tofacitinib 5 mg BID. Among patients who received placebo for the first three months and then switched to tofacitinib, 5.8% and 3.0% of patients who went to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 7.5% and 1.5% of patients who went to tofacitinib 10 mg BID, at 12 and six months respectively, experienced serious AEs. 1f,2e In OPAL Broaden, serious AEs were reported in 8.5% of patients taking adalimumab q2 wk. 1f Overall safety findings in these studies were consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology clinical development program for tofacitinib. 1g,2f \nAbout Psoriatic Arthritis \nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disease. 3 PsA causes joint pain and stiffness, skin and nail psoriasis, swollen toes and fingers, persistent painful tendonitis and irreversible joint damage. 4 An estimated three million people in the U.S. and Europe combined have active PsA. 5 Disease prevalence may even be higher because it is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed altogether. 6,7 \nAbout XELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate) and XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release \nXELJANZ ® /XELJANZ XR ® (tofacitinib citrate) is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ is not currently approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. \nPfizer is committed to advancing the science of JAK inhibition and enhancing understanding of XELJANZ through a robust clinical development program. The efficacy and safety profile of XELJANZ has been studied in approximately 6,300 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), amounting to more than 21,000 patient-years of drug exposure in the global clinical development program. 8 \nXELJANZ/XELJANZ XR U.S. Label Information \nXELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate)/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may be used as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in combination with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, is not recommended. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in people with hepatitis B or C. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not for people with severe liver problems. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in children. \nImportant Safety Information XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor them closely for signs and symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if they have any kind of infection unless their healthcare provider tells them it is okay. People may be at a higher risk of developing shingles. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR therapy. Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestines. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis), or who have a narrowing within their digestive tract. Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away or a change in bowel habits. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can cause changes in certain lab test results including low blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before starting patients on XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR and while they are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results. Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. \nIt is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, a registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR or breastfeed. They should not do both. In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Healthcare providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis). \nPlease click the direct link to the full prescribing information for XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including boxed warning and Medication Guide: http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=959 . \nWorking together for a healthier world® \nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

      "text": "Pfizer Announces Results from Phase 3 OPAL Clinical Development Program Investigating XELJANZ® (Tofacitinib Citrate) for Psoriatic Arthritis Detailed Results from Two Phase 3 Studies Featured in Oral & Poster Presentations at 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting Tuesday, November 15, 2016 8:00 am EST Dateline: US7170811035 \"Tofacitinib, if approved, may be an important treatment option for people with active psoriatic arthritis.\" \nNEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that new results from the Phase 3 O ral P soriatic A rthritis Tria L (OPAL) studies, Broaden and Beyond, will be presented at the 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting (November 11-16, Washington, DC). OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond evaluated the efficacy and safety of XELJANZ ® (tofacitinib citrate) in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who had an inadequate response (IR) to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), respectively. Detailed results from OPAL Broaden will be presented during a plenary session [#2983] for the first time at ACR/ARHP. Additionally, results from OPAL Beyond will be presented during a late-breaking abstract poster session [#10L]. \n“Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic condition that can have a significant and potentially debilitating impact on people with the disease, who currently have limited treatment options,” said Michael Corbo, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “As the only JAK inhibitor being investigated in psoriatic arthritis, tofacitinib, if approved, would provide patients and healthcare professionals the first medicine in a new class to treat this disease. We continue to progress the OPAL clinical development program globally and look forward to possible future regulatory filings.” \nOPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond met their primary efficacy endpoints showing a statistically significant improvement with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily (BID) compared to treatment with placebo at three months as measured by American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.0001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001, respectively), and change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). 1a,2a \nOPAL Broaden, which was a 12-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=107) and 10 mg (n=104) BID compared to placebo (n=105) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one csDMARD and who were TNFi-naïve. 1b,1c OPAL Broaden included an active control arm of adalimumab 40 mg (n=106) administered subcutaneously every two weeks (q2 wk). The study was not designed for non-inferiority or superiority comparisons between adalimumab and tofacitinib. OPAL Beyond, a six-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=131) and 10 mg (n=132) BID compared to placebo (n=131) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one TNFi. 2b OPAL Beyond focused exclusively on the TNFi-IR patient population. In both studies, patients who were initially randomized to placebo advanced to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID in a blinded manner at three months. \nEfficacy Results \nIn OPAL Broaden, 50.5% and 60.6% of patients achieved an ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 33.3% of patients taking placebo at three months. 1d Patients taking adalimumab 40 mg q2 wk achieved an ACR20 response rate of 51.9%. 1d In OPAL Beyond, 49.6% and 47.0% of patients achieved ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 23.7% of patients taking placebo at three months. 2c In both studies, changes from baseline in HAQ-DI score were statistically significantly greater with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID compared to placebo at three months. 1d,2c \n“The findings from OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond showed that treatment with tofacitinib improved symptoms and decreased disease activity in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who do not respond well to currently available therapies, including DMARDs and TNFis,” said Philip Mease, M.D., Swedish Medical Center and University of Washington. “Tofacitinib, if approved, may be an important treatment option for people with active psoriatic arthritis.” \nSafety Findings \nThe most common adverse events (AEs) in OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond over 12 and six months, respectively, were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. 1e,2d In OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond, serious AEs were reported in 3.8% and 6.1% of patients taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and 7.5% and 3.8% of patients taking tofacitinib 5 mg BID. Among patients who received placebo for the first three months and then switched to tofacitinib, 5.8% and 3.0% of patients who went to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 7.5% and 1.5% of patients who went to tofacitinib 10 mg BID, at 12 and six months respectively, experienced serious AEs. 1f,2e In OPAL Broaden, serious AEs were reported in 8.5% of patients taking adalimumab q2 wk. 1f Overall safety findings in these studies were consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology clinical development program for tofacitinib. 1g,2f \nAbout Psoriatic Arthritis \nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disease. 3 PsA causes joint pain and stiffness, skin and nail psoriasis, swollen toes and fingers, persistent painful tendonitis and irreversible joint damage. 4 An estimated three million people in the U.S. and Europe combined have active PsA. 5 Disease prevalence may even be higher because it is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed altogether. 6,7 \nAbout XELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate) and XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release \nXELJANZ ® /XELJANZ XR ® (tofacitinib citrate) is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ is not currently approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. \nPfizer is committed to advancing the science of JAK inhibition and enhancing understanding of XELJANZ through a robust clinical development program. The efficacy and safety profile of XELJANZ has been studied in approximately 6,300 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), amounting to more than 21,000 patient-years of drug exposure in the global clinical development program. 8 \nXELJANZ/XELJANZ XR U.S. Label Information \nXELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate)/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may be used as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in combination with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, is not recommended. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in people with hepatitis B or C. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not for people with severe liver problems. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in children. \nImportant Safety Information XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor them closely for signs and symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if they have any kind of infection unless their healthcare provider tells them it is okay. People may be at a higher risk of developing shingles. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR therapy. Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestines. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis), or who have a narrowing within their digestive tract. Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away or a change in bowel habits. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can cause changes in certain lab test results including low blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before starting patients on XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR and while they are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results. Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. \nIt is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, a registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR or breastfeed. They should not do both. In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Healthcare providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis). \nPlease click the direct link to the full prescribing information for XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including boxed warning and Medication Guide: http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=959 . \nWorking together for a healthier world® \n  health care products.

      "text": "Pfizer Announces Results from Phase 3 OPAL Clinical Development Program Investigating XELJANZ® (Tofacitinib Citrate) for Psoriatic Arthritis [November 15, 2016] Pfizer Announces Results from Phase 3 OPAL Clinical Development Program Investigating XELJANZ® (Tofacitinib Citrate) for Psoriatic Arthritis Tweet \nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that new results from the Phase 3 O ral P soriatic A rthritis Tria L (OPAL) studies, Broaden and Beyond, will be presented at the 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting (November 11-16, Washington, DC). OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond evaluated the efficacy and safety of XELJANZ ® (tofacitinib citrate) in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who had an inadequate response (IR) to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), respectively. Detailed results from OPAL Broaden will be presented during a plenary session [#2983] for the first time at ACR/ARHP. Additionally, results from OPAL Beyond will be presented during a late-breaking abstract poster session [#10L]. \n\"Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic condition that can have a significant and potentially debilitating impact on people with the disease, who currently have limited treatment options,\" said Michael Corbo, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. \"As the only JAK inhibitor being investigated in psoriatic arthritis, tofacitinib, if approved, would provide patients and healthcare professionals the first medicine in a new class to treat this disease. We continue to progress the OPAL clinical development program globally and look forward to possible future regulatory filings.\" \nOPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond met their primary efficacy endpoints showing a statistically significant improvement with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily (BID) compared to treatment with placebo at three months as measured by American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response (OPAL Broaden: p=0.05 and p<0.0001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001, respectively), and change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score (OPAL Broaden: p=0.05 and p<0.001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). 1a,2a \nOPAL Broaden, which was a 12-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=107) and 10 mg (n=104) BID compared to placebo (n=105) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one csDMARD and who were TNFi-naïve. 1b,1c OPAL Broaden included an active control arm of adalimumab 40 mg (n=106) administered subcutaneously every two weeks (q2 wk). The study was not designed for non-inferiority or superiority comparisons between adalimumab and tofacitinib. OPAL Beyond, a six-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=131) and 10 mg (n=132) BID compared to placebo (n=131) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one TNFi. 2b OPAL Beyond focused exclusively on the TNFi-IR patient population. In both studies, patients who were initially randomized to placebo advanced to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID in a blinded manner at three months. \nEfficacy Results \nIn OPAL Broaden, 50.5% and 60.6% of patients achieved an ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 33.3% of patients taking placebo at three months. 1d Patients taking adalimumab 40 mg q2 wk achieved an ACR20 response rate of 51.9%. 1d In OPAL Beyond, 49.6% and 47.0% of patients achieved ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 23.7% of patients taking placebo at three months. 2c In both studies, changes from baseline in HAQ-DI score were statistically significantly greater with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID compared to placebo at three months. 1d,2c \n\"The findings from OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond showed that treatment with tofacitinib improved symptoms and decreased disease activity in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who do not respond well to currently available therapies, including DMARDs and TNFis,\" said Philip Mease, M.D., Swedish Medical Center and University of Washington. \"Tofacitinib, if approved, may be an important treatment option for people with active psoriatic arthritis.\" \nSafety Findings \nThe most common adverse events (AEs) in OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond over 12 and six months, respectively, were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. 1e,2d In OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond, serious AEs were reported in 3.8% and 6.1% of patients taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and 7.5% and 3.8% of patients taking tofacitinib 5 mg BID. Among patients who received placebo for the first three months and then switched to tofacitinib, 5.8% and 3.0% of patients who went to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 7.5% and 1.5% of patients who went to tofacitinib 10 mg BID, at 12 and six months respectively, experienced serious AEs. 1f,2e In OPAL Broaden, serious AEs were reported in 8.5% of patients taking adalimumab q2 wk. 1f Overall safety findings in these studies were consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology clinical development program for tofacitinib. 1g,2f \nAbout Psoriatic Arthritis \nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disease. 3 PsA causes joint pain and stiffness, skin and nail psoriasis, swollen toes and fingers, persistent painful tendonitis and irreversible joint damage. 4 An estimated three million people in the U.S. and Europe combined have active PsA. 5 Disease prevalence may even be higher because it is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed altogether. 6,7 \nAbout XELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate) and XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release \nXELJANZ ® /XELJANZ XR ® (tofacitinib citrate) is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ is not currently approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. \nPfizer is committed to advancing the science of JAK inhibition and enhancing understanding of XELJANZ through a robust clinical development program. The efficacy and safety profile of XELJANZ has been studied in approximately 6,300 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), amounting to more than 21,000 patient-years of drug exposure in the global clinical development program. 8 \nXELJANZ/XELJANZ XR U.S. Label Information \nXELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate)/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may be used as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in combination with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, is not recommended. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in people with hepatitis B or C. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not for people with severe liver problems. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in children. \nImportant Safety Information XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor them closely for signs and symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if they have any kind of infection unless their healthcare provider tells them it is okay. People may be at a higher risk of developing shingles. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR therapy. Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestines. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis), or who have a narrowing within their digestive tract. Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away or a change in bowel habits. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can cause changes in certain lab test results including low blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before starting patients on XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR and while they are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results. Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. \nIt is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, a registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR or breastfeed. They should not do both. In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Healthcare providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis). \nPlease click the direct link to the full prescribing information for XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including boxed warning and Medication Guide: http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=959 . \nWorking together for a healthier world® \nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

(NYSE:PFE) announced today that new results from the Phase 3 O ral P soriatic A rthritis Tria L (OPAL) studies, Broaden and Beyond, will be presented at the 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting (November 11-16, Washington, DC). OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond evaluated the efficacy and safety of XELJANZ ® (tofacitinib citrate) in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who had an inadequate response (IR) to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), respectively. Detailed results from OPAL Broaden will be presented during a plenary session [#2983] for the first time at ACR/ARHP. Additionally, results from OPAL Beyond will be presented during a late-breaking abstract poster session [#10L]. \n“Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic condition that can have a significant and potentially debilitating impact on people with the disease, who currently have limited treatment options,” said Michael Corbo, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “As the only JAK inhibitor being investigated in psoriatic arthritis, tofacitinib, if approved, would provide patients and healthcare professionals the first medicine in a new class to treat this disease. We continue to progress the OPAL clinical development program globally and look forward to possible future regulatory filings.” \nOPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond met their primary efficacy endpoints showing a statistically significant improvement with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily (BID) compared to treatment with placebo at three months as measured by American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.0001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001, respectively), and change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). 1a,2a \nOPAL Broaden, which was a 12-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=107) and 10 mg (n=104) BID compared to placebo (n=105) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one csDMARD and who were TNFi-naïve. 1b,1c OPAL Broaden included an active control arm of adalimumab 40 mg (n=106) administered subcutaneously every two weeks (q2 wk). The study was not designed for non-inferiority or superiority comparisons between adalimumab and tofacitinib. OPAL Beyond, a six-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=131) and 10 mg (n=132) BID compared to placebo (n=131) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one TNFi. 2b OPAL Beyond focused exclusively on the TNFi-IR patient population. In both studies, patients who were initially randomized to placebo advanced to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID in a blinded manner at three months. \nEfficacy Results \nIn OPAL Broaden, 50.5% and 60.6% of patients achieved an ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 33.3% of patients taking placebo at three months. 1d Patients taking adalimumab 40 mg q2 wk achieved an ACR20 response rate of 51.9%. 1d In OPAL Beyond, 49.6% and 47.0% of patients achieved ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 23.7% of patients taking placebo at three months. 2c In both studies, changes from baseline in HAQ-DI score were statistically significantly greater with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID compared to placebo at three months. 1d,2c \n“The findings from OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond showed that treatment with tofacitinib improved symptoms and decreased disease activity in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who do not respond well to currently available therapies, including DMARDs and TNFis,” said Philip Mease, M.D., Swedish Medical Center and University of Washington. “Tofacitinib, if approved, may be an important treatment option for people with active psoriatic arthritis.” \nSafety Findings \nThe most common adverse events (AEs) in OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond over 12 and six months, respectively, were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. 1e,2d In OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond, serious AEs were reported in 3.8% and 6.1% of patients taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and 7.5% and 3.8% of patients taking tofacitinib 5 mg BID. Among patients who received placebo for the first three months and then switched to tofacitinib, 5.8% and 3.0% of patients who went to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 7.5% and 1.5% of patients who went to tofacitinib 10 mg BID, at 12 and six months respectively, experienced serious AEs. 1f,2e In OPAL Broaden, serious AEs were reported in 8.5% of patients taking adalimumab q2 wk. 1f Overall safety findings in these studies were consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology clinical development program for tofacitinib. 1g,2f \nAbout Psoriatic Arthritis \nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disease. 3 PsA causes joint pain and stiffness, skin and nail psoriasis, swollen toes and fingers, persistent painful tendonitis and irreversible joint damage. 4 An estimated three million people in the U.S. and Europe combined have active PsA. 5 Disease prevalence may even be higher because it is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed altogether. 6,7 \nAbout XELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate) and XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release \nXELJANZ ® /XELJANZ XR ® (tofacitinib citrate) is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ is not currently approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. \nPfizer is committed to advancing the science of JAK inhibition and enhancing understanding of XELJANZ through a robust clinical development program. The efficacy and safety profile of XELJANZ has been studied in approximately 6,300 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), amounting to more than 21,000 patient-years of drug exposure in the global clinical development program. 8 \nXELJANZ/XELJANZ XR U.S. Label Information \nXELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate)/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may be used as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in combination with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, is not recommended. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in people with hepatitis B or C. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not for people with severe liver problems. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in children. \nImportant Safety Information XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor them closely for signs and symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if they have any kind of infection unless their healthcare provider tells them it is okay. People may be at a higher risk of developing shingles. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR therapy. Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestines. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis), or who have a narrowing within their digestive tract. Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away or a change in bowel habits. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can cause changes in certain lab test results including low blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before starting patients on XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR and while they are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results. Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. \nIt is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, a registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR or breastfeed. They should not do both. In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Healthcare providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis). \nPlease click the direct link to the full prescribing information for XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including boxed warning and Medication Guide: http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=959 . \nWorking together for a healthier world® \nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

The efficacy and safety profile of XELJANZ has been studied in approximately 6,300 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), amounting to more than 21,000 patient-years of drug exposure in the global clinical development program. 8 \nXELJANZ/XELJANZ XR U.S. Label Information \nXELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate)/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may be used as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in combination with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, is not recommended. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in people with hepatitis B or C. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not for people with severe liver problems. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in children. \nImportant Safety Information XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor them closely for signs and symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if they have any kind of infection unless their healthcare provider tells them it is okay. People may be at a higher risk of developing shingles. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR therapy. Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestines. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis), or who have a narrowing within their digestive tract. Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away or a change in bowel habits. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can cause changes in certain lab test results including low blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before starting patients on XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR and while they are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results. Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. \nIt is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, a registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972. Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR or breastfeed. They should not do both. In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Healthcare providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis). \nPlease click the direct link to the full prescribing information for XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including boxed warning and Medication Guide: http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=959 . \nWorking together for a healthier world® \nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

      "text": "Detailed Results from Two Phase 3 Studies Featured in Oral & Poster Presentations at 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting Tuesday, November 15, 2016 8:00 am EST Public Company Information: \"The findings from OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond showed that treatment with tofacitinib improved symptoms and decreased disease activity in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who do not respond well to currently available therapies, including DMARDs and TNFis\" \nNEW YORK--()--Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that new results from the Phase 3 O ral P soriatic A rthritis Tria L (OPAL) studies, Broaden and Beyond, will be presented at the 2016 ACR/ARHP Annual Meeting (November 11-16, Washington, DC). OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond evaluated the efficacy and safety of XELJANZ ® (tofacitinib citrate) in adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who had an inadequate response (IR) to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), respectively. Detailed results from OPAL Broaden will be presented during a plenary session [#2983] for the first time at ACR/ARHP. Additionally, results from OPAL Beyond will be presented during a late-breaking abstract poster session [#10L]. \n“Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic condition that can have a significant and potentially debilitating impact on people with the disease, who currently have limited treatment options,” said Michael Corbo, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation & Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “As the only JAK inhibitor being investigated in psoriatic arthritis, tofacitinib, if approved, would provide patients and healthcare professionals the first medicine in a new class to treat this disease. We continue to progress the OPAL clinical development program globally and look forward to possible future regulatory filings.” \nOPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond met their primary efficacy endpoints showing a statistically significant improvement with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily (BID) compared to treatment with placebo at three months as measured by American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.0001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001, respectively), and change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score (OPAL Broaden: p≤0.05 and p<0.001; OPAL Beyond: p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). 1a,2a \nOPAL Broaden, which was a 12-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=107) and 10 mg (n=104) BID compared to placebo (n=105) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one csDMARD and who were TNFi-naïve. 1b,1c OPAL Broaden included an active control arm of adalimumab 40 mg (n=106) administered subcutaneously every two weeks (q2 wk). The study was not designed for non-inferiority or superiority comparisons between adalimumab and tofacitinib. OPAL Beyond, a six-month duration trial with a three month placebo-controlled period, evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg (n=131) and 10 mg (n=132) BID compared to placebo (n=131) in adult patients with active PsA who had an IR to at least one TNFi. 2b OPAL Beyond focused exclusively on the TNFi-IR patient population. In both studies, patients who were initially randomized to placebo advanced to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID in a blinded manner at three months. \nEfficacy Results \nIn OPAL Broaden, 50.5% and 60.6% of patients achieved an ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 33.3% of patients taking placebo at three months. 1d Patients taking adalimumab 40 mg q2 wk achieved an ACR20 response rate of 51.9%. 1d In OPAL Beyond, 49.6% and 47.0% of patients achieved ACR20 response with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID, respectively, compared to 23.7% of patients taking placebo at three months. 2c In both studies, changes from baseline in HAQ-DI score were statistically significantly greater with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID compared to placebo at three months. 1d,2c \n“The findings from OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond showed that treatment with tofacitinib improved symptoms and decreased disease activity in patients with active psoriatic arthritis who do not respond well to currently available therapies, including DMARDs and TNFis,” said Philip Mease, M.D., Swedish Medical Center and University of Washington. “Tofacitinib, if approved, may be an important treatment option for people with active psoriatic arthritis.” \nSafety Findings \nThe most common adverse events (AEs) in OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond over 12 and six months, respectively, were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. 1e,2d In OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond, serious AEs were reported in 3.8% and 6.1% of patients taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and 7.5% and 3.8% of patients taking tofacitinib 5 mg BID. Among patients who received placebo for the first three months and then switched to tofacitinib, 5.8% and 3.0% of patients who went to tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 7.5% and 1.5% of patients who went to tofacitinib 10 mg BID, at 12 and six months respectively, experienced serious AEs. 1f,2e In OPAL Broaden, serious AEs were reported in 8.5% of patients taking adalimumab q2 wk. 1f Overall safety findings in these studies were consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology clinical development program for tofacitinib. 1g,2f \nAbout Psoriatic Arthritis \nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disease. 3 PsA causes joint pain and stiffness, skin and nail psoriasis, swollen toes and fingers, persistent painful tendonitis and irreversible joint damage. 4 An estimated three million people in the U.S. and Europe combined have active PsA. 5 Disease prevalence may even be higher because it is often misdiagnosed or goes undiagnosed altogether. 6,7 \nAbout XELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate) and XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release \nXELJANZ ® /XELJANZ XR ® (tofacitinib citrate) is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ is not currently approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. \nPfizer is committed to advancing the science of JAK inhibition and enhancing understanding of XELJANZ through a robust clinical development program. The efficacy and safety profile of XELJANZ has been studied in approximately 6,300 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), amounting to more than 21,000 patient-years of drug exposure in the global clinical development program. 8 \nXELJANZ/XELJANZ XR U.S. Label Information \nXELJANZ (tofacitinib citrate)/XELJANZ XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended-release is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may be used as a single agent or in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in combination with biologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, is not recommended. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in people with hepatitis B or C. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not for people with severe liver problems. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in children. \nImportant Safety Information XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor them closely for signs and symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if they have any kind of infection unless their healthcare provider tells them it is okay. People may be at a higher risk of developing shingles. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the way the immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, can happen in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ. Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR therapy. Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestines. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis), or who have a narrowing within their digestive tract. Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away or a change in bowel habits. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can cause changes in certain lab test results including low blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before starting patients on XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR and while they are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for these side effects.

      "text": "PALOMA-2 Phase 3 Study Published In The New England Journal Of Medicine Demonstrates Clinical Benefit Of Pfizer’s IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) In First-Line ER+, HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer First-in-class IBRANCE in Combination with Letrozole Exceeded 2 Years in Median PFS  09   \nNEW YORK- Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that detailed results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine . These data, presented at the 52 nd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June, further demonstrate the clinical benefit of IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) as initial therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+, HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The PALOMA-2 study showed the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole extended progression-free survival (PFS), or the amount of time before tumor growth, by more than 10 months compared with letrozole plus placebo. Further, the study demonstrated that the median PFS of the IBRANCE and letrozole combination exceeded two years – making it the first and only treatment for this population of women to do so in a randomized Phase 3 study. 1 \n“The median PFS of more than two years observed in this study is unprecedented for this patient population,” said Veronique Dieras, M.D., medical oncologist and head of clinical research, Clinical Investigational Unit Chef de Service Recherche Clinique, Unité d'Investigation Clinique Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France. “Building on the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 data, the results of PALOMA-2 provide additional evidence that the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole is a meaningful advancement for these women.” \n“Since its accelerated approval in 2015, IBRANCE in combination with letrozole has become a standard of care for the treatment of post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer,” said Hope Rugo, M.D., professor of medicine and director of breast oncology and clinical trials education at the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. “We now have seen consistent results across three randomized trials in which the addition of IBRANCE to an endocrine therapy significantly prolonged PFS compared to the endocrine therapy alone.” \nIn the trial, median PFS for women treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole was 24.8 months (95% CI, 22.1-not estimable) compared with 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.9-17.1) for women treated with letrozole plus placebo (HR=0.58 [95% CI, 0.46-0.72], p<0.001), a 42% reduction in the risk of disease progression. \n“IBRANCE has raised the bar for new treatments in hormone-receptor positive advanced breast cancer. The results of this Phase 3 trial add to the growing body of clinical data in support of IBRANCE and translates into hope for patients,” said Mace Rothenberg, M.D., chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We look forward to sharing the full PALOMA-2 data with global regulatory authorities with the goal of making IBRANCE available to more women around the world. Pfizer is proud of being a leader in the development of innovative therapies like IBRANCE that make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.” \nSafety results were consistent with PALOMA-1 and no major unexpected safety findings were observed. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events with IBRANCE plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (66.4% vs 1.4%), leukopenia (24.8% vs 0%), infections (6.5% vs 3.2%) and anemia (5.4% vs 1.8%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of patients in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group and none of the patients in the placebo plus letrozole group. For more information, please see Important Safety Information for IBRANCE below. 2 \nIBRANCE first was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2015 and is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole was approved under accelerated approval based on PFS results from the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 study. As stated at the time of the approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, the double-blind, Phase 3 PALOMA-2 study. 2 A supplemental New Drug Application to support the conversion of the accelerated approval to regular approval based on the results of PALOMA-2 has been submitted to the FDA. \nIBRANCE also is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of HR+, HER2-advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy based on results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study. 2 \nSince the initial approval in February 2015, more than 40,000 women have been prescribed IBRANCE by more than 8,500 prescribers in the U.S. \nAs previously disclosed, the European Commission has approved IBRANCE for the treatment of women with HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The approval is for IBRANCE to be used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor. The approval also covers the use of IBRANCE in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. In total, IBRANCE is approved in more than 50 countries. \nAbout PALOMA-2 \nPALOMA-2 is a randomized (2:1), multicenter, multinational, double-blind Phase 3 study designed to assess the PFS of IBRANCE (125 mg orally once daily for three out of four weeks in repeated cycles) in combination with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily continuously) versus letrozole plus placebo as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. PALOMA-2 evaluated a total of 666 women from 186 global sites in 17 countries. \nThe full prescribing information for IBRANCE can be found at www.pfizer.com . \nAbout IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) 125 mg capsules \nIBRANCE is the first and only FDA approved oral inhibitor of CDKs 4 and 6, 2 which are key regulators of the cell cycle that trigger cellular progression. 3,4 In the U.S., IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women, or fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole is approved under accelerated approval based on PFS. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, PALOMA-2. 2 \nImportant IBRANCE (palbociclib) Safety Information from the U.S. Prescribing Information \nNeutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-1 (75%) and PALOMA-3 (83%). In PALOMA-1, Grade 3 (57%) or 4 (5%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. In PALOMA-3, Grade 3 (56%) or Grade 4 (11%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in about 1% of patients exposed to IBRANCE. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3. Inform patients to promptly report any fever. \nMonitor complete blood count prior to starting IBRANCE, at the beginning of each cycle, on Day 14 of first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. \nPulmonary embolism (PE) has been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-1 (5%) and in patients treated with IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in PALOMA-3 (1%) compared with no cases in patients treated either with letrozole alone or fulvestrant plus placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of PE and treat as medically appropriate. \nBased on the mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. IBRANCE may impair fertility in males and has the potential to cause genotoxicity. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Advise women not to breastfeed during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants. \nThe most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-1 of IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone included neutropenia (75% vs 5%), leukopenia (43% vs 3%), fatigue (41% vs 23%), anemia (35% vs 7%), upper respiratory infection (31% vs 18%), nausea (25% vs 13%), stomatitis (25% vs 7%), alopecia (22% vs 3%), diarrhea (21% vs 10%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs 1%), decreased appetite (16% vs 7%), vomiting (15% vs 4%), asthenia (13% vs 4%), peripheral neuropathy (13% vs 5%), and epistaxis (11% vs 1%). \nGrade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥10%) in PALOMA-1 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group vs the letrozole alone group included neutropenia (54% vs 1%) and leukopenia (19% vs 0%). The most frequently reported serious adverse events in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole were pulmonary embolism (4%) and diarrhea (2%). \nLab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-1 (all grades, IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone) were decreased WBC (95% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (94% vs 17%), decreased lymphocytes (81% vs 35%), decreased hemoglobin (83% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (61% vs 16%). \nThe most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-3 of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo included neutropenia (83% vs 4%), leukopenia (53% vs 5%), infections (47% vs 31%), fatigue (41% vs 29%), nausea (34% vs 28%), anemia (30% vs 13%), stomatitis (28% vs 13%), headache (26% vs 20%), diarrhea (24% vs 19%), thrombocytopenia (23% vs 0%), constipation (20% vs 16%), vomiting (19% vs 15%), alopecia (18% vs 6%), rash (17% vs 6%), decreased appetite (16% vs 8%), and pyrexia (13% vs 5%). \nGrade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥10%) in PALOMA-3 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus fulvestrant group vs the fulvestrant plus placebo group included neutropenia (66% vs 1%) and leukopenia (31% vs 2%). The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant were infections (3%), pyrexia (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pulmonary embolism (1%). \nLab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-3 (all grades, IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo) were decreased WBC (99% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (96% vs 14%), anemia (78% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (62% vs 10%). \nAvoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors . If patients must be administered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg/day. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of IBRANCE and should be avoided. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers . The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may need to be reduced as IBRANCE may increase their exposure. \nIBRANCE has not been studied in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min). \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

      "text": "By: Pfizer Inc. via Business Wire News Releases November 16, 2016 at 17:09 PM EST PALOMA-2 Phase 3 Study Published In The New England Journal Of Medicine Demonstrates Clinical Benefit Of Pfizer’s IBRANCE® (palbociclib) In First-Line ER+, HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that detailed results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. These data, presented at the 52nd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June, further demonstrate the clinical benefit of IBRANCE® (palbociclib) as initial therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+, HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The PALOMA-2 study showed the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole extended progression-free survival (PFS), or the amount of time before tumor growth, by more than 10 months compared with letrozole plus placebo. Further, the study demonstrated that the median PFS of the IBRANCE and letrozole combination exceeded two years – making it the first and only treatment for this population of women to do so in a randomized Phase 3 study.1 \nPfizer Inc. ( NYSE:PFE ) today announced that detailed results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine . These data, presented at the 52 nd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June, further demonstrate the clinical benefit of IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) as initial therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+, HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The PALOMA-2 study showed the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole extended progression-free survival (PFS), or the amount of time before tumor growth, by more than 10 months compared with letrozole plus placebo. Further, the study demonstrated that the median PFS of the IBRANCE and letrozole combination exceeded two years – making it the first and only treatment for this population of women to do so in a randomized Phase 3 study. 1 \n“The median PFS of more than two years observed in this study is unprecedented for this patient population,” said Veronique Dieras, M.D., medical oncologist and head of clinical research, Clinical Investigational Unit Chef de Service Recherche Clinique, Unité d'Investigation Clinique Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France. “Building on the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 data, the results of PALOMA-2 provide additional evidence that the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole is a meaningful advancement for these women.” \n“Since its accelerated approval in 2015, IBRANCE in combination with letrozole has become a standard of care for the treatment of post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer,” said Hope Rugo, M.D., professor of medicine and director of breast oncology and clinical trials education at the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. “We now have seen consistent results across three randomized trials in which the addition of IBRANCE to an endocrine therapy significantly prolonged PFS compared to the endocrine therapy alone.” \nIn the trial, median PFS for women treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole was 24.8 months (95% CI, 22.1-not estimable) compared with 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.9-17.1) for women treated with letrozole plus placebo (HR=0.58 [95% CI, 0.46-0.72], p<0.001), a 42% reduction in the risk of disease progression. \n“IBRANCE has raised the bar for new treatments in hormone-receptor positive advanced breast cancer. The results of this Phase 3 trial add to the growing body of clinical data in support of IBRANCE and translates into hope for patients,” said Mace Rothenberg, M.D., chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We look forward to sharing the full PALOMA-2 data with global regulatory authorities with the goal of making IBRANCE available to more women around the world. Pfizer is proud of being a leader in the development of innovative therapies like IBRANCE that make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.” \nSafety results were consistent with PALOMA-1 and no major unexpected safety findings were observed. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events with IBRANCE plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (66.4% vs 1.4%), leukopenia (24.8% vs 0%), infections (6.5% vs 3.2%) and anemia (5.4% vs 1.8%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of patients in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group and none of the patients in the placebo plus letrozole group. For more information, please see Important Safety Information for IBRANCE below. 2 \nIBRANCE first was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2015 and is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole was approved under accelerated approval based on PFS results from the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 study. As stated at the time of the approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, the double-blind, Phase 3 PALOMA-2 study. 2 A supplemental New Drug Application to support the conversion of the accelerated approval to regular approval based on the results of PALOMA-2 has been submitted to the FDA. \nIBRANCE also is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of HR+, HER2-advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy based on results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study. 2 \nSince the initial approval in February 2015, more than 40,000 women have been prescribed IBRANCE by more than 8,500 prescribers in the U.S. \nAs previously disclosed, the European Commission has approved IBRANCE for the treatment of women with HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The approval is for IBRANCE to be used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor. The approval also covers the use of IBRANCE in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. In total, IBRANCE is approved in more than 50 countries. \nAbout PALOMA-2 \nPALOMA-2 is a randomized (2:1), multicenter, multinational, double-blind Phase 3 study designed to assess the PFS of IBRANCE (125 mg orally once daily for three out of four weeks in repeated cycles) in combination with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily continuously) versus letrozole plus placebo as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. PALOMA-2 evaluated a total of 666 women from 186 global sites in 17 countries. \nThe full prescribing information for IBRANCE can be found at www.pfizer.com . \nAbout IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) 125 mg capsules \nIBRANCE is the first and only FDA approved oral inhibitor of CDKs 4 and 6, 2 which are key regulators of the cell cycle that trigger cellular progression. 3,4 In the U.S., IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women, or fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole is approved under accelerated approval based on PFS. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, PALOMA-2. 2 \nImportant IBRANCE (palbociclib) Safety Information from the U.S. Prescribing Information \nNeutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-1 (75%) and PALOMA-3 (83%). In PALOMA-1, Grade 3 (57%) or 4 (5%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. In PALOMA-3, Grade 3 (56%) or Grade 4 (11%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in about 1% of patients exposed to IBRANCE. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3. Inform patients to promptly report any fever. \nMonitor complete blood count prior to starting IBRANCE, at the beginning of each cycle, on Day 14 of first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. \nPulmonary embolism (PE) has been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-1 (5%) and in patients treated with IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in PALOMA-3 (1%) compared with no cases in patients treated either with letrozole alone or fulvestrant plus placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of PE and treat as medically appropriate. \nBased on the mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. IBRANCE may impair fertility in males and has the potential to cause genotoxicity. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Advise women not to breastfeed during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants. \nThe most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-1 of IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone included neutropenia (75% vs 5%), leukopenia (43% vs 3%), fatigue (41% vs 23%), anemia (35% vs 7%), upper respiratory infection (31% vs 18%), nausea (25% vs 13%), stomatitis (25% vs 7%), alopecia (22% vs 3%), diarrhea (21% vs 10%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs 1%), decreased appetite (16% vs 7%), vomiting (15% vs 4%), asthenia (13% vs 4%), peripheral neuropathy (13% vs 5%), and epistaxis (11% vs 1%). \nGrade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥10%) in PALOMA-1 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group vs the letrozole alone group included neutropenia (54% vs 1%) and leukopenia (19% vs 0%). The most frequently reported serious adverse events in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole were pulmonary embolism (4%) and diarrhea (2%). \nLab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-1 (all grades, IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone) were decreased WBC (95% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (94% vs 17%), decreased lymphocytes (81% vs 35%), decreased hemoglobin (83% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (61% vs 16%). \nThe most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-3 of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo included neutropenia (83% vs 4%), leukopenia (53% vs 5%), infections (47% vs 31%), fatigue (41% vs 29%), nausea (34% vs 28%), anemia (30% vs 13%), stomatitis (28% vs 13%), headache (26% vs 20%), diarrhea (24% vs 19%), thrombocytopenia (23% vs 0%), constipation (20% vs 16%), vomiting (19% vs 15%), alopecia (18% vs 6%), rash (17% vs 6%), decreased appetite (16% vs 8%), and pyrexia (13% vs 5%). \nGrade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥10%) in PALOMA-3 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus fulvestrant group vs the fulvestrant plus placebo group included neutropenia (66% vs 1%) and leukopenia (31% vs 2%). The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant were infections (3%), pyrexia (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pulmonary embolism (1%). \nLab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-3 (all grades, IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo) were decreased WBC (99% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (96% vs 14%), anemia (78% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (62% vs 10%). \nAvoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors . If patients must be administered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg/day. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of IBRANCE and should be avoided. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers . The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may need to be reduced as IBRANCE may increase their exposure. \nIBRANCE has not been studied in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min). \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

(NYSE:PFE) today announced that detailed results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine . These data, presented at the 52 nd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June, further demonstrate the clinical benefit of IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) as initial therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+, HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The PALOMA-2 study showed the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole extended progression-free survival (PFS), or the amount of time before tumor growth, by more than 10 months compared with letrozole plus placebo. Further, the study demonstrated that the median PFS of the IBRANCE and letrozole combination exceeded two years – making it the first and only treatment for this population of women to do so in a randomized Phase 3 study. 1 \n\n“The median PFS of more than two years observed in this study is unprecedented for this patient population,” said Veronique Dieras, M.D., medical oncologist and head of clinical research, Clinical Investigational Unit Chef de Service Recherche Clinique, Unité d'Investigation Clinique Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France. “Building on the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 data, the results of PALOMA-2 provide additional evidence that the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole is a meaningful advancement for these women.” “Since its accelerated approval in 2015, IBRANCE in combination with letrozole has become a standard of care for the treatment of post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer,” said Hope Rugo, M.D., professor of medicine and director of breast oncology and clinical trials education at the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. “We now have seen consistent results across three randomized trials in which the addition of IBRANCE to an endocrine therapy significantly prolonged PFS compared to the endocrine therapy alone.” In the trial, median PFS for women treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole was 24.8 months (95% CI, 22.1-not estimable) compared with 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.9-17.1) for women treated with letrozole plus placebo (HR=0.58 [95% CI, 0.46-0.72], p<0.001), a 42% reduction in the risk of disease progression. “IBRANCE has raised the bar for new treatments in hormone-receptor positive advanced breast cancer. The results of this Phase 3 trial add to the growing body of clinical data in support of IBRANCE and translates into hope for patients,” said Mace Rothenberg, M.D., chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We look forward to sharing the full PALOMA-2 data with global regulatory authorities with the goal of making IBRANCE available to more women around the world. Pfizer is proud of being a leader in the development of innovative therapies like IBRANCE that make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.” Safety results were consistent with PALOMA-1 and no major unexpected safety findings were observed. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events with IBRANCE plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (66.4% vs 1.4%), leukopenia (24.8% vs 0%), infections (6.5% vs 3.2%) and anemia (5.4% vs 1.8%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of patients in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group and none of the patients in the placebo plus letrozole group. For more information, please see Important Safety Information for IBRANCE below. 2 IBRANCE first was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2015 and is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole was approved under accelerated approval based on PFS results from the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 study. As stated at the time of the approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, the double-blind, Phase 3 PALOMA-2 study. 2 A supplemental New Drug Application to support the conversion of the accelerated approval to regular approval based on the results of PALOMA-2 has been submitted to the FDA. IBRANCE also is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of HR+, HER2-advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy based on results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study. 2 Since the initial approval in February 2015, more than 40,000 women have been prescribed IBRANCE by more than 8,500 prescribers in the U.S. As previously disclosed, the European Commission has approved IBRANCE for the treatment of women with HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The approval is for IBRANCE to be used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor. The approval also covers the use of IBRANCE in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. In total, IBRANCE is approved in more than 50 countries. About PALOMA-2 PALOMA-2 is a randomized (2:1), multicenter, multinational, double-blind Phase 3 study designed to assess the PFS of IBRANCE (125 mg orally once daily for three out of four weeks in repeated cycles) in combination with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily continuously) versus letrozole plus placebo as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. PALOMA-2 evaluated a total of 666 women from 186 global sites in 17 countries. The full prescribing information for IBRANCE can be found at www.pfizer.com . About IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) 125 mg capsules IBRANCE is the first and only FDA approved oral inhibitor of CDKs 4 and 6, 2 which are key regulators of the cell cycle that trigger cellular progression. 3,4 In the U.S., IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women, or fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole is approved under accelerated approval based on PFS. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, PALOMA-2. 2 Important IBRANCE (palbociclib) Safety Information from the U.S. Prescribing Information Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-1 (75%) and PALOMA-3 (83%). In PALOMA-1, Grade 3 (57%) or 4 (5%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. In PALOMA-3, Grade 3 (56%) or Grade 4 (11%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in about 1% of patients exposed to IBRANCE. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3. Inform patients to promptly report any fever. Monitor complete blood count prior to starting IBRANCE, at the beginning of each cycle, on Day 14 of first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Pulmonary embolism (PE) has been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-1 (5%) and in patients treated with IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in PALOMA-3 (1%) compared with no cases in patients treated either with letrozole alone or fulvestrant plus placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of PE and treat as medically appropriate. Based on the mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. IBRANCE may impair fertility in males and has the potential to cause genotoxicity. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Advise women not to breastfeed during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-1 of IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone included neutropenia (75% vs 5%), leukopenia (43% vs 3%), fatigue (41% vs 23%), anemia (35% vs 7%), upper respiratory infection (31% vs 18%), nausea (25% vs 13%), stomatitis (25% vs 7%), alopecia (22% vs 3%), diarrhea (21% vs 10%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs 1%), decreased appetite (16% vs 7%), vomiting (15% vs 4%), asthenia (13% vs 4%), peripheral neuropathy (13% vs 5%), and epistaxis (11% vs 1%). Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥10%) in PALOMA-1 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group vs the letrozole alone group included neutropenia (54% vs 1%) and leukopenia (19% vs 0%). The most frequently reported serious adverse events in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole were pulmonary embolism (4%) and diarrhea (2%). Lab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-1 (all grades, IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone) were decreased WBC (95% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (94% vs 17%), decreased lymphocytes (81% vs 35%), decreased hemoglobin (83% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (61% vs 16%). The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-3 of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo included neutropenia (83% vs 4%), leukopenia (53% vs 5%), infections (47% vs 31%), fatigue (41% vs 29%), nausea (34% vs 28%), anemia (30% vs 13%), stomatitis (28% vs 13%), headache (26% vs 20%), diarrhea (24% vs 19%), thrombocytopenia (23% vs 0%), constipation (20% vs 16%), vomiting (19% vs 15%), alopecia (18% vs 6%), rash (17% vs 6%), decreased appetite (16% vs 8%), and pyrexia (13% vs 5%). Grade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥10%) in PALOMA-3 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus fulvestrant group vs the fulvestrant plus placebo group included neutropenia (66% vs 1%) and leukopenia (31% vs 2%). The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant were infections (3%), pyrexia (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pulmonary embolism (1%). Lab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-3 (all grades, IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo) were decreased WBC (99% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (96% vs 14%), anemia (78% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (62% vs 10%). Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors . If patients must be administered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg/day. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of IBRANCE and should be avoided. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers . The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may need to be reduced as IBRANCE may increase their exposure. IBRANCE has not been studied in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min).

      "text": "PALOMA-2 Phase 3 Study Published In The New England Journal Of Medicine Demonstrates Clinical Benefit Of Pfizer's IBRANCE® (palbociclib) In First-Line ER+, HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer [November 16, 2016] PALOMA-2 Phase 3 Study Published In The New England Journal Of Medicine Demonstrates Clinical Benefit Of Pfizer's IBRANCE® (palbociclib) In First-Line ER+, HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Tweet \nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that detailed results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine . These data, presented at the 52 nd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June, further demonstrate the clinical benefit of IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) as initial therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+, HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The PALOMA-2 study showed the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole extended progression-free survival (PFS), or the amount of time before tumor growth, by more than 10 months compared with letrozole plus placebo. Further, the study demonstrated that the median PFS of the IBRANCE and letrozole combination exceeded two years - making it the first and only treatment for this population of women to do so in a randomized Phase 3 study. 1 \n\"The median PFS of more than two years observed in this study is unprecedented for this patient population,\" said Veronique Dieras, M.D., medical oncologist and head of clinical research, Clinical Investigational Unit Chef de Service Recherche Clinique, Unité d'Investigation Clinique Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France. \"Building on the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 data, the results of PALOMA-2 provide additional evidence that the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole is a meaningful advancement for these women.\" \n\"Since its accelerated approval in 2015, IBRANCE in combination with letrozole has become a standard of care for the treatment of post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer,\" said Hope Rugo, M.D., professor of medicine and director of breast oncology and clinical trials education at the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"We now have seen consistent results across three randomized trials in which the addition of IBRANCE to an endocrine therapy significantly prolonged PFS compared to the endocrine therapy alone.\" \nIn the trial, median PFS for women treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole was 24.8 months (95% CI, 22.1-not estimable) compared with 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.9-17.1) for women treated with letrozole plus placebo (HR=0.58 [95% CI, 0.46-0.72], p<0.001), a 42% reduction in the risk of disease progression. \n\"IBRANCE has raised the bar for new treatments in hormone-receptor positive advanced breast cancer. The results of this Phase 3 trial add to the growing body of clinical data in support of IBRANCE and translates into hope for patients,\" said Mace Rothenberg, M.D., chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. \"We look forward to sharing the full PALOMA-2 data with global regulatory authorities with the goal of making IBRANCE available to more women around the world. Pfizer is proud of being a leader in the development of innovative therapies like IBRANCE that make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.\" \nSafety results were consistent with PALOMA-1 and no major unexpected safety findings were observed. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events with IBRANCE plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (66.4% vs 1.4%), leukopenia (24.8% vs 0%), infections (6.5% vs 3.2%) and anemia (5.4% vs 1.8%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of patients in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group and none of the patients in the placebo plus letrozole group. For more information, please see Important Safety Information for IBRANCE below. 2 \nIBRANCE first was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2015 and is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole was approved under accelerated approval based on PFS results from the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 study. As stated at the time of the approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, the double-blind, Phase 3 PALOMA-2 study. 2 A supplemental New Drug Application to support the conversion of the accelerated approval to regular approval based on the results of PALOMA-2 has been submitted to the FDA. \nIBRANCE also is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of HR+, HER2-advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy based on results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study. 2 \nSince the initial approval in February 2015, more than 40,000 women have been prescribed IBRANCE by more than 8,500 prescribers in the U.S. \nAs previously disclosed, the European Commission has approved IBRANCE for the treatment of women with HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The approval is for IBRANCE to be used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor. The approval also covers the use of IBRANCE in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. In total, IBRANCE is approved in more than 50 countries. \nAbout PALOMA-2 \nPALOMA-2 is a randomized (2:1), multicenter, multinational, double-blind Phase 3 study designed to assess the PFS of IBRANCE (125 mg orally once daily for three out of four weeks in repeated cycles) in combination with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily continuously) versus letrozole plus placebo as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. PALOMA-2 evaluated a total of 666 women from 186 global sites in 17 countries. \nThe full prescribing information for IBRANCE can be found at www.pfizer.com . \nAbout IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) 125 mg capsules \nIBRANCE is the first and only FDA approved oral inhibitor of CDKs 4 and 6, 2 which are key regulators of the cell cycle that trigger cellular progression. 3,4 In the U.S., IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women, or fulvestrant in women with disease progression followng endocrine therapy. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole is approved under accelerated approval based on PFS. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, PALOMA-2. 2 \nImportant IBRANCE (palbociclib) Safety Information from the U.S. Prescribing Information \nNeutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-1 (75%) and PALOMA-3 (83%). In PALOMA-1, Grade 3 (57%) or 4 (5%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. In PALOMA-3, Grade 3 (56%) or Grade 4 (11%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in about 1% of patients exposed to IBRANCE. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3. Inform patients to promptly report any fever. \nMonitor complete blood count prior to starting IBRANCE, at the beginning of each cycle, on Day 14 of first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. \nPulmonary embolism (PE) has been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-1 (5%) and in patients treated with IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in PALOMA-3 (1%) compared with no cases in patients treated either with letrozole alone or fulvestrant plus placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of PE and treat as medically appropriate. \nBased on the mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. IBRANCE may impair fertility in males and has the potential to cause genotoxicity. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Advise women not to breastfeed during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants. \nThe most common adverse reactions (=10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-1 of IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone included neutropenia (75% vs 5%), leukopenia (43% vs 3%), fatigue (41% vs 23%), anemia (35% vs 7%), upper respiratory infection (31% vs 18%), nausea (25% vs 13%), stomatitis (25% vs 7%), alopecia (22% vs 3%), diarrhea (21% vs 10%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs 1%), decreased appetite (16% vs 7%), vomiting (15% vs 4%), asthenia (13% vs 4%), peripheral neuropathy (13% vs 5%), and epistaxis (11% vs 1%). \nGrade 3/4 adverse reactions (=10%) in PALOMA-1 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group vs the letrozole alone group included neutropenia (54% vs 1%) and leukopenia (19% vs 0%). The most frequently reported serious adverse events in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole were pulmonary embolism (4%) and diarrhea (2%). \nLab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-1 (all grades, IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone) were decreased WBC (95% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (94% vs 17%), decreased lymphocytes (81% vs 35%), decreased hemoglobin (83% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (61% vs 16%). \nThe most common adverse reactions (=10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-3 of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo included neutropenia (83% vs 4%), leukopenia (53% vs 5%), infections (47% vs 31%), fatigue (41% vs 29%), nausea (34% vs 28%), anemia (30% vs 13%), stomatitis (28% vs 13%), headache (26% vs 20%), diarrhea (24% vs 19%), thrombocytopenia (23% vs 0%), constipation (20% vs 16%), vomiting (19% vs 15%), alopecia (18% vs 6%), rash (17% vs 6%), decreased appetite (16% vs 8%), and pyrexia (13% vs 5%). \nGrade 3/4 adverse reactions (=10%) in PALOMA-3 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus fulvestrant group vs the fulvestrant plus placebo group included neutropenia (66% vs 1%) and leukopenia (31% vs 2%). The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant were infections (3%), pyrexia (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pulmonary embolism (1%). \nLab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-3 (all grades, IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo) were decreased WBC (99% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (96% vs 14%), anemia (78% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (62% vs 10%). \nAvoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors . If patients must be administered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg/day. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of IBRANCE and should be avoided. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers . The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may need to be reduced as IBRANCE may increase their exposure. \nIBRANCE has not been studied in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min). \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

      "text": "PALOMA-2 Phase 3 Study Published In The New England Journal Of Medicine Demonstrates Clinical Benefit Of Pfizer’s IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) In First-Line ER+, HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer\nFirst-in-class IBRANCE in Combination with Letrozole Exceeded 2 Years in Median PFS\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that detailed results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-2 trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine . These data, presented at the 52 nd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June, further demonstrate the clinical benefit of IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) as initial therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+, HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. The PALOMA-2 study showed the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole extended progression-free survival (PFS), or the amount of time before tumor growth, by more than 10 months compared with letrozole plus placebo. Further, the study demonstrated that the median PFS of the IBRANCE and letrozole combination exceeded two years – making it the first and only treatment for this population of women to do so in a randomized Phase 3 study. 1\n“The median PFS of more than two years observed in this study is unprecedented for this patient population,” said Veronique Dieras, M.D., medical oncologist and head of clinical research, Clinical Investigational Unit Chef de Service Recherche Clinique, Unité d'Investigation Clinique Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France. “Building on the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 data, the results of PALOMA-2 provide additional evidence that the combination of IBRANCE and letrozole is a meaningful advancement for these women.”\n“Since its accelerated approval in 2015, IBRANCE in combination with letrozole has become a standard of care for the treatment of post-menopausal women with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer,” said Hope Rugo, M.D., professor of medicine and director of breast oncology and clinical trials education at the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. “We now have seen consistent results across three randomized trials in which the addition of IBRANCE to an endocrine therapy significantly prolonged PFS compared to the endocrine therapy alone.”\nIn the trial, median PFS for women treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole was 24.8 months (95% CI, 22.1-not estimable) compared with 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.9-17.1) for women treated with letrozole plus placebo (HR=0.58 [95% CI, 0.46-0.72], p<0.001), a 42% reduction in the risk of disease progression.\n“IBRANCE has raised the bar for new treatments in hormone-receptor positive advanced breast cancer. The results of this Phase 3 trial add to the growing body of clinical data in support of IBRANCE and translates into hope for patients,” said Mace Rothenberg, M.D., chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “We look forward to sharing the full PALOMA-2 data with global regulatory authorities with the goal of making IBRANCE available to more women around the world. Pfizer is proud of being a leader in the development of innovative therapies like IBRANCE that make a meaningful difference in patients' lives.”\nSafety results were consistent with PALOMA-1 and no major unexpected safety findings were observed. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events with IBRANCE plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole were neutropenia (66.4% vs 1.4%), leukopenia (24.8% vs 0%), infections (6.5% vs 3.2%) and anemia (5.4% vs 1.8%). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.8% of patients in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group and none of the patients in the placebo plus letrozole group. For more information, please see Important Safety Information for IBRANCE below. 2\nIBRANCE first was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2015 and is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole was approved under accelerated approval based on PFS results from the Phase 2 PALOMA-1 study. As stated at the time of the approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, the double-blind, Phase 3 PALOMA-2 study. 2 A supplemental New Drug Application to support the conversion of the accelerated approval to regular approval based on the results of PALOMA-2 has been submitted to the FDA.\nIBRANCE also is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of HR+, HER2-advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy based on results from the Phase 3 PALOMA-3 study. 2\nSince the initial approval in February 2015, more than 40,000 women have been prescribed IBRANCE by more than 8,500 prescribers in the U.S.\nAs previously disclosed, the European Commission has approved IBRANCE for the treatment of women with HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The approval is for IBRANCE to be used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor. The approval also covers the use of IBRANCE in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. In total, IBRANCE is approved in more than 50 countries.\nAbout PALOMA-2\nPALOMA-2 is a randomized (2:1), multicenter, multinational, double-blind Phase 3 study designed to assess the PFS of IBRANCE (125 mg orally once daily for three out of four weeks in repeated cycles) in combination with letrozole (2.5 mg once daily continuously) versus letrozole plus placebo as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. PALOMA-2 evaluated a total of 666 women from 186 global sites in 17 countries.\nThe full prescribing information for IBRANCE can be found at www.pfizer.com .\nAbout IBRANCE ® (palbociclib) 125 mg capsules\nIBRANCE is the first and only FDA approved oral inhibitor of CDKs 4 and 6, 2 which are key regulators of the cell cycle that trigger cellular progression. 3,4 In the U.S., IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine based therapy in postmenopausal women, or fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy. 2 The indication in combination with letrozole is approved under accelerated approval based on PFS. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial, PALOMA-2. 2\nImportant IBRANCE (palbociclib) Safety Information from the U.S. Prescribing Information\nNeutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-1 (75%) and PALOMA-3 (83%). In PALOMA-1, Grade 3 (57%) or 4 (5%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. In PALOMA-3, Grade 3 (56%) or Grade 4 (11%) decreased neutrophil counts were reported in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in about 1% of patients exposed to IBRANCE. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3. Inform patients to promptly report any fever.\nMonitor complete blood count prior to starting IBRANCE, at the beginning of each cycle, on Day 14 of first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.\nPulmonary embolism (PE) has been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-1 (5%) and in patients treated with IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in PALOMA-3 (1%) compared with no cases in patients treated either with letrozole alone or fulvestrant plus placebo. Monitor for signs and symptoms of PE and treat as medically appropriate.\nBased on the mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. IBRANCE may impair fertility in males and has the potential to cause genotoxicity. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy. Advise women not to breastfeed during IBRANCE treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-1 of IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone included neutropenia (75% vs 5%), leukopenia (43% vs 3%), fatigue (41% vs 23%), anemia (35% vs 7%), upper respiratory infection (31% vs 18%), nausea (25% vs 13%), stomatitis (25% vs 7%), alopecia (22% vs 3%), diarrhea (21% vs 10%), thrombocytopenia (17% vs 1%), decreased appetite (16% vs 7%), vomiting (15% vs 4%), asthenia (13% vs 4%), peripheral neuropathy (13% vs 5%), and epistaxis (11% vs 1%).\nGrade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥10%) in PALOMA-1 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus letrozole group vs the letrozole alone group included neutropenia (54% vs 1%) and leukopenia (19% vs 0%). The most frequently reported serious adverse events in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole were pulmonary embolism (4%) and diarrhea (2%).\nLab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-1 (all grades, IBRANCE plus letrozole vs letrozole alone) were decreased WBC (95% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (94% vs 17%), decreased lymphocytes (81% vs 35%), decreased hemoglobin (83% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (61% vs 16%).\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in PALOMA-3 of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo included neutropenia (83% vs 4%), leukopenia (53% vs 5%), infections (47% vs 31%), fatigue (41% vs 29%), nausea (34% vs 28%), anemia (30% vs 13%), stomatitis (28% vs 13%), headache (26% vs 20%), diarrhea (24% vs 19%), thrombocytopenia (23% vs 0%), constipation (20% vs 16%), vomiting (19% vs 15%), alopecia (18% vs 6%), rash (17% vs 6%), decreased appetite (16% vs 8%), and pyrexia (13% vs 5%).\nGrade 3/4 adverse reactions (≥10%) in PALOMA-3 reported at a higher incidence in the IBRANCE plus fulvestrant group vs the fulvestrant plus placebo group included neutropenia (66% vs 1%) and leukopenia (31% vs 2%). The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions in patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant were infections (3%), pyrexia (1%), neutropenia (1%), and pulmonary embolism (1%).\nLab abnormalities occurring in PALOMA-3 (all grades, IBRANCE plus fulvestrant vs fulvestrant plus placebo) were decreased WBC (99% vs 26%), decreased neutrophils (96% vs 14%), anemia (78% vs 40%), and decreased platelets (62% vs 10%).\nAvoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors . If patients must be administered a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg/day. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of IBRANCE and should be avoided. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers . The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may need to be reduced as IBRANCE may increase their exposure.\nIBRANCE has not been studied in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min).\nAbout Pfizer Oncology\nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

      "text": "Who Wants To Buy Gilead Now? Pfizer? Allergan? Nov.17.16 Send Message Summary \nGilead seems to go from bad to worse in its R&D aside from its core antiviral strengths. \nThe latest negative news came from the late-stage drug momelotinib for the blood disorder myelofibrosis. \nAlso upsetting to me was Gilead's approach to its lead NASH asset, selonsertib. \nAs is summarized herein, I see Gilead as worth more \"dead\" than \"alive,\" and see it as potentially attractive to Pfizer, maybe Allergan; and maybe in a merger of equals. \nI believe that on its own, over many years, even if R&D is non-productive, GILD's existing antiviral assets have the possibility of providing strong total returns for (very) patient investors. Introduction Reporting on Wednesday's report from Gilead (NASDAQ: GILD ) of disappointing results in its Phase 3 program for myelofibrosis, veteran biotech reporter John Carroll ended his piece by saying: \nAs the R&D hole keeps getting deeper, some wonder if Gilead will be forced back to the deal table to buy something major. Perhaps the board will authorize doing just that, though management is on record as having said repeatedly that when biotech stocks were trading lower, deal prices were not attractive. This talk, so frequently heard now, along the lines that GILD \"will be forced\" (forced!) to \"buy something major\" could be a distraction. The situation is tailor-made for GILD to be bought out by a roll-up such as Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) or Allergan (NYSE: AGN ). First, let's look at the reasoning. GILD is the world's best for-profit antiviral inventor, developer and marketer. Assuming the expected strong safety and efficacy from its HCV triplet of Epclusa + \"vox,\" or sof/vel/vox as GILD calls it, then I think that no matter what AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ) throws at it based on its latest major HCV press release , GILD has the upper hand permanently in HCV. I also think that assuming the expected very strong results from its final single tablet regimen for HIV disease, or bictegravir/emtricitabine/TAF, GILD will dominate this market globally until a cure is found. If none is found, the US patent on bictegravir is expected to run until about 2033. Without getting quantitative until later in the article, my sense is that this is a situation tailor-made for PFE. While PFE continues to struggle to actually develop important products in-house (sad to say), its forte is taking a company, stripping it to the bone, and extracting value. First, a look at why we have enough information to agree with the Street that GILD's non-antiviral R&D is at best worthless, probably of negative value. I'll begin with just some R&D failures from memory since I began buying and trading GILD around $73 in early 2014. GILD's recent R&D failures and abandonments The list is long, and, again, this is just from memory: Zydelig + entospletinib (SyK inhibitor) for cancer Zydelig for frontline CLL Next-generation candidate to improve upon Zydelig Entospletinib for cancer as monotherapy ONO-4059 (BTK inhibitor) as monotherapy Simtuzumab for cancer GS-5745 for UC and Crohn's Eleclazine for V-tach/fib Ranexa + dronedarone for A fib Momelotinib for pancreatic cancer (apparently) Momelotinib for lung cancer Momelotinib for myelofibrosis (probably). So, for years, the only new drug that's not an antiviral to be approved for GILD has been Zydelig, which is not meeting expectations. At a certain point, shareholders have to ask questions. So should the board, especially the independent directors. Could this all be bad luck? Maybe not. Maybe GILD is just throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks There's an incorrect thinking in biotech-land that a company should spend at least X% of its revenue, or profits, in R&D. Well, that would be nice. But what happens when you're GILD and revenues explode almost overnight due to the HCV business? Do you get careless? Do you need more R&D staff to handle the many therapeutic categories you are now working in? Take an internally-developed compound, GS-4997, now called selonsertib. This drug is an \"ASK-1\" inhibitor, which inhibits an intracellular enzyme that's in the middle of certain signaling chains. GILD identified 3 diseases that selonsertib might treat and tested all 3 in Phase 2 studies. Now, if this were a star drug, it would have gone 3 for 3. But instead it missed on pulmonary hypertension and diabetic kidney disease. Then, with a weak trial design, it had suggestively positive data for NASH . Yet this study was open label, had no placebo group, and had 4 different treatment groups with selonsertib. So a rational view would be that this was a Phase 2a study, but not a proof of concept study. After all, from GILD's perspective, it was not just studying this drug for NASH. It was throwing it against 3 diseases and studying all 3 at the same time. It would not be unusual for the drug to be inactive in all diseases but fail in 2/3 studies and have some mildly positive results in the 3rd one. This is what GILD reported at The Liver Meeting, which has just concluded; it has mentioned the topline data previously, so this was not the first mention of the news. It said that: \n\"... data demonstrate regression in fibrosis that was, in parallel, associated with reductions in other measures of liver injury in patients treated with selonsertib for 24 weeks.\" However, the patient numbers were small in aggregate and very small given there were 5 different treatment groups. The study was open label, not double-blind. There were no statistics given in the press release. The study only last 24 weeks, which is short for a NASH study. So this is a classic Phase 2a study, namely a hypothesis-generating one. It does not look like a successful proof of concept. A Phase 2b study is now appropriate. It would be up to GILD to determine the proper dosing of selonsertib, to have a placebo group, proper blinding, and possibly one trial for F3 (severe fibrosis) patients and one trial for the milder F2 cases. A longer period of time would be needed to decide on efficacy, as well. If GILD wanted to power the study that, if very successful, it could serve as a pivotal study, that would be its choice. However, in the press release providing the topline results last month, GILD's PR department had its CSO, Dr. Bischofberger, be attributed as saying this: \n\"We are encouraged by these data demonstrating the anti-fibrotic effect of GS-4997 in patients with NASH after only 24 weeks of treatment, and look forward to sharing the complete results with the hepatology community. Additionally, pending discussions with regulatory agencies, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial program of GS-4997 in patients with NASH.\" I was a bit gobsmacked that GILD would go to Phase 3 with this study and awaited the more detailed numbers. Also surprising in this week's press release was that GILD bothered to mention some rodent study suggesting additive benefit of selonsertib and GS-9674 in NASH, which was a poster presentation at The Liver Meeting. I look at even mentioning this preclinical finding as unduly promotional. Please, do the Phase 2 combination study in people for what amounts to a human lifestyle disease, then tell us what you have found. Just mentioning this given GILD's stature for a non-investigational combination of drugs looks more promotional than one would expect from a major drug company; it's what junior biotechs promote because they have little else. The jumping to Phase 3 on thin data is getting to be a habit. The company jumped its antibody GS-5745 to Phase 3 in gastric cancer off of a smallish Phase 1/2 study with suggestive but not overwhelmingly positive results. It also took limited results for GS-5745 in ulcerative colitis and initiated not just a Phase 2 study, as would have been appropriate, but a different Phase 2/3 study, expecting success in Phase 2 to allow a continuous transition to Phase 3. Then the Phase 2 part of the study failed. Financial firms are very cautious on what it says publicly about mega-caps, as they cannot get GILD's deal business if they are rude. But an indie such as me can provide an opinion. That opinion is that there is now reason to wonder about GILD's R&D competence beyond antivirals as well at the alacrity with which it places drugs in Phase 3. Now let's take the above thoughts and value the stock. What's GILD worth? The question has to be raised whether, except for the opportunistic deal with Galapagos (NASDAQ: GLPG ) for filgotinib, GILD's non-antiviral pipeline is worth a positive number, zero... or a negative number. Maybe it's more a cost center than anything else. I suggested as much in a recent article suggesting that GILD could spin off its non-antiviral R&D into a Newco that also got the income from its non-core revenue drivers such as Letairis and Ranexa. But with the latest news on momelotinib and the marginal Phase 2a data on selonsertib, no one will be interested in this Newco. So there are two ways to value GILD: with, and without, billions a year spent and possibly wasted on R&D. I imagine that PFE would look at GILD's projected $28 B in sales next year and see close to that in pre-tax profits. If it looks past the latest hopes for an HIV cure, then it will likely project HIV/AIDS sales growing and will project that its global distribution will help HCV and the rest of product sales. So it can add value mostly through its immense global marketing capabilities. If PFE were to pay 5X revenues, that might equate to 6X pre-tax profits if there were no R&D expenses. Subtract GAAP (which, for now, equal cash) taxes and you are perhaps left with a 13-14% return on capital - which will consist of borrowed funds at about a 2-3% interest rate. This might suggest a $140 B starting deal price, or a little over $100/share, say $105. This would be highly accretive to reported EPS; whether the deal was a great deal looking 10 years from now can be ignored. There's always another deal for PFE . In this sort of deal, whether consensual or hostile, management's stock-based compensation would vest, so the insiders have the same financial incentives as the outsiders. Then, if Dr. Milligan, Dr. Bischofberger and some other senior people want to start a new venture, or join a smaller company, they would have cashed out with a record of having delivered big-time for shareholders. I think this fits precisely with PFE's well-honed modus operandus . Other pharma companies could do this, such as MRK, which could use a boost in EPS right now while it grows Keytruda revenues. It's more difficult for yours truly to discuss AGN's possible interest in GILD, given that much of its interest would relate to tax savings, not just GAAP but ultimate tax savings. How this could work, and whether it would involve dismembering GILD before the deal closes, I cannot say. I'm also not an expert on AGN's global brand marketing reach as it would apply to infectious and liver diseases. However, I have to think that with a clean balance now, AGN has been looking into a bid for GILD. There are several multinational Big Pharma companies that might think about a merger-of-equals with GILD. If that would occur, probably all of GILD's R&D would be open for discussion. Thus I would think that a BMS (NYSE: BMY ) or AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN ) could, in a merger, value GILD well above its trading price. Value of GILD as it is now to shareholders If the company is going to spin its wheels on the R&D front, then absent a deal with a payout to shareholders, the patience I've been talking about on GILD since the first half of 2015, when the stock was rising to new highs, may be needed more than I thought. Because of the years it will take for any NASH projects to produce a dollar, much less profits, much less meaningful profits, and because filgotinib operates in highly competitive areas, I believe that patient GILD shareholders have to count on dividends and let the share price take care of itself. As I've been emphasizing for a little more than two years, before many were paying attention, GILD has the TAF-based HIV/AIDS line that could bring in very large profits into the 2030s. If so, some Street estimates start with HIV/AIDS and related hepatitis B revenues around $20 B by 2021 or so. That could mean $20 B X 15 years, or $300 B in revenues, with anything from HCV and the other products extra. Whether that would be in nominal dollars, or whether inflation adjustments would resume/continue, or whether those estimates are overoptimistic, I cannot say. Also, what the right future tax rate to think of is also unknown. But clearly, there might be a pot of gold from HIV/AIDS drugs, as ViiV may fade and leave GILD with a de facto monopoly on single tablet regiments in most of the 2020s. No guarantees! (Just as the reports of the imminent near-demise of GILD's HCV line is also not guaranteed to be accurate.) So even if the R&D department becomes a drain on EPS, there could be substantial rewards for patient holders of GILD shares. Concluding remarks I am more disappointed that GILD is talking about jumping selonsertib to Phase 3 than I am with yet another pipeline failure, this time momelotinib for myelofibrosis. I never included profits from this drug in my judgment on GILD's inherent values. But what I do expect is a Big Pharma-like caution in testing and evaluating drug candidates. To go to Phase 3 never having done even one double-blind study on a drug strikes this old fellow as much too newfangled for comfort. That goes double for a novel situation such as NASH, where even the \"right\" endpoint is uncertain. So it may be time for major changes at GILD. The simplest way is for the marvelous antiviral assets to go to a great global marketer with an acquisitive bent; thus PFE comes to mind, among others. If some offshoring of profits could be attained, then AGN comes to mind along with a small number of the usual EU-based giants. Another way is for the institutions to pass the word to GILD's board that it's time to forget about diversifying. GILD has been there, has tried to do that, and what has occurred is evident for all to see. And by now, o many biotech deals have been done over the past few years that one to move the needle at a price that works in a rising-rate environment may not be available. GILD certainly could have done some more diversifying deals for stock in 2012 and 2013 as its stock price rose ahead of the Sovaldi launch, but it stuck with those it made after the Great Recession - none of which except for Pharmasset (an antiviral deal) are looking especially good as of now. In my view, the single worst thing that GILD could do, fundamentally, right now is as summarized by Piper Jaffray (NYSE: PJC ) in a Barron's blog post - my italics added for emphasis: \nSo how can we be so down on the science and so positive on the stock? Simply, the 6x forward P/E, in our view, implies steady decline of HCV franchise, undervalues the HIV franchise, and implies no value-creation efforts from the company. And while we see a broken R&D engine, the reality is that Gilead 's \"true\" pipeline is the entire biotech industry, and the more that its internal programs fail, the more it will be forced to in-license and acquire... The beauty of the biotech industry is that if you can't build it, you can buy it . We just wish Gilead would recognize this sooner than later, but it seems quite inevitable to us; we expect management will fix this. No. This looks like the dealmaking side of PJC talking through the analyst. I believe GILD is correct in its statements about the poor projected ROIC of deals at today's acquisition prices. Especially post-election, with the rebound in sentiment in biotech, the deal front has been picked-over. GILD tried a string-of-pearls strategy after the Great Recession, and it failed. The success came from its own research into HCV cures. Having failed to develop a nuc, but having top-notch candidates other than that, the Pharmasset deal was assumed at GILD to be synergistic from the get-go. But it appears as though no such innovative, powerhouse mid-stage internally-generated compounds exist at GILD. The best hope was selonsertib, but with iffy results in NASH and failures in the other two diseases tested, and with GILD already having acquired a full house of other candidates in NASH, no other deal is needed in NASH. The best news in the Piper note is that since the Street is saying that GILD's R&D is broken (non-antiviral, that is), there's little downside to the stock anymore from pipeline failures - unless they involve HCV or the bictegravir-based triplet on which so much depends. I disagree with Piper on the forward EPS for GILD, since I use GAAP. Clearly next year looks challenging, with pressures on HCV revenues continuing and some patent cliff issues in the EU. So I'm not sure that the forward P/E is not closer to 9X at a GILD price around $75. Then there is the omnipresent issue of whether, if one is a long term holder of the stock, the 19-20% tax rate GILD reports is ultimately going to be adjusted upward. So, 9X or whatever it proves to be (I hope EPS are higher than I fear), still may understate the P/E based on taxes finally paid on 2017 earnings. Thus, my view remains what I've been saying all the way down: GILD is a relatively cheap stock. The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ), at 2181, is back to 25X TTM GAAP EPS. GILD is, right now, more like at 7X. Much as GILD has fared poorly in its R&D outside of antivirals, it owns two of the great product lines in all of the global pharma business. So, given all the expensive investment alternatives available, I continue to see GILD as a good asset to hold for the long term, with substantial fundamental positive total returns possible over time. A takeover or merger premium would be welcomed, though, as it could give a quick 40% or greater premium to GILD's current price. Thanks for reading and sharing any thoughts you wish to contribute.

      "text": "Diversified Portfolio Expected to Drive Pfizer’s Growth in 2016 PART 3 OF 4 Pfizer’s Metabolic, Rare Disease Segments: Hope for the Future? By Margaret Patrick | Nov 17, 2016 4:01 pm EST Pfizer’s revenue growth drivers \nPfizer has a strong presence in oncology as well as immunology and inflammation. It’s also actively diversifying in the metabolic and rare disease segments through collaborations and acquisitions. Partnership with Merck \nBy the end of 2016, Pfizer ( PFE ) expects to submit two NDAs (New Drug Applications) for ertugliflozin to the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). It also expects to file NDAs for two combination therapies with ertugliflozin, one with Januvia and the other with metformin. \nPfizer is developing the ertugliflozin therapy in partnership with Merck & Co. ( MRK ). The filing will include results from the Phase 3 study VERTIS SITA2, which demonstrated the efficacy of investigational oral SGLT2 inhibitor ertugliflozin as a treatment option for type 2 diabetes patients. \nIf Pfizer gets regulatory approval for ertugliflozin, it may boost the company’s share price as well as the shares of the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF ( DIA ). Pfizer makes up about 1.2% of DIA’s total portfolio holdings. Acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics \nOn August 1, 2016 , Pfizer announced that it has acquired Bamboo Therapeutics. The acquisition added to Pfizer’s portfolio multiple clinical and preclinical investigational drugs targeted at several rare diseases. The rare diseases are mainly those related to neuromuscular and central nervous system conditions. Bamboo Therapeutics also added a strong gene therapy development platform to Pfizer’s portfolio. \nAccording to Pfizer , “Gene therapy is an emerging area of medical research focused on highly specialized, one-time, transformative treatments addressing the root cause of diseases caused by genetic mutation. Gene therapy is a promising investigational technology, especially for patients with rare diseases, many of which are caused by a single genetic mutation. The technology involves introducing genetic material into the body to deliver a corrected copy of a gene to a patient’s cells to compensate for a defective one. The genetic material can be delivered to the cells by a variety of means, most frequently using a viral vector such as rAAV.” Partnership with Spark Therapeutics \nPfizer and Spark Therapeutics are developing SPK-9001, a hemophilia B therapy. According to a Pfizer press release , “Hemophilia is a rare genetic bleeding disorder that causes the blood to take a long time to clot as a result of a deficiency in one of several blood clotting factors, and occurs almost exclusively in males.” \nThese developments will help Pfizer pose strong competition to other pharmaceutical players such as Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY ) and Eli Lilly ( LLY ). \nIn the next part, we’ll explore some growth prospects for Pfizer’s vaccines portfolio in 2016. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"BMY\",\"LLY\",\"MRK\",\"PFE\",\"DIA\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Bristol Myers Squibb Co.\",\"Eli Lilly & Co.\",\"Merck & Co., Inc.\",\"Pfizer Inc.\",\"SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF\"]} X",

      "text": "Twitter News Feed Item QuintilesIMS Forms New Collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Lilly, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer to Generate Real World Insights On Usage of Anti-Cancer Therapies Across Europe November 22, 2016 08:02 AM EST Blog This \nQuintilesIMS (NYSE:Q) announced today that it will lead a collaborative initiative involving founding partners Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer, which aims to provide clearer and more proactive insight into how anti-cancer treatments are used in a real-world setting across key European markets. \nCurrently, there are major information gaps and inconsistencies in knowledge about the real-world use of oncology products across Europe. Additional information about how oncology products are actually used, for which types of patients, with what sequences and combinations of therapies, and in which indications, is particularly important to help improve oncology patient care. \nTreatment use information is typically based on historical data, thereby providing a view of the past, not a view of current practice. This new initiative is intended to provide more timely, consistent and comprehensive data resources that could be used to provide further insight for healthcare systems to make better informed decisions on patient care in the future.

      "text": "DANBURY, Conn. & RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESSWIRE)-- Collaboration addresses information gaps on actual utilization of anti-cancer therapies \nQuintilesIMS (NYSE:Q) announced today that it will lead a collaborative initiative involving founding partners Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer, which aims to provide clearer and more proactive insight into how anti-cancer treatments are used in a real-world setting across key European markets. \nCurrently, there are major information gaps and inconsistencies in knowledge about the real-world use of oncology products across Europe.

      "text": "By: Pfizer Inc. via Business Wire News Releases November 30, 2016 at 08:30 AM EST Pfizer Announces Positive Top-Line Results from the Pivotal Comparative REFLECTIONS B3271002 Study for PF-05280014, a Potential Biosimilar to Herceptin®1 (trastuzumab) Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the pivotal REFLECTIONS B3271002 study, a comparative safety and efficacy study of PF-05280014 versus Herceptin® (trastuzumab), met its primary endpoint. PF-05280014 is being developed by Pfizer as a potential biosimilar to Herceptin. \nPfizer Inc. ( NYSE:PFE ) today announced that the pivotal REFLECTIONS B3271002 study, a comparative safety and efficacy study of PF-05280014 versus Herceptin® (trastuzumab), met its primary endpoint. PF-05280014 is being developed by Pfizer as a potential biosimilar to Herceptin. \nThe trial demonstrated equivalence in the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) of PF-05280014 versus Herceptin, taken in combination with paclitaxel, in first line patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum period of time 2 . \n“As the leading global biosimilars company, we are committed to advancing our robust pipeline of biosimilar therapies in hopes of expanding access to high-quality treatment options for patients living with serious, life-threatening conditions such as cancer,” said Sumant Ramachandra, MD, PhD, MBA, Head of Research and Development, Pfizer Essential Health. “Favorable comparative clinical data between proposed biosimilars and their respective reference product contribute to physician and patient understanding of and confidence in the value and importance of biosimilars. We are encouraged by these data and look forward to sharing the complete results with health authorities and the oncology community once available.” \nA separate comparative, randomized, double-blind clinical trial [REFLECTIONS B3271004] in early breast cancer patients [N=226] also met its primary endpoint of steady-state C trough concentrations (PK) in patients treated with PF-05280014 and Herceptin. \nAbout the REFLECTIONS B3271002 Study \nREFLECTIONS B3271002 is a comparative, randomized, double blind, clinical trial[N=690] evaluating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 (a potential biosimilar to Herceptin® [trastuzumab]) in combination with paclitaxel versus Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel in first line patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) by Week 25 of study treatment. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum period of time 2 . \nMore information about the PF-05280014 REFLECTIONS B3271002 and B3271004 studies can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov . \nAbout PF-05280014 \nPF-05280014 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is in development as a potential biosimilar for all currently approved indications of Herceptin® (trastuzumab). \nHerceptin is currently approved in the U.S., EU and other markets for HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric cancer. \nPF-05280014 is an investigational compound and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimilarity has not yet been established by regulatory authorities and is not yet claimed. \nAbout Pfizer: Working together for a healthier world® \nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

(NYSE:PFE) today announced that the pivotal REFLECTIONS B3271002 study, a comparative safety and efficacy study of PF-05280014 versus Herceptin® (trastuzumab), met its primary endpoint. PF-05280014 is being developed by Pfizer as a potential biosimilar to Herceptin. \nThe trial demonstrated equivalence in the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) of PF-05280014 versus Herceptin, taken in combination with paclitaxel, in first line patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum period of time 2 . “As the leading global biosimilars company, we are committed to advancing our robust pipeline of biosimilar therapies in hopes of expanding access to high-quality treatment options for patients living with serious, life-threatening conditions such as cancer,” said Sumant Ramachandra, MD, PhD, MBA, Head of Research and Development, Pfizer Essential Health. “Favorable comparative clinical data between proposed biosimilars and their respective reference product contribute to physician and patient understanding of and confidence in the value and importance of biosimilars. We are encouraged by these data and look forward to sharing the complete results with health authorities and the oncology community once available.” A separate comparative, randomized, double-blind clinical trial [REFLECTIONS B3271004] in early breast cancer patients [N=226] also met its primary endpoint of steady-state C trough concentrations (PK) in patients treated with PF-05280014 and Herceptin. About the REFLECTIONS B3271002 Study REFLECTIONS B3271002 is a comparative, randomized, double blind, clinical trial[N=690] evaluating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 (a potential biosimilar to Herceptin® [trastuzumab]) in combination with paclitaxel versus Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel in first line patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) by Week 25 of study treatment. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum period of time 2 . More information about the PF-05280014 REFLECTIONS B3271002 and B3271004 studies can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov . About PF-05280014 PF-05280014 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is in development as a potential biosimilar for all currently approved indications of Herceptin® (trastuzumab).

      "title": "What's Pfizer's Excuse for Not Buying Exelixis?",
      "text": "What's Pfizer's Excuse for Not Buying Exelixis? newsfeedback@fool.com (Todd Campbell) 0 \nExelixis Inc. (NASDAQ: EXEL) reported in October that its kidney cancer drug Cabometyx outperformed Pfizer Inc .'s (NYSE: PFE) top-selling Sutent in first-line advanced kidney cancer patients. Exelixis' management plans to use this data to convince regulators to expand Cabometyx's label, and if the Food and Drug Administration agrees, then it could clear the way for Cabometyx to cut significantly into Sutent's market share. Since Pfizer may soon battle Exelixis in this indication, does it make sense for Pfizer to acquire it? Image source: Pfizer, Inc. A big win \nLast year, Exelixis announced that patients diagnosed with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who had received prior anti-angiogenic therapy and who were given Cabometyx saw median progression-free survival of 7.4 months. That handily outpaced the 3.8 months delivered by Afinitor, a top-selling second-line advanced RCC drug with sales of $1.6 billion last year. \nThe FDA approved Cabometyx for use in advanced RCC patients earlier this year, and since then, Cabometyx has already won away 20% market share in the second-line setting and 35% market share in the third-line setting. As a result, Cabometyx's sales are clocking in at an annualized pace north of $120 million. \nClearly, Cabometyx is off to a solid start, but sales could climb even higher if the FDA approves Cabometyx for use in first-line advanced RCC patients, a market that's currently dominated by Pfizer's Sutent. \nIn October, Exelixis reported that Cabometyx patients experienced a 31% decrease in risk of death or cancer progression versus Sutent at a median follow-up period of 20.8 months. Cabometyx progression-free survival was 8.2 months and Sutent's progression-free survival was 5.6 months. Cabometyx overall survival data was 30.3 months versus 21.8 months for Sutent, and the objective response rate was 46% for Cabometyx and 18% for Sutent. \nBased on those results, there's a good chance that if Cabometyx gets approved for use in the first-line indication, then it will displace Sutent as the go-to treatment. Defending its position \nSutent's sales totaled $823 million through the first nine months of 2016, and Pfizer's strategy to defend that revenue includes expanding Sutent's use beyond advanced RCC to include all RCC patients. \nIn October, Pfizer reported that Sutent significantly delayed disease progression in RCC patients who took it as an adjunct therapy after undergoing surgery. Specifically, the median disease-free survival for Sutent patients was 6.8 years versus 5.6 years for patients taking a placebo. Pfizer executives plan to discuss these results with regulators, and if Sutent eventually gets a green light for use in these patients, then it could offset any market share losses to Cabometyx in the first-line advanced RCC setting. \nPfizer isn't giving up entirely on the first-line advanced RCC indication, either. Pfizer's studying the use of another one of its kidney cancer drugs -- Inlyta -- alongside checkpoint inhibitors in first-line advanced RCC patients. \nOne of these trials combines Inlyta with Merck & Co .'s (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda, and another trial combines Inlyta with Pfizer and Merck KGaA 's avelumab. If either of those studies succeed, then Pfizer could wind up winning back any sales that Sutent ends up losing to Cabometyx. Image source: Exelixis. What about a deal? \nA lot of Pfizer's recent growth has come from cancer drugs, including the breast cancer drug Ibrance, and Pfizer's already shown a big commitment to expanding its oncology footprint, both in terms of its research and development pipeline and its recent acquisition of Medivation. \nThis week, the FDA accepted Pfizer's application to approve avelumab for use in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare skin cancer, and earlier this year, Pfizer spent $14 billion buying Medivation to get its hands on the prostate cancer drug Xtandi and a late-stage PARP-inhibitor in breast cancer studies. \nGiven Pfizer's racking up over a billion dollars in sales per year from Sutent and its doubling down on its exposure to oncology via both R&D and mergers and acquisitions, it's not be a stretch to wonder if management would consider acquiring Exelixis rather than battling it. 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes \nIf Pfizer were to buy Exelixis, it would eliminate the short-term risk Cabometyx poses to Sutent in the first-line advanced RCC setting. It would also insulate Pfizer against the risk of its Inlyta's trials falling short. Furthermore, it would strengthen Pfizer's position in the second- and third-line advanced RCC setting, and it would give Pfizer the opportunity to benefit from ongoing studies of Cabometyx in liver cancer. \nBuying Exelixis would also give Pfizer a stake in Cotellic, a drug that Exelixis co-developed with Roche for use in melanoma patients with a specific genetic makeup. Exelixis' Cotellic revenue is a rounding error right now, but Roche's study of Cotellic in previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer could change that someday. \nThose are all intriguing reasons why Pfizer might want to own Exelixis, however, there's a good chance that Pfizer will decide that Exelixis is simply too pricey to buy. When Pfizer bought Medivation, it paid 11 times forward sales, and if we apply that multiple to Exelixis 2018 sales estimates, it works out to roughly $4.9 billion, which is about what Exelixis is already worth. Since Pfizer still has some R&D programs underway that could allow it to compete against Cabometyx in the first-line advanced RCC indication down the road and Exelixis won't come cheap, investors might not want to bet that an acquisition is in the cards. \n10 stocks we like better than Exelixis \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ: EXEL) reported in October that its kidney cancer drug Cabometyx outperformed Pfizer Inc.'s (NYSE: PFE) top-selling Sutent in first-line advanced kidney cancer patients. Exelixis' management plans to use this data to convince regulators to expand Cabometyx's label, and if the Food and Drug Administration agrees, then it could clear the way for Cabometyx to cut significantly into Sutent's market share. Since Pfizer may soon battle Exelixis in this indication, does it make sense for Pfizer to acquire it? Latest Business Achievements",

(NYSE:PFE) today announced that the pivotal REFLECTIONS B3271002 study, a comparative safety and efficacy study of PF-05280014 versus Herceptin® (trastuzumab), met its primary endpoint. PF-05280014 is being developed by Pfizer as a potential biosimilar to Herceptin. \nThe trial demonstrated equivalence in the primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) of PF-05280014 versus Herceptin, taken in combination with paclitaxel, in first line patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum period of time 2 . \n“As the leading global biosimilars company, we are committed to advancing our robust pipeline of biosimilar therapies in hopes of expanding access to high-quality treatment options for patients living with serious, life-threatening conditions such as cancer,” said Sumant Ramachandra, MD, PhD, MBA, Head of Research and Development, Pfizer Essential Health. “Favorable comparative clinical data between proposed biosimilars and their respective reference product contribute to physician and patient understanding of and confidence in the value and importance of biosimilars. We are encouraged by these data and look forward to sharing the complete results with health authorities and the oncology community once available.” \nA separate comparative, randomized, double-blind clinical trial [REFLECTIONS B3271004] in early breast cancer patients [N=226] also met its primary endpoint of steady-state C trough concentrations (PK) in patients treated with PF-05280014 and Herceptin. \nAbout the REFLECTIONS B3271002 Study \nREFLECTIONS B3271002 is a comparative, randomized, double blind, clinical trial[N=690] evaluating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of PF-05280014 (a potential biosimilar to Herceptin® [trastuzumab]) in combination with paclitaxel versus Herceptin in combination with paclitaxel in first line patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) by Week 25 of study treatment. ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum period of time 2 . \nMore information about the PF-05280014 REFLECTIONS B3271002 and B3271004 studies can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov . \nAbout PF-05280014 \nPF-05280014 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is in development as a potential biosimilar for all currently approved indications of Herceptin® (trastuzumab). \nHerceptin is currently approved in the U.S., EU and other markets for HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric cancer. \nPF-05280014 is an investigational compound and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimilarity has not yet been established by regulatory authorities and is not yet claimed. \nAbout Pfizer: Working together for a healthier world® \nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

      "text": "By: Spark Therapeutics, Inc.; Pfizer   11:00 AM EST Spark Therapeutics and Pfizer Present Updated Preliminary Data from Hemophilia B Phase 1/2 Trial Suggesting Consistent and Sustained Levels of Factor IX Activity at Annual ASH Meeting Together, all nine participants have reduced infusions of factor IX concentrates by 99 percent over cumulative 1,650 days Seven infused participants who have progressed to at least 12 weeks post-vector administration as of Nov. 30, 2016 have a mean steady-state factor IX activity level greater than 28 percent \nPHILADELPHIA,   Spark Therapeutics ( NASDAQ:ONCE ) and Pfizer Inc. ( NYSE:PFE ) announced updated preliminary data today from the first nine infused participants in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of investigational SPK-9001 for hemophilia B, who received a single administration of 5 x 10 11 vector genomes (vg)/kg body weight. These data will be presented at today’s media briefing and on Sunday, Dec. 4 at the Plenary Scientific Session of the 58th   (ASH) Annual Meeting, in San Diego. \nThe first participant to reach one year in the study, who has been followed for 52 weeks post-infusion of SPK-9001 , has reduced to zero his number of intravenous factor IX infusions without having any bleeds. In the year before administration of SPK-9001 , he infused factor IX concentrates prophylactically a total of 98 times and still experienced four traumatic bleeds. As of Nov. 30, 2016, his steady-state factor IX activity level was 33 percent of normal. \nAs of Nov. 30, 2016, the total clotting factor IX concentrates consumption in all nine infused participants over a cumulative 1,650 patient days following vector administration was reduced by 1.13 million international units based on their factor IX concentrates usage in the year before vector administration. Seven of the nine infused participants, who have progressed to at least 12 weeks post-vector administration as of Nov. 30, 2016, experienced consistent and sustained factor IX activity levels, with a mean steady-state level greater than 28 percent. In the study to date, no participants developed factor IX inhibitors or experienced thrombotic events after the vector administration. No serious adverse events after SPK-9001 administration have been reported. \nTwo of the nine participants experienced asymptomatic, transient elevation in liver enzymes associated with an immune response to the Spark100 vector capsid during the first four to eight weeks following administration. In one participant, this response was accompanied by a decline in factor IX activity level from 32 to 12 percent, as of Nov. 30, 2016. In the other participant, to whom steroids were administered more promptly, this response was accompanied by a decline from a peak factor IX activity level of 71 to 68 percent, as of Nov. 30, 2016. Both participants were put on a tapering course of corticosteroids, and, to date, neither participant has experienced any bleeds nor has required infusion of replacement factor IX concentrates. \n“We will monitor these two participants carefully as we continue to taper the corticosteroids,” said Katherine A. High, M.D., president and chief scientific officer at Spark Therapeutics. “It’s important to remember that the immune response to the capsid typically is transient, and in both cases, seems to have been arrested by corticosteroids. Once corticosteroids have been discontinued altogether, levels of expression will be the best measure of the efficacy of this approach. The experience we have gained in immuno-monitoring and in clinical management of the immune response in the hemophilia B trial will further inform our upcoming hemophilia studies.” \nEight of the infused participants have required no factor IX concentrates to prevent or control bleeding events since the day after vector administration. One participant with severe joint disease self-administrated a precautionary infusion two days after administration of SPK-9001 for a suspected ankle bleed and again at week 35, post the data cut-off date and despite a factor IX activity level of 36 percent, for a suspected knee bleed. \n“Giving people living with hemophilia B treatment options that potentially minimize or eliminate the need for infusions of factor concentrates is one of the main goals of conducting clinical studies of investigational gene therapies,” said Dr. High. “While continued observation and larger cohorts are needed, these updated preliminary data continue to be encouraging and suggest the potential of investigational SPK-9001 to deliver a consistent, sustained and therapeutically meaningful level of factor IX activity through a one-time intravenous administration.” \nAdditionally, to date, six of seven participants reported increased physical activity and improved quality of life based on the Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults, a validated instrument that measures health-related quality of life in adults (≥ 17 years of age) with hemophilia. Two participants received the gene therapy product too recently to evaluate quality-of-life measures. \nPresentation Details: ASH Annual Meeting Media BriefingPresenter: Katherine A.

People with hemophilia are at risk for excessive and recurrent bleeding from modest injuries, which have the potential to be life threatening. People with severe hemophilia often bleed spontaneously into their muscles or joints. The incidence of hemophilia B is one in 25,000 male births. People with hemophilia B have a deficiency in clotting factor IX, a specific protein in the blood. Hemophilia B is also called congenital factor IX deficiency or Christmas disease. Current standard of care requires recurrent intravenous infusions of either plasma-derived or recombinant factor IX to control and prevent bleeding episodes. There exists a significant need for novel therapeutics to treat people living with hemophilia. \nAbout the SPK-FIX Program and SPK-9001 Spark Therapeutics' proprietary technology platform for selecting, designing, manufacturing and formulating gene therapies was applied to developing compounds in the SPK-FIX program. The SPK-FIX program leverages a long history of hemophilia gene therapy research and clinical development conducted by Spark Therapeutics and its founding scientific team over nearly three decades. SPK-9001 is a novel, investigational bio-engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid expressing a codon-optimized, high-activity human factor IX variant enabling endogenous production of factor IX. SPK-9001 is being developed under a collaboration with Pfizer. Spark Therapeutics and Pfizer entered into a collaboration in 2014 for the SPK-FIX program, including SPK-9001 , under which Spark Therapeutics is responsible for conducting all Phase 1/2 studies for any product candidates, while Pfizer will assume responsibility for pivotal studies, any regulatory activities and potential global commercialization of any products that may result from the collaboration. SPK-9001 has received breakthrough therapy and orphan product designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. \nAbout Spark Therapeutics Spark Therapeutics, a fully integrated company, is challenging the inevitability of genetic disease by discovering, developing, and delivering gene therapies that address inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), liver-mediated diseases such as hemophilia, and neurodegenerative diseases.

      "title": "Pfizer and Avillion Announce Positive Top-Line Results for Phase 3 BFORE Study of BOSULIF for First-Line Treatment of Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia",
      "text": "Thumbnail December 05, 2016 08:00   \nNEW YORK- Today, Pfizer Inc. and its partner Avillion LLP announced results from the Phase 3 BFORE ( B osutinib trial in F irst line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment) trial demonstrating superiority of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) over imatinib as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The study met its primary endpoint of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. No new or unexpected safety issues were identified. BOSULIF is currently indicated in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. \n“Since its approval, the efficacy and distinct tolerability profile of BOSULIF has provided an important treatment option for patients with Ph+ CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. The positive outcome of the BFORE study represents a key step in potentially broadening treatment options for patients in the first-line setting,” said Mace Rothenberg, MD, chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “This is an important milestone for Pfizer’s emerging hematology portfolio as we work to develop new treatments for patients with acute and chronic hematologic malignancies.” \n“This successful partnership between Pfizer and Avillion is good news for CML patients because additional first-line treatment options allow physicians to tailor therapy based on individual patient considerations,” said Allison Jeynes-Ellis, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Avillion. “The outcome of this partnership reinforces our belief in the potential of our innovative business model for the co-development and partnership of late-stage clinical candidates.” \nBased on the results of the study, Pfizer will work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities to potentially make BOSULIF available for Ph+ CML patients in the first-line setting. Detailed efficacy and safety data from this study will be submitted for a future congress or peer-reviewed journal. \nPfizer and Avillion entered into an exclusive collaborative development agreement in 2014 to conduct the BFORE trial. Under the terms of the agreement, Avillion provided funding and conducted the trial to generate the clinical data that will be used to support potential regulatory filings for marketing authorization of BOSULIF as first-line treatment of patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. If approved for this indication, Avillion will be eligible to receive milestone payments from Pfizer. Pfizer retains all rights to commercialize BOSULIF globally. \nPfizer is advancing a broad range of therapies that leverage select pathways and mechanisms of action to address acute and chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders and lymphoma. \nAbout the BFORE Study \nBFORE ( B osutinib trial in F irst line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment) is a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. The study enrolled 536 patients at multiple sites in North America, Asia and Europe. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BOSULIF 400mg or imatinib, a standard of care, for the duration of the study. The primary outcome was to show superiority of bosutinib over imatinib at 12 months by comparing MMR, or the proportion of patients in each arm whose levels of the Bcr-Abl1 kinase have dropped below 0.1%. \nABOUT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) \nBOSULIF® (bosutinib) is an oral, once-daily, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases. BOSULIF® was approved in September 2012 in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy and offers an important treatment option for these patients. In Europe, BOSULIF was granted conditional marketing authorization in March 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with one or more TKIs and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. The current approved dose of BOSULIF® is 500 mg orally once daily with food. For more information on BOSULIF resources available for healthcare professionals and patients, please visit www.BOSULIF.com . \nIMPORTANT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) SAFETY INFORMATION \nContraindication: Hypersensitivity to BOSULIF. Anaphylactic shock occurred in less than 0.2% of treated patients. \nGastrointestinal Toxicity: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur. In the clinical trial, median time to onset for diarrhea was 2 days, median duration was 1 day, and median number of episodes per patient was 3 (range 1-221). Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and/or fluid replacement. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nMyelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia can occur. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month and then monthly or as clinically indicated. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nHepatic Toxicity: Twenty percent of patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Liver enzyme elevation usually occurs early in treatment. Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Drug-induced liver injury has occurred. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose is 200 mg daily. \nRenal Toxicity: An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy, with particular attention to patients with preexisting renal impairment or risk factors. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment. The recommended starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) are 300 mg and 400 mg daily, respectively. \nFluid Retention: Fluid retention can occur and may cause pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nEmbryofetal Toxicity: BOSULIF may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving BOSULIF. \nAdverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions observed in greater than 20% of patients in the Phase 1/2 safety population (N=546) were diarrhea, nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, anemia, pyrexia, and fatigue. The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in greater than 10% of patients were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia. \nCYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers: Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. \nProton Pump Inhibitors: Consider using short-acting antacids or H2 blockers instead of PPIs to avoid a reduction in BOSULIF exposure. Separate antacid or H2 blocker dosing and BOSULIF dosing by more than 2 hours. \nNursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or BOSULIF, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. \nPlease see full Prescribing Information at www.bosulif.com . \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

      "text": "By: Pfizer Inc. and Avillion LLP via Business Wire News Releases December 05, 2016 at 08:00 AM EST Pfizer and Avillion Announce Positive Top-Line Results for Phase 3 BFORE Study of BOSULIF for First-Line Treatment of Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Today, Pfizer Inc. and its partner Avillion LLP announced results from the Phase 3 BFORE (Bosutinib trial in First line chrOnic myelogenous leukemia tREatment) trial demonstrating superiority of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) over imatinib as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The study met its primary endpoint of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. No new or unexpected safety issues were identified. BOSULIF is currently indicated in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. \nToday, Pfizer Inc. and its partner Avillion LLP announced results from the Phase 3 BFORE ( B osutinib trial in F irst line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment) trial demonstrating superiority of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) over imatinib as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The study met its primary endpoint of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. No new or unexpected safety issues were identified. BOSULIF is currently indicated in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161205005343/en/ \n“Since its approval, the efficacy and distinct tolerability profile of BOSULIF has provided an important treatment option for patients with Ph+ CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. The positive outcome of the BFORE study represents a key step in potentially broadening treatment options for patients in the first-line setting,” said Mace Rothenberg, MD, chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “This is an important milestone for Pfizer’s emerging hematology portfolio as we work to develop new treatments for patients with acute and chronic hematologic malignancies.” \n“This successful partnership between Pfizer and Avillion is good news for CML patients because additional first-line treatment options allow physicians to tailor therapy based on individual patient considerations,” said Allison Jeynes-Ellis, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Avillion. “The outcome of this partnership reinforces our belief in the potential of our innovative business model for the co-development and partnership of late-stage clinical candidates.” \nBased on the results of the study, Pfizer will work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities to potentially make BOSULIF available for Ph+ CML patients in the first-line setting. Detailed efficacy and safety data from this study will be submitted for a future congress or peer-reviewed journal. \nPfizer and Avillion entered into an exclusive collaborative development agreement in 2014 to conduct the BFORE trial. Under the terms of the agreement, Avillion provided funding and conducted the trial to generate the clinical data that will be used to support potential regulatory filings for marketing authorization of BOSULIF as first-line treatment of patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. If approved for this indication, Avillion will be eligible to receive milestone payments from Pfizer. Pfizer retains all rights to commercialize BOSULIF globally. \nPfizer is advancing a broad range of therapies that leverage select pathways and mechanisms of action to address acute and chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders and lymphoma. \nAbout the BFORE Study \nBFORE ( B osutinib trial in F irst line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment) is a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. The study enrolled 536 patients at multiple sites in North America, Asia and Europe. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BOSULIF 400mg or imatinib, a standard of care, for the duration of the study. The primary outcome was to show superiority of bosutinib over imatinib at 12 months by comparing MMR, or the proportion of patients in each arm whose levels of the Bcr-Abl1 kinase have dropped below 0.1%. \nABOUT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) \nBOSULIF® (bosutinib) is an oral, once-daily, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases. BOSULIF® was approved in September 2012 in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy and offers an important treatment option for these patients. In Europe, BOSULIF was granted conditional marketing authorization in March 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with one or more TKIs and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. The current approved dose of BOSULIF® is 500 mg orally once daily with food. For more information on BOSULIF resources available for healthcare professionals and patients, please visit www.BOSULIF.com . \nIMPORTANT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) SAFETY INFORMATION \nContraindication: Hypersensitivity to BOSULIF. Anaphylactic shock occurred in less than 0.2% of treated patients. \nGastrointestinal Toxicity: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur. In the clinical trial, median time to onset for diarrhea was 2 days, median duration was 1 day, and median number of episodes per patient was 3 (range 1-221). Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and/or fluid replacement. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nMyelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia can occur. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month and then monthly or as clinically indicated. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nHepatic Toxicity: Twenty percent of patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Liver enzyme elevation usually occurs early in treatment. Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Drug-induced liver injury has occurred. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose is 200 mg daily. \nRenal Toxicity: An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy, with particular attention to patients with preexisting renal impairment or risk factors. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment. The recommended starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) are 300 mg and 400 mg daily, respectively. \nFluid Retention: Fluid retention can occur and may cause pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nEmbryofetal Toxicity: BOSULIF may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving BOSULIF. \nAdverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions observed in greater than 20% of patients in the Phase 1/2 safety population (N=546) were diarrhea, nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, anemia, pyrexia, and fatigue. The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in greater than 10% of patients were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia. \nCYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers: Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. \nProton Pump Inhibitors: Consider using short-acting antacids or H2 blockers instead of PPIs to avoid a reduction in BOSULIF exposure. Separate antacid or H2 blocker dosing and BOSULIF dosing by more than 2 hours. \nNursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or BOSULIF, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. \nPlease see full Prescribing Information at www.bosulif.com . \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

      "text": "Pfizer and Avillion Announce Positive Top-Line Results for Phase 3 BFORE Study of BOSULIF for First-Line Treatment of Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Monday, December 5, 2016 8:00 am EST Dateline: PFE US7170811035 \"The outcome of this partnership reinforces our belief in the potential of our innovative business model for the co-development and partnership of late-stage clinical candidates.\" \nNEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Today, Pfizer Inc. and its partner Avillion LLP announced results from the Phase 3 BFORE ( B osutinib trial in F irst line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment) trial demonstrating superiority of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) over imatinib as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The study met its primary endpoint of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. No new or unexpected safety issues were identified. BOSULIF is currently indicated in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. \n“Since its approval, the efficacy and distinct tolerability profile of BOSULIF has provided an important treatment option for patients with Ph+ CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. The positive outcome of the BFORE study represents a key step in potentially broadening treatment options for patients in the first-line setting,” said Mace Rothenberg, MD, chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “This is an important milestone for Pfizer’s emerging hematology portfolio as we work to develop new treatments for patients with acute and chronic hematologic malignancies.” \n“This successful partnership between Pfizer and Avillion is good news for CML patients because additional first-line treatment options allow physicians to tailor therapy based on individual patient considerations,” said Allison Jeynes-Ellis, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Avillion. “The outcome of this partnership reinforces our belief in the potential of our innovative business model for the co-development and partnership of late-stage clinical candidates.” \nBased on the results of the study, Pfizer will work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities to potentially make BOSULIF available for Ph+ CML patients in the first-line setting. Detailed efficacy and safety data from this study will be submitted for a future congress or peer-reviewed journal. \nPfizer and Avillion entered into an exclusive collaborative development agreement in 2014 to conduct the BFORE trial. Under the terms of the agreement, Avillion provided funding and conducted the trial to generate the clinical data that will be used to support potential regulatory filings for marketing authorization of BOSULIF as first-line treatment of patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. If approved for this indication, Avillion will be eligible to receive milestone payments from Pfizer. Pfizer retains all rights to commercialize BOSULIF globally. \nPfizer is advancing a broad range of therapies that leverage select pathways and mechanisms of action to address acute and chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders and lymphoma. \nAbout the BFORE Study \nBFORE ( B osutinib trial in F irst line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment) is a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. The study enrolled 536 patients at multiple sites in North America, Asia and Europe. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BOSULIF 400mg or imatinib, a standard of care, for the duration of the study. The primary outcome was to show superiority of bosutinib over imatinib at 12 months by comparing MMR, or the proportion of patients in each arm whose levels of the Bcr-Abl1 kinase have dropped below 0.1%. \nABOUT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) \nBOSULIF® (bosutinib) is an oral, once-daily, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases. BOSULIF® was approved in September 2012 in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy and offers an important treatment option for these patients. In Europe, BOSULIF was granted conditional marketing authorization in March 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with one or more TKIs and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. The current approved dose of BOSULIF® is 500 mg orally once daily with food. For more information on BOSULIF resources available for healthcare professionals and patients, please visit www.BOSULIF.com . \nIMPORTANT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) SAFETY INFORMATION \nContraindication: Hypersensitivity to BOSULIF. Anaphylactic shock occurred in less than 0.2% of treated patients. \nGastrointestinal Toxicity: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur. In the clinical trial, median time to onset for diarrhea was 2 days, median duration was 1 day, and median number of episodes per patient was 3 (range 1-221). Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and/or fluid replacement. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nMyelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia can occur. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month and then monthly or as clinically indicated. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nHepatic Toxicity: Twenty percent of patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Liver enzyme elevation usually occurs early in treatment. Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Drug-induced liver injury has occurred. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose is 200 mg daily. \nRenal Toxicity: An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy, with particular attention to patients with preexisting renal impairment or risk factors. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment. The recommended starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) are 300 mg and 400 mg daily, respectively. \nFluid Retention: Fluid retention can occur and may cause pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nEmbryofetal Toxicity: BOSULIF may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving BOSULIF. \nAdverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions observed in greater than 20% of patients in the Phase 1/2 safety population (N=546) were diarrhea, nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, anemia, pyrexia, and fatigue. The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in greater than 10% of patients were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia. \nCYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers: Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. \nProton Pump Inhibitors: Consider using short-acting antacids or H2 blockers instead of PPIs to avoid a reduction in BOSULIF exposure. Separate antacid or H2 blocker dosing and BOSULIF dosing by more than 2 hours. \nNursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or BOSULIF, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. \nPlease see full Prescribing Information at www.bosulif.com . \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

The study met its primary endpoint of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. No new or unexpected safety issues were identified. BOSULIF is currently indicated in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. \n“Since its approval, the efficacy and distinct tolerability profile of BOSULIF has provided an important treatment option for patients with Ph+ CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. The positive outcome of the BFORE study represents a key step in potentially broadening treatment options for patients in the first-line setting,” said Mace Rothenberg, MD, chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “This is an important milestone for Pfizer’s emerging hematology portfolio as we work to develop new treatments for patients with acute and chronic hematologic malignancies.” \n“This successful partnership between Pfizer and Avillion is good news for CML patients because additional first-line treatment options allow physicians to tailor therapy based on individual patient considerations,” said Allison Jeynes-Ellis, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Avillion. “The outcome of this partnership reinforces our belief in the potential of our innovative business model for the co-development and partnership of late-stage clinical candidates.” \nBased on the results of the study, Pfizer will work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities to potentially make BOSULIF available for Ph+ CML patients in the first-line setting. Detailed efficacy and safety data from this study will be submitted for a future congress or peer-reviewed journal. \nPfizer and Avillion entered into an exclusive collaborative development agreement in 2014 to conduct the BFORE trial. Under the terms of the agreement, Avillion provided funding and conducted the trial to generate the clinical data that will be used to support potential regulatory filings for marketing authorization of BOSULIF as first-line treatment of patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. If approved for this indication, Avillion will be eligible to receive milestone payments from Pfizer. Pfizer retains all rights to commercialize BOSULIF globally. \nPfizer is advancing a broad range of therapies that leverage select pathways and mechanisms of action to address acute and chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders and lymphoma. \nAbout the BFORE Study \nBFORE ( B osutinib trial in F irst line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment) is a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. The study enrolled 536 patients at multiple sites in North America, Asia and Europe. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BOSULIF 400mg or imatinib, a standard of care, for the duration of the study. The primary outcome was to show superiority of bosutinib over imatinib at 12 months by comparing MMR, or the proportion of patients in each arm whose levels of the Bcr-Abl1 kinase have dropped below 0.1%. \nABOUT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) \nBOSULIF® (bosutinib) is an oral, once-daily, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases. BOSULIF® was approved in September 2012 in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy and offers an important treatment option for these patients. In Europe, BOSULIF was granted conditional marketing authorization in March 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with one or more TKIs and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. The current approved dose of BOSULIF® is 500 mg orally once daily with food. For more information on BOSULIF resources available for healthcare professionals and patients, please visit www.BOSULIF.com . \nIMPORTANT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) SAFETY INFORMATION \nContraindication: Hypersensitivity to BOSULIF. Anaphylactic shock occurred in less than 0.2% of treated patients. \nGastrointestinal Toxicity: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur. In the clinical trial, median time to onset for diarrhea was 2 days, median duration was 1 day, and median number of episodes per patient was 3 (range 1-221). Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and/or fluid replacement. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nMyelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia can occur. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month and then monthly or as clinically indicated. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nHepatic Toxicity: Twenty percent of patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Liver enzyme elevation usually occurs early in treatment. Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Drug-induced liver injury has occurred. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose is 200 mg daily. \nRenal Toxicity: An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy, with particular attention to patients with preexisting renal impairment or risk factors. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment. The recommended starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) are 300 mg and 400 mg daily, respectively. \nFluid Retention: Fluid retention can occur and may cause pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nEmbryofetal Toxicity: BOSULIF may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving BOSULIF. \nAdverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions observed in greater than 20% of patients in the Phase 1/2 safety population (N=546) were diarrhea, nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, anemia, pyrexia, and fatigue. The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in greater than 10% of patients were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia. \nCYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers: Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. \nProton Pump Inhibitors: Consider using short-acting antacids or H2 blockers instead of PPIs to avoid a reduction in BOSULIF exposure. Separate antacid or H2 blocker dosing and BOSULIF dosing by more than 2 hours. \nNursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or BOSULIF, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. \nPlease see full Prescribing Information at www.bosulif.com . \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

      "text": "Pfizer and Avillion Announce Positive Top-Line Results for Phase 3 BFORE Study of BOSULIF for First-Line Treatment of Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia [December 05, 2016] Pfizer and Avillion Announce Positive Top-Line Results for Phase 3 BFORE Study of BOSULIF for First-Line Treatment of Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Tweet \nToday, Pfizer Inc. and its partner Avillion LLP announced results from the Phase 3 BFORE ( B osutinib trial in F irst line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment) trial demonstrating superiority of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) over imatinib as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The study met its primary endpoint of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. No new or unexpected safety issues were identified. BOSULIF is currently indicated in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161205005343/en/ \n\"Since its approval, the efficacy and distinct tolerability profile of BOSULIF has provided an important treatment option for patients with Ph+ CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. The positive outcome of the BFORE study represents a key step in potentially broadening treatment options for patients in the first-line setting,\" said Mace Rothenberg, MD, chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. \"This is an important milestone for Pfizer's emerging hematology portfolio as we work to develop new treatments for patients with acute and chronic hematologic malignancies.\" \n\"This successful partnership between Pfizer and Avillion is good news for CML patients because additional first-line treatment options allow physicians to tailor therapy based on individual patient considerations,\" said Allison Jeynes-Ellis, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Avillion. \"The outcome of this partnership reinforces our belief in the potential of our innovative business model for the co-development and partnership of late-stage clinical candidates.\" \nBased on the results of the study, Pfizer will work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities to potentially make BOSULIF available for Ph+ CML patients in the first-line setting. Detailed efficacy and safety data from this study will be submitted for a future congress or peer-reviewed journal. \nPfizer and Avillion entered into an exclusive collaborative development agreement in 2014 to conduct the BFORE trial. Under the terms of the agreement, Avillion provided funding and conducted the trial to generate the clinical data that will be used to support potential regulatory filings for marketing authorization of BOSULIF as first-line treatment of patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. If approved for this indication, Avillion will be eligible to receive milestone payments from Pfizer. Pfizer retains all rights to commercialize BOSULIF globally. \nPfizer is advancing a broad range of therapies that leverage select pathways and mechanisms of action to address acute and chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders and lymphoma. \nAbout the BFORE Study \nBFORE ( B osutinib trial in F irst line chr O nic myelogenous leukemia t RE atment) is a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. The study enrolled 536 patients at multiple sites in North America, Asia and Europe. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BOSULIF 400mg or imatinib, a standard of care, for the duration of the study. The primary outcome was to show superiority of bosutinib over imatinib at 12 months by comparing MMR, or the proportion of patients in each arm whose levels of the Bcr-Abl1 kinase have dropped below 0.1%. \nABOUT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) \nBOSULIF® (bosutinib) is an oral, once-daily, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases. BOSULIF® was approved in September 2012 in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy and offers an important treatment option for these patients. In Europe, BOSULIF was granted conditional marketing authorization in March 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with one or more TKIs and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. The current approved dose of BOSULIF® is 500 mg orally once daily with food. For more information on BOSULIF resources available for healthcare professionals and patients, please visit www.BOSULIF.com . \nIMPORTANT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) SAFETY INFORMATION \nContraindication: Hypersensitivity to BOSULIF. Anaphylactic shock occurred in less than 0.2% of treated patients. \nGastrointestinal Toxicity: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur. In the clinical trial, median time to onset for diarrhea was 2 days, median duration was 1 day, and median number of episodes per patient was 3 (range 1-221). Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and/or fluid replacement. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nMyelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia can occur. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month and then monthly or as clinically indicated. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nHepatic Toxicity: Twenty percent of patients experienced an incrase in either ALT or AST. Liver enzyme elevation usually occurs early in treatment. Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Drug-induced liver injury has occurred. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose is 200 mg daily. \nRenal Toxicity: An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy, with particular attention to patients with preexisting renal impairment or risk factors. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment. The recommended starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) are 300 mg and 400 mg daily, respectively. \nFluid Retention: Fluid retention can occur and may cause pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. \nEmbryofetal Toxicity: BOSULIF may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving BOSULIF. \nAdverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions observed in greater than 20% of patients in the Phase 1/2 safety population (N=546) were diarrhea, nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, anemia, pyrexia, and fatigue. The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in greater than 10% of patients were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia. \nCYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers: Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. \nProton Pump Inhibitors: Consider using short-acting antacids or H2 blockers instead of PPIs to avoid a reduction in BOSULIF exposure. Separate antacid or H2 blocker dosing and BOSULIF dosing by more than 2 hours. \nNursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or BOSULIF, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. \nPlease see full Prescribing Information at www.bosulif.com . \nAbout Pfizer Oncology \nPfizer Oncology is committed to pursuing innovative treatments that have a meaningful impact on those living with cancer.

      "text": "View More Jobs NEW YORK, N.Y., December 5, 2016 – Today, Pfizer Inc. and its partner Avillion LLP announced results from the Phase 3 BFORE (Bosutinib trial in First line chrOnic myelogenous leukemia tREatment) trial demonstrating superiority of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) over imatinib as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The study met its primary endpoint of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months. No new or unexpected safety issues were identified. BOSULIF is currently indicated in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. “Since its approval, the efficacy and distinct tolerability profile of BOSULIF has provided an important treatment option for patients with Ph+ CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. The positive outcome of the BFORE study represents a key step in potentially broadening treatment options for patients in the first-line setting,” said Mace Rothenberg, MD, chief development officer, Oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. “This is an important milestone for Pfizer’s emerging hematology portfolio as we work to develop new treatments for patients with acute and chronic hematologic malignancies.” “This successful partnership between Pfizer and Avillion is good news for CML patients because additional first-line treatment options allow physicians to tailor therapy based on individual patient considerations,” said Allison Jeynes-Ellis, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Avillion. “The outcome of this partnership reinforces our belief in the potential of our innovative business model for the co-development and partnership of late-stage clinical candidates.” Based on the results of the study, Pfizer will work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory authorities to potentially make BOSULIF available for Ph+ CML patients in the first-line setting. Detailed efficacy and safety data from this study will be submitted for a future congress or peer-reviewed journal. Pfizer and Avillion entered into an exclusive collaborative development agreement in 2014 to conduct the BFORE trial. Under the terms of the agreement, Avillion provided funding and conducted the trial to generate the clinical data that will be used to support potential regulatory filings for marketing authorization of BOSULIF as first-line treatment of patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. If approved for this indication, Avillion will be eligible to receive milestone payments from Pfizer. Pfizer retains all rights to commercialize BOSULIF globally. Pfizer is advancing a broad range of therapies that leverage select pathways and mechanisms of action to address acute and chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders and lymphoma. About the BFORE Study BFORE (Bosutinib trial in First line chrOnic myelogenous leukemia tREatment) is a multi-center, open-label Phase 3 study designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of BOSULIF® (bosutinib) as a first-line treatment for patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML. The study enrolled 536 patients at multiple sites in North America, Asia and Europe. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive BOSULIF 400mg or imatinib, a standard of care, for the duration of the study. The primary outcome was to show superiority of bosutinib over imatinib at 12 months by comparing MMR, or the proportion of patients in each arm whose levels of the Bcr-Abl1 kinase have dropped below 0.1%. ABOUT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) BOSULIF® (bosutinib) is an oral, once-daily, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which inhibits the Bcr-Abl kinase that promotes CML; it is also an inhibitor of Src-family kinases. BOSULIF® was approved in September 2012 in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy and offers an important treatment option for these patients. In Europe, BOSULIF was granted conditional marketing authorization in March 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML previously treated with one or more TKIs and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. The current approved dose of BOSULIF® is 500 mg orally once daily with food. For more information on BOSULIF resources available for healthcare professionals and patients, please visit www.BOSULIF.com. IMPORTANT BOSULIF® (bosutinib) SAFETY INFORMATION Contraindication: Hypersensitivity to BOSULIF. Anaphylactic shock occurred in less than 0.2% of treated patients. Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can occur. In the clinical trial, median time to onset for diarrhea was 2 days, median duration was 1 day, and median number of episodes per patient was 3 (range 1-221). Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and/or fluid replacement. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. Myelosuppression: Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia can occur. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month and then monthly or as clinically indicated. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. Hepatic Toxicity: Twenty percent of patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Liver enzyme elevation usually occurs early in treatment. Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Drug-induced liver injury has occurred. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. In patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the recommended starting dose is 200 mg daily. Renal Toxicity: An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy, with particular attention to patients with preexisting renal impairment or risk factors. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment. The recommended starting doses for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30-50 mL/min) are 300 mg and 400 mg daily, respectively. Fluid Retention: Fluid retention can occur and may cause pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary. Embryofetal Toxicity: BOSULIF may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving BOSULIF. Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions observed in greater than 20% of patients in the Phase 1/2 safety population (N=546) were diarrhea, nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, anemia, pyrexia, and fatigue. The most common Grade 3/4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in greater than 10% of patients were thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia. CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers: Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. Proton Pump Inhibitors: Consider using short-acting antacids or H2 blockers instead of PPIs to avoid a reduction in BOSULIF exposure. Separate antacid or H2 blocker dosing and BOSULIF dosing by more than 2 hours. Nursing Mothers: Given the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or BOSULIF, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Learn more... \nWed, Dec 7, 2016, 09:23 GMT - UK Markets close in 7 hrs 7 mins Pfizer and Flynn Pharma fined over 2,600% NHS price hike \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma fined over 2,600% NHS price hike \"/> \nA regulator has ordered two pharmaceutical firms to pay a record penalty, accusing them of overcharging the NHS through a 2,600% overnight drug price hike. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had imposed a £84.2m fine on the manufacturer Pfizer and a £5.2m fine on distributor Flynn Pharma. It declared each \"broke competition law by charging excessive and unfair prices\" in the UK for phenytoin sodium capsules, an anti-epilepsy drug, used by 48,000 patients who could not switch to alternative medication for fear it would trigger seizures. US firm Pfizer (NYSE: PFE - news ) , best-known as the maker of Viagra, told Sky News it disputed the findings. \nThe regulator's investigation found prices were raised by up to 2,600% after the drug, once known as Epanitin, was \"deliberately\" de-branded in September 2012 when Stevenage-based Flynn bought the UK distribution rights from Pfizer. It meant that because the drug was now generic, it was no longer the subject of price regulation. \nThe CMA said the amount the NHS was charged for 100mg packs of the drug rocketed from £2.83 to £67.50, before coming down to £54 from May 2014. It meant, the watchdog said, that NHS expenditure on phenytoin sodium capsules rose from about £2m a year in 2012 to about £50m in 2013. \"The prices of the drug in the UK have also been many times higher than Pfizer's prices for the same drug in any other European country,\" the statement said. Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the CMA's investigation, said: \"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on suchbehaviour and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited.\" Pfizer said it would appeal \"all aspects\" of the ruling. Its statement said: \"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law. \"Phenytoin capsules were a loss making product for Pfizer and the Flynn transaction represented an opportunity to secure ongoing supply of an important medicine for patients with epilepsy, while maintaining continuity of manufacture. \"When Flynn launched its product, the company set a price that was between 25 and 40% less than the price of the equivalent medicine from another supplier to the NHS which had long been regulated, and appeared to be acceptable to, the Department of Health.\" Both firms have been given up to four months by the CMA to reduce their prices, to ensure there is no risk to the supply of the drug to patients who rely on it. \nThey are not the first to face similar action. \nGlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) was among firms hit with a £45m penalty in February after a \"pay-to-delay\" scandal surrounding blockbuster anti-depressant drug Seroxat.

If it's given the go-ahead, avelumab will join the previously approved PD-1/PD-L1 drugs Opdivo, Keytruda, and Tecentriq in reshaping how doctors treat cancer. \nWill a potential avelumab approval next year be a game-changer for this pharmaceuticals giant? In this clip from The Motley Fool's Industry Focus: Healthcare podcast, analyst Michael Douglass is joined by contributor Todd Campbell to discuss avelumab's pending FDA decision and what it could mean for Pfizer investors. \nA full transcript follows the video. \n10 stocks we like better than Pfizer \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of Nov. 7 , 2016 \nThis podcast was recorded on Nov. 30, 2016. \nMichael Douglass: Let's hop on over to the opposite end of the biotech spectrum: big pharma, Pfizer, the massive drug company closing in in what's called the PD-1 race. PD-1, immuno-oncology, the idea here is: Cancer cells are often able to cloak themselves from being identified and targeted by the immune system. The idea of PD-1 inhibitors is that they basically block that cloaking device, and the immune system can be like, \"Whoa, wait a minute, this thing is bad. Let's kill it.\" It's been a really exciting area. You and I were chatting before the show, and you mentioned: Immuno-oncology is expected to be, potentially, a tens-of-billions-of-dollars opportunity across the entire market, just because of how effective some of these drugs have been in treating cancer. Pfizer, a later entrant compared to Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck . Let's talk about Pfizer's new PD-1 drug. \nTodd Campbell: This is a pretty cool area of advancing technology and how we treat cancer. We talked about PD-1s as the ability to be able to help T cells find and destroy cancer more easily -- avoid the cloaking system, if you will. Where we find that, that could be really useful in helping and patient outcomes in cancer, is when these drugs are used in combination with other drugs that are already effective in these different indications. There is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm that PD-1- and PD-L1-targeting drugs could generate a lot of money on their own, but also that they could generate a lot of money when used in concert with these other approved medications. \nAs you mentioned, you have Bristol-Myers and Merck already on the market with their PD-1-targeting drugs. You also have Roche entering the game in October with a drug called Tecentriq, which got approved for some use in some non-small cell lung cancer patients. Now, sometime next year, it's likely that we'll see Pfizer join the race with this drug, avelumab. (laughs) I always butcher the names, I apologize. \nDouglass: Pronunciation is always a fraught ... \nCampbell: Pfizer has teamed up with Merck Germany -- which is not to be confused with Merck, the U.S.-based company -- on this drug. The FDA has just accepted their application for approval of its use in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, which is a very rare form of skin cancer that has very few treatment options, and a very poor prognosis. So, there's a major unmet need they're targeting with this drug. Because of that, the FDA is reviewing this drug on an accelerated pathway that could get it on the market as soon as next summer. It won't move the needle a lot for Pfizer, because Pfizer is a huge company, generating billions of dollars in revenue, and the patient population is pretty small. But it's important, because it gets them in the race for PD-1 and PD-L1, and would potentially allow them to expand that label into other indications. There are a lot of trials that are still ongoing, evaluating this drug for Pfizer. 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes \nDouglass: A couple really good points you made that I want to call out here. The first one is, the initial opportunity with the drug is often the full opportunity with the drug. You have a drug that is good for this one disease, and it's good for that disease and that's all. The real beauty and excitement of PD-1s and PD-L1s is, they are potentially -- and they are certainly being tested extensively -- used in a number of cancers. So, it's not just, \"This one was approved for non small-cell lung cancer, OK, cool, it's a non small-cell lung cancer.\" It's also, \"What about renal cell carcinoma? What about these blood cancers? What about whatever else?\" There's a lot of potential opportunity with this, and that's why investors are really excited about them. At the end of the day, these combos, given the size of the market -- cancer is an enormous disease, and obviously a very deadly one -- given the diversity of cancers that need to be targeted and fought back against, there's really opportunity here for multiple winners. \nCampbell: Yeah. If you look at the way it's shaped up already -- and this is a relatively new class of cancer-fighting compounds -- you have Opdivo sales in the third quarter already clocking in at a $3.6 billion pace. \nDouglass: $3.6 billion annualized. \nCampbell: Yeah, annualized. And, Keytruda clocking in at around a $1.2 billion annualized pace. So, you're already generating out, just from those two drugs, sales at like a $5 billion annualized pace. I think some of the peak sales estimates for PD-1s and PD-L1s put this market in the tens of billions of dollars. Now, as you and I have talked about in the past, Michael, peak sales estimates: Don't rely on them. (laughs) They're often wrong. But what we are seeing so far, proof in the pudding, is very strong uptake of these drugs, and very good revenue generation for investors for the ones that have already reached the market. \nDouglass: Yeah. So, this is definitely good news for Pfizer shareholders. I would not argue, and I don't think you would either, Todd, that this is thesis-changing for Pfizer, because no one drug can really easily move the needle for a company as big as Pfizer. What the opportunity with this drug is is yet still unclear. We only have these data points so far. Of course, obviously, actual approval is not guaranteed. The FDA certainly surprises people in both directions sometimes. I think there's still a lot of question marks as to how, long-term, this fits into the Pfizer strategy. But it is undoubtedly good news. It's nice to see Pfizer getting into this market and playing with the first movers, Bristol and Merck and Roche. \nCampbell: Absolutely. You mentioned, we only have the information so far on Merkel cell. There are 11 ongoing phase 3 trials that are either recruiting or not yet recruiting for this drug. I imagine that if investors stay tuned over the course of the next year, year and a half, they're going to see some more data coming out that will give them a little bit more clarity into what the peak potential could be for this drug. \nMichael Douglass has no position in any stocks mentioned.
