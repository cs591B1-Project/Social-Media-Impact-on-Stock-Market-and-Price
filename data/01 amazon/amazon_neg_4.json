      "text": "Amazon \nThe original Ramones—Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee, and Tommy—are dead. Black Sabbath is on their farewell tour. Anthony Bourdain, whose Kitchen Confidential forever scared readers off the Monday fish special, is a doting father with a new cookbook, Appetites . \nAppetites is an idiosyncratic compendium of the foods Bourdain enjoys cooking for his family—daughter Ariane and mixed martial arts fighting champion wife, Ottavia Busa. Yet as the book went to press, Bourdain and Busa announced their congenial divorce. Even as this puts a different spin on matters, Bourdain’s touching devotion to his daughter and her best friend Jacques keeps the book’s theme—family happiness, Bourdain style—intact. \nAppetites is neither a classic nor conventional cookbook. It’s not organized seasonally or really even by meal; don’t expect prettified chapters presenting elaborate breakfasts, lavish lunches, or photography courtesy of the “arranged dishtowel school”. A section entitled “Fight!” offers a single recipe for an Açaí Bowl. Evidently this stuff is quite restorative after a morning practicing Brazilian jiujitsu. “Party” covers what one might serve at such an event—think Chicken Satay with Fake-Ass Spicy Peanut Sauce or The Grill Bitchs (sic) Bar Nuts. “Hamburger Rules” offers two pages of musings on this crucial topic, sans recipes. \n“Thanksgiving” does offer recipes, alongside practical tips for surviving this most stressful of holidays. In lieu of a dessert chapter, readers are advised to eat Stilton, accompanied by a glass of port. There are more standard chapters on sandwiches, meats, and pasta; the book concludes with instructions for making stocks. Just don’t expect to learn how to prepare a standing rib roast or bake a layer cake here. Appetites isn’t that kind of book. \nNor is Appetites for beginners or what Julia Child dismissively termed “flimsies”. These are recipes requiring serious skills, with plenty of deep frying, pasta making, tripe-wrangling, and octopus handling. Even the most confident cook faces some unusual ingredients, here. Want to make the Korean Fried Chicken? You’ll need to hit the Korean market first to pick up gochukaru (ground Korean red pepper), gochujang (Korean fermented red pepper paste), and cheongju (Korean rice wine). Planning to whip up a batch of Sarwak Laksa Paste ? After you’ve located all 19 ingredients, you’ll need to grind, heat, and stir each in a wok. Bourdain calls this “a labor of love”. Or insanity. Whatever you call it, weeknight cooking it’s not. \nRecipes like New England-Style Lobster Roll, Gaufrette Potato With Smoked Salmon, Crème Fraîche, and Caviar, Ravioli of Salt Cod With Lobster Sauce or Poulet En Vesse: Homage A Mère Brazier, which calls for four ounces of foie gras and four black truffles, are for well off television stars or those with trust funds. Proles like your reviewer, in the interest of making her mortgage payment, must skip these recipes, however delicious they might be. \nAll of this said, serious home cooks will seriously enjoy Appetites . The indelicate humor characterizing Anthony Bourdain’s Les Halles Cookbook , is well-evidenced here. Consider this brief headnote for Candied Sweet Potatoes: “Put those goddamn marshmallows away.” That third slice of bread in club sandwiches? Possibly invented by the Nazis, the sure path to “a plate full of broken dreams”. The “Thanksgiving Tactical Primer” is full of helpful hints, including the preparation of a “stunt turkey”, leaving you, the cook, with ample time alone to: \n“...smoke a little weed, sit there in front of tv in your underwear, and enjoy a nice roast turkey sandwich with some reheated stuffing and gravy.” \nInto the kitchen. Like so many classically trained chefs, Bourdain is increasingly drawn toward Southeast Asian cuisine. While trading his chef’s whites to become a professional traveler/eater has doubtless influenced Bourdain’s palate, he’s far from alone in his culinary passions. Chefs as disparate as April Bloomfield, Gabrielle Hamilton, Yotam Ottolenghi, and David Tanis have worked and trained in the French-Italian vernacular. Yet all include Asian recipes on their restaurant menus and in their cookbooks. In Appetites , this means the aforementioned Kuching Laksa, a bowl of spicy noodles, and its attendant 19 ingredient spice paste. \nSidelined by dental surgery, your reviewer settled for preparing Do Chua with Herbs, Scallions, Sprouts, and Egg. Do Chua is a Vietnamese pickle of slivered carrot and daikon, mixed with a little sugar, salt, and sherry vinegar. Easy to make, possessing the compelling Southeast Asian taste combination of hot and sweet, sour and salty, do chua keeps for weeks in the refrigerater. It’s delicious all by itself, or mixed with the remaining salad ingredients—easily found items like basil, scallions, and hard boiled eggs—or stuffed into a Banh Mi. \nBourdain’s Banh Mi recipe calls for Spam, an ingredient your food snob reviewer had never bought, much less eaten. I wasn’t even sure where to buy it. It turned out the upscale market I’d patronized for years carried the stuff. There it sat, shelved high above the imported ventresca tuna and canned Alaskan salmon-sustainable, of course. Buying it felt disreputable, akin to purchasing farmed fish, or Peruvian tomatoes. Spam! I breathed deeply, reminded myself I was writing an article . Was I ashamed of my purchase, or my snobbery? Both. \nIn the safety of my kitchen I opened the iconic tin. An alarmingly homogenous, fleshy pink square plopped onto the cutting board. After the reading the ingredient list—surprisingly benign—I expected Spam to taste like salty ham. In fact it tasted of little at all. Banh Mi gets it flavor from lightly sauteéd chicken livers, ample butter, that do chua , cilantro, mayonnaise, and just enough red pepper to make matters zippy. Would I make this again? Absolutely. Would I include Spam again? Hell, no. \nI’m a firm believer in deep frying as restaurant activity. Restaurants, after all, have access to professional ovens capable of reaching charnel house temperatures. Further, restaurants have access to large, extremely dangerous pots of oil, which (poorly) paid people may dip foodstuffs into, achieving shattering levels of crispness. Afterward, restaurants may call professional hauling outfits to schlep their used cooking oil off the premises. \nThe home cook has none of these assets. The home cook has an inferior oven, an old frying pan, and carpal tunnel syndrome, causing burns when she forged ahead with the next recipe. \nBourdain writes The Macau-Style Pork Chop Sandwich may be “the most delicious thing in the book”. As I haven’t cooked every recipe in Appetites , I cannot vouch for this statement. I can tell you it was an enormous hit in our test recipe household of two. Nor does it ask for too many oddball ingredients, although black vinegar may be hard to find. If so, use another kind. Do risk the burns and inevitable mess to make this. It’s basically breaded pork chops fried at scary temperatures. The seasonings lean pan-Asian: soy sauce, sesame oil, Chinese rice wine, and garlic. The results, whether you stick them between slices of white break or eat them with cutlery, are truly worth the price of the book. \nCast Iron Grilled Chicken is a wonderful introduction to the amazing alchemy that is chicken cooked in a protective coat of yogurt. Here, said yogurt is mixed with a tablespoon of cumin and 15—yes, 15—cardamom pods, a goodly glug of olive oil, oregano, and black pepper before reposing in the fridge. You are then instructed to grill your chicken, assuming grilling is a possibility. If not, place your chicken on a ridged grill pan, cook it stovetop, and finish it in the oven. The results are amazing—simultaneously tangy and silky, a fine approximation, Bourdain promises, of great street food without any of street food’s sometimes unpleasant aftereffects. \nThe misses in Appetites are ultimately a question of taste (no pun intended), at times costly ingredients, and at times, the photography. I dislike food porn. Here, the many shots of food literally being stepped on by shoes, boots and bare feet—in an attempt to be artsy—in my mind rapidly crosses the line from juvenile silliness to plainly offensive. Wishing to be subversive is one thing. Bad taste is another. \nThe above are hardly reasons to strike Appetites from your must-have cookbook list. If you are serious about the business of cooking, from finding those exotic fermented peppers to setting up your mise en place to cooking said dish to serving your guests to chowing down, Appetites offers a whacking good time. There’s lots to learn here: have you ever made Buddae Jjigae ? I sure haven’t. In a world crammed with too many oversimplified recipes, a Kuching Style Laksa asking us to pull together 19 f*ing ingredients is a refreshingly demanding request. So is asking us, finally, to put those damned marshmallows away.

      "text": "Courtesy of Amazon November 9, 2016 | 07:15AM PT \nFor editor Jennifer Lame , reading Kenneth Lonergan ’s “Manchester by the Sea” met her high expectations. “I’ve been a fan of his for a long time and went in with such high hopes, which always leads to some amount of disappointment, but after reading it, it met them and more. I loved it.” This story first appeared in the November 08, 2016 issue of Variety. Subscribe today. See more. \nAfter receiving news that his older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) has died, Lee (Casey Affleck) takes leave from his job as a janitor in Boston to return to his home town of Manchester-by-the-Sea where he finds out he’s become the sole guardian of his nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) and is forced to confront the past that separated him from his wife, Randi (Michelle Williams), and the town he left behind. \nWhen we first meet Lee it’s not clear why his demeanor is rather stoic, unapologetic, and somewhat poignant. His personal tragedy is revealed through a parallel story of chronological flashbacks that informs viewers about his reluctance to return to the community where he was born and raised. “The structure is interesting because you don’t find out what happens to Lee until halfway through the film,” says the editor. “The flashbacks made this story so unique and different [that] I was nervous [about] how they would translate on screen because they were so beautifully written.” \nInstead of using a visual device to cue the audience when the narrative was weaving from past to present, they moved in and out without notice. “The whole idea that everything has to be explained ad nauseam can wreck your material,” says Lonergan, who also directed the film. “I’m not interested in creating mystery or confusion for its own sake, but you have to follow your instincts on what has resonance and assume the audience is going to go along with you.” \nLame played scenes typically longer than normal to create uneasiness around Lee. It rooted a subtle authenticity to his character. “As an editor you want to move things along so the audience doesn’t get bored, but the unorthodox pacing in the beginning of this movie serves the second half so well. We were fine-tuning and carefully crafting each scene so that every moment would impact the story. Showing Lee in these spaces like this allows the audience to see him interacting in a slightly off way.” \nTo create the dynamics between Lee and Randi, the editor used a less-is-more approach. “Everything to them is extremely painful,” Lame says. “One of my favorite parts in the script is when Randi says she should burn in hell for what she said to Lee. A lot of this movie is what you see and don’t see and we don’t get to see what happens after their separation. I can’t imagine what went down between the two of them and how awful it was, but when she says that line it makes me realize it all in that one line.” \nSound influenced the story by building an aesthetic that was an extension of the characters and their environments. “Kenny didn’t want a movie that was going to have abstract tones and tonal palettes that weren’t directly rooted in reality,” says Jacob Ribicoff, who served as the sound editor, designer, and re-recording mixer. “He wanted to craft a soundscape down to each detail. If we were in the interior of the house, he wanted to feel the cold of the room or the wind on the second floor in the bedrooms. He would step in to say you wouldn’t hear that bird in winter or would want to hear more of the neighborhood while we’re inside \nLee’s Boston apartment. Kenny had a specific sense of what he wanted to hear and I think it was all a function of the story and how the characters were feeling.” For composer Lesley Barber, “Kenny and I talked a lot about what it’s like for Lee, for someone who doesn’t magically bounce back after tragedy and trauma. I recorded each piece with a very fine-tuned approach to space, weather and atmosphere and exactly how the instruments were being performed.” \nThe piece “Plymouth Chorale” plays during Lee’s drive to Manchester and also while Patrick walks to his father’s funeral, and Lonergan admits the music elevated those scenes in a strange yet good way. “It’s hard to talk about music because of what it does. It skips your brain and goes straight to your emotions. Lesley composed a lot of music and when we dropped that song in it had an almost angelic quality. A simple melody with complicated harmonies — it’s the aural equivalent of including the sky in a shot. You see a street and you tilt up to reveal this big sky over it. Music does that. It changes the perspective and adds color.” Latest Predictions:",

      "text": "| 92 Percent of Amazon Shoppers Would Not Consider Purchasing a Product That Received Less Than Three Stars Feedvisor's Amazon User Study 2016 reveals valuable insights into Amazon shoppers purchase habits \nNovember 8, 2016; 06:27 AM \nTel Aviv, Israel (PRWEB) - Feedvisor’s Amazon User Study 2016 reveals an overall preference for high-quality shopping experiences, indicating that Amazon third-party sellers must compete on customer service in order to be successful. The study found that when buying from third-party sellers, nearly nine in 10 (87 percent) of shoppers say they always or sometimes check the seller rating, while only 13 percent rarely or never do. Nine in 10 (92 percent) of Amazon users will not purchase a product with a rating below three stars. \nThe study was conducted by Feedvisor, the algorithmic repricing and revenue intelligence company. It surveyed more than 1,500 U.S. Amazon users and showed how they rely on the online marketplace for price and product information during their shopping journeys. The study revealed that 70 percent of Amazon Prime members and more than half of non-Prime members always or often check Amazon prices before making a purchase on another site. In addition, 59 percent say they always read the full product description when researching and comparing products on Amazon. \n“Amazon users are savvy shoppers and they have high expectations of their eCommerce experiences,” said Ohad Hagai, VP Marketing of Feedvisor. “It’s no longer enough for Amazon sellers to post their items on the marketplace and expect to make a sale. Since the vast majority of customers prefer free and quick shipping through Amazon, sellers might wish to consider Fulfillment By Amazon as a means to accelerating their sales.\" \nOverall, the study reveals that in order to maximize revenue, third-party sellers will have to go above and beyond when it comes to providing quality content and customer service. \nKey findings include: \n● Amazon uses aren’t exclusive: 61 percent of Amazon users have also made a purchase on a brand or retailer’s site, such as Walmart.com or Gap.com, in the last year. ● Prime members shop Amazon more often: About a third of Prime members make purchases on Amazon at LEAST once per week, compared to 5 percent of non-Prime members. ● Shipping costs are a deterrent to sales: More than 85 percent of customers consider shipping charges to be a deal-breaker. ● Amazon users consider third-party sellers to be reliable: Nearly 80 percent of Prime and 60 percent of non-Prime members have purchased from third-party sellers. \n“As the eCommerce marketplace becomes increasingly crowded, Amazon sellers need to focus on meeting consumers' demands in order to be successful,” Hagai added. “With speedy shipping, quality product descriptions and positive reviews, third-party sellers will be able to maximize sales on Amazon.” \nTo view the complete results of the Feedvisor Amazon User Study, please visit: http://fv.feedvisor.com/amazon-customer-survey-p.html?utm_source=pr&utm_medium=csurvey&asset=csurvey-pr. \nAbout Feedvisor: Feedvisor is the pioneer of Algo-Commerce — the discipline of using Big Data and Machine Learning Algorithms to make business critical decisions for online retailers.

      "title": "Amazon Vouchers Offered Monthly for Costa Ricans in USA Who Top Up Claro Mobiles in Costa Rica on LlamaCostaRica.com",
      "text": "10 Amazon vouchers of $40 and 1 of $100 are offered monthly as prize for Claro top ups made of minimum $10 sent to Costa Rica mobiles between November 1st, 2016 and April 30th, 2017.\n\nAtlanta, Georgia (PRWEB) November 09, 2016\n\nLlamaCostaRica.com offers on a monthly basis 11 Amazon vouchers of $40 or $100 to 11 Costa Ricans who make international mobile top ups from the USA to Claro Costa Rica on the website. Expats who make such top ups until April 30, 2017, enter automatically the raffle for one of these Amazon vouchers. The promotion addresses Costa Ricans living in the USA and their families and friends in Costa Rica, who are the direct beneficiaries. The offer is available until the end of April, 2017, for mobile top ups of minimum $10 on LlamaCostaRica.com: https://llamacostarica.com/buy/mobile_recharge\n\nThe chance to win an Amazon voucher of $40 or $100 requires a customer to top up a Claro mobile in Costa Rica from the USA until April 30, 2017 on LlamaCostaRica.com. Each month, the website will single out 11 people randomly. Prizes vary according to the amount recharged on LlamaCostaRica.com:\n-10 Amazon vouchers of $40 each will be offered for top ups higher than $10;\n-1 Amazon voucher of $100 will be offered for top ups higher than $25.\n\nAnyone living in the USA can benefit of this promotion. The only condition is to have a free account on LlamaCostaRica.com and send a minimum of $10 as mobile credit to a Claro mobile in Costa Rica. It takes seconds to open an account and few more seconds to send the Claro credit, as existing customers point out on review platforms.\n\nFor Costa Ricans in the USA, who send Claro credit to mobiles in Costa Rica, this is a win-win situation. Besides the $10 minimum credit they send to Claro mobiles, they get something themselves: one of the $40 worth Amazon vouchers or the unique $100 voucher. The current promotion is available with the service called Mobile Recharge on LlamaCostaRica.com.\n\nThe winner will be singled out randomly among those who send Claro credit of minimum $10 on LlamaCostaRica.com to someone in Costa Rica, until April 30, 2017. The winners will be contacted by phone in maximum 48 hours. The voucher will be sent by email in maximum 7 business days.\n\nThere are also backup winners besides the 11 winners each month. If the winner can not be contacted during the mentioned time, the prize will be offered to the backup winner.\n\nA customer can have multiple entries, yet a participant can only win once during the campaign. The Amazon vouchers cannot be exchanged to cash or other prizes. More details are available on LlamaCostaRica.com.\n\nBesides this promotion, offers run monthly on LlamaCostaRica.com for Claro, as well as for top ups to the other phone providers in the country: Kolbi, FullMovil, Movistar and Tuyo. The online top up process takes less than 1 minute and the credit gets to the destination instantly. Plus, it saves a lot of time and hassle to top up online on LlamaCostaRica.com.\n\nLlamaCostaRica.com offers a full expat service. Besides the online Mobile Recharge service, it also facilitates international calls to Costa Rica through the Voice Credit service. There are at least 3 big advantages about this service, that makes LlamaCostaRica.com stand out on the global market:\n-Balance never expires.\n-The lowest price to call Costa Rica is 1.2 cents/minute. In other words, one can get up to 526 minutes for a $10 Voice Credit purchase.\n-Voice Credit balance can be used to make calls to other destinations in the world.\n\nThank You points are offered on any regular purchase on LlamaCostaRica.com, outside the promotional period. Once these points reach 1000, they can be converted into $10 Voice Credit for free calls to Costa Rica and other parts of the world.\n\nLlamaCostaRica.com makes available 3 ways to call for each customer:\n-From any phone to any phone, through the use of access numbers;\n-From one's laptop or computer, through the Web Call application;\n-Using KeepCalling app on any smartphone or device using Android or iOS..\n\nLlamaCostaRica.com is a website dedicated to the Costa Rican diaspora worldwide. The website is a brand of KeepCalling, a global telecommunications company registered in 2002 in the USA. Presently, KeepCalling provides its services to hundreds of thousands of consumers and businesses, with a focus on customer satisfaction.

A video further illustrating the new vacuum sealer's features can be viewed at, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI_lql1Brag . “Our durable Food Storage Vacuum Sealer Canister is built with an arc design for uniform pressure across surface when vacuum sealed. This feature slows down food deterioration of food products by reducing the atmospheric oxygen upon vacuum sealing, creating an anaerobic environment that inhibits the growth of bacteria or fungi that causes food spoilage,” explains Clark.

It has a gentle setting in which the user can switch the food sealer vacuum to a lower pressure to prevent delicate food from being crushed.

      "text": "Donald Trump said Amazon and Jeff Bezos have a ‘huge antitrust problem.’ Now they may. The president-elect is certainly one to hold grudges. share Asa Mathat Let’s state the obvious: Donald Trump and Amazon CEO, and Washington Post owner, Jeff Bezos do not see eye to eye. And that becomes a more concerning prospect for Bezos and Amazon now that Trump is president-elect. In May, after learning of the large team of Washington Post reporters looking into his past, Trump told conservative TV commentator Sean Hannity that Bezos was using the paper to damage Trump’s chances because he feared what a President Trump would mean for Amazon. \"He thinks I'll go after him for antitrust,\" Trump said at the time. \"Because he's got a huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing. \"He's using the Washington Post, which is peanuts, he's using that for political purposes to save Amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of antitrust.\" Trump’s campaign later reiterated this narrative in a statement claiming that the Post was being used as political leverage so Amazon doesn’t “get sued for monopolistic tendencies that have led to the destruction of department stores and the retail industry.” In response, Bezos has appeared undaunted in public. Bezos told an audience at Recode’s Code Conference in June that “a presidential candidate should embrace” the media coverage that the country’s democracy allows for rather than fight it. More recently, Bezos called out Trump for his threats of retribution against media organizations he feels have wronged him. In the wake of Trump’s win, I asked an Amazon spokesman if Bezos planned to comment. I was told he doesn’t. Investors seem to be unsure about what a Trump presidency means for the online retailer. Amazon’s stock was down 2.68 percent as of 11:25 am ET on Wednesday morning. Other tech stocks like Apple, Facebook and Alphabet were also down, but all less than 2 percent. recode_divider",

      "text": "KITT.AI is rolling out its newest flagship product.\nKITT.AI co-founder and CEO Xuchen Yao, and co-founder Guoguo Chen. Available today in beta, ChatFlow is a multi-platform framework for creating conversational agents, also known as chatbots. It provides a drag-and-drop interface that lets developers code and deploy chatbots that can exist directly within apps like Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Kik, Skype, Twilio, and Slack.\n“ChatFlow’s conversational engine solves many pain points of developing a natural language dialogue system: managing dialogue context, tracking dialogue states, planning/drawing a dialogue diagram, etc.,” said KITT.AI co-founder and CEO Xuchen Yao .\nChatbots, which have received much attention and hype over the past year, are designed to help people be more productive and improve efficient communication between businesses and customers. The technology sometimes provides a better interface than using a separate app or website.\nHere’s a bit more on how ChatFlow works:\nKITT.AI, originally incubated inside Paul Allen’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), launched last year and in January landed funding from Founders’ Co-op and Amazon’s Alexa Fund . It also received investment from Madrona Venture Group. The startup currently consists of its three co-founders, but is looking to expand and raise additional funding soon.\nIn May, KITT.AI rolled out its first software toolkit called Snowboy , which lets developers add verbal “hotword detection” to devices. The startup optimized Snowboy last month to allow third-party developers outside of Amazon to use the “Alexa” wake word to turn on their devices.",

      "text": "Investors shopping for retail stocks should select Amazon ( AMZN ) over Macy's ( M ) , and they should certainly keep an eye on Nordstrom ( JWN ) , says TheStreet's Jim Cramer. Macy's third-quarter results tomorrow morning will let investors see how the company's real estate sales are going, as well as where its outlook for the fourth quarter stands. The Terry Lundgren-led company has been hit hard by the rise of Amazon , which has exploded in selling clothing, hurting Macy's as a result. Macy's has responded in kind to selling real estate, cutting costs and trying to improve the in-store experience as it tries to survive.",

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

      "text": "It's fair to say Donald Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos aren't on the best terms.\nTrump has often attacked Bezos for using his Washington Post ownership to keep taxes low on Amazon and free of antitrust allegations, famously saying, \" if I become president, oh, do they have problems.\" \nBezos, meanwhile, called out Trump for his accusations of mainstream media bias, saying he's \"eroding our democracy,\"  and suggesting Trump take a trip to space instead. \nNow that Trump will become the next US president, Bezos and the companies he own — Amazon and The Washington Post specifically — may have to brace themselves.  These are the areas that could face increased scrutiny under Trump's presidency: \nTaxes Trump seems to believe Bezos's ownership in The Washington Post (a company owned by Bezos himself, not Amazon) is somehow helping Amazon keep its taxes low. \nHe once called Amazon a \"big tax shelter\" and suggested Bezos is using The Post's unprofitable business as a means for tax deduction on Amazon. He also said Amazon is  getting away with \"murder\" because Bezos is using Washington Post's influence to keep politicians away from taxing the company properly. \nIt's unclear what actions Trump will take to prove his case, but it's not hard to see him threatening to put more pressure on Bezos and Amazon by asking the IRS to increase its scrutiny.  \n\"[Bezos] bought this paper for practically nothing, and he’s using that as a tool for political power, against me and against other people, and I’ll tell you what, we can’t let him get away with it,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News in May. \nAmazon paid $273 million in income taxes in 2015. The company has historically had very little profit and only about $14 billion in cash, a small amount compared to other companies of its size. \nOn the other hand, if anything, Trump's proposed tax policy could help Amazon. Trump plans to lower the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, and cut the  tax rate on income held overseas to 10% from the current 35%. \nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/673884271954776064\nThe @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon ! Big tax shelter \nAntitrust Trump once claimed Bezos has a  \"huge antitrust problem.\" \n\"What he’s got is a monopoly, and he wants to make sure I don’t get in,\" Trump said. \nIt's true that Amazon controls a big chunk of the online retail and cloud computing market, but making a case for antitrust could prove difficult for Trump. \nAntitrust laws clearly state that the main goal is to protect consumers  from unfair price hikes due to the lack of competition. But Amazon is all about offering every day low prices and putting customers first in its business. Amazon also owns just 15% share of total US retail and 20% share in e-commerce — hardly anywhere near a monopoly. \nThere's a chance Amazon could potentially raise prices in the future, but its history suggests that's unlikely. Amazon continuously offers discounts and big sales days, while its cloud service AWS is the driving force behind an industry-wide price war, even after offering 52 price cuts so far . \nAP \nThe Washington Post Perhaps Trump's biggest concern seems to be Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post. He believes Bezos exerted influence over the paper's editorial voice in order to reduce Trump's chances of winning the presidency . In the run-up to the election, The Post did break a number of stories that tainted Trump's image . \nBezos has repeatedly disputed this claim and made it clear that he is not involved in the editorial process. He's also criticized Trump for not welcoming more media scrutiny . \n“An appropriate thing for a presidential candidate to do is say, ‘I am running for the highest office in the world, please scrutinize me.' That’s not what we’ve seen. To try and chill the media and threaten retribution and retaliation, which is what he’s done in a number of cases, it just isn’t appropriate,\" Bezos said. \nWe don't know what Trump will do to The Washington Post, but the paper has a long history as a political watch dog, so this is an area to watch. \nInvestors Amazon's stock is down 2.6% as of Wednesday afternoon, but most investors believe Amazon won't be much affected by Trump, largely because it's still growing fast with a lot of long-term growth potential in front of it. \nAP \"The drivers of Amazon’s business are broad — secular growth trends in online retail, cloud computing, and media distribution — that it wouldn’t seem to me to be at risk unless the government specifically began to regulate those industries with impediments to growth, which seems unlikely,\" Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian told Business Insider.\nMizuho's analyst Neil Doshi also noted he remains bullish on Amazon because its market share is \"far from displaying monopolistic characteristics\" and growth remains strong.\n\"We remain buyers of Amazon's stock given its growing market share of retail dollars shifting online, strong flywheels around its core business, and continued strength and profitability coming from its AWS cloud segment,\" Doshi wrote.\nAmazon's representative wasn't immediately available for comment on this article.\nNOW WATCH: How the ‘perfect body’ for men has changed over the last 150 years \n",

      "title": "Creative Muvo 2c Review",
      "text": "Buy at Amazon \nRecently we reviewed the Creative iRoar, which is one of the most expensive and feature-packed speakers the company has ever made. We liked it so much, we figured we’d take a look at one of their entry-level products to see if that level of quality extends down to lower price points. The Muvo 2c is a fun-sized little speaker with microSD support and an IPX6 rating, but is it any good? What’s inside \nThe packaging is just a hard plastic shell with the speaker plainly visible inside. Once you get it open you’ll get the speaker, a micro USB charging cable, and a quick start guide, and the instruction booklet. Build & Design \nCreative didn’t reinvent the wheel with the Muvo 2c. There’s nothing particularly different about it. It’s small and square-ish in shape which is a form factor that’s a dime a dozen. It also isn’t heavy at all, weighing in at only 165 grams. We got a chance to look at the red model, but you can also pick it up in black, blue, or green if you have a preference. The single driver inside is protected by a grill that takes up the entire front portion of the speaker, and up top you’ll find five buttons to help you control playback without reaching for your source device. \nThat said, the 2c isn’t entirely generic. On the back you’ll find a passive bass radiator which isn’t entirely brand new, but also isn’t too common in sub-$50 speakers. Another useful feature is the IP66 rating which means that it can survive basically any amount of water shy of submersion. A small rubber flap on the right side keeps the micro USB input, 3.5mm input, and microSD card slot safe from liquid. The Muvo 2c may be small, but it’s a little too bulky to stuff in your pocket. That said, it’ll easily fit in a backpack. Still, if you want to take it with you somewhere you can always attach a wrist loop to the top left of the speaker. Connection \nFor the price we weren’t expecting anything other than basic functionality in terms of connection, but the Muvo 2c surprised us. Not only does it have a strong connection up to around 30 feet (which is the standard), it also has all kinds of controls and inputs. Lining the top of the speaker are five buttons: a power button, Bluetooth pairing button, multifunction button, volume down, and volume up. Along with that are two small LED lights. The one on the right tells you what mode you’re in. You can switch between AUX input, Bluetooth, microSD Card, or USB Audio, each with its own designated color. The left light tells you how much battery is left which is a little more straightforward. \nThough I was happy to find that the Muvo 2c had a bunch of controls, it was borderline impossible to figure out how to access them without opening the manual. And even then, it got confusing. I’ll attach a picture of the instructions below, but the TL;DR version is that Creative decided to follow almost none of the playback control norms that we’re used to with all other speakers. For example, normally you might skip a song by double or triple tapping a certain button, but with the Muvo 2c you’ll have to press the multifunction button and a volume button simultaneously to achieve the same result. Though all of the controls worked fine, the process of having to remember a combination of colors, taps, and buttons requires the use of the instruction manual unless you have a really good memory. Battery Life \nCreative claims a battery life of 6 hours of constant music playback with the 2c. While we did achieve 6 hours on medium to low volume, we only got about 4 hours on max volume. Sound Quality \nSeeing as most consumers stream their music, we did most of our testing via Bluetooth. That said, we also did some testing using files on a microSD card slot. \nLows \nThe Muvo 2c isn’t a powerhouse by any means when it comes to the low end. It’s not going to rattle your desk or anything, but the passive bass radiator on the back does add a good push. It’s still hard to consider a true bass, but for the size it isn’t bad. In songs that had a really deep bass like “Tremors” by SOHN there were a few slight distortions in the beginning, but that was the exception rather than the rule. Overall, the low end did as good as you can expect from a speaker of this size. \nMids \nVocals do have a slight precedence over the other instruments but there isn’t much spacing. The main piano melody in “Hymn For The Weekend” by Coldplay sounds like it’s being punctuated by the snare hits and just sounds a little messy when all of the elements join together during the chorus. \nHighs \nThe highs were handled nicely and never really becomes sharp or painful. There is a good amount of shimmer in cymbals and hi-hats but not anything to write home about. Just a solid performance overall. Conclusion \nCreative may have blown us away with their iRoar and SoundBlaster speakers, but the Muvo 2c didn’t really blow me away. It’s a solid speaker that sounds just as good as some of its competitors at this price point such as the Anker Soundcore . Still, it does have a few more tricks up its sleeve like microSD support and the ability to pair two speakers together, but that’s also hindered by its lackluster battery life and confusing controls. If you absolutely need microSD than this speaker is the way to go, but I still find it easier to recommend something like the Anker Soundcore which is similar in sound but has a drastically better battery life.

Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services.

(Photo: Amazon) \nWe’ve scoured the web to find you the best deals on good products. While Reviewed.com may receive a small share of the revenue from your purchase, editorial opinions are independent from any business sales. \nToday and tomorrow, Prime members can get Amazon's Dash Buttons—normally $4.99 each—for just $0.99 using code \"REVIEWDASH\" at checkout (limit three per customer). \nIf you haven't encountered the Dash buttons before, they're little branded buttons that link to your Amazon account and let you push the button to re-order whatever product the button links to (Cheez-Its, Pop-Tarts, Milk-Bones, and so on). \nNot only can you get your very own little Dash buttons for $0.99, but Amazon is actually giving a $4.99 credit for each purchase—yep, they're essentially paying you $4 to buy a button. \nBecause it's limited to three discounted Dash buttons per Prime customer, your max gain from this button bargain is $12. But still, it's not every day you get paid $12 to push buttons—dash off and get some! Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fDcWd8 Most Popular",

      "text": "  03:13 AM EST Amazon May Be Expanding Into Housekeeping Wednesday, November 09, 2016 Amazon May Be Expanding Into Housekeeping According to reports, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) isn’t just satisfied with having control over your wallet and a good chunk of world wide web traffic. It’s also interested in helping people tidy up around the house, doing laundry, and putting groceries and other essentials away. The program is called Amazon Assistants, and it looks as though the company in the process of testing out the program in its hometown of Seattle. The Seattle Times first reported Amazon posted the housekeeper ads on Monday. This isn’t Amazon’s first foray into services. The company already has a large web services division, which supplies hosting and other cloud-based services for tech companies. It also connects members to local contractors through its Home Assistants program. One thing to note is the company’s ad specified the housekeepers would be employees, rather than independent contractors. Perks offered include Amazon stock, flexible hours, on-site training, and health insurance. If Amazon did decide to really ramp up this project, it would likely switch to a independent contractor model, like Uber has done with its drivers. Like with many of Amazon’s premium services, it looks like Amazon Assistants will only be marketed to Prime members only. Amazon is known for testing out new concepts in Seattle. There’s no indication this newest initiative is anything more than a small pilot project. It could be years until we see the program get rolled out in a big way, if at all. Amazon is keeping mum about the new project, declining to comment when reached by reporters.",

      "text": "Here's how much the highest-paid actors make from the shows by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu   2:30 PM Eugene Kim - Business Insider \nRobert De Niro will make his TV debut on Amazon through a new crime series directed by David O. Russell. \nNot much is known about the yet-to-be-titled show, but it won't come cheap for Amazon: De Niro is reported to be making $850,000 per episode. \nTo figure out where De Niro's pay stands among other actors in shows produced by rival TV streaming apps, we looked through a recent report published by Variety. The report, based on Variety's own survey of actors and industry people last month, gives a glimpse into what the top stars make for each episode. \nWe narrowed down the list to the shows produced by Netflix, HBO, Amazon, and Hulu, since they're the four most popular standalone TV streaming services. Check out how much the highest-paid actors are estimated to make per episode: \nYou can see the full Variety report here>> 8. Aaron Paul (The Path, Hulu): $225,000 per episode Hulu 7.

      "text": "Cloud How Amazon is planning for the second decade of the cloud revolution AWS is one of leaders in public cloud, but the market is still evolving. Here's how they plan to keep innovating. By Conner Forrest   iStockphoto/lukutin77 \nAs common as it has become in enterprise infrastructure, cloud computing is still in its infancy. At the 2016 Structure Conference in San Francisco, Amazon's Matt Wood explained how Amazon Web Services (AWS) plans to continue growing and innovating over the next 10 years. \nAt the time of this writing, AWS is just over 10 years old. Wood, who was the company's third employee in Europe, said that AWS has a $13 billion revenue run rate and roughly one million active customers per month. \nCloud has become \"the new normal\" for the way enterprises are operating, Wood said, especially over the last five years. But, that doesn't mean that AWS doesn't have its work cut out for it. \nSEE: Cloud computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) \nContinuing its cloud dominance starts with AWS understanding how customers currently use the cloud. Wood said that, typically, development and test environments are the first to move to the cloud. However, they are starting to see customers then begin working on new apps that are optimized for the cloud. For example, Major League Baseball (MLB) has outfitted stadiums with missile tracking systems, and they use that and AWS tools to track baseball movements and statistics, and display it on live TV. \nThe types of verticals that are embracing the cloud is broadening as well. In the financial sector, Capital One is running all of its mobile banking on AWS, Wood said, and the reason why is surprising. One of the main reasons Capital One is working with AWS is for security, as Wood said people from Capital One have said security is higher on AWS than through what they can accomplish in their own data centers. Must-Read Cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy \nAnother trend that will impact cloud computing is big data—there's more data being produced and it's more complex. In on-premises deployments, you're \"hitting your walls\" in that you run out of storage or you can't process it quickly enough, Wood said. AWS sees big data processing, and the tools needed to accomplish it in the cloud, as a big part of the next 10 years. \nWood said that AWS believes that, in the fullness of time, most organizations won't run their own data centers. However, he said that hybrid cloud and hybrid architecture are key stepping stones. Many companies have invested a lot of money in their own infrastructure, and they want to keep getting a return on that investment. \nFor AWS, Wood said, they want to make all these environments accessible through a single platform. He said that AWS has made a \"significant investment\" in allowing users to run their infrastructure alongside AWS, allowing for the hybrid path. \nAs the cloud takes away the competitive differentiation of data center technology, it democratizes it for all customers, Wood said. So, small companies have access to the same data center tech that large companies do through AWS. As such, Wood said, companies are differentiating more on data than data center technology. \nOverall, Wood said, AWS customers won't ever want less functionality or fewer features, so they will try to continue innovating with new tools and services as quickly as they can. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers AWS is about 10 years old, but it is important that it plans strategically for the next 10 years if it wants to maintain its leadership in the cloud space. AWS' Matt Wood believes that cloud is democratizing data center tech, so customers have to differentiate more on their use of data. While AWS wants everyone to move to the public cloud, they view hybrid cloud as a core stepping stone and they are investing in enabling it for customers.

      "text": "Amazon looks to clean house literally November 9, 2016 by Angel Gonzalez, The Seattle Times \nIs Amazon.com thinking of providing good housekeeping as its next Prime member perk? \nTwo Seattle job postings for \"home assistants\" on Amazon's website suggest so. \nThey call for potential recruits to join \"Amazon Assistants,\" which the company describes as \"experts in helping Amazon customers keep up their home.\" \nThat means helping customers with \"tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away.\" \nThe goal is to provide, as part of a two-person team, \"timesaving assistance to Amazon Prime members,\" so they can run an \"errand-free\" home. \nAmazon didn't respond to a request for comment. \nThe apparent venture serves to underscore how creative Amazon is becoming when it comes to reasons to join the Prime membership program. \nMembers pay $99 a year for guaranteed shipping, and also get perks that range from a Netflix-like streaming video service to photo storage and even free books. \nMembership also includes discounts to Amazon Music Unlimited, a Spotify-like music-streaming service, in addition to a more limited music library at no extra cost. \nIn exchange, Amazon receives cash flow that helps cover the cost of the perks. Most important, it gains loyal shoppers. Members spend twice as much as nonmembers do ($1,200 annually on average, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a research firm.) \nThe success of the program has been such that it has become one of Amazon's main \"pillars,\" multibillion-dollar revenue generators. Nearly half of U.S. households belong to the program, according to analysts. \nCIRP, the research firm, says membership growth is beginning to slow somewhat as it starts to reach the limit of households that can afford it. \nSo the obvious way to stir up more interest is by packing in more perks. CEO Jeff Bezos highlighted Prime in his most recent letter to shareholders, saying that \"we want Prime to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member.\" \nAmazon devotees can already hire a housekeeper through Amazon's marketplace for independent home-service providers, launched last year. \nBut this seems different: Amazon's job posting is for a housecleaning Amazonian, with benefits ranging from Amazon stock and health insurance, as well as possibly overtime pay. \nThe posting is written with the cheerful prose the company uses to entice engineers or data scientists. \n\"If you love making a house feel like a home then this is the role for you,\" the ad says. \n\"Tasks you will become awesome at\" include housecleaning alongside a professional cleaner, washing and folding laundry, restocking essentials and groceries. \nAlso, Amazon is looking for \"outgoing, detail-oriented, and tech savvy\" college graduates or those with an equivalent degree to fill the job. Five or more years of experience as a hotel concierge or a barista help, according to the job posting.",

      "text": "The Offer Direct Link \nGet Amazon Dash buttons free with promo code + $4.99 free Amazon credit Amazon Dash buttons usually cost $4.99. They also come with a offer to get $4.99 credit after first use. Using various promo codes, it’s currently possible to pay $0 for Dash. You still get the $4.99 credit after first use, making it a $4.99 moneymaker in Amazon credit.\nThere are a few promo codes working to get the Dash button free. Here are the promo codes we have so far, mentioned on Slickdeals :\nSLICKBUTTONS\nCOLLECTDASH\nKINJADASH\nIDGDASH\nBGRBUTTONS\nSome of these codes may have expired already. Find two of them that are still valid; the first will get you $4 off and the second will knock off the remaining $.99, making it free.\n\nThe Fine Print As always, Amazon Dash buttons can be ordered by Prime members only.\nOur Verdict Probably not worth bothering with if you aren’t interested in the Dash idea, but certainly a good deal if you’re interested in trying Dash, whether for convenience of the tech-thrill.\nTide Dash is probably a popular option, but I just noticed now a Gift Card Dash option. Apparently, you order Amazon gift cards through the Dash button. Not sure I’d ever use that since I prefer selecting a specific credit card, but certainly interesting. Full list of Dash buttons here .\nThis post contains our Amazon affiliate link; we appreciate when you use it! \nThe post Free Amazon Dash Button + $5 Free Dash Credit [Prime Only] appeared first on Doctor Of Credit .\n",

      "title": "Walmart Vs. Amazon: E-Stores Battle It Out",
      "text": "Share \nThere’s no question that Walmart’s e-store and Amazon are going toe-to-toe in the battle of the best retail giant. \nAs the retail space continues to reinvent itself, the rivalry between the two retailers seems to only gain traction. \nThe gloves came out last year when Amazon officially booted Walmart out of its long-running top spot of being the world’s biggest retailer. From then on, it seems both companies have continued to push the retail envelope — forging new partnerships, expanding around the globe and ensuring customers can access their products across channels. \nWhile there’s no way to tell who will actually win the battle, it’s safe to say both e-store giants are putting up a good fight. \nJust months ago, Walmart made a big move to go after a new market and rebrand with the acquisition of Jet , a company with no profits to date but one that’s showing rapid growth selling household goods and groceries online. The firm has reportedly gained 350,000 users a month since its launch in 2015. \nJet has achieved over $1 billion in sales from more than 4 million shoppers, and Jet’s sales in July grew 168 percent since August 2015, whereas Walmart’s online sales grew by only 30 percent. \n“In a growing market, Walmart.com lost ground — sales dropped 0.7 percent from the quarter before. It takes a bit of work to lose ground in a market that’s on fire, and that’s not something that Walmart’s CEO was particularly happy to explain away,” PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster commented earlier this year in a piece about the reinvention of retail. \n“Jet.com is being positioned now as Walmart’s saving grace as it tries to recapture its eCommerce mojo,” she said. “And although the need to rev up that mojo is essential, it may be that the Jet.com acquisition is about more than merely giving Walmart.com a new lease on life.” \nMany believe Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion is just a ploy to beat out Amazon based on price. But according to CEO Mark Cohen of Sears Canada, it is a “waste of money” and “a terrible mistake.” \nAmazon’s profitability is not based on its price points but on the company’s seamless methodology and service in delivering consumer goods, Cohen said. Walmart’s online sales were $13.7 billion in fiscal year 2015, while Amazon’s sales in 2015 were $107 billion. \nMichael Lasser of UBS speculated that Walmart’s purchase of Jet may have just been a maneuver to bring Marc Lore onboard to run the firm’s eCommerce and that this could herald poaching by Walmart of other top performers from Amazon and eBay. New talent from among the best and the brightest would certainly help Walmart, and it is no secret that Jet shoppers tend to be wealthier, younger and more urban.",

      "title": "Amazon.com: Can Donald Trump Do What No One Else Has?",
      "text": "Large ENLARGE Amazon’s retail dominance could be at risk under the Trump Administration. Illustration: Photo: Sean Gallup/Getty Images \nShares of Amazon.com are down 2.5% Wednesday, on a day when the broad market is up nearly 1.1%. \nSo why the weakness? Perhaps it’s because President-Elect Donald Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos haven’t exactly gotten along in the past. Back in May, the two business executives exchanged some harsh words, with Trump suggesting that Amazon was an illegal monopoly. \nTrump, then on his way to securing the Republican nomination, first criticized the coverage of him in the Washington Post, which is personally owned by Jeff Bezos (not Amazon). Trump told Fox News, according to a Washington Post account , that Bezos was using the Post “as a tool for political power against me and against other people, and I’ll tell you what, we can’t let him get away with it.” \nAnd he raised the idea that Bezos had an antitrust issue on his hands because of Amazon’s e-commerce dominance. \nA few days later, Bezos answered back that Trump’s comments are “not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave.” \nSome might try to argue that Amazon has achieved monopoly status in online retail, amounting to a violation of antitrust laws. Could Trump make that case when he takes office in January? No one else has managed to challenge Amazon’s dominance, but maybe Trump can. Investors have a least some reason to be nervous. Text Size",
