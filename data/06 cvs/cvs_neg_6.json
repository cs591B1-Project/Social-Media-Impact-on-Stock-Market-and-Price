      "title": "CVS employees hide, call police after man asks about sliced cheese",
      "text": "RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — What began as a spontaneous trip to the store ended up being one of the most bizarre experiences of Ricky Berry’s life. He and his roommate went to purchase a grocery item and ended up having the police called on them.\nBerry and his roomate told 8News they walked into the CVS in Carytown and asked an employee if they sold sliced cheese. The worker kindly replied that they did not.\nA few minutes later, the employee — all of the store employees, in fact — were nowhere to be found. Berry and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, said they were in the store with another customer for more than 30 minutes alone before an officer with the Richmond Police Department showed up.\n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said.\nAs for the third customer who was as confused as the two roommates, Berry said, “he was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That’s all he needed.”\n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening up the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry explained. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.”\nSo the officer joined in on the search for the missing employees. Berry recorded a video on his Snapchat account of what happened next.\n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry said.\nEventually, the employees were found in the back of the store hiding in a locked room. After making a few calls, the officer told the customers they had to leave.\nIn one of the videos he recorded, Berry said, “We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding.”\n“He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told 8News Reporter Jonathan Costen. “We had no idea what was going on.”\nBerry said the officer was kind and was just doing what he was told to do.\nMultiple attempts to contact the store manager were denied, although a CVS spokesperson apologized and said the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained.",

      "title": "No evidence of aloe vera found in the aloe vera at Wal-Mart, CVS, Target",
      "text": "The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all.\nSamples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice - another name for aloe vera - as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water.\nThere's no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't approve cosmetics before they're sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS.\n\"You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,\" said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing.\nAloe's three chemical markers - acemannan, malic acid and glucose - were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News . The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that's sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can't be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico.\nTarget declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores, CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them.\nAloe plant Darrell Wong / Fresno Bee An aloe plant grows in a field of California gold rocks in Fresno, Calif.\nAn aloe plant grows in a field of California gold rocks in Fresno, Calif.\n(Darrell Wong / Fresno Bee) The four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart's Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target's Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships.\nThe tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent.\nFruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that's farmed and processed in Guatemala.\nBoth companies disputed Bloomberg's findings.\n\"We've been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,'' John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth's general counsel, said in a telephone interview. \"We stand behind our products.''\nTim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there's no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn't an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn't mean the aloe isn't real, he said.\n\"Acemannan has been misinterpreted,'' Meadows said. \"The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody's guess.''\nThough it's true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn't a test that's designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant \"is not a major component\" of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn't see evidence of aloe or interfering substances.\nALOE Daniel Acker / Bloomberg Aloe vera plants are displayed for a photograph in Tiskilwa, Illinois, on Nov. 18, 2016.\nAloe vera plants are displayed for a photograph in Tiskilwa, Illinois, on Nov. 18, 2016.\n(Daniel Acker / Bloomberg) The CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier.\nSeveral law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies' private-label products. They're seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled.\n\"No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,'' attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms.\nFruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations.\nIndependently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels.\nAcemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry.\nJesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn't detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He's been making aloe products since 1989.\n\"What you have there is not aloe,'' said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. \"It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.''\nAcemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe's makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won't register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth's Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm's gels, citing proprietary formulations.\nAloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the \"plant of immortality\" in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it's been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\nConcerns over imitation aloe aren't new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group's executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said.\nJeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he's seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they're not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars.\nMaking just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form.\n\"Aloe is all harvested by hand,\" Barrie said. \"It's an involved process and it's not cheap.\"\nThere's no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe's healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, \"there's nothing to hang your hat on\" in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn't been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\"There's a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you'll sell more of it whether it's a cream or a lotion for sunburns,'' said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council.\nSome people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house.\nMeredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said.\n\"I like just having it at home to snip it from there,\" Zielke said. \"I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.\"",

      "text": "by Joshua M Brown \nI was talking to a banker at CVS this morning while waiting for my prescription to be filled (I have laryngitis and my sinuses are f***ed). \nHe was on the phone talking about setting CD rates and I was playing with the blood pressure armband until the lady yelled at me to stop. One of the important things to keep in mind about the recent surge in rates is that all it’s really done is brought us back to where we started the year. \nMy chart below illustrates the year in US Treasury bond yields…you may click to embiggen. \nWe get questions from investors about how to allocate the fixed income portion of their portfolios. Our response is quite different than what you might hear from others in the media. \nWe don’t make bets on long vs short duration and we don’t go for “unconstrained” strategies that can be short the bond. Getting the direction of rates right is every bit as easy as getting the direction of the stock market right. By which I mean it is not at all easy. Think about how many smart people have been “keeping duration low” over the last 7 years, and missing the lion’s share of the gains the asset class has had to offer. \nOur answer is to say that, at any given time, there are some areas across the curve that offer a better expected return profile than others. We want to quantify this expected return premium and systematically overweight toward it. It’s not sexy, but we think it’s effective, and that’s all that matters. Combining this strategy on the Treasury side with a diversified mix of munis, TIPS, investment grade corporates, mortgage-backed securities and high yield credit is a humble approach that offers flexibility and several non-correlated return streams. \nThe alternative to our approach is to scramble around trying to guess at what’s about to happen next and place bets on directional moves, which we are unwilling to attempt. We leave the prognosticating to the Bond Kings. May the odds be ever in your favor 😉 \nIf you’re unsure about what to do in the presence of rising yields and declining bond prices, you can talk to us here . We literally do this for a living. \nYou can also read my colleague Ben Carlson on the subject of how bad the losses in bonds might get . \nFull Disclosure: Nothing on this site should ever be considered to be advice, research or an invitation to buy or sell any securities, please see my Terms & Conditions page for a full disclaimer.

      "text": "  \nThree brands of over-the-counter homeopathic children’s drugs, two bearing the CVS name, have been recalled over uncertainty about the amount of potentially poisonous belladonna. \nRaritan Pharmaceuticals recall announcement , issued Thursday, says U.S. Food & Drug Administration tests determined varying amounts of belladonna from the amount stated on 135-tablet bottles of CVS Homeopathic Infants’ Teething Tablets in lot Nos. 41116 and 43436; 0.85-ounce bottles of CVS Homeopathic Kids’ Ear Relief Liquid, lot No. 35254; and 0.85-ounce bottles of Kids Relief Homeopathic Ear Relief Oral Liquid, lot No. 33149. \nCVS initiated its own recall of the teething tablets in September. At the same time, the FDA issued a blanket warning to throw out homeopathic children’s teething tablets and gels. Homeopathic remedies emphasize a “natural” approach to healing. \nRaritan says it makes the products for Homeolab USA, which supplies the belladonna blends. \nDespite carrying the Italian term for “beautiful lady,” belladonna is “a substance that can cause harm at larger doses,” Raritan’s recall notice states. “The company is voluntarily recalling the product out of an abundance of caution.” \nAccording to Encyclopedia.com, “ingestion of high concentrations of atropine, a potent alkaloid found in belladonna, can cause severe illness and death. Atropine is fatal in doses as small as 100 mg, which equals 5-50 g of belladonna herb, depending on the potency of the particular plant. For children, a fatal dose is even significantly less.” \nDavid J. Neal: 305-376-3559 , @DavidJNeal Related content",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products. \nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera. \nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\" \nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results. \nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe. \nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises. \nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. \nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nRICHMOND, Va. ( WRIC ) — What began as a spontaneous trip to the store ended up being one of the most bizarre experiences of Ricky Berry’s life. He and his roommate went to purchase a grocery item and ended up having the police called on them. \nBerry and his roomate told 8News they walked into the CVS in Carytown and asked an employee if they sold sliced cheese. The worker kindly replied that they did not. \nA few minutes later, the employee — all of the store employees, in fact — were nowhere to be found. Berry and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, said they were in the store with another customer for more than 30 minutes alone before an officer with the Richmond Police Department showed up. \n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said. \nThe other customer was as confused as the two roommates. Berry said, “He was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That’s all he needed.” \n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening up the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry explained. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.” \nSo the officer joined in on the search for the missing employees. Berry recorded a video on his Snapchat account of what happened next. \n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry said. \nEventually, the employees were found in the back of the store hiding in a locked room. \nAfter making a few calls, the officer told the customers they had to leave. In one of the videos he recorded, Berry said, “We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding.” \n“He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told 8News Reporter Jonathan Costen. “We had no idea what was going on.” \nBerry said the officer was kind and was just doing what he was told to do. \nMultiple attempts to contact the store manager were denied, although a CVS spokesperson apologized and said the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained. \nOriginally published by our Media General sister station in Richmond, Virginia, WRIC-TV Share this: ",

      "text": "No Evidence of Aloe Vera Found in the Aloe Vera at Wal-Mart, CVS Lydia Mulvany and Zeke Faux Nov 25, 2016 2:15 pm ET (Bloomberg) -- The aloe vera gel many Americans buy to soothe damaged skin contains no evidence of aloe vera at all. Samples of store-brand aloe gel purchased at national retailers Wal-Mart, Target and CVS showed no indication of the plant in various lab tests. The products all listed aloe barbadensis leaf juice — another name for aloe vera — as either the No. 1 ingredient or No. 2 after water. There’s no watchdog assuring that aloe products are what they say they are. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they’re sold and has never levied a fine for selling fake aloe. That means suppliers are on an honor system, even as the total U.S. market for aloe products, including drinks and vitamins, has grown 11 percent in the past year to $146 million, according to Chicago-based market researcher SPINS LLC. “You have to be very careful when you select and use aloe products,” said Tod Cooperman, president of White Plains, New York-based ConsumerLab.com, which has done aloe testing. Aloe’s three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid and glucose — were absent in the tests for Wal-Mart, Target and CVS products conducted by a lab hired by Bloomberg News. The three samples contained a cheaper element called maltodextrin, a sugar sometimes used to imitate aloe. The gel that’s sold at another retailer, Walgreens, contained one marker, malic acid, but not the other two. That means the presence of aloe can’t be confirmed or ruled out, said Ken Jones, an independent industry consultant based in Chapala, Mexico. 23,000 Stores Target Corp. declined to comment. Spokesmen for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. said their suppliers confirmed to them that their products were authentic. The four retailers have 23,000 outlets between them. The four gels that Bloomberg had analyzed were Wal-Mart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel. The lab that did the testing requested anonymity to preserve its business relationships. The tests used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance. It found additives such as maltodextrin and other ingredients, like triethanolamine, an emulsifier. In all the samples, lactic acid, a component that indicates degraded aloe vera, was absent. Fruit of the Earth, a Fort Worth, Texas-based aloe brand founded in 1980, said it made the gels for Wal-Mart, Target and Walgreens. Fruit of the Earth said its aloe supplier was Ormond Beach, Florida-based Concentrated Aloe Corp., which said it uses fair trade, organic aloe that’s farmed and processed in Guatemala. Both companies disputed Bloomberg’s findings. Raw Ingredients “We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,’’ John Dondrea, Fruit of the Earth’s general counsel, said in a telephone interview. “We stand behind our products.’’ Tim Meadows, president of Concentrated Aloe Corp., said that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t reliable for cosmetics because the presence of multiple ingredients can cause interference and there’s no way to test for aloe in finished products. He added that maltodextrin isn’t an adulterant because it can be used in the drying process, and while some ways of processing aloe remove acemannan, that doesn’t mean the aloe isn’t real, he said. “Acemannan has been misinterpreted,’’ Meadows said. “The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody’s guess.’’ Though it’s true that nuclear magnetic resonance isn’t a test that’s designed to study aloe vera in cosmetics, the lab results suggest that the plant “is not a major component” of the products, said James Neal-Kababick, director of Flora Research Labs in Grants Pass, Oregon, which tests and researches natural products. Jones, the consultant who also reviewed some of the tests, said he didn’t see evidence of aloe or interfering substances. The CVS aloe gel was made by Product Quest Manufacturing LLC. The Daytona Beach, Florida-based firm declined to comment or identify its supplier. Lawsuits Filed Several law firms, including Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Barbat, Mansour & Suciu PLLC, have filed lawsuits against the four retailers after separate testing failed to find aloe in the companies’ private-label products. They’re seeking class-action status and restitution for all the customers who they say were misled. See also: The Parmesan Cheese You Sprinkle on Your Penne Could Be Wood “No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,’’ attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September in Illinois on behalf of plaintiffs represented by 10 law firms. Fruit of the Earth, Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens denied the allegations. Independently, ConsumerLab.com said it had Fruit of the Earth brand Aloe Vera 100% Gel tested using nuclear magnetic resonance and found no evidence of aloe, while a competing brand, Aubrey Organics, did contain the markers that indicate aloe. ConsumerLab said it tested a dozen aloe products, including pills and juices, and just half the items appeared to meet the claims on their labels. Beneficial Properties Acemannan is thought to give the plant its beneficial properties, said Jane Wilson, executive director of the International Aloe Science Council in Silver Spring, Maryland, which represents the industry. Jesper Hummeluhr, founder of Copenhagen-based cosmetics maker Aloe Vera Group APS, said that if acemannan isn’t detected, the aloe was degraded during the manufacturing process or the product contains no aloe. He’s been making aloe products since 1989. “What you have there is not aloe,’’ said Hummeluhr, who reviewed some of the results without being told the name of the brands. “It could be a lot of water and a little bit of aloe added.’’ Reliability Questioned Acemannan is as much as 15 percent of aloe’s makeup. Levels below 0.01 percent of dry weight won’t register in the tests. Fruit of the Earth’s Dondrea declined to say how much aloe is in the firm’s gels, citing proprietary formulations. Aloe vera is a succulent farmed in hot climates like Texas and Mexico. Its spiky leaves contain a clear goo that people have used as a topical ointment to treat burns and other skin problems for millennia. Known as the “plant of immortality” in ancient Egypt, it was depicted on stone carvings 6,000 years ago, a burial gift for pharaohs, and it’s been used as a folk remedy for conditions from diabetes to epilepsy, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Imitation Aloe Concerns over imitation aloe aren’t new. The industry created the International Aloe Science Council in the 1980s as more and more products hit store shelves that contained little or no aloe, said Wilson, the group’s executive director. Maltodextrin, a light-colored powder that looks like aloe powder and is used as a food additive, was a common filler or substitute. Maltodextrin is cheaper than aloe, Wilson said. Jeff Barrie, a Keene, New Hampshire-based sales manager at AloeCorp, one of the biggest suppliers of raw aloe powder, said he’s seen competitors beat his lowest prices by half. That means they’re not selling aloe, he said. Aloe powder can cost as much as $240 a kilogram, he said, while the same amount of maltodextrin can cost a few dollars. Making just 1 kilogram of aloe powder, the ingredient used in finished goods like gels and drinks, requires 400 kilos (882 pounds) of aloe leaves, Barrie said. The process involves removing rinds from the leaves and dehydrating the remaining aloe into a powder form. “Aloe is all harvested by hand,” Barrie said. “It’s an involved process and it’s not cheap.” There’s no conclusive body of scientific research affirming aloe’s healing properties. While some studies have shown a benefit for burns and cuts, “there’s nothing to hang your hat on” in terms of clear evidence, partly because there hasn’t been enough research, said D. Craig Hopp, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrated Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Loving Aloe “There’s a lot of people that swear by aloe and love it, and if you put it in your product, you’ll sell more of it whether it’s a cream or a lotion for sunburns,’’ said Gary Shreeve, a vice president of global operations at Scottsdale, Arizona-based Forever Living Products, which sells aloe certified by the International Aloe Science Council. Some people are old school about aloe. Rather than buying aloe products, they just keep the succulent around the house. Meredith Zielke, a documentary filmmaker in Chicago, is one of many aloe lovers who have a simple remedy. She keeps the plant in her home to cool her skin when her Lyme disease acts up. And it works, she said. “I like just having it at home to snip it from there,” Zielke said. “I just like the comfort and the knowledge of having a plant in your house that can actually heal you.” ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "RICHMOND, Va. ( WRIC ) — What began as a spontaneous trip to the store ended up being one of the most bizarre experiences of Ricky Berry’s life.\nHe and his roommate went to purchase a grocery item and ended up having the police called on them.\nBerry and his roomate told WRIC they walked into the CVS in Carytown and asked an employee if they sold sliced cheese. The worker kindly replied that they did not.\nA few minutes later, the employee — all of the store employees, in fact — were nowhere to be found. Berry and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, said they were in the store with another customer for more than 30 minutes alone before an officer with the Richmond Police Department showed up.\nRicky Berry (Courtesy: WRIC) “We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said.\nAs for the third customer who was as confused as the two roommates, Berry said, “he was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That’s all he needed.”\n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening up the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry explained. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.”\nPhilip Blackwell (Courtesy: WRIC) So the officer joined in on the search for the missing employees. Berry recorded a video on his Snapchat account of what happened next.\n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry said.\nEventually, the employees were found in the back of the store hiding in a locked room. After making a few calls, the officer told the customers they had to leave.\nIn one of the videos he recorded, Berry said, “We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding.”\n“He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told WRIC. “We had no idea what was going on.”\nBerry said the officer was kind and was just doing what he was told to do.\nMultiple attempts to contact the store manager were denied, although a CVS spokesperson apologized and said the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained.",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Ricky Berry (Courtesy: WRIC) \nRICHMOND, Va. ( WRIC ) — What began as a spontaneous trip to the store ended up being one of the most bizarre experiences of Ricky Berry’s life. \nHe and his roommate went to purchase cheese and ended up having the police called on them. \nBerry and his roomate told WRIC they walked into the CVS in Carytown and asked an employee if they sold sliced cheese. The worker kindly replied that they did not. \nA few minutes later, the employee — all of the store employees, in fact — were nowhere to be found. Berry and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, said they were in the store with another customer for more than 30 minutes alone before an officer with the Richmond Police Department showed up. Ricky Berry (Courtesy: WRIC) \n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said. \nAs for the third customer who was as confused as the two roommates, Berry said, “he was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That’s all he needed.” \n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening up the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry explained. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.” Philip Blackwell (Courtesy: WRIC) \nSo the officer joined in on the search for the missing employees. Berry recorded a video on his Snapchat account of what happened next. \n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry said. \nEventually, the employees were found in the back of the store hiding in a locked room. After making a few calls, the officer told the customers they had to leave. \nIn one of the videos he recorded, Berry said, “We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding.” \n“He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told WRIC. “We had no idea what was going on.” \nBerry said the officer was kind and was just doing what he was told to do. \nMultiple attempts to contact the store manager were denied, although a CVS spokesperson apologized and said the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained.

      "text": "\nRICHMOND, Va. ( WRIC ) — What began as a spontaneous trip to the store ended up being one of the most bizarre experiences of Ricky Berry’s life. \nHe and his roommate went to purchase cheese and ended up having the police called on them. \nBerry and his roommate said they walked into the CVS in Carytown and asked an employee if they sold sliced cheese. The worker kindly replied that they did not. \nA few minutes later, the employee — all of the store employees, in fact — were nowhere to be found. Berry and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, said they were in the store with another customer for more than 30 minutes alone before an officer with the Richmond Police Department showed up. Ricky Berry (Courtesy: WRIC) \n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said. \nAs for the third customer who was as confused as the two roommates, Berry said, “he was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That’s all he needed.” \n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening up the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry explained. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.” Philip Blackwell (Courtesy: WRIC) \nSo the officer joined in on the search for the missing employees. Berry recorded a video on his Snapchat account of what happened next. \n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry said. \nEventually, the employees were found in the back of the store hiding in a locked room. After making a few calls, the officer told the customers they had to leave. \nIn one of the videos he recorded, Berry said, “We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding.” \n“He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told WRIC. “We had no idea what was going on.” \nBerry said the officer was kind and was just doing what he was told to do. \nMultiple attempts to contact the store manager were denied, although a CVS spokesperson apologized and said the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained.

      "text": " \nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video RICHMOND, Va. -- Something strange happened to Rick Berry and his roommate Philip Blackwell when they went shopping in a Carytown drug store last night. Berry asked the employee for one thing.\n\"Sliced cheese,\" Berry said. \"I just, yeah, all I asked was for sliced cheese and she told me that they didn't carry it.\"\nBerry said before he knew it, the two employees just vanished.\n\"We looked around for about, I want to say 30 or 45 minutes and we couldn't find anybody,\" Blackwell said.\nA third customer was also in the store.\n\"He was actually in the store before we were. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That's all he needed. And then the employees disappeared and we all just became part of some weird event.\"\nEventually, Berry says, police showed up. Customers and the police worked together to find the missing employees.\n\"He was laughing with us cause, you know, we were like this is how weird movies start. Weird apocalyptic movies start. Just joking about it.\"\nBerry shot his own Snapchat video that shows officers trying to find the employees.\n\"Someone called the cops on us.\"\nEventually, the officer took another phone call. And that's when the three customers were...\n\"Being kicked out because they were scared of us and they were hiding.\"\n\"Just told us that we needed to leave the premises or else we were going to be arrested for trespassing. And that completely flipped the script on all of us and we had no idea what was going on.\"\n ",

      "text": "Follow @rawstory \nA late night trip to a local CVS store by two black men to buy some sliced cheese turned into a run-in with police after panicked store employees hid in a locked backroom and called the cops, reports WATE . \nAccording to Ricky Berry, he and his roommate Philip Blackwell went to a CVS store in Carytown, Virginia in search of cheese. \nAfter asking an employee if the store carried cheese, and being told it did not, Berry said the staffer and other employees who had been on floor disappeared. \n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said, adding that they discovered another customer, attempting to purchase Oragel for a bad tooth, who also couldn’t find anyone to help him. \nBerry stated that a police officer showed up and helped them search the store only to discover the employees huddled in a back room behind locked doors. \n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry said, before adding that the officer made a few calls after which he told them they’d have to leave. \n“We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding,” Berry said, “He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. We had no idea what was going on.” \nThe two men said they attempted to contact the store manager and were unsuccessful, but did receive an apology from a CVS spokesperson who said the employed who called the police was being counseled and retrained. \nWatch the video below via WATE: About the Author Tom Boggioni is based in the quaint seaside community of Pacific Beach in less quaint San Diego.

( more ) A late night trip to a local CVS store by two black men who wanted to buy some sliced cheese turned into a run-in with police after panicked store employees hid in a locked backroom and called the cops. After asking an employee if the store carried cheese, and being told it did not, Ricky Berry said the staffer and other employees who had been on floor disappeared. The two men said they attempted to contact the store manager and were unsuccessful, but did receive an apology from a CVS spokesperson who said the employee who called the police was being counseled and retrained.

      "text": "Virginia CVS employees hide and call police on black customers looking to buy cheese CVS employees call police on black customers looking for cheese NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, November 26, 2016, 4:50 PM \nA late-night cheese run to CVS turned into a brush with law enforcement after store employees hid in the backroom and called the cops on a pair of black customers. \nRick Berry and his roommate Phillip Blackwell said they walked into the Virginia pharmacy and asked an employee if the store carried sliced cheese only to be told kindly that it did not. \nShortly after, Blackwell told WRIC , he noticed all the employees — including the one they’d just spoken to — had vanished. They were alone in the store with one other customer for about a half hour before a police officer arrived, Berry explained. Phillip Blackwell and his roommate Rick Berry said their CVS cheese trip was like \"how werid apoclyptic movies start.\" (wric.com) \n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry said. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.” \nWoman arrested while stealing $860 of nail polish from CVS \nThe roommates explained the situation to the officer who in the end, joined them in their search for the CVS employees. \n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry, who recorded the incident on his Snapchat, said. \nThey found the employees huddled together, locked into the store’s backroom and after making a few calls, the officer told the pair they had to leave. Ricky Berry recorded parts of the incident and then shared the clips on Snapchat. (wric.com) \n“We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding,” Berry said in one the Snapchat videos. \nCalif. police pummel wild man during arrest in CVS \nThe pair noted the officer remained friendly with them throughout the ordeal and was only doing what he was asked. \n“He just told us we need to leave the premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing, and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told the news station. “We had no idea what was going on.” \nA CVS spokesperson apologized on behalf of the employee and told WRIC the worker who called the police will be interviewed and potentially go through another round of training.

      "text": "6 minutes ago KidKorporate : Recoil Therapy: Multiple attempts to contact the store manager were denied, although a CVS spokesperson apologized and said the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained.If it's corporate policy to have everyone go hide in the back every time a black male enters the store, they are not going to get a lot of work done in many locations. To say nothing about all the inventory that will walk out the door when a black guy walks in (not necessarily him taking stuff, but the other customers are going to eventually figure out that nobody is there/watching them...)/is 'sliced cheese' some sort of newfangled code word for something that I don't know about//\"Put all the 'sliced cheese' in the bag & then lay on the floor and count to 100 before getting up...\"///no that sounds really dumbKids today are getting high off baby wipes boiled in Pine Sol, they call it \"sliced cheese.\" Huh, learn something new every day. Sounds like an idiotic/potentially dangerous way to get into an altered state.Couldn't they just slip a homeless guy a few bucks to go buy them a bottle of something the way it was done back in the day?",

Berry asked the employee for one thing. \n\"Sliced cheese,\" Berry said. \"I just, yeah, all I asked was for sliced cheese and she told me that they didn't carry it.\" \nBerry said before he knew it, the two employees just vanished. \n\"We looked around for about, I want to say 30 or 45 minutes and we couldn't find anybody,\" Blackwell said. \nA third customer was also in the store. \n\"He was actually in the store before we were. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That's all he needed. And then the employees disappeared and we all just became part of some weird event.\" \nEventually, Berry says, police showed up. Customers and the police worked together to find the missing employees. \n\"He was laughing with us cause, you know, we were like this is how weird movies start. Weird apocalyptic movies start. Just joking about it.\" \nBerry shot his own Snapchat video that shows officers trying to find the employees. \n\"Someone called the cops on us.\" \nEventually, the officer took another phone call. And that's when the three customers were... \n\"Being kicked out because they were scared of us and they were hiding.\" \n\"Just told us that we needed to leave the premises or else we were going to be arrested for trespassing. And that completely flipped the script on all of us and we had no idea what was going on.\" \n",

      "text": "CVS employees hide, call police after man asks about sliced cheese Jonathan Costen and Will Armbruster Published: November 25, 2016, 10:44 am Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) (WRIC Photo) \nRICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — What began as a spontaneous trip to the store ended up being one of the most bizarre experiences of Ricky Berry’s life. He and his roommate went to purchase a grocery item and ended up having the police called on them. \nBerry and his roomate told 8News they walked into the CVS in Carytown and asked an employee if they sold sliced cheese. The worker kindly replied that they did not. \nA few minutes later, the employee — all of the store employees, in fact — were nowhere to be found. Berry and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, said they were in the store with another customer for more than 30 minutes alone before an officer with the Richmond Police Department showed up. \n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said. \nAs for the third customer who was as confused as the two roommates, Berry said, “he was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That’s all he needed.” \n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening up the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry explained. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.” \nSo the officer joined in on the search for the missing employees. Berry recorded a video on his Snapchat account of what happened next. \n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry said. \nEventually, the employees were found in the back of the store hiding in a locked room. After making a few calls, the officer told the customers they had to leave. \nIn one of the videos he recorded, Berry said, “We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding.” \n“He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told 8News Reporter Jonathan Costen. “We had no idea what was going on.” \nBerry said the officer was kind and was just doing what he was told to do. \nMultiple attempts to contact the store manager were denied, although a CVS spokesperson apologized and said the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained.

November 26, 2016 CVS Extreme Couponing Shampoo Deals Under $1 \nHere is one idea from our weekly matchup for the $10.00/$40.00 purchase-based CVS email coupon that was sent to some shoppers this week. These deals will start tomorrow, 11/27 and go through Saturday, 12/3. To learn more about purchase-based coupons, be sure to read our tutorial .

The coupon can be printed any time between Thursday and Sunday and will be valid until four days after you print. If you print on Sunday, the coupon will not expire until Thursday.

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products. \nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera. \nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\" \nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results. \nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe. \nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises. \nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. \nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.

      "text": "CVS employees hide, call police after man asks about sliced cheese WISH Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nRICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — What began as a spontaneous trip to the store ended up being one of the most bizarre experiences of Ricky Berry’s life. He and his roommate went to purchase a grocery item and ended up having the police called on them. \nBerry and his roommate said they walked into the CVS in Carytown and asked an employee if they sold sliced cheese. The worker kindly replied that they did not. \nA few minutes later, the employee — all of the store employees, in fact — were nowhere to be found. Berry and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, said they were in the store with another customer for more than 30 minutes alone before an officer with the Richmond Police Department showed up. \n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said. \nAs for the third customer who was as confused as the two roommates, Berry said, “he was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That’s all he needed.” \n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening up the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry explained. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.” \nSo the officer joined in on the search for the missing employees. Berry recorded a video on his Snapchat account of what happened next. \n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry said. \nEventually, the employees were found in the back of the store hiding in a locked room. After making a few calls, the officer told the customers they had to leave. \nIn one of the videos he recorded, Berry said, “We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding.” \n“He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told 8News Reporter Jonathan Costen. “We had no idea what was going on.” \nBerry said the officer was kind and was just doing what he was told to do. \nMultiple attempts to contact the store manager were denied, although a CVS spokesperson apologized and said the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained.

      "text": "Black men asking for cheese cause CVS clerks to hide in fear By Mo Barnes | November 27, 2016 11:05 AM EST | 1 Rick Berry and Snapchat image of officer trying to open locked door (Photo credit: Screenshot WATE-TV) \nA simple request for sliced cheese lead to a police encounter for two Black men at a Carrytown, Virginia, CVS store. According to Ricky Berry, he and his roommate Philip Blackwell needed some sliced cheese and entered a local CVS. When they asked the clerk if the store carried cheese, he was told that it did not. Then the clerk walked away and the two men found themselves alone in the store with the exception of a man with a bad toothache. \n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said to the media, adding that they discovered another customer, “attempting to purchase Orajel for a bad tooth, who also couldn’t find anyone to help him.” \nSoon a police officer arrived at the scene and when told the story, he started to laugh. \n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry said. \nThe responding officer began searching the store also and found the employees cowering in fear behind a locked door. The officer talked to the scared staff and then made several calls to the dispatcher, he then told Berry and his roommate to leave the store. “We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding. He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. We had no idea what was going on,” Berry said. \nThe men received a telephone call from the CVS corporate office with an apology for their treatment. The company also stated that the employee who called the police is being counseled and retrained. The store reportedly had a negative encounter with a Black customer earlier in the day but that is unconfirmed. Share this:",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products.\nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera.\nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing.\nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\"\nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results.\nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe.\nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises.\nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart.\nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.",

      "text": "WATCH: These Two Black Men Were Kicked Out Of CVS And Police Were Called After Asking For Sliced Cheese The store is now apologizing for the incident. Published 3 hours ago \nBe careful what you ask for, especially if you’re at CVS and want sliced cheese. \nTwo men black men recently went to a CVS store in Richmond, Virginia and needed the dairy product. They asked one of the two store employees working at the time who then disappeared without warning. \nShortly afterward, the police showed up and tried to help find the two employees who ended up hiding in a storage room. Police did ask the two men, who are roommates, to leave the store. \nRick Barry and Phillip Blackwell 's story was later told by ABC8 News. They told the network what happened from their perspective. The whole thing sounds questionable to say the least. \n“Sliced cheese, all I asked for was sliced cheese,” Berry told WRIC. “We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn't find anybody.” Berry even claimed the police were laughing with the him and Blackwell during the employee search. “This is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” he said jokingly. \nThis is your America now, folks. CVS did appologize, but is it too little, too late? Check out what happened below. Written by Paul Meara",

      "text": "\nWe can’t drive, laugh or fly while Black—and now we can’t buy dairy either?\nThis seems to be the moral of a recent story about two Black customers who went into a local CVS store looking for cheese slices. According to WATE NEWS, Ricky Berry and his roommate Philip Blackwell went to the drugstore in Carytown, Virginia, looking for the dairy item. \nIt all started out pretty normal: The two asked the store’s employees if they had what they looking for, and they were told “no.” And then that’s when things got strange. Blackwell said that all of a sudden, the employees just disappeared.\n“ We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody ,” Blackwell said, saying that there was another customer who was trying to buy Oragel for a bad tooth, to no avail. \nThen to the young men’s surprise, the police showed up out of nowhere. They quickly explained what happened to the officer and were told that someone called 911 on them. The officer walked around the store and found the employees huddled in the back room with the doors locked.\nSigh.\n“ He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start ,” Berry said. \nBut then after making a few calls, the officer told Berry and Blackwell that they had to leave the store.\n“ We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding, ” Berry said, “ He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. We had no idea what was going on. ” \nAfterwards, the two men called the store manager, but their calls were not returned. However, a spokesperson for the drugstore recently apologized to Berry and Blackwell for the incident and stressed that the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained, WATE noted . \nYou know this ridiculous situation would almost funny, if this type of unsubstianed fear of Black people didn’t historically lead to our death . \nRELATED LINKS: \nBEAUTIFUL NEWS: Chicago Woman Dedicates Life’s Work To Slain Teen Who Saved Her 9 Years Ago \nJumping The Broom!

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products. \nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera. \nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\" \nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results. \nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe. \nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises. \nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. \nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.",

      "text": "\nLast year, CVS Pharmacy found itself in the center of a racial discrimination lawsuit . Four CVS employees alleged they were directed to racially profile black shoppers and to “follow the black guy” without any evidence the shopper was going to steal from the store. Now, CVS is back on the news after two men claimed employees for the pharmacy chain took excessive measures when they went on a late-night cheese run.\nRoommates Rick Berry and Philip Blackwell say they were just looking for some cheese slices when they entered a Richmond, Virginia CVS Pharmacy, but were instead told the store didn’t carry any cheese slices. What happened next was even more bizarre, because after being told there any cheese slices, the men claimed the employees simply vanished.\n“We looked around for maybe 30 to 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Berry told the local ABC News affiliate . “The employees disappeared and we just became a part of some weird event.”\nPolice were called over “suspicious activity,” and even when officers arrived to the pharmacy, the employees still remained in hiding. “[The officer] was laughing with us because this was like how weird movies start. Like, we’re in an apocalyptic movie,” added Berry.\nUnable to find the employees, the officers left, and Berry and Blackwell were forced to leave. In a Snapchat video one of the men reportedly filmed of the weird event, Berry said they were being “kicked out” because CVS employees were “scared” and were “hiding.” The employees reportedly told the men they would be arrested for trespassing if they didn’t vacate the premises immediately.\nCVS says they’re “apologetic” for what happened and will speak with employees to figure out what happened.\n(Via ABC 8 Richmond )\n",

Pictured is the cop trying to open a locked door \n'We had no idea what was going on.' \nDespite being kicked out by the cop, Berry only had good words to say about the officer, describing him as 'nice' throughout the ordeal. \nA CVS spokesman apologized in a statement given to WRIC, and said the store member responsible will be given additional training.

      "title": "Terrified CVS Workers Hide And Call Police After Black Customer Asked ONE Question (VIDEO)",
      "text": "  \nEvery day there are small examples of how fear allowed Donald Trump to amass such a large share of the white vote across the board. \nOn such example took place in Carytown, Virginia, when Rick Berry and his roommate Philip Blackwell paid a visit to a local CVS store. \nThe two black men entered the store, and Berry asked one of the store employees if they sold sliced cheese. The employee told Berry they did not. \nAfter that innocent exchange, things got weird. \nBefore long, all of the CVS staff disappeared, leaving bewildered customers searching for someone to take payment for their items. \n“‘We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,’ Blackwell said , adding that they discovered another customer, attempting to purchase Oragel for a bad tooth, who also couldn’t find anyone to help him.” \nAfter a long wait, Berry stated that a police officer entered the store. The officer then helped the men search the store for the missing staff, which they eventually discovered huddled in a back office behind locked doors. \nThe entire episode struck the men and the officer as funny. However, the mood quickly changed. \n“‘He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,’ Berry said, before adding that the officer made a few calls after which he told them they’d have to leave. \n‘We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding,’ Berry said, ‘He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. We had no idea what was going on.'” \nThe two men tried unsuccessfully to contact the CVS store manager for that location, but they did receive an apology from a spokesperson for the corporation who assured them that the staff member who called the police was being coached and retrained. \nOne can only imagine what kind of training video CVS has available to “retrain” employees who fear black men. \nFeatured image via YouTube",

      "text": "\nWe can’t drive, laugh or fly while Black—and now we can’t buy dairy either?\nThat seems to be the moral of a recent story about two Black customers who went into a local CVS store looking for cheese slices. According to WATE NEWS, Ricky Berry and his roommate Philip Blackwell went to the drugstore in Carytown, Virginia, looking for the dairy item. \nIt all started out pretty normal: The two asked the store’s employees if they had what they looking for, and they were told “no.” And then that’s when things got strange. Blackwell said that all of a sudden, the employees just disappeared.\n“ We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody ,” Blackwell said, saying that there was another customer who was trying to buy Oragel for a bad tooth, to no avail. \nThen to the young men’s surprise, the police showed up out of nowhere. They quickly explained what happened to the officer and were told that someone called 911 on them. The officer walked around the store and found the employees huddled in the back room with the doors locked.\nSigh.\n“ He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start ,” Berry said. \nBut then after making a few calls, the officer told Berry and Blackwell that they had to leave the store.\n“ We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding, ” Berry said, “ He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. We had no idea what was going on. ” \nAfterwards, the two men called the store manager, but their calls were not returned. However, a spokesperson for the drugstore recently apologized to Berry and Blackwell for the incident and stressed that the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained, WATE noted . \nYou know this ridiculous situation would almost be funny, if this type of unsubstianed fear of Black people didn’t historically lead to our death . \nRELATED LINKS: \nBEAUTIFUL NEWS: Chicago Woman Dedicates Life’s Work To Slain Teen Who Saved Her 9 Years Ago \nJumping The Broom!

      "text": "RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — What began as a spontaneous trip to the store ended up being one of the most bizarre experiences of Ricky Berry’s life. He and his roommate went to purchase a grocery item and ended up having the police called on them.\nBerry and his roomate said they walked into the CVS in Carytown and asked an employee if they sold sliced cheese. The worker kindly replied that they did not.\nA few minutes later, the employee — all of the store employees, in fact — were nowhere to be found. Berry and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, said they were in the store with another customer for more than 30 minutes alone before an officer with the Richmond Police Department showed up.\n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said.\nAs for the third customer who was as confused as the two roommates, Berry said, “he was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel.

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nRICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — What began as a spontaneous trip to the store ended up being one of the most bizarre experiences of Ricky Berry’s life. He and his roommate went to purchase a grocery item and ended up having the police called on them. \nBerry and his roomate said they walked into the CVS in Carytown and asked an employee if they sold sliced cheese. The worker kindly replied that they did not. \nA few minutes later, the employee — all of the store employees, in fact — were nowhere to be found. Berry and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, said they were in the store with another customer for more than 30 minutes alone before an officer with the Richmond Police Department showed up. \n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell said. \nAs for the third customer who was as confused as the two roommates, Berry said, “he was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That’s all he needed.” \n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening up the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry explained. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.” \nSo the officer joined in on the search for the missing employees.

      "text": "Maybe “cheese” sounded like “freeze” to the Richmond, Va. CVS workers who ran to the back and called the police on a young black man who asked for sliced cheese.\nThat’s right, Ricky Berry had the audacity to ask a store worker for cheese and for some reason, I’m sure none of which have anything to do with racism or Donald Trump being elected to the White House, all of the employees ran to the back of the store, WATE reports.\nBerry told the news station that he and his roommate, Philip Blackwell, walked the store with another customer for 30 minutes looking for anyone who could help them.\n“We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody,” Blackwell told WATE.\nThe other customer was just as confused as Berry and Blackwell.\n“He was in the store before we were actually. He had a bad tooth, all he wanted was some Orajel. That’s all he needed.”\nA Richmond police officer showed up and was equally as confused as the other customers as to what happened to all the workers.\n“We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening up the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry explained. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.”\nBerry said that the stunned officer walked the store laughing with them because he too couldn’t believe what he was seeing.\n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry told WATE.\nThe employees were found in a locked room in the back of the store, but get this. Once they were found, the roommates were kicked out of the store. The officer made a few calls but still told the men that if they didn’t leave they would be arrested.\n“We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding,” Berry said in a cellphone video of the incident, WTAE reports. “He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told WRIC. “We had no idea what was going on.”\nBerry added that the officer was just doing what he was told to do. Several attempts by the news station to contact the store’s manager were denied. A CVS spokesperson apologized for the incident and noted that the employee who called police would be interviewed and possibly retrained, the news station reports.\nRead more at WATE . \n",

      "text": "tweet \nI wish we could make some of these stories up. \nDuring an attempt to show just how dumb people really can be — Virginia CVS employees somehow thought they were being robbed when two black customers came in looking for cheese. \nRick Berry and his roommate Phillip Blackwell said they walked into the Richmond, Va., pharmacy and asked an employee if the store carried sliced cheese only to be told kindly that it did not. \nAfterwards — in a scene similar to a comedy movie or something — all the employees ran to the back and hid out, until police arrived. Shortly after, Blackwell told WRIC, he noticed all the employees — including the one they’d just spoken to — had vanished. They were alone in the store with one other customer for about a half hour before a police officer arrived, Berry explained. “We were walking around trying to find an employee, and the cop himself ended up opening the emergency door, which set the alarm off,” Berry said. “A couple of minutes later, he got the call from the alarm company asking what was going on.” \nThe two roommates explained the situation to the officer — who in the moment of hilarity — helped the two men locate the employees — who were all huddled together, locked into the store’s backroom. “He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry, who recorded the incident on his Snapchat, said. \nFlip The Page To See More: 1",

      "text": "The Police Were Called After Two Black Men Asked for Some Cheese at CVS \"We were like, 'this is how weird apocalyptic movies start.\" Jack Buehrer Video via WORLD NEWS/YouTube \nLast week, two roommates from Richmond, Virginia made a late-night run to CVS in search of some sliced cheese. Instead, they were greeted with terrified employees, and eventually the police. \nAccording to ABC 8 , Rick Berry and Philip Blackwell walked into the store on Thanksgiving evening. After being told the pharmacy did not carry cheese, Berry and Blackwell—who are black—claim the employees called the police and hid from them, leaving the store's customers without service. \n\"W e looked around for about 30-45 minutes and we couldn't find anybody,\" Blackwell told ABC. Coming Soon! — Harris from the Post ( @rousseau_ist ) November 28, 2016 \nOne customer, Berry told the network, had a bad tooth and was looking for medication. \"All he wanted was some Orajel, but the employees disappeared and we all just became part of some weird event.\" \nThe police would eventually arrive at the CVS after being called to investigate some \"suspicious activity,\" but the employees remained in hiding. The officers were unable to locate the workers and even began joking with Berry and Blackwell about the incident. \"We were like, 'this is how weird apocalyptic movies start,\" Berry said. Those White people could have literally got them brothas killed just for going to the CVS & asking if they had any more cheese slices. — Joseph ( @josephlboston ) November 24, 2016 \nEventually, the officers left and the employees reappeared. According to Berry, however, the two men were asked to leave the store by the workers, and told they would be arrested for trespassing. \nCVS said they were looking into the incident and were \"apologetic\" to Berry and Blackwell. Still, the incident is the second time in the last several months that the pharmacy chain has been in the news for alleged discrimination. Last year, the company was the focus of a lawsuit filed by four former employees who claimed that staff members in a number of New York City stores were coached to racially profile people of color. I was at a CVS that was robbed last year, I don't think the robbers asked for cheese!! # cmonman https://t.co/ IWb3jlW4Pv",

      "text": "\nWe can’t drive, laugh or fly while Black—and now we can’t buy dairy either?\nThat seems to be the moral of a recent story about two Black customers who went into a local CVS store looking for cheese slices. According to WATE NEWS, Ricky Berry and his roommate Philip Blackwell went to the drugstore in Carytown, Virginia, looking for the dairy item. \nIt all started out pretty normal: The two asked the store’s employees if they had what they looking for, and they were told “no.” And then that’s when things got strange. Blackwell said that all of a sudden, the employees just disappeared.\n“ We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody ,” Blackwell said, saying that there was another customer who was trying to buy Oragel for a bad tooth, to no avail. \nThen to the young men’s surprise, the police showed up out of nowhere. They quickly explained what happened to the officer and were told that someone called 911 on them. The officer walked around the store and found the employees huddled in the back room with the doors locked.\nSigh.\n“ He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start ,” Berry said. \nBut then after making a few calls, the officer told Berry and Blackwell that they had to leave the store.\n“ We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding, ” Berry said, “ He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. We had no idea what was going on. ” \nAfterwards, the two men called the store manager, but their calls were not returned. However, a spokesperson for the drugstore recently apologized to Berry and Blackwell for the incident and stressed that the employee who called the police will be interviewed and possibly retrained, WATE noted . \nYou know this ridiculous situation would almost be funny, if this type of unsubstianed fear of Black people didn’t historically lead to our death . \nRELATED LINKS: \nBEAUTIFUL NEWS: Chicago Woman Dedicates Life’s Work To Slain Teen Who Saved Her 9 Years Ago \nJumping The Broom!

When the two asked an employee if the store had any, she told them that the store didn’t. Moments later, the two employees present disappeared. Berry and Blackwell were looking for the staff members with another customer for more than 30 minutes, then the cops showed up, WRIC reported on November 23. \n“All I asked for was sliced cheese,” Berry told the local outlet. \nBerry, who documented most of the incident, shared on Snapchat that someone called the cops on them shortly after Richmond Police Department showed up. The customers explained that they just wanted to buy cheese and then the employees vanished. The cops were also confused about where the staff had gone and joined the search. \nThey eventually found the employees hiding in a locked room in the back of the store. Berry told WRIC that the officers told the customers that they had to leave or they would be arrested for trespassing. \nBerry said in a Snapchat video, shown in the video above, that they were “being kicked out because they were scared of us and they were hiding.” In one video he shared, someone can be heard saying “you gotta go.” \nCVS Communications Director Michael J. DeAngelis told The Huffington Post that the corporate office and district manager has apologized to Berry. He said that it is against policy for employees to leave the sales floor unstaffed during hours of operation and the company is “reinforcing the appropriate way for employees to respond to what they believe may be a security concern.” \nDeAngelis also said that CVS has “firm nondiscrimination policies that are rigorously enforced throughout the company” and that there is “no indication that the race of the customers played a role in this incident” because the two employees who worked that shift are black. \nThe Huffington Post did not get an immediate response when attempting to contact the Richmond Police Department.
