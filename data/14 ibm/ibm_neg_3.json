      "text": "LONDON , November 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --\nIBM ' s Watson AI enters the world of native advertising with ADYOULIKE  \nIBM's ground-breaking Watson artificial intelligence software is now, for the very first time, being used to create better semantic targeting for native advertising. It forms an integral part of the latest advertising platform from ADYOULIKE, the innovative in-feed native advertising technology.\n     (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160901/403517LOGO )\n\nA demo is available here: http://native-semantic-technology.ayl.io/ \nAs part of the platform, Watson scans all the publisher pages in ADYOULIKE's global network of premium publishers and analyses them in the same way as a human mind would: looking contextually for topics, sentiment and semantics rather than just scanning for simple keywords.\nThis allows the platform to deliver native content in-feed in the most relevant and targeted way possible. Watson looks at where, why and how the existing editorial content on each site is 'talking about' subjects and ensures advertisers are dynamically delivering the best native content to fit. The data is currently available through ADYOULIKE's DMP and will be usable by programmatic buyers in Q1 next year.\nJulien Verdier , CEO of ADYOULIKE, comments on the launch:\n\"We are extremely pleased to be launching the world's first semantic targeting AI for native advertising. It is going to revolutionise the way native advertising is delivered, at scale. It's a game changer for the native ad industry. We are now able, in real time, to associate any kind of advertising content to the best matching editorial context, whatever the level of semantic targeting expected by advertisers and publishers. We truly think that deep semantic contextual targeting is the only way to make the most of the native opportunity.\n\"Each month we reach more than 100m unique visitors and generate billions of ad impressions in an exclusive and premium editorial context. Thanks to IBM Watson we're now able to give a semantic context to each and every page in our publisher network, pushing advertising targeting to the next level and adding even more value to the user journey.\n\"ADYOULIKE is driven by innovation and this new semantic contextual targeting feature is a big first step in our planned technological innovations for 2017 - as we pave the way for what we call 'Deep Native Advertising' and our expanding DNA platform.\" \n\"The Watson AI can look at existing content in a way that was previously impossible, providing a wealth of contextual data that examines not just what a publisher is writing about, but why. That makes it an invaluable tool for native advertising, which relies on being as relevant as possible to the existing editorial.\n\"This also signposts the future of digital content as we move towards the 2020s. We have so much access to data now, so it's about who can use and analyse that data most effectively and craft compelling content that plays to those insights. ADYOULIKE are pleased to play a part in this exciting development for the industry.\"\nEnds  \nFor more information, contact: \nJack Ferris , jack@velvetpr.biz , +44 (0)208 996 1805\nJo Sensini , jo@velvetpr.biz , +44 (0) 208 996 1800\n\n\nAbout ADYOULIKE \n\nThe ADYOULIKE group continues to expand internationally in 2016. Now operating in more than 18 countries with main offices in Paris , London and New York , this hyper-growing start-up has 70 employees worldwide.\nThe ADYOULIKE Native Technology Platform and Network allows brand advertisers to scale their native advertising campaigns across premium and niche publishers with ease from a single point of entry.

      "text": "This man is the guinea pig for cancer therapy he invented The smartphone is on a collision course with your local dermatologist. IBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists. The technology is young, and IBM ( IBM , Tech30 ) said it must prove itself in more tests. But the findings are a harbinger of when we turn to computers rather than humans for more affordable and better health care. \nThe IBM system was given photos of skin lesions taken with a smartphone attachment designed for dermatologists. Costs for this device, called a Dermascope, run from $100 to $1,400. The IBM computer then compared the images to its database of skin cancer photos and estimated the likelihood the lesion was melanoma. The computer was more accurate -- 76% -- than eight expert dermatologists (70%). \nThe paper, which is available online , will also be published in a 2017 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development. \nRelated: How Microsoft wants to tackle cancers through computer science \nIBM's computer relies on artificial intelligence to make its decisions. The system was fed hundreds of images labeled as skin cancer, so it could realize the appearance and characteristics of dangerous skin lesions. The exposure to hundreds of pictures helps the computer suss out the underlying traits of what appears to be cancerous and what's harmless. \nThe IBM Research system outlines the area of the skin believed to be part of the lesion. This isn't simply a case of man vs. machine. The computer system was trained with photos, which came from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, that humans labeled as cancerous. IBM's approach to diagnosing skin cancer still leaves room for human dermatologists to train the computer system. \nNoel Codella, an IBM Research scientist and author of the research, said tools like this one could help a physician quickly check how risky a skin lesion is and refer a patient to a dermatologist as needed. Expert dermatologists aren't always available and can be expensive. IBM's computer system may eventually work as a stand-in. \nCodella declined to say when the technology would be made available to the public and described it as still a research project. \nIBM is not the only company harnessing cameras and computers to improve health care. \n\"You have all these phones everywhere with very powerful computers inside them,\" said Modiface founder and CEO Parham Aarabi. \"Using them to help doctors is a really good cause.\" \nAarabi's startup Modoface, which is the brains behind an app from Vichy, provides recommendations about whether someone needs to moisture their skin. \nModiface's artificial intelligence also powers beauty apps that lets consumers see how cosmetics might look on them or how a Botox treatment would change appearance. \nModiface found skin roughness can be easily identified with the camera on a smartphone, but it had a tougher time telling a part acne and dark spots on the skin. \n\"This doesn't replace doctors -- it aids them,\" Parham said. \"The best technology helps them become efficient, and better and faster at what they do.\" \nCNNMoney (Washington)   11:03 AM ET",

      "text": "IBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists.\nWASHINGTON — The smartphone is on a collision course with your local dermatologist.\nIBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists. The technology is young, and IBM said it must prove itself in more tests. But the findings are a harbinger of when we turn to computers rather than humans for more affordable and better health care.\nThe IBM system was given photos of skin lesions taken with a smartphone attachment designed for dermatologists. Costs for this device, called a Dermascope, run from $100 to $1,400. The IBM computer then compared the images to its database of skin cancer photos and estimated the likelihood the lesion was melanoma. The computer was more accurate — 76% — than eight expert dermatologists (70%).\nThe paper, which is available online, will also be published in a 2017 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development.\nIBM’s computer relies on artificial intelligence to make its decisions. The system was fed hundreds of images labeled as skin cancer, so it could realize the appearance and characteristics of dangerous skin lesions. The exposure to hundreds of pictures helps the computer suss out the underlying traits of what appears to be cancerous and what’s harmless.\nThis isn’t simply a case of man vs. machine. The computer system was trained with photos, which came from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, that humans labeled as cancerous. IBM’s approach to diagnosing skin cancer still leaves room for human dermatologists to train the computer system.\nNoel Codella, an IBM Research scientist and author of the research, said tools like this one could help a physician quickly check how risky a skin lesion is and refer a patient to a dermatologist as needed. Expert dermatologists aren’t always available and can be expensive. IBM’s computer system may eventually work as a stand-in.\nCodella declined to say when the technology would be made available to the public and described it as still a research project.\nIBM is not the only company harnessing cameras and computers to improve health care.\n“You have all these phones everywhere with very powerful computers inside them,” said Modiface founder and CEO Parham Aarabi. “Using them to help doctors is a really good cause.”\nAarabi’s startup Modoface, which is the brains behind an app from Vichy, provides recommendations about whether someone needs to moisture their skin.\nModiface’s artificial intelligence also powers beauty apps that lets consumers see how cosmetics might look on them or how a Botox treatment would change appearance.\nModiface found skin roughness can be easily identified with the camera on a smartphone, but it had a tougher time telling a part acne and dark spots on the skin.\n“This doesn’t replace doctors — it aids them,” Parham said. “The best technology helps them become efficient, and better and faster at what they do.”",

      "text": " ADYOULIKE\nLONDON , November 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --\nIBM ' s Watson AI enters the world of native advertising with ADYOULIKE\nIBM's ground-breaking Watson artificial intelligence software is now, for the very first time, being used to create better semantic targeting for native advertising. It forms an integral part of the latest advertising platform from ADYOULIKE, the innovative in-feed native advertising technology.\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160901/403517LOGO )\nA demo is available here: http://native-semantic-technology.ayl.io/\nAs part of the platform, Watson scans all the publisher pages in ADYOULIKE's global network of premium publishers and analyses them in the same way as a human mind would: looking contextually for topics, sentiment and semantics rather than just scanning for simple keywords.\nThis allows the platform to deliver native content in-feed in the most relevant and targeted way possible. Watson looks at where, why and how the existing editorial content on each site is 'talking about' subjects and ensures advertisers are dynamically delivering the best native content to fit. The data is currently available through ADYOULIKE's DMP and will be usable by programmatic buyers in Q1 next year.\nJulien Verdier , CEO of ADYOULIKE, comments on the launch:\n\"We are extremely pleased to be launching the world's first semantic targeting AI for native advertising. It is going to revolutionise the way native advertising is delivered, at scale. It's a game changer for the native ad industry. We are now able, in real time, to associate any kind of advertising content to the best matching editorial context, whatever the level of semantic targeting expected by advertisers and publishers. We truly think that deep semantic contextual targeting is the only way to make the most of the native opportunity.\n\"Each month we reach more than 100m unique visitors and generate billions of ad impressions in an exclusive and premium editorial context. Thanks to IBM Watson we're now able to give a semantic context to each and every page in our publisher network, pushing advertising targeting to the next level and adding even more value to the user journey.\n\"ADYOULIKE is driven by innovation and this new semantic contextual targeting feature is a big first step in our planned technological innovations for 2017 - as we pave the way for what we call 'Deep Native Advertising' and our expanding DNA platform.\"\n\"The Watson AI can look at existing content in a way that was previously impossible, providing a wealth of contextual data that examines not just what a publisher is writing about, but why. That makes it an invaluable tool for native advertising, which relies on being as relevant as possible to the existing editorial.\n\"This also signposts the future of digital content as we move towards the 2020s. We have so much access to data now, so it's about who can use and analyse that data most effectively and craft compelling content that plays to those insights. ADYOULIKE are pleased to play a part in this exciting development for the industry.\"\nEnds\nFor more information, contact:\nJack Ferris , jack@velvetpr.biz , +44 (0)208 996 1805\nJo Sensini , jo@velvetpr.biz , +44 (0) 208 996 1800\nAbout ADYOULIKE\nThe ADYOULIKE group continues to expand internationally in 2016. Now operating in more than 18 countries with main offices in Paris , London and New York , this hyper-growing start-up has 70 employees worldwide.\nThe ADYOULIKE Native Technology Platform and Network allows brand advertisers to scale their native advertising campaigns across premium and niche publishers with ease from a single point of entry.

      "text": "WASHINGTON– The smartphone is on a collision course with your local dermatologist.\nIBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists. The technology is young, and IBM said it must prove itself in more tests. But the findings are a harbinger of when we turn to computers rather than humans for more affordable and better health care.\nThe IBM system was given photos of skin lesions taken with a smartphone attachment designed for dermatologists. Costs for this device, called a Dermascope, run from $100 to $1,400. The IBM computer then compared the images to its database of skin cancer photos and estimated the likelihood the lesion was melanoma. The computer was more accurate — 76% — than eight expert dermatologists (70%).\nThe paper, which is available online, will also be published in a 2017 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development.\nIBM’s computer relies on artificial intelligence to make its decisions. The system was fed hundreds of images labeled as skin cancer, so it could realize the appearance and characteristics of dangerous skin lesions. The exposure to hundreds of pictures helps the computer suss out the underlying traits of what appears to be cancerous and what’s harmless.\nThis isn’t simply a case of man vs. machine. The computer system was trained with photos, which came from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, that humans labeled as cancerous. IBM’s approach to diagnosing skin cancer still leaves room for human dermatologists to train the computer system.\nNoel Codella, an IBM Research scientist and author of the research, said tools like this one could help a physician quickly check how risky a skin lesion is and refer a patient to a dermatologist as needed. Expert dermatologists aren’t always available and can be expensive. IBM’s computer system may eventually work as a stand-in.\nCodella declined to say when the technology would be made available to the public and described it as still a research project.\nIBM is not the only company harnessing cameras and computers to improve health care.\n“You have all these phones everywhere with very powerful computers inside them,” said Modiface founder and CEO Parham Aarabi. “Using them to help doctors is a really good cause.”\nAarabi’s startup Modoface, which is the brains behind an app from Vichy, provides recommendations about whether someone needs to moisture their skin.\nModiface’s artificial intelligence also powers beauty apps that lets consumers see how cosmetics might look on them or how a Botox treatment would change appearance.\nModiface found skin roughness can be easily identified with the camera on a smartphone, but it had a tougher time telling a part acne and dark spots on the skin.\n“This doesn’t replace doctors — it aids them,” Parham said. “The best technology helps them become efficient, and better and faster at what they do.”\nBy Matt McFarland",

      "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — The smartphone is on a collision course with your local dermatologist.\nIBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists. The technology is young, and IBM said it must prove itself in more tests. But the findings are a harbinger of when we turn to computers rather than humans for more affordable and better health care.\nThe IBM system was given photos of skin lesions taken with a smartphone attachment designed for dermatologists. Costs for this device, called a Dermascope, run from $100 to $1,400. The IBM computer then compared the images to its database of skin cancer photos and estimated the likelihood the lesion was melanoma. The computer was more accurate — 76% — than eight expert dermatologists (70%).\nThe paper, which is available online, will also be published in a 2017 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development.\nIBM’s computer relies on artificial intelligence to make its decisions. The system was fed hundreds of images labeled as skin cancer, so it could realize the appearance and characteristics of dangerous skin lesions. The exposure to hundreds of pictures helps the computer suss out the underlying traits of what appears to be cancerous and what’s harmless.\nThis isn’t simply a case of man vs. machine. The computer system was trained with photos, which came from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, that humans labeled as cancerous. IBM’s approach to diagnosing skin cancer still leaves room for human dermatologists to train the computer system.\nNoel Codella, an IBM Research scientist and author of the research, said tools like this one could help a physician quickly check how risky a skin lesion is and refer a patient to a dermatologist as needed. Expert dermatologists aren’t always available and can be expensive. IBM’s computer system may eventually work as a stand-in.\nCodella declined to say when the technology would be made available to the public and described it as still a research project.\nIBM is not the only company harnessing cameras and computers to improve health care.\n“You have all these phones everywhere with very powerful computers inside them,” said Modiface founder and CEO Parham Aarabi. “Using them to help doctors is a really good cause.”\nAarabi’s startup Modoface, which is the brains behind an app from Vichy, provides recommendations about whether someone needs to moisture their skin.\nModiface’s artificial intelligence also powers beauty apps that lets consumers see how cosmetics might look on them or how a Botox treatment would change appearance.\nModiface found skin roughness can be easily identified with the camera on a smartphone, but it had a tougher time telling a part acne and dark spots on the skin.\n“This doesn’t replace doctors — it aids them,” Parham said. “The best technology helps them become efficient, and better and faster at what they do.”",

Solutions By Investopedia | November 14, 2016 — 2:07 PM EST \nIn what the companies involved are billing as the \"world's fastest deep learning enterprise solution,\" artificial intelligence leader IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and chipmaker NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA ) recently announced a strategic partnership to advance a computer's ability to \"think and learn in more human-like ways.\" \nUtilizing IBM's new software toolkit, PowerAI, integrated with its recently unveiled A.I.-centric server featuring NVIDIA's NVLink interconnect technology, the combined hardware-software offering delivers more than twice the performance of similar A.I. solutions, according to the announcement. \nFrom IBM's perspective, the powerful A.I. upgrade will also enhance the already impressive machine-learning capabilities of its industry-leading cognitive computing wonder, Watson. \nThe upgraded PowerAI tool has been made available free of charge to existing customers of IBM's A.I. server S822LC for high-performance computing (HPC). Though the upgraded A.I. solution is designed to run on a single S822LC for HPC, it is also scalable for extremely high-end supercomputing clusters that boast hundreds or even thousands of servers. \nThanks in large part to the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) market, the amount of data being collected that will require comprehensive analysis is expected to skyrocket. It's this unsurprising that industry estimates for the A.I. market's outlook are jaw-dropping. One study suggests the A.I. space will generate more than $8 trillion within 20 years, and that's just in the U.S. \nA secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here . \nTim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

      "text": "IBM diagnoses skin cancer with the help of a smartphone \nWASHINGTON, D.C. — The smartphone is on a collision course with your local dermatologist. \nIBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists. The technology is young, and IBM said it must prove itself in more tests. But the findings are a harbinger of when we turn to computers rather than humans for more affordable and better health care. \nThe IBM system was given photos of skin lesions taken with a smartphone attachment designed for dermatologists. Costs for this device, called a Dermascope, run from $100 to $1,400. The IBM computer then compared the images to its database of skin cancer photos and estimated the likelihood the lesion was melanoma. The computer was more accurate — 76% — than eight expert dermatologists (70%). \nThe paper, which is available online, will also be published in a 2017 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development. \nIBM’s computer relies on artificial intelligence to make its decisions. The system was fed hundreds of images labeled as skin cancer, so it could realize the appearance and characteristics of dangerous skin lesions. The exposure to hundreds of pictures helps the computer suss out the underlying traits of what appears to be cancerous and what’s harmless. \nThis isn’t simply a case of man vs. machine. The computer system was trained with photos, which came from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, that humans labeled as cancerous. IBM’s approach to diagnosing skin cancer still leaves room for human dermatologists to train the computer system. \nNoel Codella, an IBM Research scientist and author of the research, said tools like this one could help a physician quickly check how risky a skin lesion is and refer a patient to a dermatologist as needed. Expert dermatologists aren’t always available and can be expensive. IBM’s computer system may eventually work as a stand-in. \nCodella declined to say when the technology would be made available to the public and described it as still a research project. \nIBM is not the only company harnessing cameras and computers to improve health care. \n“You have all these phones everywhere with very powerful computers inside them,” said Modiface founder and CEO Parham Aarabi. “Using them to help doctors is a really good cause.” \nAarabi’s startup Modoface, which is the brains behind an app from Vichy, provides recommendations about whether someone needs to moisture their skin. \nModiface’s artificial intelligence also powers beauty apps that lets consumers see how cosmetics might look on them or how a Botox treatment would change appearance. \nModiface found skin roughness can be easily identified with the camera on a smartphone, but it had a tougher time telling a part acne and dark spots on the skin. \n“This doesn’t replace doctors — it aids them,” Parham said. “The best technology helps them become efficient, and better and faster at what they do.” ",

      "text": " HTii\nLEXINGTON PARK, Md. , Nov. 14, Defense contractor HTii will provide expert advice to the global community of IBM DOORS and DOORS Next Generation software users November 17 via a live video webinar from an international IBM conference in Long Beach, California .\nThe webinar will feature HTii data architect Adam Hammett and a panel of IBM and industry experts answering questions from conference attendees and online participants around the world. It will take place Thursday, November 17 , at 9:00 am Pacific time . Registration is at https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8382745197377329154 .\nHammett also will give a separate, solo presentation earlier in the conference on DOORS Next Generation.\nThe events are part of IBM's Continuous Engineering for the Internet of Things Summit 2016 on the historic Queen Mary ocean liner, now a dockside conference center at the Long Beach pier.\nA wide range of industries use IBM DOORS applications to manage requirements for large, complex projects, such as the development of new software, pharmaceuticals and military weapons. The legacy DOORS application is a standalone product installed on individual computers or servers. The newer DOORS Next Generation is an online version that is part of IBM's Jazz lifecycle project management suite of applications.\n\"Both are enormously powerful,\" Hammett said, \"but two similar but different products raise questions for many users - which one to use, should they use both, or if they want to switch, how do they migrate from DOORS to DOORS NG?\"\nThe panel and webinar Hammett is appearing on, \"Sharing Successes & Solving Problems,\" will answer as many of these questions as possible during its scheduled three-hour period, he said.\n\"This is not a presentation or slide show,\" he said. \"It's one long Q&A session.\"\nHis solo presentation November 16 at 1:40-2:15 Pacific time will cover new configuration management options in the latest release of DOORS NG, version 6.x.\n\"Configuration management in DOORS NG means keeping track of changes made by many technical experts working simultaneously on different versions of the same basic set of requirements,\" he said.\nHammett will explore several DOORS NG functions, including global configurations, baselines, change sets and streams, along with best practices for planning and implementing configuration management.\nSpecializing in Rational CLM products, HTii ( www.htii.com ) develops solutions for managing, reporting and analyzing data for complex engineering projects.\nContact\nBob Kaper\nHTii Communications Director\n240-895-8194\n releases/htii-to-advise-global-doors-software-community-from-ibm-conference-300361331.html\n ",

      "title": "IBM and SAP: The Power Couple of Digital Business",
      "text": "As companies in industries from finance to health care race toward a digital future, the pace of data-driven business transformation is accelerating. But all too often, existing IT infrastructure still struggles to keep up.\nFed by the Internet of Things (IoT) and the daily transactions of a digital era, data is the heartbeat of business today, opening up opportunities for new revenue streams, creating foundations for more engaged customer relationships, and delivering insights that weren’t previously possible. The explosion of data is fueling a digital universe that’s expected to double every two years, surging from 4.4 trillion gigabytes in 2013 to a whopping 44 zettabytes—or 44 trillion gigabytes—by 2020, according to research from IDC and EMC .\n“The amount of data and complexity of queries has become a business stumbling block. From the customers’ perspective, it really is the perfect storm.” — Brian Burke, Global SAP Solutions Executive, IBM SAP Alliance\nWhile only 5 percent of this data trove was deemed valuable in 2013, that percentage is expected to more than double by 2020 as companies bring new data sources into the fold and leverage emerging big-data analytics capabilities to spin the deluge into something useful, the research found. In fact, 80 percent of CEOs now depend on data for insights to guide their decision making, and companies actively engaged in analytics are 3.6 times more likely to outperform their competitors and peers, according to collaborative research by the IBM Institute for Business Value and the University of Oxford.\nDespite the new digital era’s obvious competitive advantages for those organizations equipped to handle complex data queries, many companies are finding that their existing systems and IT infrastructures are buckling under the weight of all this data and are inadequate for their updated business requirements. They need a platform that’s optimized from the ground up to handle analytics on large volumes of data in real time and that can deliver the flexibility and scalability demanded by the current pace of change.\n“The amount of data and complexity of queries has become a business stumbling block,” says Brian Burke, global SAP Solutions executive for the IBM SAP Alliance. “From the customers’ perspective, it really is the perfect storm.”\nPowering Analytics and Transactions Increasingly, the solution can be found in a next-generation platform built to handle the rigors of modern-day digital business. The SAP HANA in-memory relational database technology and application platform, coupled with IBM’s Power Systems line of hardware and services, delivers the greater speed and superior data management needed for advanced analytics operations even as it supports a flexible, on-demand capacity that can scale easily to meet changing enterprise requirements and accommodate ongoing business fluctuations. (For a real-life story about how one global enterprise, the Bosch Group, is using the combination to transform itself, see “The Partnership in Action,” below.)\nSAP HANA, which taps an in-memory approach to offer significant speed advantages for large-scale, diverse data sets, is equally well-suited for advanced analytics or as a platform for running mission-critical, transactional applications such as finance systems and customer relationship management (CRM). Since HANA debuted in 2010, adoption rates have risen significantly. About 45 percent of respondents to a survey by the Americas’ SAP User’s Group (ASUG) implemented the technology in 2015, up from 40 percent a year earlier.  Of those that had implemented SAP HANA, 23 percent had additional projects underway, 22 percent had one or more initiatives planned and approved, and 31 percent had projects in the pipeline, but no funding, according to the ASUG survey.\nAs more of those SAP HANA deployments involve 24/ 7 operations, enterprises are seeking the peace of mind that comes from deploying their mission-critical systems on a platform offering proven scalability and resiliency. That level of confidence gets harder to achieve within the limitations of an Intel x86-based infrastructure as systems get more complex and data sets trend larger, IBM’s Burke contends.\nAs partners, IBM and SAP provide integrated services and support so that users have one point of contact, regardless of whether the problem lies with hardware or software.\n“Now that you’re running transactional and mission-critical systems on HANA, you have to have a reliable and mature system that is also unlimited in how big you can make it,” he says. “There are so many limitations in the x86 commodity world.” The combination of SAP HANA and IBM Power Systems—backed by a collaborative partnership between the two companies—addresses these concerns, delivering the flexibility, resiliency, and performance required to fully exploit SAP HANA solutions, he adds.\nIBM Power Systems for SAP HANA makes good on its promise of flexibility in multiple ways. For one thing, virtualization is supported out of the box, allowing multiple SAP HANA virtual machines to be consolidated on a single IBM Power Systems server , including both production and nonproduction workloads as well as virtual systems used in the event of system failure. This approach reduces capital expenditures and ensures that capacity doesn’t sit idle.\nThrough standard capabilities like dynamic capacity sizing and load balancing, enterprises can easily adapt the environment of IBM Power Systems for SAP HANA to changing business needs and different workloads. They can even go so far as to reallocate unused capacity from the production environment to other use cases, such as development or user acceptance testing.\nIn terms of resiliency, IBM Power Systems’ default architecture supports a range of enterprise-grade reliability features, including out-of-the-box virtualization that enables efficient failover in the event of a system failure. Also standard: alerts that proactively warn enterprises of problems so they can initiate corrective action before a failure occurs.\nPerformance is also a big deal, not just for analytics or IoT applications, but for the mission-critical, transactional systems now being migrated to SAP HANA in areas such as fraud detection or transportation and logistics. IBM Power Systems offer four times the memory bandwidth of x86 architectures, which benefits memory-intensive SAP HANA operations, and each Power System processor core can execute up to eight simultaneous threads, compared to just two threads per core for x86 platforms.\nMoreover, Power Systems offer another advantage, one that’s due to its significantly bigger processor cache. This feature ensures that data is continuously fed to available processors and results in the agile response so important for large-scale, real-time transaction processing.\nThe Partnership in Action This combination of benefits makes the IBM Power System the optimal platform for the Bosch Group’s forthcoming SAP HANA implementations. With a broad footprint across industries such as consumer goods, industrial technology, mobility solutions, and energy and building products, the global giant is one of SAP’s largest installations, running the entire portfolio of applications. As SAP’s strategic direction shifts toward SAP HANA and in-memory technology, Bosch plans to follow suit, eventually migrating its core SAP applications in areas such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and data warehousing to the new platform, along with future IoT applications, says Erik Thorwirth, SAP’s senior manager of server services for AIX and Linux.\nBecause of the breadth and variety of SAP applications earmarked for the transition, Bosch believes the IBM Power Systems line, already the platform for its existing SAP footprint, is the best match. The company’s existing expertise in IBM Power Systems, coupled with the platform’s scalability and built-in support for virtualization, positions the organization to deploy new systems quickly without rolling out additional hardware or doing laborious manual configuration, says Volker Fischer, Bosch’s senior expert for AIX and Linux.\n“The ability to replicate systems simply is one of the key features, because we will be moving such a large and varied mix of systems to the SAP HANA platform,” Fischer explains. “It makes deployment simpler and more efficient, and our administrative workload goes down.”\nThe combined platform’s virtualization capabilities will also easily accommodate changing workloads, which is increasingly important in the modern ERP landscape, Thorwirth says. “We expect the SAP HANA systems of the future to be more volatile in terms of size than classical ERP systems,” he explains. “With the SAP HANA/IBM Power Systems paradigm, we don’t need to get into the data center and apply more physical memory. We can leverage virtualization to create large building blocks that can shrink or grow as needed depending on workloads.”\nAnother upside for Bosch is the IBM and SAP partnership around digital transformation. The companies are working together in various ways, such as co-locating development resources in Walldorf, Germany, and Palo Alto, California, to pursue a shared product roadmap. The partners also provide integrated services and support so that users have one point of contact, regardless of whether the problem lies with hardware or software. The partners have also committed to co-innovation efforts for IBM Power Systems for SAP HANA, particularly in the areas of the cloud, cognitive computing, customer experience, and industry-specific roadmaps.\nAs companies like Bosch set out on the road to digital transformation, they need to prepare for the twists and turns along the way. With its proven performance, built-in resiliency, and flexibility for accommodating the shifts of modern business, IBM Power Systems paired with SAP HANA is the best choice for accelerating the journey, helping enterprises reach their destinations and achieve lasting business success.\nFor more about SAP HANA and IBM’s Power Systems, please visit ibm.com/power/hana .",

      "text": "CINDY LU / November 14, 2016 / 0 comments \nRichard Jones is our PTL (Project Team Lead) for the Ocata Cycle. Congrats! He wrote up a great summary in the Mailing List . \nIt was great to catch up with everyone in Barcelona! We had core contributors from 8 companies in attendance and a handful of contributors to discuss and prioritize tasks for this cycle. \nThis post will summarize what was discussed at each of the working sessions. \nSession 1: Keystone Cross-Project Remove token revocation upon logout and project switch because it caused issues where the user starts a long running task, logs out, and then the token fails authentication. This patch by Eric has landed! There are also long standing issues around K2K support, federated identity, policy issues, and v3 role issues that were discussed. \nSession 2: Operator/ Plugin Feedback Not many operators showed up for this early morning session, but we did get some useful feedback. Companies have a very steep learning curve for writing customization modules for their deployment, especially since Horizon is in a state of flux. \nOne issue is that they spend a lot of time hacking up an override for something, only to have the process change in the next cycle. \nAnother issue is that often times their version is several releases behind, and documentation no longer covers the exact steps needed to make a specific change. We don’t have a good solution for how to handle this, because every deployment is different. We can only provide general documentation. It is unfortunate that developers need to do a lot of trial and error with the code. I think if we were able to speak with a lot of deployers, we would be able to come up with some best practices and things to watch out for. \nFor older versions of Horizon, it was very difficult to customize granular things. Something like adding a new form field to a modal involved a lot of hacking. Examples given to us by an operator was adding a Fixed IP field to the Create Instance workflow or wanting to including custom content in a table cell. Thankfully, Angular addresses those issues. However, we still have improvements to make (e.g. not having to make changes to model files and having a stable enough Angular Launch Instance so we can remove the old workflow code). \nOperator would like to pre-populate image panel with their images. \nPagination and filtering still doesn’t work well, which is especially needed for a UI. This is not a problem of Horizon but of the underlying API services which do not all support pagination. It is not a solvable issue at this time, but we can bridge the gap with the OpenStack Searchlight project which has made a lot of headway in this space. \nSession 3: Planning Formalize the responsibilities of core members, bug triaging, managing blueprints, team meeting participation, active reviews Write a review checklist of things to look for when reviewing code. Patches should include a reno (release note) to notify operators and deployers of large patch sets that could potentially break their environment, attaching a link to a bug report or blueprint for each patch. Restructure the documentation. Add missing content for how testing setup and enabled files for plugins. Still not generating Javascript docs. Write up more documentation around the Angular work Remove JQuery UI library, only using it for datepicker Add utility library like Underscore or Lodash Reevaluate settings.py because the list continues to grow Reevaluate integration testing framework, perhaps have something more lightweight Need to cleanup test suite and make sure we are covering all areas Remove Selenium gate tests \nMicroversions is a large problem for Horizon to tackle. We started a discussion on this. Microversions are small changes to the API between full releases while maintaining backward compatibility. The plan is to determine the maximum version of the service. Then we can use a local mapping of feature availability to call appropriate API endpoint and switch features on/ off using something similar to requirements.txt (e.g. “> 2.1, != 2.5, < 2.9”). \nSession 4: Cross Project Topics Quotas has always been messy topic. With the Angular redesign, we will readdress this issue and keep in mind to make it easy to plug-in and add/ remove quotas per deployment. We upgraded to Glance v2 at the end of Newton (thanks for the hard work and perseverance, Brad!) but still have some bugs to fix (filtering issue for Admins). We also need to have full Keystone v3 support at some point. The issue of error messaging (another frequently brought up issue) is still up in the air, as it’s more an a service API issue than a Horizon issue. We cannot just spit out whatever the API returns, because it could have sensitive data and is untranslated. \nSession 5: AngularJS Topics Angular Launch Instance wizard is on by default. However, you may still use the old Launch Instance. Set it in LAUNCH_INSTANCE_LEGACY_ENABLED = True and LAUNCH_INSTANCE_NG_ENABLED = False in settings.py. Old source code will not be removed for several releases (at least until Pike) because it needs to be more stable. It is missing some functionality that the original had and is not extensible in some areas. \nWe are removing the Django Swift UI. Yay! We are also adding ui-router in Ocata-1 to support nested routing in Angular Swift UI. There are many Angular panels in the pipeline, but not gaining much traction because of lack of reviews. Review please! \nSession 6: Priorities Remove Django Swift UI code Include ui-router Fix bug for Glance v2 Migration to tox instead of run_test.sh Remove initScope() from actions directive Fix OpenStack logo (went from 3D to 2D) Include profiler dashboard Finish off Angular Identity Panels Finish off Angular Swift Panel Finish off Angular Flavors Panel Document Microversion Plan Generate boilerplate code for Angular dashboards (like Django’s start dash command) Thanks Shu!! https://github.com/shu-mutou/ui-cookiecutter Document horizon framework (registry) and show customization examples \nLong term Write up more documentation for the Javascript work Handle quotas in Angular in an extendable way Handle microversions Continue to update any xstatic packages \nSession 7: Meetup We cleaned up the out-of-date blueprints, cutting it down by 50%, we have less than 80 blueprints in Launchpad now. We will follow what other projects do and assign a core member to shepherd the patch and make sure it is on track. \nDetailed notes from the Etherpad here . \nPSA: Horizon is in desperate need of reviewers! Part of open source development is to not only contribute source code upstream, but also to review the work of others. \nIf you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to ping me (clu_) on #openstack-horizon . Also, a reminder that Ocata Release Cycle is short ( https://releases.openstack.org/ocata/schedule.html ). \nTil next time, ",

      "text": "Email \nWASHINGTON (CNNMoney) — The smartphone is on a collision course with your local dermatologist. \nIBM researchers have developed a computer system it believes is more effective at identifying a form of skin cancer than expert dermatologists. The technology is young, and IBM said it must prove itself in more tests. But the findings are a harbinger of when we turn to computers rather than humans for more affordable and better health care. \nThe IBM system was given photos of skin lesions taken with a smartphone attachment designed for dermatologists. Costs for this device, called a Dermascope, run from $100 to $1,400. The IBM computer then compared the images to its database of skin cancer photos and estimated the likelihood the lesion was melanoma. The computer was more accurate — 76% — than eight expert dermatologists (70%). \nThe paper, which is available online, will also be published in a 2017 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development. \nIBM’s computer relies on artificial intelligence to make its decisions. The system was fed hundreds of images labeled as skin cancer, so it could realize the appearance and characteristics of dangerous skin lesions. The exposure to hundreds of pictures helps the computer suss out the underlying traits of what appears to be cancerous and what’s harmless. \nThis isn’t simply a case of man vs. machine. The computer system was trained with photos, which came from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, that humans labeled as cancerous. IBM’s approach to diagnosing skin cancer still leaves room for human dermatologists to train the computer system. \nNoel Codella, an IBM Research scientist and author of the research, said tools like this one could help a physician quickly check how risky a skin lesion is and refer a patient to a dermatologist as needed. Expert dermatologists aren’t always available and can be expensive. IBM’s computer system may eventually work as a stand-in. \nCodella declined to say when the technology would be made available to the public and described it as still a research project. \nIBM is not the only company harnessing cameras and computers to improve health care. \n“You have all these phones everywhere with very powerful computers inside them,” said Modiface founder and CEO Parham Aarabi. “Using them to help doctors is a really good cause.” \nAarabi’s startup Modoface, which is the brains behind an app from Vichy, provides recommendations about whether someone needs to moisture their skin. \nModiface’s artificial intelligence also powers beauty apps that lets consumers see how cosmetics might look on them or how a Botox treatment would change appearance. \nModiface found skin roughness can be easily identified with the camera on a smartphone, but it had a tougher time telling a part acne and dark spots on the skin. \n“This doesn’t replace doctors — it aids them,” Parham said. “The best technology helps them become efficient, and better and faster at what they do.” ",

      "text": "IBM Corp. demonstrated at its first Watson Developer Conference last week that it has successfully hidden enough of the “rocket science” in machine learning to excite a crowd of 1,300 mainstream developers. \nThat’s right: I said developers, not data scientists. IBM is making a big play to extend the commercial reach of its artificial intelligence-driven computing platform, and indications are that it’s starting to work. A few things we heard at the event in San Francisco: \nIBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty (above) announced that its cognitive computing services already reach 200 million people worldwide and would reach 1 billion by the end of 2017. Healthcare and consumers are proving especially ripe targets for Watson. IBM will continue to engage data scientists, but it indicated that increasingly it will turn its attention to reaching developers. It aims to reach those developers by making Watson’s machine learning tools and services as easy-to-use and cost-effective as renting cloud virtual machines. A third computing transition: cognitive IBM speaks of a third transition in computing, which can be called the “cognitive transition.” What’s driving this transition is the explosion of digitally accessible information. There’s just too much information to understand for humans to explicitly write the correct, “best” instructions to guide both computers and — more broadly — systems (which include people). \nInstead, computers have to learn from all this data and augment humans in making sense out of it. Rometty came back to the theme of augmenting people, not replacing them, several times. IBM believes just about every decision humans make will be assisted by machine learning within five years. And Big Blue wants to lead that process. \nHow does it plan to lead? IBM’s core differentiation is to take the voodoo out of machine learning. Using a research and development budget that’s among the largest in the industry, IBM has a goal to hand ever more powerful Watson application programming interfaces over to developers and spawn an explosion in applications that’s equal to the explosion in digital data. \nTwo product lines that target different customers constitute its offerings. First are APIs that mainstream developers without a data science background can use. Second are the semi-custom industry solutions that IBM’s professional services organization has the skills to package for delivery to end customers. \nThe developer APIs were the focus of this conference, and they were on rich display in a number of impressive showcases. In one such showcase, IBM highlighted a solution that can diagnose melanoma remotely. \nUsing a smartphone with a special snap-on lens, an untrained individual can take a picture of a lesion on their skin and ship the image to Watson for analysis. Watson does deep analysis in the cloud based on a corpus of images tens of thousands of times greater than any single doctor could study. Watson augments the remote doctor’s ability to diagnose the image with two factors. It returns a confidence level whether the lesion is melanoma as well as which attributes of the image are relevant to its diagnosis. It can also show images of similar lesions in its database. \nIt’s the Model, Not the Data The machine learning solutions IBM builds for customers are based on live models with data feedback loops that make the models smarter over time. That’s identical to Wikibon’s notion of the “ data feedback loop ” capability in our digital business platform research . \nIBM sees this process — ingestion, model, refinement — as the true value-add within machine learning. Wikibon agrees. No digital business should have the narrow goal of generating just more data. Rather, IBM’s belief, with which Wikibon concurs, is to generate more models that can complement — and in some cases, supplement — human decision making. \nBut IBM is going to be very careful with how it leverages customer data. Rometty emphasized that IBM won’t leverage the live models from its customers in order to improve its solutions over time. On this point she drew a clear distinction between IBM and competitors such as Google Inc. (We would add Oracle Corp. to Google’s camp; Oracle’s Datalogix subsidiary, among other Oracle properties, collects large volumes of data on consumers and businesses and openly resells that data). Rometty insisted IBM will not follow that path. \nDeep learning today is competitive with humans in recognizing objects in images. Extracting structure and meaning from text just as effectively is within reach. Graphics processing unit-accelerated servers, open source frameworks such as Google’s TensorFlow, Python and its libraries, graph databases such as SNAP and an API to Microsoft’s Bing that can crawl the web are the new building blocks. \nBusiness-to-business marketing firm Demandbase Inc. estimates it would have cost 100 times more to build its solution 10 years ago versus today thanks to these building blocks. The use cases for machine learning, AI and cognitive are extensive, but adoption won’t accelerate if the technology can be understood only by a few priestesses. \nWatson is cool technology, no question. But it will enter the pantheon of great technology only if IBM can, in fact, make it both highly functional and as easy-to-use as Amazon Web Services made the cloud. Based on what we saw at the Watson Developer Conference, IBM is off to a fast start. \nGeorge Gilbert is big data and analytics analyst for Wikibon. ",

Credit: IBM Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 3:46 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nJust over five years ago, IBM's Watson supercomputer crushed opponents in the televised quiz show Jeopardy. It was hard to foresee then, but artificial intelligence is now permeating our daily lives. \nSince then, IBM has expanded the Watson brand to a cognitive computing package with hardware and software used to diagnose diseases, explore for oil and gas, run scientific computing models, and allow cars to drive autonomously. The company has now announced new AI hardware and software packages. [ Further reading: Watson's the name, data's the game ] \nThe original Watson used advanced algorithms and natural language interfaces to find and narrate answers. Then, Watson was one supercomputer, but now AI systems are deployed at a grander scale. Mega data centers run by Facebook, Google, Amazon and other companies use AI on thousands of servers to recognize images and speech and analyze loads of data. \nWatson is just one of IBM's efforts; the company has more initiatives to bring AI to other companies. It's releasing more powerful hardware to make deep-learning systems faster while analyzing data or finding answers to complex questions. IBM is pairing those superfast systems with new software tools. \nThe new IBM hardware and software tools -- called PowerAI -- are used to train software to perform AI tasks like image and speech recognition. The more a computer learns, the more accurate the results. Training requires a lot of computing horsepower. The new training hardware is now available. \nUltimately, the hardware and software could be the key in making Watson technologies easily available to companies through the cloud or on-premises. For now, the company is not talking about whether the new wares will be a part of Watson. \nThe first set of hardware is the Power8 server with the Nvidia Tesla GPUs, said Sumit Gupta, IBM's vice president of high-performance computing and analytics. \nThe hardware is the fastest deep-learning system available, Gupta said. The Power8 CPUs and Tesla P100 GPUs are among the fastest chips available, and both are linked via the NVLink interconnect, which outperforms PCI-Express 3.0. Nvidia's GPUs power many deep-learning systems in companies like Google, Facebook, and Baidu. \n\"Performance is very important as deep learning training jobs run for days,\" Gupta said. It's also important to speed up key technologies like storage and networking, he said. \nThe Power8 hardware is available via the Nimbix cloud , which provides bare-metal access to hardware and an Infiniband backend. \nIBM is also planning hardware and software for inferencing, which requires lighter processing on the edge or end device. The inferencing engine takes results from a trained model, adds additional data or input, and provides improvised results. Drones, robots, and autonomous cars use inferencing engines for navigation, image recognition, or data analysis. \nInferencing chips are also used in data centers to boost deep learning models. Google has created its own chip called TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), and other companies like KnuEdge, Wave Computing, and GraphCore are creating inferencing chips. \nIBM is working on a different model for its inferencing hardware and software, Gupta said. He did not provide any further details. \nThe software is the glue that puts IBM's AI hardware and software in a cohesive package. IBM has forked a version of the open-source Caffe deep-learning framework to function on its Power hardware. IBM is also supporting other frameworks like TensorFlow, Theano, and OpenBLAS. \nThe frameworks are sandboxes in which users can create and tweak parameters of a computer model that learns to solve a particular problem. Caffe is widely used for image recognition. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite \nA customer is using the IBM i (V5R4) as a FTP server (with exit points programs caring about security). The server was accessible from internet even in passive modus but since the firewall was changed, we cannot access it. According with the IT Staff from the customer (and Cisco support, the new firewall provider): \n“the server has to provide the public IP address when going into passive mode for the transfer to work that's why you're getting that error. You'll need to speak to vendor of the server for alternatives for it to provide the public address.” \nUnfortunately, I cannot find the way to change this setting in IBM i (I don´t even know it this is possible) \nAnybody with experience?",

      "text": "XAd Is Buying WeatherBug to Enhance Its Ad Targeting and Take Aim at IBM The weather app has 20 million users By Christopher Heine November 15, 2016, 8:36 AM EST Technology The location player makes a key purchase. Getty Images Location data player xAd has purchased WeatherBug, which is consistently one of the most downloaded weather mobile apps, per AppAnnie. WeatherBug has 20 million users, giving its new owner a fresh layer of ad-targeting data to offer clients like Dunkin' Donuts, BMW and Arby's. WeatherBug users average 25 minutes per month on the digital company's mobile, desktop web, connected TV and iWatch properties. \"Weather is a very exciting category because consumers download the app, keep it running in the background [to keep track] of storms and lightning and so on and so forth. It's one of the top three activities Americans do every week,\" said Dipanshu Sharma, xAd CEO. \"We were looking to strengthen our data position, as well as how do we go from knowing where you are and where you work to predicting where you are going to go.\" It's all about the data, and the WeatherBug purchase puts xAd in position to challenge IBM. Big Blue acquired the digital assets to The Weather Company at the beginning of 2016 and released a product called JourneyFX last month that lets brands buy weather-triggered ad placements. Five-hundred million global consumers can be targeted via xAd's ad network, according to the New York-based tech company. The WeatherBug integration \"will happen by Q1,\" Sharma said. \"We will able to get more granular with our data sets.\" The price tag for WeatherBug was not disclosed. Meanwhile, xAd also announced a funding round of $42.5 million from Eminence Capital, Microsoft Ventures, W Capital, IVP and Emergence Capital. Since 2008, xAd has raised $116.5 million. Sharma's company also revealed the hiring of former comScore chief Serge Matta as its global sales lead. Get the Technology Today newsletter: \nCheck out our other newsletters: Daily Digest",

She’s been with IBM for more than 25 years, serving in technical and executive roles in hardware, software and services. She serves as executive sponsor for IBM’s Work/Life Integration initiatives. She was the first executive to pilot working part-time as a mom, which help formulate the company’s policy on part-time and job sharing. She is also at the forefront of building gender partnership to identify and interrupt the subtle implicit biases that hold women back. \nWe honor Marie for the work she does to ensure that women in technology have the opportunity to excel and that girls have access to STEM education. She serves on the board of the nonprofit Anita Borg Institute that connects, inspires and guides women in computing and in companies where technology innovation is a strategic imperative. She is distinguished for her active mentorship in STEM, mentoring more than 40 women at IBM, college students through MentorNet, and at local schools. She also works with Girls Who Code, the Society of Women Engineers, and WITI. Marie was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2015 “for her passionate support of women in technology.” \nMarie holds an M.B.A. from New York University, a Masters in Computer Science from Columbia University and a B.S. in Engineering from The Cooper Union.

      "text": "Informed news analysis every weekday How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity IBM ventures into cognitive security, where AI systems learn to understand infosec terms and concepts well enough to reduce detection and response time More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Comments \nIBM captured our imaginations when it unveiled Watson, the artificial intelligence computer capable of playing—and winning—the \"Jeopardy\" game show. Since then, Big Blue has been introducing Watson’s analytics and learning capabilities across various industries, including health care and information security. \nCognitive security technology such as Watson for Cybersecurity can change how information security professionals defend against attacks by helping them digest vast amounts of data. IBM Security is currently in the middle of a year-long research project working with eight universities to help train Watson to tackle cybercrime. Watson has to learn the \"language of cybersecurity\" to understand what a threat is, what it does, and what indicators are related. [ Make threat intelligence meaningful: A 4-point plan . | Discover how to secure your systems with InfoWorld's Security Report newsletter . ] \n“Generally we learn by examples,” says Nasir Memon, professor of computer science and engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. We get an algorithm and examples, and we learn when we are able to look at a problem and recognize it as similar to other incidents. \nInformation security is no stranger to machine learning. Many next-generation security defenses already incorporate machine learning, big data, and natural language processing. What’s different with cognitive computing is the fact that it can blend human-generated security knowledge with more traditional security data. Consider how much security knowledge passes through the human brain and comes out in the form of research documents, industry publications, analyst reports, and blogs. \nSomeone saw or read something and thought it was important enough to write a blog post or a paper about it, says Jeb Linton, the chief security architect of IBM Watson. Cognitive systems can recognize the rich contextual significance of that piece of knowledge and apply traditional machine-generated data to help analysts get a better understanding of what they are seeing. \n“It’s about learning how to take human expertise [in the form of blog posts, articles] mostly in the form of language, and to use it as training data for machine learning algorithms,” Linton says. \nTechnology innovation has to actually address the challenges security professionals are currently facing, or it remains on the fringes as a cool but not practical option. Cognitive security has the potential to reduce incident response times, optimize accuracy of alerts, and stay current with threat research. \n“We need to make sure these technologies are actually solving the problems that security professionals are facing, both today and in the future,” wrote Diana Kelley on IBM’s Security Intelligence . \nAccording to recent statistics from IBM Institute of Business Value, 40 percent of security professionals believe cognitive security will improve detection and incident response decision-making capabilities, and 37 percent believe cognitive security solutions will significantly improve incident response time. Another 36 percent of respondents think cognitive security will provide increased confidence to discriminate between innocuous events and true incidents. If security analysts were able to stay current on threats and increase accuracy of alerts, they could also reduce response time. \nMore than half (57 percent) of security leaders believed that cognitive security solutions can significantly slow the efforts of cybercriminals. \nThese are high expectations for Watson for Cybersecurity, and IBM is working with eight different universities to feed up to 15,000 new documents into Watson every month, including threat intelligence reports, cybercrime strategies, threat databases, and materials from its own X-Force research library. In the video below, IBM's Linton and NYU's Memon talk about how machines learn and what the future of cognitive security technology looks like. \nIt’s easy to dismiss cognitive technology and its promises of dramatically changing how information security professionals defend themselves from attackers as more buzzwords. But interest from other fields is growing: Cognitive computing is slated to become a $47 billion industry by 2020, according to recent figures from IDC. While cognitive security is still in early stages, information security professionals see how the technology will help analysts make better and faster decision using vast amounts of data.

      "text": "  Sponsor Content by IBM / What's this? The Gift of Good Customer Analytics Sponsor Post: Wrapping Your Data Up in One Neat Package Can Help You Avoid Holiday Shopping Hassles Reprints Reprints Most Popular \nIf your company is one of the many relying on the holiday shopping season to deliver a big portion of the year's sales and profits, you know that means it's the most important time to deliver the best and most consistent customer experience across all the touch points your customers use. Making a mistake that frustrates your customers—or not being able to fix a mistake quickly—can cost your company dearly during this hectic shopping season. \nInvesting in the right customer analytics is the first step toward protecting your performance in the holiday season. \nImagine it's Nov. 25—Black Friday. Two days ago, your company launched a campaign for its new cutting-edge product, just in time for the big holiday kickoff. Your team thinks all the pieces are in place to boost sales and meet the goal of increasing revenue by 10%. \nThe team did its research—analytics from last year show that the most traveled path to purchase involved social media promotions that led to a purchase on mobile web—so ads on social media sites, offering a sale price and free shipping, are a key element of this year's campaign. \nNow the campaign has been out for a couple of days. You dig into your analytics to check how customers are responding to the offer. And you're shocked. \nThe campaign seems to be driving plenty of traffic to your website, but conversion rates are way down. Customers are visiting the site, even putting the product in shopping carts. But they're not completing the sale. \nYou don't have time to waste. \nWith the right customer analytics approach, you can quickly pinpoint the problem area. For example, tapping into your analytics, you could look at visual representations of the journeys that most commonly led to shoppers abandoning their carts. With each channel represented, you would be able to see that a common factor in this is social. Drilling in farther, you would determine that something was going on with Facebook. \nWith this information, you could check your Facebook page, looking at when the abandonments started, and find out that a promo code had been entered incorrectly by the design team—so that when the customer enters the code on your website, he receives an error message and eventually gives up. If you find that sort of problem, you can take action quickly. In this case, not only do you immediately fix the typo in the ad, but you can also retarget the customers who abandoned their shopping carts with a fresh offer. \nIf you have this depth and breadth of analytics—customer journey, behavior and struggle analysis—all under one hood, you don't have to go to five different places to find out what's wrong. You can quickly gain insights and take action while it still matters. Related Stories The CMO of the Future: How to Embrace Really Big Data \nDespite all the customer data available today, many marketers find they still struggle with understanding their customers. Information is fragmented, stored in silos across the company and never brought together. Each department uses its own analytical tools, often specific to individual platforms, and if a company tries to get a holistic view of the customer, it takes a huge amount of effort and time. The customer journey appears as a set of unconnected touch points—and it's difficult to put any insights to work for the brand. \nThat lack of coordination is never more apparent than when a problem happens, and it's impossible to track down the source of that problem and fix it. \nHaving your customer analytics in one place allows you to see how one channel affects the other. You should have easy visibility into how behavior is connected across all key channels, including web, mobile, social and in-store activity. Teams can work in concert and dig in together for a root-cause analysis, no matter where in the journey an issue may appear. \nEveryone in the retail space knows the competitiveness and speed of the holiday season is unmatched. Shoppers are out there buying. You and your competitors are vying for share of mind and wallet. And if you are not executing flawlessly, if you don't have the ability to quickly identify and resolve problems in order to deliver that outstanding customer experience, you are toast. You will lose potential customers, potential sales and the fourth-quarter revenue you're counting on. \nThe holiday season, more than any other, is the time you don't want to make a mistake. But if you do, you need to be able to figure it out fast. The ability to uncover the problem and respond quickly starts with the right customer analytics. \nAbout the Author \nElizabeth Magill manages marketing for IBM Customer Analytics solutions within the IBM Commerce division.

      "title": "GE Wants To Be The Next Artificial Intelligence Powerhouse",
      "text": "When you hear the term \"artificial intelligence,\" you may think of tech giants Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, or Facebook. Industrial powerhouse General Electric is now aiming to be included on that short list. It may not have a chipper digital assistant like Cortana or Alexa. It won&apos;t sort through selfies, but it will look through X-rays. It won&apos;t recommend movies, but it will suggest how to care for a diesel locomotive. Today, GE announced a pair of acquisitions and new services that will bring machine learning AI to the kinds of products it&apos;s known for, including planes, trains, X-ray machines, and power plants.\nThe effort started in 2015 when GE announced Predix Cloud —an online platform to network and collect data from sensors on industrial machinery such as gas turbines or windmills. At the time, GE touted the benefits of using machine learning to find patterns in sensor data that could lead to energy savings or preventative maintenance before a breakdown. Predix Cloud opened up to customers in February, but GE is still building up the AI capabilities to fulfill the promise. \"We were using machine learning, but I would call it in a custom way,\" says Bill Ruh, GE&apos;s chief digital officer and CEO of its GE Digital business (GE calls its division heads CEOs). \"And we hadn&apos;t gotten to a general-purpose framework in machine learning.\" \nToday GE revealed the purchase of two AI companies that Ruh says will get them there. Bit Stew Systems , founded in 2005, was already doing much of what Predix Cloud promises—collecting and analyzing sensor data from power utilities, oil and gas companies, aviation, and factories. (GE Ventures has funded the company.) Customers include BC Hydro, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Scottish & Southern Energy.\nThe second purchase, Wise.io is a less obvious purchase. Founded by astrophysics and AI experts using machine learning to study the heavens, the company reapplied the tech to streamlining a company&apos;s customer support systems, picking up clients like Pinterest, Twilio, and TaskRabbit. GE believes the technology will transfer yet again, to managing industrial machines. \"I think by the middle of next year we will have a full machine learning stack,\" says Ruh.\nGE Wants to Give Industrial Machines Their Own Social Network With Predix Cloud GE is selling a new service that promises to predict when a machine will break down...so technicians can preemptively fix it. GE also just bought ServiceMax , maker of software for dispatching field service agents, for a cool $915 million. \"It&apos;s a unicorn, essentially,\" he says.\nThough young, Predix is growing fast, with 270 partner companies using the platform, according to GE, which expects revenue on software and services to grow over 25% this year, to more than $7 billion. Ruh calls Predix a \"significant part\" of that extra money. And he&apos;s ready to brag, taking a jab at IBM Watson for being a \"general-purpose\" machine-learning provider without the deep knowledge of the industries it serves. \"We have domain algorithms, on machine learning, that&apos;ll know what a power plant is and all the depth of that, that a general-purpose machine learning will never really understand,\" he says.\nGE Healthcare lobbed a shot across IBM&apos;s bow in announcing a deal with UCSF to develop AI-driven apps for the care of various diseases. (See my colleague Chrissy Farr&apos;s full coverage [[TK-Link here]] .) Health is the first industry IBM Watson targeted (starting with years of studying cancer data), and UCSF is a nice prize.\nNot synonymous with health is another new GE customer, McDonald’s, which is using a Predix service called Current to lower energy costs on items like heating and lighting. Most of GE&apos;s new offerings are in the energy realm, such as Digital Substation, which promises to use monitoring and AI to reduce downtime for power companies.\nOne especially dull-sounding new Predix service—Predictive Corrosion Management—touches on a very hot political issue: giant oil and gas pipeline projects. Over 400 people have been arrested in months of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline , which would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The issue is very complicated, but one concern of protestors is that a pipeline rupture would contaminate drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.\n\"I think absolutely this is aimed at that problem. If you look at why pipelines spill, it&apos;s corrosion,\" says Ruh. \"We believe that 10 years from now, we can detect a leak before it occurs and fix it before you see it happen.\" Given how political battles over pipelines drag on, 10 years might not be so long to wait.",

      "title": "IBM and Nvidia make deep learning easy for AI service creators with a new bundle",
      "text": "  \nOn Monday, IBM announced that it collaborated with Nvidia to provide a complete package for customers wanting to jump right into the deep learning market without all the hassles of determining and setting up the perfect combination of hardware and software. The company also revealed that a cloud-based model is available as well that eliminates the need to install local hardware and software. \nTo trace this project, we have to jump back to September when IBM launched a new series of “OpenPower” servers that rely on the company’s Power8 processor. The launch was notable because this chip features integrated NVLink technology, a proprietary communications link created by Nvidia that directly connects the central processor to a Nvidia-based graphics processor, namely the Tesla P100 in this case. Server-focused x86 processors provided by Intel and AMD don’t have this type of integrated connectivity between the CPU and GPU. \nMore: IBM opens its wallet for a new headquarters to house its Watson Internet of Things platform \nAccording to IBM, the data thrashed between an IBM-based NVLink-embedded CPU and a Nvdia-based GPU moves 2.5 times faster than the movement of data between an AMD/Intel processor and a graphics chip using a PCI Express connection. More specifically, the NVLink communication can shove data at 80GB per second while x86 servers relying on PCI Express only moves data at 32GB per second. \nThe server IBM is supplying in its new bundle is the Power S822LC designed for high performance computing, which is the foundation for deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence services. This is a 2U rack-mounted server, which can measure up to 3.5 inches in height. This unit consists of two eight-core or ten-core Power8 processors, up to 1TB of system memory, and up to four Tesla P100 graphics chips. \nIn a pre-release phone call with IBM, the company indicated that one Power8 CPU in the server is assigned two P100 GPUs. There are two NVLink lanes between a single CPU and a single GPU, and two NVLink lanes between the paired GPUs. Thus, the two connected GPUs have an incredibly fast access to large data sets residing in the system memory due to the NVLink connections, and the 115GB-per-second link between the CPU and the system memory. Additionally, the link between both sets of the CPU/GPU trio provides speeds of 38.4GB per second. \nOutside the hardware, IBM’s new bundle consists of a deep learning software toolkit called PowerAI . This combines pre-compiled deep learning frameworks (Caffe, Torch, Theano, and OpenBLAS) into one package aimed at Ubuntu 16.04 running on an IBM Power processor, Nvidia CUDA v8.0, and Nvidia cuDNN 5.1. \nThat’s a lot of server talk we know, so just rest assured that IBM has provided a hardware/software solution that can be used to quickly set up a scalable platform for creating AI-reliant services. \n“The new solution supports emerging computing methods of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning,” the company stated on Monday. “IBM PowerAI also provides a continued path for Watson, IBM’s cognitive solutions platform, to extend its artificial intelligence expertise in the enterprise by using several deep learning methods to train Watson.” \nIn the pre-announcement briefing, IBM stressed that the PowerAI toolkit will make setting up a platform for AI quick and easy. The bundle of deep learning software is optimized and tested on IBM’s hardware for “ease of implementation.” The company also provides documents via IBM OpenPower to make the installation process a breeze, and promises to continue optimizing the software for future Power-based hardware. \nBut what does all of this mean for the general consumer? IBM is setting service developers up for a more personal experience. For instance, the hardware/software bundle will likely be used to create an intelligent system for detecting retail bank fraud. This service would compare the face provided in physical IDs that are used across multiple bank branches against the face of the actual customer standing in front of the counter. \nAnother scenario would be chat bots and call center automation. In both situations, artificial intelligence backed by IBM’s new bundle would quickly understand speech and language, and then answer questions in a more human-like manner. Services would also benefit from a smarter search system thanks to deep learning powered by the hardware/software combo. \n“PowerAI democratizes deep learning and other advanced analytic technologies by giving enterprise data scientists and research scientists alike an easy-to-deploy platform to rapidly advance their journey on AI,” said Ken King, General Manager, OpenPower. “Coupled with our high-performance computing servers built for AI, IBM provides what we believe is the best platform for enterprises building AI-based software, whether it’s chatbots for customer engagement, or real-time analysis of social media data.” \nFinally, the second component of IBM’s announcement focused on Nimbix , a high performing computing (HPC) cloud platform provider. Nimbix expanded its cloud-based services by installing IBM’s Power S822LC server and the PowerAI suite. Thanks to this offering, customers not wanting to purchase and install the hardware/software combo into a data center can create services that rely on computing in the cloud. \nIBM indicated in the briefing that the new Nimbix solution is ideal for high performance computing and deep learning, and won’t require that customers create a virtual machine to provide their services. One of the current compute applications listed on the Nimbix website is machine learning inference demonstration software with a starting price of $5 per hour. \nFor more information about IBM’s new hardware/software bundle for setting up an AI platform, head here .

      "text": "IBM Unveils Blockchain Platform For KYC Compliance Corin Faife ( @corintxt) | Published on November 15, 2016 at 16:37 GMT News \nIBM's Bluemix Garage in Singapore has announced a new partnership aimed at helping financial institutions better comply with know-your-customer (KYC) requirements using blockchain. \nAnnounced yesterday at the Singapore FinTech festival, the project (a collaboration with KYC startup KYCK! ) aims to provide enhanced identity verification services, enabling KYCK!'s customers to more rapidly on-board customers in a secure environment. \nThe hope is the service will reduce the time and expense financial service providers encounter when on-boarding new customers and complying with KYC regulation. Using a permissioned distributed ledger, many of the existing steps can be streamlined into a one-time process, the partners said. \nBuilt on the open-source Hyperledger project, the service will provide KYCK! customers with video conferencing and encrypted document submission capabilities for the secure on-boarding of new customers. \nWhen identity has been confirmed, KYCK! will enter the customer's information into current bank checks, though a blockchain-based business network (including banking and governmental entities) would also be leveraged. \nFor more details, read the full report here.",

      "text": "Publicly traded customer relationship management (CRM) software company Salesforce is today talking up new artificial intelligence (AI) research that’s been conducted by the Salesforce Research division the company formally announced in September , following the MetaMind acquisition .\nMetaMind’s team was skilled in a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning, which involves training artificial neural networks on lots of data and then getting them to make inferences about new data. The new Salesforce Research division, headed up by former MetaMind cofounder and chief executive Richard Socher, does research in an academic context, and over time its learnings can lead to Salesforce product improvements. Salesforce competitors like Microsoft also operate units that regularly publish academic research.\nBut today the news is about new research. Salesforce Research has developed a neural network called a dynamic coattention network, which can answer questions about text, thanks to a coattentive encoder and a dynamic decoder. “The DCN interprets documents based on specific questions, builds a conditional representation of the document for each different question asked, iteratively hypothesizes multiple answers, and weeds out initial incorrect predictions. In the end it arrives at the most accurate and intuitive answers,” Socher wrote in a Medium post .\nQuestion answering is an established domain and an area of ongoing research for other major technology companies, such as Facebook . Salesforce tested out the dynamic coattention network’s performance on on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) , and it came out ahead of systems from Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Microsoft Research Asia, Google, and IBM.\n“The Dynamic Coattention Network is the first model to break the 80 percent F1 mark, taking machines one step closer to the human-level performance of 91.2 percent F1 on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset,” Salesforce research scientists Victor Zhong and Caiming Xiong wrote in a blog post . (The full paper is here .)\nAbove: An illustration of the dynamic coattention network.\nImage Credit: Screenshot In addition, Salesforce Research has thought up an alternative to the longstanding long short-term memory (LSTM) type of recurrent neural network (RNN) called a quasi-recurrent neural network, or QRNN. The advantage is that it’s possible to process all of a given text at once, in parallel, rather than one word at a time, which means you can do it more quickly, as research scientist James Bradbury explains in a blog post . The team applied the QRNN to sentiment analysis, translation, and predicting the next word in text, and overall it performed better than an LSTM RNN. (Paper here .)\nSalesforce Research has also built a model that can be likened to a Swiss Army knife: It can handle dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, semantic relatedness, syntactic chunking, and textual entailment. “These results are notable because many of the previous models were designed to handle single or a few related tasks to achieve the best results only for the limited number of the tasks,” former Salesforce Research intern Kazuma Hashimoto wrote in a blog post .

      "text": "View Blog \nSummary: IBM’s Watson as it exists today is as close as we’ve come to a single integrated platform for AI. It contains all the capabilities for image and video, natural language speech and text input and output, and the most comprehensive knowledge recovery module yet combined together. If you want to exploit the advances we’ve made in AI you need to understand where Watson is today and where it’s heading. \n\nRecently we wrote about how the ‘popular’ Watson of Jeopardy fame still lingers in the memories of our non-data scientist colleagues and perhaps misleads them about the capabilities of AI. But that’s the Watson of 2011, a virtual eon ago in DS time, especially with the leaps-and-bounds progress in AI. It’s time we got in tune with the modern Watson, or more correctly IBM’s Watson Group and its Watson platform and took a look at all there is to offer. \n\nThree Capabilities of AI (Cognitive Computing) \nFirst let’s review. There are three broad capabilities in today’s AI and they are: \nImage and video processing: Largely driven by Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) this field has been getting most of the press with capabilities like facial and object recognition. \nText and speech processing: This is generally known as Natural Language Processing (NLP), the capability to not only intake speech and text but to understand the nuanced context of strings of words, to perform search or translation on them, and output words and blocks of text and speech. Siri, Alexa, and Cortana represent examples of this field that used to be the butt of jokes but are now more than commercially acceptable. This field has been largely driven by Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs). \nKnowledge Retrieval: This field is a combination of search and Question Answering Machines (QAMs like Watson). It’s almost not fair to put these in the same category since the standards for search are only to return a list of possible sources in which the answer may be found. A QAM is required to return the single most likely answer while interpreting the context and nuance of the speech or text input. Watson at its historical core is a QAM and this is still its strong suit. \nSearch can rely on a variety of older techniques associated with much more simple routines. For the most part these don’t qualify for what we think of as AI but they’re included here since they are a major form of output from our virtual AI assistants like SIRI. Still there is a crossover area between simple search (what year was George Washington born) versus the much more complex capabilities of QAMs (given these symptoms, identify the best course of medical treatment). \n\nKnowledge Retrieval QAMs are Quite Complex \nWatson and QAMs in general have not received nearly as much press as the other two capabilities which really fails to recognize the sophistication of what’s going on here . QAMs rely on three capabilities : Natural language processing to understand the complexities of human communication both as a means of user input, as the basis for its more sophisticated search, and of course as output. Hypothesis generation and evaluation. QAMs create many hypotheses from the input language then search the knowledge base to find potential matches for each. By applying advanced analytics to weight and evaluate a number of potential responses based on only relevant evidence they arrive at a single conclusion. Evidence-based learning based on outcomes to get smarter with each iteration and interaction. \nCombining these three areas, image processing , text and speech processing , and knowledge retrieval we get the eyes, ears, mouth, and memory content that represent what AI is today. Given this anthropomorphic description, it’s no wonder that many people believe a more accurate descriptor is ‘Cognitive Computing’. \nThe reason for this lengthy preamble is that while all three of these major component areas have been moving forward at a rapid pace, we haven’t till now seen the introduction of a comprehensive AI platform where the best of all of these can be found in a single place. There is an arms race going on here and all the majors are moving to become the ‘one place’ for AI. In fact, in an effort to win over developers and grow their ecosystems, as of just the last year much of this capability is now open source. \n\nWatson as Comprehensive AI Platform \nBy early 2014 IBM had seen the writing on the wall and had established The Watson Group as a separate business within IBM. IBM CEO Virginia Rometty says this is a major battleground that IBM must win. \nMoving quickly, IBM’s Watson Group led with a series of products to appeal to its enterprise partners and by mid-2015 had added a very large list of cloud based APIs and developer SDKs to encourage the largest possible group of outside developers. \nDavid Schubmehl, an analyst at IDC compares IBMs new playbook in AI with Microsoft's Windows in personal computing and Google's Android OS in mobile. \"IBM is trying to do the same thing with Watson,\" he said, \"open up a platform, make it available for others, and democratize the technology.\" \n\nHere’s What You Can Find in Watson Today \nProducts for Enterprise End Users \n\nWatson Virtual Agent \nThis bot is intended to supplement or replace many of your CSRs and perhaps even with better quality responses and higher customer satisfaction. It’s not limited to CSR activities but could be used in any customer interactive service and has text or conversational speech inputs and outputs. There are onboard analytics that help to analyze trends in customer concerns and evaluate satisfaction with the interaction. IBM has even pre-trained several packages for specific industry use so the need for additional customization is limited. \nWatson Explorer \nNot ready to have your customers handled directly by AI? Explorer is intended to quickly bring together a 360 degree view of the customer or prospect plus recommended solutions based on its analytics. CSRs who spend much time trying to access information, or particularly sales and marketing staff interacting with customers are targets for this more internally focused product. Financial services, investment advisors, and insurance companies are good examples of the target market. \nWatson Analytics \nThis is IBMs shot at Citizen Data Scientists and offers automated data prep, modeling, and data visualization. From my quick tour it looks like the modeling is limited to which variables are most likely to affect outcome but that’s a good place for analysts to start. There’s a free version and two expanded versions with greater input capabilities and these premium versions also include Twitter data. \nWatson Analytics will also suggest questions that might be answered by the data you load so this is a guided process. There’s a separate version called Watson Analytics for Social Media that provides access to a much wider range of social media input. This won’t produce sophisticated predictive models that can be implemented in operating systems but it will let individual users explore statistical inference and sentiment analysis from social media in an extremely easy and non-technical format. \nWatson Knowledge Studio \nThis is the enterprise in-house version of the developer APIs and SDKs below that allow significant customization of the Watson enterprise products. \nWatson Customized for Specific Industries or Processes \nThere are a large number of offerings that combine elements of Virtual Agent, Explorer, and Analytics into packages targeting specific industries or processes: Commerce",

She said relevant skill is what \"matters most.\" \nRometty also agreed with Trump's ideas on spending in infrastructure. \n\"The country should focus on infrastructure investments that incorporate Internet of things technology and   to improve performance. \nThe letter also included ideas on healthcare, user data to fight government \"waste and inefficiency,\" America's tax system and medical care of veterans.",

      "text": "FIS' Astec Analytics provides up-to-date, intra-day short selling market insight via securities lending analytics, helping users gauge changes in investor sentiment. This is a roundup of some of the hottest stocks from a securities lending perspective Top Pick: IBM \nThe \"relentless rise\" of short interest activity seen in International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) shouldn't be overlooked. \nFIS noted that by the middle of August, the stock hit a peak of $163.53 and by the end of the month the short interest stood just 30 percent above the 12-month lows. Since then the short interest has grown consistently as IBM's stock fell below the $150 mark on October 21. Following that, at the end of each week a new peak of short interest was recorded. \nAs a percentage of supply, the short interest in IBM is relatively low but there is a committed demand of shorts that may see something concerning that other investors are overlooking. Cliffs Natural Resources \nShort interest in Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF ) has been decreasing over the past 12 months. \nCliffs, along with many other mining stocks, benefited from the post-election surge . Over the same time period, short sellers as a whole are already holding onto positions near a 12-month low and trimmed their positions by 3 percent. Crane \nCrane Co. (NYSE: CR ) has seen its stock gain around 47 percent over the past 12 months, with 60 percent of that gain taking place since the end of October. However, as the stock pushed above the $60 and $70 per share mark, short sellers returned to the stock. Under Armour \nUnder Armour Inc (NYSE: UA ) was FIS' top short pick two weeks ago, but the stock has since recovered and gained around 3 percent last week. \nShort volume is running at 96 percent of the available supply which makes Under Armour a hard borrow to find so borrowing costs are on the rise. In fact, last week borrowing costs rose 39 percent as lenders took advantage of the limited supply. Fitbit \nFitbit Inc (NYSE: FIT ) continues to operate in a highly competitive environment, not to mention ongoing skepticism over the accuracy of the health tracking device and consumer fatigue, pushed Fitbit's stock to its all time-lows. \nShort sellers and long investors appear to have sensed a floor price as short sellers reduced their positions as a whole by 14 percent by volume. In addition, short interest fell as a proportion of the shares available from 96 percent to 70 percent as new institutional supply has since become available. Twilio \nTwilio Inc 's (NYSE: TWLO ) stock is trading much closer to its IPO price than its all-time highs. However, as is typically the case with newly released shares, short supply is hard to find. Nevertheless, short sellers took advantage of new supply last week and the overall short positions rose by 23 percent.  ",

      "text": "IBM, Nvidia release new PowerAI software suite for deep learning projects IBM, Nvidia release new PowerAI software suite for deep learning projects By Jessica Hall   2:15 pm Comment \nAt some point this year the big buzzword appears to have shifted away from “the cloud” to “deep learning.” Eugen Weber once remarked that everybody who’s anybody sacked Rome. In similar fashion, everybody who’s anybody is setting machine learning loose on problems — especially the much-beloved process of deep learning. Deep learning is a machine learning method that extracts information from a volume of data by crunching through millions of entries, in order to sift out and rank the most important aspects of the data. One current wunderkind of deep learning is the Jeopardy-playing, cancer-diagnosing AI Watson, which runs on IBM’s Power architecture. \nNow IBM and Nvidia just jointly released a set of deep learning software tools called PowerAI, designed to use the Power architecture. These tools are meant to make machine learning projects faster and tighten up neural net performance, and in part, to provide a way to extend Watson as our understanding of AI advances. PowerAI consists of a set of binary distributions of several custom-tuned neural nets (software) and some associated custom Nvidia GPUDL libraries compatible with machine-learning tasks. As a software suite, PowerAI is designed to run on a single one of IBM’s highest-end Power servers, the Power S822LC for High Performance Computing (HPC), but also to scale up from one to many many supercomputing clusters. \nReaders may be familiar with Nvidia’s NVLink communications protocol; NVLink is a hardware bridge that can link CPUs to GPUs or GPUs to GPUs, at up to 80 GB/s of bandwidth. On IBM’s highest-end S822LC HPC servers, because of hardware acceleration using the IBM POWER8 chip in tandem with the NVLink hardware bridge between NV GPUs, PowerAI can run Alexnet with Caffe or BVLC at twice the speed of comparable x86 systems. Nvidia’s NVLink fabric \nBeyond Watson, one of the outfits making use of Power tools (yeah, they named it so we’d have to say it like that, very punny, guys) is the Human Brain Project, which is using Power supercomputers to crunch the massively parallel data flow through the human connectome, and even to simulate and visualize that data in a way that isn’t limited by the size of the output pipe. Another is the city of Yachay, Ecuador. Yachay is a planned city that its organizers have dubbed the “city of knowledge,” and said organizers intend to use PowerAI for calculations related to climate projections, food genomics, and energy research. The entire project is designed to push residents from emphasizing what they have to emphasizing what they know; the intent is to make the city run on knowledge-based innovation. Tagged In",

      "text": "NAFTA explained IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wants to help President-elect Donald Trump create new jobs in America. But she's not suggesting getting tough on Mexico and China or ending trade deals as Trump has threatened as a way to bring back jobs from foreign shores. \nInstead, Rometty urged Trump in a letter to focus his job-creation efforts on vocational training for young workers. \n\"Let's work together to scale up this approach of vocational training, creating a national corps of skilled workers trained to take the 'new collar' IT jobs that are in demand here in America,\" Rometty wrote in the letter that was first reported by CNBC. \nTrump too has advocated for more job training, something he and President Obama seem to agree on. \nObama has spent a record $265 million on apprenticeship programs during his time in office, according to the Commerce Department. \nRelated: The men America left behind \nRometty hopes to focus specifically on training high school students for tech job training to allow young workers to go into advanced fields such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and data science. IBM ( IBM , Tech30 ) has partnered with New York City to open a high school five years ago with a six-year curriculum that has traditional high school education with vocational experience . These translate into paid internships at IBM and other tech companies. \nMore broadly, Rometty's letter hits at a weakness in the U.S. economy: employers can't find the skilled workers they need even though job openings are at near record highs. \nIt's called the job skills gap -- the difference between the skills workers have and the skills employers want. That divide is a major reason why some U.S. workers have felt left behind during America's recovery from the Great Recession. \nVocational training and apprenticeships are among the most popular ideas at addressing the job skills gap. \nCNNMoney (New York)   3:07 PM ET",

      "title": "IBM CEO Makes Case for ‘New Collar’ Jobs in Open Letter to Donald Trump",
      "text": "In an open letter to President Elect Donald Trump, IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty outlined several bi-partisan steps she thinks the new administration could employ to help create jobs.\nUp to a third of the employees at some of IBM’s ibm corporate centers do not have college degrees, Rometty noted, adding the company needs to hire across developing areas, such as cybersecurity, data science, and artificial intelligence. These are what Rometty characterized as “new collar” jobs, roles that require defined skills but not necessarily two- or four-year college degrees.\nRometty suggested the federal government could improve health insurance programs by applying data analytics to cut Medicare fraud and easing secure data transfers of healthcare data between authorized providers. The government could also wield its purchasing power to lower the cost of prescription drugs and patient care, she added. (IBM is in the data analytics and security business.)\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nRometty also noted that Trump’s reform proposal could “free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs.’\nShe said IBM supported efforts of the new administration to pass tax reform early next year.\nFor more on Ginni Rometty, watch: \nRometty leads one of the country’s oldest and most legendary business giants --albeit one that has been challenged of late by younger tech companies in the cloud computing sector. But Rometty has IBM pushing hard in artificial intelligence, cloud, and mobile. With nearly 380,000 employees worldwide, IBM ibm remains the largest tech company in the United States.\nFull text of the letter is below:\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/331203087/image2016-11-14-091952-2-1 \nNews of Rometty’s letter was first reported by CNBC . An IBM spokesperson said that nine years ago, Rometty’s predecessor Sam Palmisano reached out in a similar manner to then-President-elect Barack Obama.",

      "text": "Corrects amount of IBM's cash and marketable securities to $10 billion in the U.S. and overseas from $61 billion.\nIBM's ( IBM ) Virginia Rometty told Donald Trump that her company will support the efforts of a Trump administration and Congress to pass tax reform early in 2017, in an open letter to him published on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe 59-year-old chief executive penned a letter to the president-elect congratulating him on his victory and laying out ideas she believes \"will help achieve the aspiration [he] articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change.\" She outlined her thoughts on a litany of issues, ranging from job creation to healthcare, tax reform and veterans, offering up her suggestions as \"ways we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society.\"\nMany of the issues addressed by Rometty's line up with IBM's stated positions on a variety of political issues.\n\"IBM supports your proposal to make American's tax system more competitive,\" she wrote. Trump has proposed reducing the business tax rate to 15% from 35% and enacting a repatriation holiday for corporations holding assets abroad to bring them back to the United States at a 10% rate.\n\"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system. Your tax reform proposal will free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs.\"\nIBM has about $10 billion in total cash and marketable securities combined in the U.S. and overseas as of September and does not break out how much of that amount is held abroad.\nRometty called for \"new collar\" jobs, citing vocational education as a viable area about which she believes her company and Trump agree. IBM has pushed for six-year public high schools that combine traditional education with community college, mentoring and real-world experience. They have opened 100 such schools across the country.\nTrump on the campaign trail did not provide an enormous amount of detail on his plans for education. He has adopted traditional Republican talking points like school choice and has suggested he would seek to eliminate the Department of Education.\nHis campaign website promises he will \"ensure that the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year college or to pursue a trade or skill through vocational educational \"will be easier to access, pay for, and finish.\"\nRometty also outlined her thoughts on healthcare, reiterating a number of ideas IBM put forth in 2009 on reforms it says will help America save over $900 billion over the course of a decade. The suggestions include the use of data analytics to reduce fraudulent Medicare claims, improving the exchange of information among providers and leveraging government purchasing power to lower drug costs.\nOne issue to go unmentioned in Rometty's letter is trade, or, more specifically, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. IBM strongly supports the deal, while Trump spoke out vehemently against it over the course of his campaign.\nMany expect Trump to drop out of the agreement in the early days of his administration .\nIBM was among a number of companies Trump hit on the campaign trail for shipping jobs overseas. He accused the company of laying off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moving their jobs to India at a Minnesota rally just a day before the election. He made similar attacks against Ford ( F ) , Apple ( AAPL ) and General Motors ( GM ) , among others.\nIBM spent $4.6 million on federal lobbying in 2015 -- lower than some other tech giants -- and does not have a super PAC. According to its corporate policies, it does not make any contributions to political parties, candidates or PACs. Federal Election Commission filings do not show donation records for Rometty.\nAccording to campaign finance tracker OpenSecrets, IBM employees made more than $700,000 in political contributions during the 2016 election cycle. The company's lobbying expenses have hit $3.2 million this year.",

      "text": "IBM Closes Sanovi Technologies Acquisition (IBM) By Daniel Kobialka | November 15, 2016 — 3:49 PM EST \nInternational Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) has completed its acquisition of business continuity and hybrid cloud software provider Sanovi Technologies. (See also: IBM, NVIDIA Partner to Advance A.I. Solutions .) \nIBM said it intends to incorporate Sanovi's capabilities into its global technology services business unit.

      "text": "IBM CEO pens letter to Donald Trump, says tech can bring America together LF By Laurie Fullerton - 15 November 2016 23:00pm \nIn an unprecedented move, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty issued a letter to President-elect Donald Trump today detailing steps to bring America together with technology as a central theme. IBM is the biggest tech employer in the US, and her letter addressed a need for \"new collar\" IT jobs, saying that today, IBM does not always require it's employees to have a college degree. She said relevant skill is what \"matters most.\" IBM CEO Ginni Rometty \n\"I know that you are committed to help America's economy grow in ways that are good for all of its people,\" Rometty wrote in the letter to Trump obtained by CNBC. \"I am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help achieve the aspiration you articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change.\" \nThe IBM chief advocated for Trump to create \"new collar\" IT jobs that can require job training that might begin in hybrid high school-to-college curriculum, with more vocational classes taught with an emphasis on training on the Internet of Things technology and artificial intelligence. \nRometty also agreed with Trump's ideas on tax reform and spending on infrastructure, but added an important tech caveat. \n\"The country should focus on infrastructure investments that incorporate Internet of Things technology and artificial intelligence to improve performance,\" she noted.",

      "text": "In an open letter to President Elect Donald Trump, IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty outlined several bi-partisan steps she thinks the new administration could employ to help create jobs.\nUp to a third of the employees at some of IBM’s ibm corporate centers do not have college degrees, Rometty noted, adding the company needs to hire across developing areas, such as cybersecurity, data science, and artificial intelligence. These are what Rometty characterized as “new collar” jobs, roles that require defined skills but not necessarily two- or four-year college degrees.\nRometty suggested the federal government could improve health insurance programs by applying data analytics to cut Medicare fraud and easing secure data transfers of healthcare data between authorized providers. The government could also wield its purchasing power to lower the cost of prescription drugs and patient care, she added. (IBM is in the data analytics and security business.)\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nRometty also noted that Trump’s reform proposal could “free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs.’\nShe said IBM supported efforts of the new administration to pass tax reform early next year.\nFor more on Ginni Rometty, watch:\nRometty leads one of the country’s oldest and most legendary business giants —albeit one that has been challenged of late by younger tech companies in the cloud computing sector. But Rometty has IBM pushing hard in artificial intelligence, cloud, and mobile. With nearly 380,000 employees worldwide, IBM ibm remains the largest tech company in the United States.\nFull text of the letter is below:\nNews of Rometty’s letter was first reported by CNBC . An IBM spokesperson said that nine years ago, Rometty’s predecessor Sam Palmisano reached out in a similar manner to then-President-elect Barack Obama.",

      "text": "Yes. Tom Rosamilia So I think, first of all, it’s interesting on playing right here. I was reading some of the research material from UBS and from Evidence Labs. And there is difference of opinion on what is hybrid, is it real. And I think you guys are spot on in calling this out that it really needs to be defined for people. So they understand what do we mean by hybrid environment. First thing I’ll say is we plan and intend to be a first-class provider in public, in public cloud. We do with the IBM cloud offering. And that is really important for people to understand. We’re not just giving that to others, we’re embracing it. We’re going after it. And making our platform-as-a-service layer available on top of that, it is essential for our strategy going forward. We also do a lot of cloud managed services for customers today, whether it’s on-prem or whether we do in our data centers. And my services colleagues banish that. And then there is this world in between of hybrid. And as I said, really need to define that. Ask vendors to define what that means. What some people think it means is the ability to use capacity on-prem and eventually use it off-prem when I need it. And that’s a very difficult thing for workloads to do to burst out, because of physics, because of gravity of data, and because have to have an exactly mirrored environment, somewhere else like I have on-prem in order to make that work. But as VMware folks have said and they’ve partnered with us on this. Portability is a different topic if I can run this workload here, and then I can select when I want to run the workload in a cloud. And so the VMware software partnership is critical to us to be able to duplicate all the VMs that they have, millions of VMs running on-prem today and make that available on the IBM cloud, and so they can run it either place when I choose but not in a nano-second when I have capacity need. So I think portability and making sure I have the same kind of environments available in both places is critical. I would also say what we could do with cloud object store to be able to store locally, or chose to store that data in a IBM cloud, running our cloud object store. So I can store it in either place. I am not talking about storing in both. I am saying this data goes here and that data goes there. But it's exactly the same interface for me to use one place to the other. That gives me the hybrid capability. I can do back-up and recovery. And say, I want to store my data in case I need it somewhere in a public cloud, or a dedicated cloud environment. And then this to me a really interesting case, which is one we would have called integration before. Let's take an example of an on-prime application that’s running and it wants to do sentiment analysis. And it wants to use a Watson service and Bluemix in order to do that. Well, I could augment in existing application with that cognitive computing running on Watson, running on IBM to cloud and say let me find out what Twitter, what social media is saying about my product that day as I decide what to make available or how to price something. Now I’ve done a hybrid environment where some of it's running on-prem and I am calling a set of services that could be in a public cloud somewhere looking at public data somewhere. So to me it's about the combination of all of these things. And therefore I think that’s why a lot of clients say, while I want embrace things in the public cloud, and they should, they also have to reflect that it also have a tremendous investment in what they have already done, and they want to be able to augment that. Steve Milunovich So, many of your are like competitors [multiple speakers] they initially, I think, were trying to compute AWS, and they’ve one-by-one pretty much given up on that. But you made the investment in SoftLayer early-on. Is that turning out to be a real advantage at least to be able to offer that public cloud capability to customers? Tom Rosamilia I believe, as I said, that it is really important for us to have a first-class public cloud offering. And not just say, I am going to give that over to AWS or I am going to give that over to Microsoft. I think it's essential for us to be a first-class public cloud provider. And then we can have the discussion about how we can help you integrate what you are doing today on-prem with that public cloud capability. Steve Milunovich Let's turn to Watson a bit. By the way, great ads. I think you could watch the U.S. open tennis without seeing the Watson ads. I think investors are extremely intrigued by what you’re doing clearly, you guys have been very vocal about $2 trillion opportunity potentially. But investors also have trouble getting their arms around exactly what is Watson. How do you monetize this? Can you talk us through the position in the platform today? Tom Rosamilia Yes, it's understandable that people having trouble with it, because we started-off having this monolithic thing is called Watson. It played a game-show and it did well. But going forward it wasn’t going to be about duplicating this specific use-case around Q&A or around call center or around oncology, or around whatever it might be. We had to take that code-base and re-factor into set of services. So these are cognitive services that are available in the Bluemix environment. And so people can make that sentiment analysis call. They can make that voice recognition call. They can make whatever call they want to make and learn something about using that service and learning some information back. So it shows up in a lot of services. It's not one thing. It’s a set of things and set of capabilities that now we can apply that to a call center example, or an oncology example, or a financial services example. In the oncology example, for example, we’ve partnered with companies like firms like MSK, Memorial Sloan Kettering, or Quest Diagnostics, or the Broad Institute. We’ve made the oncological services available from Watson to 70% -- or the oncologist treating 70% of the patients in the U.S. that happened to have cancer. So they’ve got this access to this incredible database of information stored from images, in some cases for companies we’ve acquired that learned about what’s benign and what’s not, and how can I reflect that back to the oncologist. Or learning about genomics, so that I can match specifically whatever cancer this patient has, or what treatment I should use. And so that’s the set of services. The translation of all that is its cognitive everywhere, it’s not about a product called cognitive. Cognitive is an aspect. Cognitive is like resiliency, or like high availability, it's can I do that in a cognitive way or am I doing that in a traditional way. Am I doing that in a learning way or am I doing that in a programming way. And so, that’s why it’s difficult for people to get their arms around well how big is Watson. Because my boss Ginni Rometty said two years ago, you’re going to see cognitive everywhere. And I think he was right. We’re seeing it all over the place. I design for cognitive, because I want to design for the AI world where we’re doing a lot of machine learning. It turns out accelerated computing is exactly the right model for cognitive computing. I’ve got to be able to provide that to IBM and to others who are doing cognitive computing. So that I can be that arm supplier to the world that’s embraced in cognitive, whether they do it from us or they do it from others. Steve Milunovich How you monetizing that, I think, at the Analyst Day, there were three, four, five different ways you were looking at monetizing. And I’m sure you kind of figuring it out as you go up bit. And where do investors see that in terms of where IBM reports revenue? Tom Rosamilia We mostly see it in the cognitive solutions segment. So that’s obviously where it would be given this is cognitive of computing. We’ve gone into new industries. It’s about Watson Healthcare, where we did a number of acquisitions but we’re combining that with the force of Watson. We do it and Watson IoT, where we can learn things from all the connected devices, or we can learn things from information, we can learn about weather, and that weather has a profound effect on lots of businesses. And so the Internet of Things using a weather channel transport is a very effective way of tying all that data that’s available. And in this case from the weather sensors, but in other case from all kinds of sensors around the world. And so you’re seeing it in -- it will be in financials, it will be in call center applications that we’re doing with many of our partners, and our customers, it’s in healthcare. So it’s in all of those difference places. But I think, you as investors, you should look for in the cognitive segment and see how that’s growing. Steve Milunovich We recently did Evidence Lab survey on AI talking to both users and ISVs, and we’re surprised to find 90% of the companies say they’re doing something in the area. IBM came out very well. And I guess one of conclusions was, in terms of what’s going to differentiate folks only the data probably matters a lot. And I think that’s something where you’ve kind of apart from history in terms of making acquisitions in recent years to own the data? Tom Rosamilia I think that’s true. But I think it’s also a way we differentiate ourselves from competition. So, there are certain domains where it really helps us to learn and inform a Watson Analytics capability around oncology. So, we make acquisitions like we’ve done with Merge and others where we bought lots of either records for images, and we can learn from those. We’ve trained Watson to recognize what’s the benign and what carcinogenic. And so if it’s cancer or not cancer, I want to know with 99% assurance and we can train it to know that owning those images in that case makes a lot of sense. So as we went into the healthcare industry, and going to transform the way people do health, provide healthcare, I think it was really important for us to have a chunk of that data that we can learn from. In other places, that’s not true. We do a lot of Watson engagements with people where your data is your data, you can keep that. The competition for IBM doesn’t always do that. But I think a difference that we make is that your data, if you want to keep that private that’s fine. If you want to combine that with publicly available data, if you want to look at social media, you want to use Watson to say tell me what Twitter is saying about me, my brand today, you can do that and combine it with your own data. But keep that to yourself. So, yes, for healthcare it was important for us to learn from medical records, from images. But in other industries, not so much. Steve Milunovich We’ve also hearing a lot about multisided platforms, and how many new tech companies are formed these platforms and the benefits you potentially get in terms of network effects. It appears that you’re trying to create Watson as a platform, opening up APIs, allowing third parties to add value. Could you talk about that? Tom Rosamilia I think we’ve learned this lesson as a valuable lesson for the industry. I would say that our mainframe as a platform that we built upon. I would say that what we’ve done around OpenPOWER as a platform to say there is a set APIs that people can use and a set of standard interfaces so that they know with assurance that they can combine forces and use OpenCAPI as hopefully a platform that we’re delivering together. And clearly, Watson is one where we believe that we’re not going to be the only ones contributing for this. We want to marketplace where others can write things and use maybe recombine those APIs into different use cases, and take advantage of the ones that are already there. So, it’s a big world. And I think if you can win at the platform level then it's a win for everybody. It’s a win for us, but it's also a win for the ecosystem of partners. And therefore a lot more people delivering value than just IBM. Steve Milunovich I’ve got a few questions from investors here. One is about, what is IBM doing in China? And I know that you had a lot of success in your area in China, and mainframes are the backbone of a lot of China transaction processing systems in airlines. But obviously given the political changes here, people also interested. Tom Rosamilia Yes. So there is a lot happening in China. I’ve been to China five-times this year, I'll be back again for the sixth time this year. So I spent a fair amount of time there. And it's an exciting place. It's a very important marketplace to us. And it's going through its own transformation for sure. But I think it is essential that you noted that there are places within China that are critically depended on our mainframe technology and we’re happy to keep those folks as customers or high-volume transaction processing customers. And I hope they continue to be forever. I think that as we look at what we’re doing with POWER, one of the reasons I called the OpenPOWER play was to be able to do indigenous development in China, not only in China but in China as well. And so I’ve done licensing models for companies in China that are building their own OpenPOWER systems. They’re delivering their own servers. Inspur is delivering a server today based POWER8 technology. But I’ve licensed the capability for them to produce their own chips and manufacture their own chips. So as they get better at semiconductor development, they can use power as reference architecture or with a license from me, sort of the arm model, in this case for servers, so that they can do indigenous development. So I go over visit with them and see how they are crossing along on their roadmap to delivering POWER8 and eventually further follow-on products and technologies. And so we’re embracing a lot of capabilities in China with the different government agencies, with the different commercial entities, in addition to the customers that I’ve traditionally called on along the way. But I think this win that we just had with Tencent is another breakthrough, because Tencent being one of the hyperscale data centers, them using POWER8 to win the sort benchmark, 5x performance of what was been available prior. They’re one of the three big hyperscale providers in China. So wining with them and hopefully winning with some of the others is another good way for us to be a part of what's happening in China. My team in China is designed with China not just manufacturer in China. But I am doing that as a co-development effort with Chinese firms that have lots of good skills and they can bring their capital intellectual one other way to the table. I can do the same and we can build for the China market together. Steve Milunovich Another question here, how will IBM Systems address the parallel computing opportunity for high-performance computing? Tom Rosamilia I think that the high-performance model is significantly changed. We used to be, several years ago, a big player in high-performance computing. And I did it with very unique and custom hardware that was only available for high-performance computing models. That turned out to be non-economically a good idea. Even though there were some great wins and some really good examples of systems. It wasn’t a good economic model for me. And so I stopped doing that for a while. And OpenPOWER has really opened up this model to say, it’s not just about the processor, it’s about the storage class memory, what I can do with accelerators, what I can do with flash, and delivering on this promise of the OpenPOWER and OpenCAPI ecosystem. And so, the wins that we’ve had with the big U.S. government wins, the wins in France, the wins in the UK at Hatchery, have all been wins at University of Michigan, have all been embracing this OpenPOWER model, it's systemic performance delivered by CPU and GPU, or CPU and FPGA. And so, what we’ve announced with POWER AI, in VDS, saying that their compilers are available for POWER8 and GPU, the wins we’ve had, the fact that it’s available on the HPC cloud and Nimbix. All of these I think are good proof points that this model of accelerated computing is the answer for HPC going forward. Steve Milunovich How does your new hybrid cloud off flash storage solution differ from your competitors? Tom Rosamilia So our off flash storage solution, the biggest difference that we can provide is that as you’ve sold this thing up, it continues to perform. So unlike spinning disc where tend to undersell, they sell it to like 30% utilization. At a certain point in utilization on a spinning disc, you’ve used to begin to fall over and that is that you created I/O bottleneck. And so everybody is waiting for data. And so, people spend a fair amount of money spreading their data out on spinning disc. In flash, you can go a little further. And so I can go to 40%-50% utilization and not create a bottleneck, because it’s a solid state and I can just -- I don’t have to move heads and drives and the like. And our environment, we can go up to 80%, almost 90%, utilization and not have a performance set. So, in our case, it's about filling this thing up, about providing compression, so that you use less of the data. If you think about how much disc people buy for how much production data they actually have, it’s a multiple of it. And so for us the better we can get to one-to-one, the better off customers are, because it’s less money for them and less floor space for them and less energy for them. And so our solution in the flash area delivers higher utilization, greater capacity for the smallest footprint possible, and the best performance in the marketplace. Steve Milunovich I guess selling hard drive business years ago was a pretty good idea? Tom Rosamilia It was a good idea. Although, we continue to package those hard drives into storage devices that we continue to sell today, and we will for years and years to come. But being in that component business, you’ve got to really be able to do at scale, same thing around the moves to get out of the semiconductor manufacturing business. I was ways up scale in that. Steve Milunovich So the industry is obviously going through a significant change to cloud, and sometimes we say, we haven’t seen anything like this since the shift to client server in the 90s, which almost put IBM out of the business at the time. But IBM did recover. How would you compare the challenges that IBM is facing today to the 90s? When I think you were around, Ginni was around, there has to in fact the thinking of the management team here as you’ve seen other one of these disruptive periods. Tom Rosamilia So I would actually recommend a near-death experience to anyone in the room. I wouldn’t recommend a death experience. But near-death is a good learning experience. And we certainly went through that. And I think it helps motivate us through transformation and saying, I don’t want to get to the point where I am struggling to keep my head above water. The thing that’s so different for me this time is this move cognitive is one that we’ve initiated, not the one that we’ve reacted to. And so, to me, we’re on the forefront of this. We have the leading capability in cognitive computing. A lot of it invented in IBM research. Some of it augmented by things we’ve done, but most of it really home-grown for our R&D dollar. What I am delivering in systems for cognitive computing is all things that we’ve either done or we’ve partnered with others to do. So, I feel good about it being on the leading edge of this, not being on the bleeding edge of this and thinking about what's going to happen if we don’t embrace something. We’re driving this. We’re not reacting to this. So that’s a fundamentals difference. The other difference I would think is the speed. This is all happening very quickly. And so possibility is aligned like never before, things that were not possible before are possible now. And I would say the last difference to me is around business model. So I think business models are changing now more than they ever have before. And it's not just about technology, it's about the way people go to market with that technology. The way people tie supply and demand. And the fact that we’re doing it this case back in the '90s, we were doing it pretty much on our own. In this case we’re really doing it through partnerships. Whether its partnerships apple, or the fact that I am doing things at SAP or on POWER. I’ve got a partnership with Cisco. You mentioned them as a competitor. They’re also a great partner to me. I sell storage with their servers. We’ve done things around collaboration together. We’ve done things around IoT together. So to me this is more about an industry rather than just a company reacting to the opportunities that’s out there, and that’s very different than it was for me in the 90s. Steve Milunovich That’s fair. I think IBM is always been as its best when it’s a thought leader, and not reacting. And a number of years ago, Ginni, at Analyst Day, talked about the cognitive computing wave, but it’s a 50-year wave. So what do you tell investors in terms of the timing of when you will see the benefits of the investments that you’ve been making the last couple of years? Tom Rosamilia I think it's happening, and I say that because it's cognitive everywhere as recording my boss, she said cognitive everywhere. And you see it happening. I see it happening. Even in the operating system function I deliver, they become smarter every year. Every delivery we have we can learn things about what's normal for customer A versus customer B by watching and observing the behavior and doing better as a result. We call that B aware, as an example. So it’s a ware, it has awareness of am I operating within normal parameters or outside, is there something really bad about to happen. So it shown up in the operating system, it shows up in our storage. It shows up in all of the different Watson set of services that are available. So, the comment about this transformation and how long it may take, that’s probably an answer to complete transformation, but I see it happen every day in what we’re doing with many companies around oncology, around call centers, around financial markets, it's happening every day. Steve Milunovich And the question is then, all the future talent acquisition or do you believe it will impact the bottom line? Tom Rosamilia In this case, I think, when you do things that coming on the bottom line is we always do acquisitions with the business case and the business case is usually around what we think has happened to the greater good of IBM. And in cases like where we’re doing labor, it's usually an acceleration of how to get talent. So, labor-based acquisitions are really for us about an injection of talent. Steve Milunovich And then maybe to finish up, you’ve divested your fabs but I believe you’ve test a lot of your semiconductor designers. And I remember John Kelly at one of the analyst days a few years ago talking about substantial changes in hardware, cloud and computing. One sort of wonders if the value ever shifts back to hardware in a way, so why did you keep those designers and what sort of there is the future of Systems business? Tom Rosamilia Good question. And I think for foreseeable we’re talking about what I am able to do with processors that I continue to innovate in more traditional ways in silicon and the combination of accelerators. And that’s true for the next four years. But what we’re beginning to see deliver is things like the next generation. And by that I mean the generation beyond silicon. So, it’s about quantum computing. We sit-up and research a quantum computer last year, made it available on the cloud this year for experimentation. So people can get on to our cloud and take advantage of quantum computing and see what it can do. We have this awesome fundamental quantum issue. This has been promised for years. But the breakthrough is really where last year and this year are being able to correct for some of the errors that occur. And make this available at scale. And so quantum computing at scale, we can now see it, we can touch it, we can feel it. It’s not commercially available, but it’s available for people to do experiments with. If I think about silicon photonics, and the comment I made about OpenCAPI is the same thing for silicon photonics. I look for the place where I am limited on the system and eventually it will be having to move information around. If I can use silicon photonics and we’re on the leading edge of doing design and our research team to do that, to me it’s about taking that bottleneck out of the system. If I think about what we’re doing with carbon nanotubes and the little layering of carbon, we can do this for orders of magnitude faster, and using a whole lot less energy than the systems today use. So between neuromorphic brain inspired systems, like TrueNorth that John has described, or quantum computing silicon photonics, what we’re doing the carbon nanotubes, all of this is about leading edge research. Some of its driving near deliveries like what we’re doing with POWER9 and beyond, and some of it will be about the next wave of computing. I am glad you noted that while I divested of the manufacturing business, I’m still doing the design. I’m doing with the partners, so they have to stab what I designed. I have to do within their parameters. And then I package it up into our servers and I deliver it in mainframes and in power systems for our clients of today, and hopefully for Linux hyperscale computing centers and HPC environments tomorrow. Steve Milunovich Great. Well, Tom, thank you so much for being with us and providing flash lights and idea. Tom Rosamilia Yes. Thank you, Steve. I appreciate it.

      "text": "Markets Today IBM's Rometty Tells Trump Company Supports His Plans for Tax Reform Early in 2017 IBM's Ginny Rometty shared her ideas for Donald Trump's presidency in an open letter to him on Tuesday afternoon. Emily Stewart Nov15,20163:51PMEST \nCorrects amount of IBM's cash and marketable securities to $10 billion in the U.S. and overseas from $61 billion. \nIBM's ( IBM ) Virginia Rometty told Donald Trump that her company will support the efforts of a Trump administration and Congress to pass tax reform early in 2017, in an open letter to him published on Tuesday afternoon. \nThe 59-year-old chief executive penned a letter to the president-elect congratulating him on his victory and laying out ideas she believes \"will help achieve the aspiration [he] articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change.\" She outlined her thoughts on a litany of issues, ranging from job creation to healthcare, tax reform and veterans, offering up her suggestions as \"ways we can work together to achieve prosperity that is broadly shared in our society.\" \nMany of the issues addressed by Rometty's line up with IBM's stated positions on a variety of political issues. \n\"IBM supports your proposal to make American's tax system more competitive,\" she wrote. Trump has proposed reducing the business tax rate to 15% from 35% and enacting a repatriation holiday for corporations holding assets abroad to bring them back to the United States at a 10% rate. \n\"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system. Your tax reform proposal will free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs.\" \nIBM has about $10 billion in total cash and marketable securities combined in the U.S. and overseas as of September and does not break out how much of that amount is held abroad. \nRometty called for \"new collar\" jobs, citing vocational education as a viable area about which she believes her company and Trump agree. IBM has pushed for six-year public high schools that combine traditional education with community college, mentoring and real-world experience. They have opened 100 such schools across the country. \nTrump on the campaign trail did not provide an enormous amount of detail on his plans for education. He has adopted traditional Republican talking points like school choice and has suggested he would seek to eliminate the Department of Education. \nHis campaign website promises he will \"ensure that the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year college or to pursue a trade or skill through vocational educational \"will be easier to access, pay for, and finish.\" \nRometty also outlined her thoughts on healthcare, reiterating a number of ideas IBM put forth in 2009 on reforms it says will help America save over $900 billion over the course of a decade. The suggestions include the use of data analytics to reduce fraudulent Medicare claims, improving the exchange of information among providers and leveraging government purchasing power to lower drug costs. \nOne issue to go unmentioned in Rometty's letter is trade, or, more specifically, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. IBM strongly supports the deal, while Trump spoke out vehemently against it over the course of his campaign. \nMany expect Trump to drop out of the agreement in the early days of his administration . \nIBM was among a number of companies Trump hit on the campaign trail for shipping jobs overseas. He accused the company of laying off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moving their jobs to India at a Minnesota rally just a day before the election. He made similar attacks against Ford ( F ) , Apple ( AAPL ) and General Motors ( GM ) , among others. \nIBM spent $4.6 million on federal lobbying in 2015 -- lower than some other tech giants -- and does not have a super PAC. According to its corporate policies, it does not make any contributions to political parties, candidates or PACs. Federal Election Commission filings do not show donation records for Rometty. \nAccording to campaign finance tracker OpenSecrets, IBM employees made more than $700,000 in political contributions during the 2016 election cycle. The company's lobbying expenses have hit $3.2 million this year. If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "Contact(s) information \nSingapore - 15 Nov 2016: Consumers and banks alike are increasingly turning to FinTechs for some of the most disruptive financial solutions in the market today. To support FinTechs worldwide, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced new developer tools, technology, training and programs to share financial services expertise. FinTechs are moving to create new approaches in payments, lending and new uses cases for blockchain such as Know Your Customer and Trade Finance. IBM is helping FinTechs envision, build and monetize their new solutions. “As banks look to partner with FinTechs, IBM provides deep financial services industry expertise, the right technology and an ecosystem to help drive collaboration between them,” said Bob Lord, Chief Digital Officer, IBM. “Our Bluemix cloud platform provides developers access to IBM Watson cognitive APIs, blockchain, data analytics and hosting services to help generate new revenue streams.”\nIBM’s cloud and blockchain ecosystem helps FinTechs, start-ups, developers and independent software vendors drive design and development. In support, the IBM Learning Lab , which features more than 100 curated online courses and uses cases covering a range of technical areas from providers like Codecademy, Big Data University, DeveloperWorks, Udemy and Udacity, today released a new repository of fintech and blockchain courses and use cases for developers and business analysts. In the areas of Blockchain and fintech, the courses and use cases are offered in conjunction with FutureLearn, Fintech School and the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. Additionally, earlier this month, at the first IBM Watson Developer Conference, IBM announced a partnership with Topcoder , the premier global software development community comprised of more than one million designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers, to advance learning opportunities for cognitive developers who are looking to harness the power of Watson to create the next generation of artificial intelligence apps, APIs and solutions. \nEigencat, a Singapore-based startup, is using Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform, to deliver digital investment solutions for the financial market. The FinTech startup is also using IBM Cloud to develop new cognitive-based investment solutions using Watson APIs and broaden its reach within and outside Singapore. IBM’s network of Bluemix Garages serves as a hub where entrepreneurs, developers, designers and industry experts can come together to build on Bluemix. For example, working with the Singapore Bluemix Garage, start-up FreshTurf is creating an innovative blockchain-based network of storage lockers for shipping and parcel delivery throughout Singapore. \nTo help FinTechs adopt blockchain using the Hyperledger Fabric , IBM also announced a set of new offerings aimed at blockchain developers. These include the Blockchain Starter Plan on Bluemix which helps developers build and test a blockchain network in one click. Worldwide Distribution of the Hyperledger Fabric on Docker Hub provides a tested and certified image of the Hyperledger Fabric on an environment of their choice, including their laptop or public or private cloud. The High Security Business Network supports industries with sensitive data and security requirements with security powered by IBM LinuxONE technology. Singapore FinTech startup KYCK! is also working in the Singapore Bluemix Garage to use these services to help build a new solution on IBM Cloud which provides a view into customer identity. Additionally, the technology innovation group within one of Thailand’s largest banks , Kasikornbank Public Company Limited (KBank), is also working with IBM to build a new blockchain network designed to help simplify procedures for the bank's corporate credit business, with the goal of enabling KBank to fast-track traditionally lengthy procedures such as Letters of Guarantee for clients. IBM is rapidly expanding its blockchain consulting services and capabilities and actively working with clients to understand what it takes to make blockchain ready for business. Through its open source contributions and resources for blockchain software developers, IBM is advancing the adoption of blockchain, with an eye to removing complexity, and making it more accessible and open. Financial services, supply chains, IoT, risk management, digital rights management and healthcare are some of the areas that are poised for dramatic change using blockchain networks. \nFor more information about IBM Blockchain, visit http://www.ibm.com/blockchain .

      "title": "What Can Modern Watson Do?",
      "text": "View Blog \nSummary: IBM’s Watson as it exists today is as close as we’ve come to a single integrated platform for AI. It contains all the capabilities for image and video, natural language speech and text input and output, and the most comprehensive knowledge recovery module yet combined together. If you want to exploit the advances we’ve made in AI you need to understand where Watson is today and where it’s heading. \n\nRecently we wrote about how the ‘popular’ Watson of Jeopardy fame still lingers in the memories of our non-data scientist colleagues and perhaps misleads them about the capabilities of AI. But that’s the Watson of 2011, a virtual eon ago in DS time, especially with the leaps-and-bounds progress in AI. It’s time we got in tune with the modern Watson, or more correctly IBM’s Watson Group and its Watson platform and took a look at all there is to offer. \n\nThree Capabilities of AI (Cognitive Computing) \nFirst let’s review. There are three broad capabilities in today’s AI and they are: \nImage and video processing: Largely driven by Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) this field has been getting most of the press with capabilities like facial and object recognition. \nText and speech processing: This is generally known as Natural Language Processing (NLP), the capability to not only intake speech and text but to understand the nuanced context of strings of words, to perform search or translation on them, and output words and blocks of text and speech. Siri, Alexa, and Cortana represent examples of this field that used to be the butt of jokes but are now more than commercially acceptable. This field has been largely driven by Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs). \nKnowledge Retrieval: This field is a combination of search and Question Answering Machines (QAMs like Watson). It’s almost not fair to put these in the same category since the standards for search are only to return a list of possible sources in which the answer may be found. A QAM is required to return the single most likely answer while interpreting the context and nuance of the speech or text input. Watson at its historical core is a QAM and this is still its strong suit. \nSearch can rely on a variety of older techniques associated with much more simple routines. For the most part these don’t qualify for what we think of as AI but they’re included here since they are a major form of output from our virtual AI assistants like SIRI. Still there is a crossover area between simple search (what year was George Washington born) versus the much more complex capabilities of QAMs (given these symptoms, identify the best course of medical treatment). \n\nKnowledge Retrieval QAMs are Quite Complex \nWatson and QAMs in general have not received nearly as much press as the other two capabilities which really fails to recognize the sophistication of what’s going on here . QAMs rely on three capabilities : Natural language processing to understand the complexities of human communication both as a means of user input, as the basis for its more sophisticated search, and of course as output. Hypothesis generation and evaluation. QAMs create many hypotheses from the input language then search the knowledge base to find potential matches for each. By applying advanced analytics to weight and evaluate a number of potential responses based on only relevant evidence they arrive at a single conclusion. Evidence-based learning based on outcomes to get smarter with each iteration and interaction. \nCombining these three areas, image processing , text and speech processing , and knowledge retrieval we get the eyes, ears, mouth, and memory content that represent what AI is today. Given this anthropomorphic description, it’s no wonder that many people believe a more accurate descriptor is ‘Cognitive Computing’. \nThe reason for this lengthy preamble is that while all three of these major component areas have been moving forward at a rapid pace, we haven’t till now seen the introduction of a comprehensive AI platform where the best of all of these can be found in a single place. There is an arms race going on here and all the majors are moving to become the ‘one place’ for AI. In fact, in an effort to win over developers and grow their ecosystems, as of just the last year much of this capability is now open source. \n\nWatson as Comprehensive AI Platform \nBy early 2014 IBM had seen the writing on the wall and had established The Watson Group as a separate business within IBM. IBM CEO Virginia Rometty says this is a major battleground that IBM must win. \nMoving quickly, IBM’s Watson Group led with a series of products to appeal to its enterprise partners and by mid-2015 had added a very large list of cloud based APIs and developer SDKs to encourage the largest possible group of outside developers. \nDavid Schubmehl, an analyst at IDC compares IBMs new playbook in AI with Microsoft's Windows in personal computing and Google's Android OS in mobile. \"IBM is trying to do the same thing with Watson,\" he said, \"open up a platform, make it available for others, and democratize the technology.\" \n\nHere’s What You Can Find in Watson Today \nProducts for Enterprise End Users \n\nWatson Virtual Agent \nThis bot is intended to supplement or replace many of your CSRs and perhaps even with better quality responses and higher customer satisfaction. It’s not limited to CSR activities but could be used in any customer interactive service and has text or conversational speech inputs and outputs. There are onboard analytics that help to analyze trends in customer concerns and evaluate satisfaction with the interaction. IBM has even pre-trained several packages for specific industry use so the need for additional customization is limited. \nWatson Explorer \nNot ready to have your customers handled directly by AI? Explorer is intended to quickly bring together a 360 degree view of the customer or prospect plus recommended solutions based on its analytics. CSRs who spend much time trying to access information, or particularly sales and marketing staff interacting with customers are targets for this more internally focused product. Financial services, investment advisors, and insurance companies are good examples of the target market. \nWatson Analytics \nThis is IBMs shot at Citizen Data Scientists and offers automated data prep, modeling, and data visualization. From my quick tour it looks like the modeling is limited to which variables are most likely to affect outcome but that’s a good place for analysts to start. There’s a free version and two expanded versions with greater input capabilities and these premium versions also include Twitter data. \nWatson Analytics will also suggest questions that might be answered by the data you load so this is a guided process. There’s a separate version called Watson Analytics for Social Media that provides access to a much wider range of social media input. This won’t produce sophisticated predictive models that can be implemented in operating systems but it will let individual users explore statistical inference and sentiment analysis from social media in an extremely easy and non-technical format. \nWatson Knowledge Studio \nThis is the enterprise in-house version of the developer APIs and SDKs below that allow significant customization of the Watson enterprise products. \nWatson Customized for Specific Industries or Processes \nThere are a large number of offerings that combine elements of Virtual Agent, Explorer, and Analytics into packages targeting specific industries or processes: Commerce",

      "title": "IBM, Slack, Watson and the Era of Cognitive Computing",
      "text": "IBM, Slack, Watson and the Era of Cognitive Computing Written by Nikos Vaggalis Monday, 14 November 2016 \nThere's a new chapter in the ongoing \"Adventures of Watson\" which introduces a new character and partner to Watson, going by the name of the Slack Chatbot. \nIt's no secret that IBM considers Watson as its flagship product and is placing all bets on its success. After ensuring its maturity as an end product by outperforming human contenders in the US TV game show Jeopardy and aiding in situations like cancer research, IBM's now looks in expanding Watson's reach into as many practical applications as possible, as demonstrated by its latest $200 million investment in Watson's German IoT headquarters in a move to expand both research as well as client base.So given the recent rise of Cognitive Computing, the partnership in which Watson is to power up Slack's chatbot should come as no surprise. \nCognitive Computing is another field of computing in which software starts to perceive the world through learning and experience, just like humans do. As such natural language processing lies at the core of this rising trend, assuming the form of an API available through the Cloud computing platforms and accessible to third parties looking to enhance their applications with advanced cognitive capabilities and AI assistance. \nThe kind of APIs found on IBM's Developer Cloud, range from Language Translation to Natural Language Classification, and Speech to Text transformation to Data analysis. The functionality required for Slack's chat bot, lies encapsulated in the newly introduced Watson Conversation API. \nDevelopers plugging into this API can automate spoken or textual interactions between human operators and software applications through the use of natural language. \nCommunicating with machines in a humanly familiar way is an increasing requirement and is met in all sorts of applications, ranging from consumer targeted ones, like Lucida's personal intelligent assistant and Chef Watson's menu suggestions, to ALPHA's military grade AI enabled wingmen . This video nicely explains Conversation's usage: \nIn this demo a human operator is put in the driver's seat of a car's simulator to command the car in textual natural language format. The car not only responds to commands such as 'turn the wind-shield wipers on' and 'turn your lights on' commands, but also engages the driver in a conversation, making him aware of his command's outcome. \nThe good thing with this kind of AI is that despite it utilizing familiar algorithms, it can be nevertheless trained in a vast variety of requirements and scenarios. So Watson's responding to a driver's most frequent requests doesn't get into the way of Conversation's neural network model in getting trained in, say, customer service scenarios. In Slack's case it is trained to interact with a Business's workforce, looking to propel productivity in the workplace. \nIn such a use case, a manager while Slack-chatting with his colleagues, assigns a co-talker the task of travelling to Paris for attending a convention. Without having to leave Slack's interface, that lucky someone, treats Watson as a real assistant and asks: \nW atson what’s the weather in Paris? \ngetting the appropriate response back. \nThis kind of integration adds to an impressive stack of Slack's B2B integration, hooks that already cover a wide range of needs a business' workforce may have, such as seamless access to GitHub or Mailchimp. \nTo get started with Conversation, you’ll need a cloud Bluemix account, which is free to begin with. After signing in you have to navigate to the 'Watson services' , and select the 'Conversation' option. After that you'll be presented with the GUI IDE that you work in for configuring the environment, training the model and implementing the dialogs and intents that Conversation will use in your application. \nIn general terms, the process of utilizing the service can be summarized in the following steps: First, build the user interface that users will use to interact with your application.This can be anything from a simple chat window or a mobile app to a robot with a voice interface or a chatbot communicating through a third-party service such as Slack, Twitter, or Facebook. The application gathers the natural-language user input and sends it to an instance of the Conversation service in the IBM Cloud. The conversation service interprets the user input, directs the flow of the conversation and gathers any information necessary for satisfying the user's intent. The application can also optionally use additional Watson services, such as Tone Analyzer or Speech to Text, to analyze user input. Based on the user's intent and the gathered information, the application interacts with your back-end systems to carry out the requested actions: answering questions, opening problem tickets, updating customer information, placing orders, or anything else that you want it to support. \nAll communication between your application and the Conversation API happens through JSON payloads that travel back and forth in the asking and responding phases. \n\n\nSlackbot's use of the Conversation API marks the beginning of a tight co-operation with IBM in developing advanced cognitive offerings that will firmly establish Slack as a prime platform for business operation. \nAt the end of the day, we should start getting used to frequent news of IBM forming new partnerships as it is through such alliances that cognitive computing's pursuit of the seamless human-computer interaction will be pushed forward, just as the How Will AI Transform Life By 2030? report largely anticipated. \nIBM is also extending cognitive computing to hobbyists and enthusiasts as demonstrated with TJBot - Using Raspberry Pi With Watson .",

      "text": "Select a topic or year \nSingapore - 15 Nov 2016: \nConsumers and banks alike are increasingly turning to FinTechs for some of the most disruptive financial solutions in the market today. To support FinTechs worldwide, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced new developer tools, technology, training and programs to share financial services expertise. FinTechs are moving to create new approaches in payments, lending and new uses cases for blockchain such as Know Your Customer and Trade Finance. IBM is helping FinTechs envision, build and monetize their new solutions. \n“ As banks look to partner with FinTechs, IBM provides deep financial services industry expertise, the right technology and an ecosystem to help drive collaboration between them, ” said Bob Lord, Chief Digital Officer, IBM. “Our Bluemix cloud platform provides developers access to IBM Watson cognitive APIs, blockchain, data analytics and hosting services to help generate new revenue streams.” \nIBM’s cloud and blockchain ecosystem helps FinTechs, start-ups, developers and independent software vendors drive design and development. In support, the IBM Learning Lab , which features more than 100 curated online courses and uses cases covering a range of technical areas from providers like Codecademy, Big Data University, DeveloperWorks, Udemy and Udacity, today released a new repository of fintech and blockchain courses and use cases for developers and business analysts. In the areas of Blockchain and fintech, the courses and use cases are offered in conjunction with FutureLearn, Fintech School and the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. Additionally, earlier this month, at the first IBM Watson Developer Conference, IBM announced a partnership with Topcoder , the premier global software development community comprised of more than one million designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers, to advance learning opportunities for cognitive developers who are looking to harness the power of Watson to create the next generation of artificial intelligence apps, APIs and solutions. \nEigencat, a Singapore-based startup, is using Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform, to deliver digital investment solutions for the financial market. The FinTech startup is also using IBM Cloud to develop new cognitive-based investment solutions using Watson APIs and broaden its reach within and outside Singapore. \nIBM’s network of Bluemix Garages serves as a hub where entrepreneurs, developers, designers and industry experts can come together to build on Bluemix. For example, working with the Singapore Bluemix Garage, start-up FreshTurf is creating an innovative blockchain-based network of storage lockers for shipping and parcel delivery throughout Singapore. \nTo help FinTechs adopt blockchain using the Hyperledger Fabric , IBM also announced a set of new offerings aimed at blockchain developers. These include the Blockchain Starter Plan on Bluemix which helps developers build and test a blockchain network in one click. Worldwide Distribution of the Hyperledger Fabric on Docker Hub provides a tested and certified image of the Hyperledger Fabric on an environment of their choice, including their laptop or public or private cloud. The High Security Business Network supports industries with sensitive data and security requirements with security powered by IBM LinuxONE technology. \nSingapore FinTech startup KYCK! is also working in the Singapore Bluemix Garage to use these services to help build a new solution on IBM Cloud which provides a view into customer identity. Additionally, the technology innovation group within one of Thailand’s largest banks , Kasikornbank Public Company Limited (KBank), is also working with IBM to build a new blockchain network designed to help simplify procedures for the bank's corporate credit business, with the goal of enabling KBank to fast-track traditionally lengthy procedures such as Letters of Guarantee for clients. \nIBM is rapidly expanding its blockchain consulting services and capabilities and actively working with clients to understand what it takes to make blockchain ready for business. Through its open source contributions and resources for blockchain software developers, IBM is advancing the adoption of blockchain, with an eye to removing complexity, and making it more accessible and open. Financial services, supply chains, IoT, risk management, digital rights management and healthcare are some of the areas that are poised for dramatic change using blockchain networks.

      "text": "IBM CEO in Letter to Trump Addresses Jobs, Health Care November 16, 2016, 04:56:  Rachael King \nInternational Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump outlining her recommendations on health care, infrastructure spending and other issues. \nThe letter is her first comment on the prospect of a Trump administration since Mr. Trump, shortly before the election, criticized IBM and other companies for shifting U.S. jobs overseas. \nThe Donald J. Trump for President organization didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. \nSilicon Valley generally has viewed Mr. Trump's victory as a blow to the tech industry, as the president-elect has been a critic of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as well as IBM. \nAmong other technology executives, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered Mr. Trump congratulations in a message on Twitter, as did Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, while Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella posted a congratulatory message on LinkedIn , with a link to a longer blog post by the company's president and chief legal officer. \nMr. Trump, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, said IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. Mr. Trump also called out Ford for laying off 794 workers in St. Paul and MoneyGram for laying off 408 workers and moving those jobs overseas. \n\"If a company wants to leave Minnesota, fire their workers and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States...we will make them pay a 35% tax,\" he said. \nThe letter offers support for another of Mr. Trump's proposals, to end tax-code incentives for businesses to keep their overseas earnings out of the country. \"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system, \" Ms. Rometty wrote. \nThe change would \"free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs,\" the letter continues. \nIBM in 2015 spent more than half its annual $5.4 billion annual research and development budget in the U.S. \nIBM also supports Mr. Trump's proposed investment in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities, Ms. Rometty wrote, adding that the infrastructure's performance would benefit by the inclusion of networked sensors and artificial intelligence, technologies that IBM offers. \nSimilarly, Ms. Rometty in her letter suggested reducing health-care costs through the use of information technology and data analytics. IBM said it operates one of the largest employer-sponsored health plans in the U.S. Health-care costs could be reduced by analyzing data to detect fraudulent Medicare claims, she wrote, citing a 2009 IBM position paper. \nMs. Rometty's letter also called for giving veterans the best health care possible. IBM recently announced a pilot program to help Department of Veterans Affairs oncologists treat 10,000 veterans using genomic analysis powered by Watson, the company's artificial-intelligence computing system. \nWrite to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com  160456ET   This article appears in: Politics",

      "text": "Comments \nThis company behind the Jeopardy! -winning computer, Watson, is now establishing itself in the adaptive and personalized learning markets. \nWhat is IBM? \nThe company is partnering with a small number of hardware and software providers to bring the same technology that won a special edition of the game show back in 2011 to K-12 institutions, colleges and continuing education providers. The partnerships and the products that might emerge from them are still in the planning stage, but the company is investing in the idea that cognitive computing -- natural language processing, informational retrieval and other functions similar to the ones performed by the human brain -- can help students succeed in and outside the classroom. \nChalapathy Neti, vice president of education innovation at IBM Watson, said education is undergoing the same “digital transformation” seen in the finance and health care sectors, in which more and more content is being delivered digitally. \n“By virtue of conducting a process [digitally], you can capture data about that process in ways we were not able to capture before,” Neti said in an interview. The data, he added, can benefit advisers and faculty members when they’re helping students make decisions about their education, or students themselves as they progress through their course work. \nIBM has been out of the personal computer market for more than a decade, and just as you no longer see any laptops branded with the “Big Blue” logo, the company won’t be releasing its own adaptive learning platform or learning management system. Instead, IBM is working with major companies to bring its technology to market. \nIn higher education, IBM is at the moment working with Blackboard and Pearson on student retention and tutoring, respectively. Both education companies are this fall beginning to test a handful of early prototypes, exploring potential use cases and working with clients to learn what sort of software they are interested in. \nPearson is testing what Angie McAllister, senior vice president of personalized learning and analytics, described as an “intelligent tutoring system.” As one of the major course material publishers in the market, Pearson controls a wealth of content, and it is testing IBM’s technology as a way to offer one-on-one tutoring using artificial intelligence. \nIBM is steering clear of referring to its technology as “artificial intelligence,” however, as some may interpret it as replacing what humans already do. \n“This is about augmenting human intelligence,” Neti said. “We never want to see these data-based systems as primary decision makers, but we want to provide them as decision assistance for a human decision maker that is an expert in conducting that process.” \nSpeaking to Inside Higher Ed during last month’s Educause Annual Conference, McAllister outlined three use cases Pearson is exploring. For example, Watson technology could power a virtual assistant similar to Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, which students could chat with if they need help while studying. Watson could also help students if they are taking a quiz online, detecting if they are stumped by a particular question and suggesting course content that might help them progress. Additionally, Pearson may look at integrating Watson technology in study guides. \nMcAllister said Pearson isn’t prepared to say when those prototypes might reach the market, but added that the company will spend the next six months to determine what use cases, if any, to develop further. \n“Digital learning opens up exciting new possibilities to improve access and outcomes in education,” Tim Bozik, president of global product at Pearson, added in a statement. “Our partnership will use the power of Watson to help students stay engaged and deepen their learning, complete their degree and be better equipped for their careers. Teachers are the most important factor in delivering a great education. The partnership will support teachers by providing better digital tools and enabling personalized learning for their students.” \nWhile Pearson is mainly focusing on students, Blackboard is working on tools for advisers and faculty members, said Katie Blot, the company’s chief strategy officer. \n“We’re very focused on student pathways, support and persistence,” Blot said in an interview. She highlighted Planner, a student planning tool, as one potential Blackboard product that could benefit from Watson technology. \n“We have tools that … help students make decisions about where to go next with their academic journey,” Blot said. “Then we can give that data to advisers to help them optimize their time. That’s an area we’re really excited about.” \nAccording to Blackboard’s tentative timeline, the company plans to settle on use cases within the next month and a half and make beta versions available to a small group of early adopters next fall. Whatever products come out of the development could see a wider launch in 2018, Blot said. \nNeti said Blackboard and Pearson are the first of IBM’s partners in higher education, and that the company intends to build an “ecosystem of partners” in the future. IBM is also partnering with companies such as Apple, Office Depot, Sesame Workshop (the nonprofit behind Sesame Street ) and Udacity at other levels of education. \n“We are now out of the gate with the biggest players,” Neti said. “With our platform, we can accelerate the digital transformation.” Read more by",

      "text": "Marcus Aurelius : timujin: IBM fell into a classic trapTheir trap was thinking hardware was more meaningful than software.Software rules. They thought they had a killer OS, too (OS/2, hah), but without a strong userbase it wasn't feasible to compete with a company like Microsoft, so their software not only eventually lagged behind Windows, it wasn't sufficiently differentiated to give any reason to stay with it. Basically they did what Apple did, but Apple carved out a segment of the market and designed their hardware and software for it. IBM tried to carve out a segment of the market that was already taken without presenting a compelling use case and without sufficient resources to keep up with their competition.They did learn the lesson on software and bought Lotus, but it was too late, by then the PS/2 was gone and their stuff ran on Windows just as well as on OS/2 Warp, so that went away, too.",

      "text": "By Carl Straumsheim, In higher education \nIBM is at the moment working with Blackboard and Pearson on student retention and tutoring, respectively. Both education companies are this fall beginning to test a handful of early prototypes, exploring potential use cases and working with clients to learn what sort of software they are interested in. “This is about augmenting human intelligence,” Neti said. “We never want to see these data-based systems as primary decision makers, but we want to provide them as decision assistance for a human decision maker that is an expert in conducting that process.” For example, Watson technology could power a virtual assistant similar to Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, which students could chat with if they need help while studying. Blackboard is working on tools for advisers and faculty members, said Katie Blot, chief strategy officer. “We’re very focused on student pathways, support and persistence.” She highlighted Planner, a student planning tool, as one product that could benefit from Watson technology.\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/16/blackboard-pearson-join-ibms-ecosystem-bring-watson-technology-higher-ed \nShare on Facebook ",

Finnish companies and healthcare professionals get access to the cognitive and analysis powers of Watson, while IBM gains data and partnerships to further develop its platform. \n“We wanted to bring this kind of major global player to Finland in a more significant way, so its artificial intelligence and cognitive solutions can be used to enhance our healthcare economy,” Anssi Pulkkinen, strategic head of health and well-being at Tekes , told Computer Weekly. \nIBM is investing in Finland. It is planning to set up Watson Health centres of expertise and innovation in Finland, as well as the tech giant’s first national imaging centre outside the US. These centres are expected to employ 150 people in the next few years. \nThe Watson Health centre of excellence will be the first to open its doors in early 2017, at IBM Finland’s headquarters in Helsinki, while the imaging centre is scheduled to launch later in the year. \n“Watson and Watson Health are very new units for IBM globally. It has not had representation in Finland before, so we have been dependent on global expertise. These centres will have experts trained here,” said Mirva Antila, deputy country manager at IBM Finland . “The Watson Health centre of excellence will be the first one in the Nordics and also serve our customers in Europe.” The call of health data \nThe one key ingredient all artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing systems, such as Watson, need to learn and evolve with is data. And it is data that caught IBM’s interest in Finland. \n“Finland has many characteristics that make it unique,” said Antila. “For example, all healthcare and patient data has been digitised in Finland for the past 30 years. Although it is currently dispersed and not in efficient use, it is already in digital format.” \nThe Nordic country has national electronic health records, biobanks and a cancer registry database of all cases in the country dating back to 1953. There is also the national health data archive, Kanta, which covers electronic prescriptions, patient data repository and the citizens’ health data service for the country’s 5.5 million inhabitants. \nThe presence of data does not mean it is easily available, and Finland is working to make its health data more accessible. The country is planning new, more permissive legislation for the secondary use of data on well-being and health. Its upcoming genome centre is tasked with creating a national genome database and facilitating its use in clinical care and research. Predicting illness \nThese advances in the foundations for digital healthcare are important, as Finnish health professionals, researchers and companies seek to develop data-driven healthcare applications and services. IBM is already working with several partners, from startups to universities, to test the use of cognitive computing in improving healthcare. \nKey among them is the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS), a joint authority covering 24 municipalities, which is planning three pilot projects to trial Watson Health’s cognitive and data analysis skills in predicting health issues. \nThese include the early identification of serious bacterial infections in prematurely born babies and using imaging data to detect a specific type of cerebral hemorrhage. HUS is also employing cognitive computing in oncology to help provide patients with more personalised cancer care. Read more about IT in healthcare With a per capita healthcare spend already the highest in the world, Norway is facing a healthcare crisis as its population is increasingly dominated by elderly people. A health authority in Norway is using technology to help patients understand their conditions and make better decisions. IBM has created a business unit to develop Watson cognitive computing to support healthcare apps written for the Apple Watch. \n“We have chosen these because bacterial infections in prematurely born babies and cerebral hemorrhages are the type of conditions where there is a lot of data, and if that could help us to diagnose these conditions even a few hours earlier, it could have a significant effect on the patient’s prognosis,” Visa Honkanen, director of strategic development at HUS , told Computer Weekly . \nIf the pilot results are encouraging, HUS aims to expand the projects to combine cognitive computing with genetic information and Finnish health data to further improve the diagnostics of specific illnesses. \n“When machine intelligence is taught, you first have to create a model it can use to predict certain situations. When that model is then applied in real situations with new data, we really see if it is beneficial and what it can offer us,” added Honkanen. “If the model works, AI should learn to improve its predictions.” Hospitals without a hospital \nIBM, Tekes and HUS all believe artificial intelligence will play a major role in the future of healthcare. It is anticipated to support the detection and diagnosis of diseases, as well as enable more personalised healthcare as the amount of health, patient and research data rapidly grows. \n“Machine learning will be very beneficial, particularly if you have a large number of sensors collecting high amounts of data that no human can analyse in a reasonable way, said Honkanen. “A machine can do the pre-filtering and analysis of this data, and give red flags before a human brain gets involved. However, the idea of AI becoming a diagnostic detective that solves problems no one else can is still far away compared to the human brain.” \nOne future vision Tekes advocates is a hospital without a hospital, currently given the working title of “IoT hospital”. This refers to the compliant and efficient use of health data combined with digital technologies and monitoring, enabling treatment at home while keeping hospital visits to a bare minimum. \nBut making this vision a reality requires more innovation in digital healthcare, and this is what Tekes believes its partnership with IBM will help Finnish companies achieve. \n“When Finnish companies start to solve healthcare problems in collaboration with companies such as IBM, it leads to solutions that have never been seen before,” said Tekes’ Pulkkinen. “We want to achieve systemic benefits for patients and the national economy.” CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

      "title": "IBM CEO Offers Donald Trump Advice",
      "text": "IBM CEO Offers Donald Trump Advice  35:  \nInternational Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to President-elect Donald Trump outlining her recommendations on health care, infrastructure spending and other issues. \nThe letter is her first comment on the prospect of a Trump administration since Mr. Trump, shortly before the election, criticized IBM and other companies for shifting U.S. jobs overseas. \nThe letter offers support for some of Mr. Trump's policies and advice on national issues—adding along the way that IBM is the largest technology employer in the U.S. Last year IBM hired more U.S. employees than in the five years prior, the letter said, and it has thousands of open positions. \nSilicon Valley generally has viewed Mr. Trump's victory as a blow to the tech industry, as the president-elect has been a critic of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. as well as IBM. \nAmong other technology executives, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered Mr. Trump congratulations in a message on Twitter, as did Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, while Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella posted a congratulatory message on LinkedIn, with a link to a longer blog post by the company's president and chief legal officer. \nMr. Trump, in a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, said IBM had laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. Mr. Trump also called out Ford for laying off 794 workers in St. Paul and MoneyGram for laying off 408 workers and moving those jobs overseas. \n\"If a company wants to leave Minnesota, fire their workers and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States…we will make them pay a 35% tax,\" he said. \nThe letter offers support for another of Mr. Trump's proposals, to end tax-code incentives for businesses to keep their overseas earnings out of the country. \"Many billions of dollars of American companies' earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system,\" Ms. Rometty wrote. \nThe change would \"free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs,\" the letter continues. \nIBM in 2015 spent more than half its annual $5.4 billion annual research and development budget in the U.S. \nIBM also supports Mr. Trump's proposed investment in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings and other public facilities, Ms. Rometty wrote, adding that the infrastructure's performance would benefit by the inclusion of networked sensors and artificial intelligence, technologies that IBM offers. \nSimilarly, Ms. Rometty in her letter suggested reducing health-care costs through the use of information technology and data analytics. IBM said it operates one of the largest employer-sponsored health plans in the U.S. Health-care costs could be reduced by analyzing data to detect fraudulent Medicare claims, she wrote, citing a 2009 IBM position paper. \nMs. Rometty's letter also called for giving veterans the best health care possible. IBM recently announced a pilot program to help Department of Veterans Affairs oncologists treat 10,000 veterans using genomic analysis powered by Watson, the company's artificial-intelligence computing system. \nWrite to Rachael King at rachael.king@wsj.com  160835ET   This article appears in: Politics",

      "text": "Raspberry Pi, IBM cognitive computing bring UK dinosaurs to life November 16th, 2016 at 12:56 pm - Author Jon Martindale \nThe Blackgang Chine is the UK’s oldest amusement park and lately, it’s started to show. IBM research lead Andy Stanford Clark answered a call for help online and offered to give the park’s animatronic Dinosaurs a hardware make over. He used Raspberry Pi micro-computers and IBM’s cognitive computing platform to make them much smarter and more interactive. \nTraditionally the dinosaurs at Blackgang Chine , located on the south coast of the Isle of White, had a simple set of pre-defined movements. The park’s owner, Alexander Dabell, wanted to make them a little more exciting and so put out the dinosaur-shaped bat signal online. Andy Clark took him up on the challenge and brought his expertise, as well as IBM systems to bear and upgraded the entire system. \nWith Raspberry Pi systems in place, much more complex pre-programmed routines of movements have been created, giving the dinosaurs more complicated actions. On top of that, the platform makes use of IBM’s cognitive computing systems, which allow the dinosaurs to react to stimulus from the environment, as well as improve over time using machine learning. \nThis also comes into play with the environments the dinosaurs are in. Using the much more aware computational system, the park can better time the use of noises, or the way lighting and smoke machines are used to create a better atmosphere. \nThere are practical benefits too though. With the more connected system in place, Blackgang’s system can send out warnings to park workers if something needs fixing. And in the case of the long necked dinosaur animatronics, they can be sent weather warnings to get out there and put a neck brace on to protect them. \nDiscuss on our Facebook page, HERE . \nKitGuru Says: Any time someone is making animatronic dinosaurs more impressive, I get excited. I still love a good robo-Rex.",

      "text": "Categorized: Mobile \nYou may know IBM as an old-school monolithic, institutional giant, but newsflash: IBM is now a giant capable of extreme athleticism, flexibility and efficiency. \nNowhere is that more clear than in the cloud-delivered mobile services space. Mobile applications are the de facto force in the cloud enterprise. Smart executives will place an emphasis on shaping the enterprise using mobile projects as the tip of the spear. \nWhy does that make IBM a top player in the mobile marketplace? \nIBM uses the full depth and breadth of it massive capabilities to provide the most comprehensive suite of services on the market. IBM has adapted to learning from the market and allowing its employees to give the market what it wants. It offers front- to back-end technologies, with built-in analytics and cognitive services on an open source cloud platform, capable of full mobility and API functionality on an unmatched scale. \nHow can I say this with such assurance? “The Forrester Wave: Mobile Development Platforms, Q4 2016,” Forrester Research Inc., 24 October 2016, listed IBM as a leader in its evaluation, stating, “the MobileFirst Foundation on-premises offering was once the most full-featured of IBM’s solutions, but the Bluemix cloud solution is now functionally equivalent, driving IBM’s move to the Leaders category.” \nIBM has pivoted and shifted to the cloud, and it has done so without a great deal of fanfare. More than 5,000 mobile transformation clients have made the leap, thanks to its suite of services. \nAccording to the Forrester report, app developers and delivery professionals “seek development speed, mobile client accelerators, and data normalization.” Likewise, “data acquisition, analytics and future experience support are key differentiators.” \nThe IBM MDP platform does those things by flipping the switch and turning it on. This is where the long experience and size of IBM benefit the customer. \nIBM has developed its cloud platform such that is not only open source, but so functionally capable that mobile development, data acquisition, and analytics tools can be added to an MDP by simply dragging it to the development or production environment. \nThere are two types of customers in the MDP space: those that want an all-inclusive platform and those that enjoy managing disparate services. IBM offerings are so robust and feature rich, that it can support both customer types and still allow innovation to thrive. An IBM client needn’t follow some stock template that forces a customer to do something in a manner they’re not comfortable with. I bet you didn’t expect to hear that from an IBMer, did you? \nDownload a copy of “The Forrester Wave: Mobile Development Platforms, Q4 2016 ” and find out why the IBM MobileFirst Foundation is a leader in its field.",

      "text": "  \nCAMBRIDGE, MA - 16 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Security today announced a major expansion of its incident response capabilities, including new facilities, services and software as part of a $200 million investment made this year. These investments include a new global security headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. which features the industry’s first physical Cyber Range for the commercial sector, where participants experience preparing for and responding to cyber attacks using live malware and real-world scenarios. \nIBM Security today announced a major expansion of its incident response capabilities, including new facilities, services and software as part of a $200 million investment made this year. These investments include a new global security headquarters in Cambridge, which features the industry’s first physical Cyber Range for the commercial sector, where participants experience preparing for and responding to cyber-attacks using live malware and real-world scenarios. (Credit: John Mottern/Feature Photo Service for IBM) IBM also expanded capabilities and capacity for its global network of IBM X-Force Command Centers which now handle over 1 trillion security events per month. These security operations centers are staffed by 1,400   who will use cognitive technologies like Watson for client services, including chat sessions and data delivery, as well as Watson for Cybersecurity to quickly address cyber security events.\nAs part of today’s announcement, IBM launched a new elite incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services (IRIS). IBM’s investments also includes its acquisition of Resilient Systems earlier this year , a pioneer in the incident response market. \nA new Ponemon Institute study on Cyber Resilience, sponsored by IBM and also announced today , found 75   surveyed say their organization does not have a modern   across the entire enterprise. This lack of planning and coordination can make it difficult to respond quickly and contain the costs of an incident. For example, in 2018, companies in the UK must report data breaches to regulators within 72 hours or face fines up to 4 percent of their global annual turnover. \n“Being prepared to respond is the first line of defense in making sure a cyber security incident doesn’t become a crisis,” said Marc van Zadelhoff, General Manager, IBM Security. “To adequately prepare for –and respond to – cyber attacks, companies need to assemble cross-functional teams that bring a strategic mix of security intelligence, technical skill, legal precision and regulatory understanding combined with a comprehensive plan of action. With our investments, we’ve moved IBM into a unique position in the industry with a comprehensive cybersecurity immune system for customers to build world-class capabilities for thwarting cybercrime.” \nIBM X-Force Command Centers and New Cyber Range \nIBM Security’s new headquarters in Cambridge, located at 75 Binney Street, includes a fully operational “Cyber Range,” bringing together capabilities and experiences previously only available in the public sector. IBM’s new X-Force Command Cambridge Cyber Range immerses people in simulated cyber attacks to train them on how properly prepare for, respond to, and manage a broad variety of threats. This experience can be leveraged by Chief Information Security Officers and their security teams, as well as those without security expertise, such as other members of the C-Suite/lines of business, board members, students and others. \nIBM’s Cyber Range uses live malware, ransomware and other real-world hacker tools culled from the dark web to deliver realistic cyber attack experiences. The facility features an air-gapped network of a fictitious corporation, used for simulated attacks, consisting of one petabyte of information, more than 3,000 users and a simulated version of the internet. \nAs part of the Cyber Range experience, IBM has designed real-world scenarios to help clients experience, defend against and shut down cyber attacks. The scenarios will also help train organizations with the necessary steps required to respond quickly in the wake of an incident, from addressing regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and state to state, to client, business partner, media and supply chain notifications and management. \nAs part of today’s announcement, IBM also launched IBM X-Force Command Center Atlanta, a fully upgraded security operations center which IBM has operated for 15 years. The facility now handles over 35 billion security events per day – a 75 percent increase in capacity. \nIBM X-Force Command Center Atlanta is a hub for the company’s network of SOCs, which help protect 4,500 clients across 133 countries. Using IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence, the security operation centers bring in 200,000 new pieces of threat intelligence daily, by leveraging insights from analysis on over 100 million web pages and images, and collecting data from monitoring 270 million endpoints. \nIBM also has expanded its capacity to handle security events and intelligence for IBM X-Force Command Centers in Bangalore and Poland, complemented by previously modernized IBM centers in Costa Rica and Tokyo, creating a scalable global network of defense for clients. \nNew IBM X-Force IRIS Team of Elite Security Consultants \nIBM also launched a new incident response and intelligence consulting team called IBM X-Force IRIS . Led by Wendi Whitmore , Global Lead, IBM X-Force IRIS the team includes over 100 elite cybersecurity consultants positioned throughout the globe, with deep expertise in incident response and threat intelligence. \nWhitmore has built the IBM X-Force IRIS team by bringing together security consultants with a broad spectrum of experience , including those who have led responses to many of the largest cyber security breaches in the past decade. Their response experience has spanned retail, political and international banking networks. Many members of the new team are former security experts at federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies where they built intelligence collection and analysis capabilities which are still in use today. \nThe IBM X-Force IRIS team further expands IBM’s incident response capabilities, building on the services announced in February. The new consulting capabilities, with the incorporation of IBM X-Force intelligence services, will help clients understand where and how cyber attacks are being launched to defend against and remediate them with greater speed and precision. \nWith a focus on preparedness and planning, the IBM X-Force IRIS practice helps clients test their environment, run attack scenarios, and identify key business systems and processes needing stronger security and critical to maintaining resiliency. Through an emphasis on proactive planning, IBM X-Force IRIS can help clients reduce the costs and complications of response, which can help lead to quicker containment of an incident. \nThe IBM X-Force IRIS’s capabilities include: Proactive incident response planning and preparedness training Incident simulation and tabletop exercises, including Red Teaming / Blue Teaming A concurrent approach to containment, remediation and threat intelligence Forensic analysis Threat Intelligence analysis \nBuilds on Resilient Systems’ Pioneering Incident Response Technology \nResilient, an IBM Company, provides a software platform for comprehensive incident response management and orchestration – designed to help   manage and respond to incidents faster and more intelligently. The platform has agile playbooks based on National Institute of Standards and Technology and SANS Institute standards that cover potential threats from a lost laptop to malware attacks. It also has the one of the largest privacy databases with global breach notifications to help clients maintain compliance. This enables clients to mitigate cyber incidents more quickly while helping minimize their exposure. \nResilient Systems’ award-winning platform is a foundational component of IBM’s incident response technologies, along with IBM’s QRadar Security Intelligence. \nFor more information on or to arrange a visit to the IBM X-Force Command Center Cyber visit: http://www.ibm.com/security/xforcecommand . \nJournalists and bloggers can download b-roll and video about IBM X-Force Command Center at http://ibm.newsmarket.com/Global/Latest-News/new-ibm-security-headquarters-in-cambridge-ma-with-industry-s-first-commercial-cyber-range/s/2f75af45-2dde-4777-872a-0b6197407a84 \n     ",
