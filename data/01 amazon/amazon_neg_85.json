      "text": "Amazon Is Launching a Futuristic Grocery Store That Promises No Lines This could be a serious game-changer. Jackson Connor \nOver the course of the last several years, the ways in which Americans purchase their food have changed dramatically thanks to innovations in technology. In 2016, a new start-up seems to pop up every week, pledging increasingly convenient ways to shop, cook, and order takeout from the comfort of one’s home. Still, amid all these advances, the grocery store has remained relative unchanged—that is, until now. \nOn Monday, Amazon released a video detailing plans for its flagship brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle, Washington. Dubbed Amazon Go, the mini-supermarket features aisles of prepared foods and standard, packaged products, but promises to get rid of checkout lines, registers, and basically all human contact. \nAfter checking into the store with their smartphones, customers will be able to peruse the shelves, adding items to both their physical and virtual shopping carts. If a customer changes his or her mind about a product, the item is automatically removed from the shopping carter after being placed back on the shelf. \nExpected to launch in 2017, the 1,800-square-foot store is already being hailed as the grocery store of the future. And while the technology involved in the project seems slightly more complex than ordering a book on Amazon.com, the company does its best to explain the store’s methodology to its prospective customers. \n“We used computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion, much like you’d find in self-driving cars,” the narrator explains. “We call it ‘Just Walk Out Technology.’” \nGot all that? \nDespite the almost laughable complexity of Amazon’s tech jargon, all we really need to know is that supermarket lines are about to be a thing of the past.

      "text": "Dec 5, 2016 2:28 PM Screenshot: Amazon Go promo/YouTube Share Tweet \nCheckout lines aren’t the worst thing in the world. There’s tabloids, gum, and those funny comments cashiers like to make about all the shameful things you’re buying. Still, Amazon is over it. Today, the company unveiled Amazon Go , a new physical store in Seattle where you can buy “grocery essentials,” ready-to-go snacks, and “chef-designed Amazon Meal Kits.” When you’re done shopping, you’re finished. There’s no checkout process. \nIt works like this: Customers check in with the new Amazon Go app, then get to their shopping. Amazon claims that by using “computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning”—the same technologies used in self-driving cars—it can automatically keep track of your items, even ones you pick up, violently shake, and put back on the shelf. Purchases are then charged to your Amazon account. Confused? This video should help. \nThis isn’t Amazon’s first bid at brick-and-mortar shopping, what with the company opening a number of physical bookstores this year in cities like Chicago, Boston, Portland, and Seattle, where they’re headquartered. \nCNN points out the potential of Amazon Go: “By eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.” Don’t rush out yet, though. Only Amazon employees can hit up the Seattle store, though the company has plans to open to the public in early 2017. This might be a good time for your neighborhood grocer to start panicking, however. Cashiers, too. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here",

      "text": "Casey Affleck, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, MIchelle Williams, Matt Damon and Kenneth Lonergan. Photo by Todd Williamson/Getty Images for Amazon Studios \nTruth is, while there are about 6,000 voting Academy members, it can take only 300 or so Oscar votes to get a movie nominated. Hence all the relentless campaigning, which is in full gear, as distributors, foreign countries, and Oscar-whisperers plan and execute relentless rounds of screenings with public appearances — at lunches, Q&A panels, premieres, DVD launch parties, and “holiday” fetes. \nCheck out this slice of the past few days to get a sense of all the wining and dining that goes on. Academy members are being constantly wooed, just like the Hollywood Foreign Press Association who vote on the Golden Globes, with yummy food, drink, music, and celebrities —despite various attempts by the Academy to monitor and limit the scale of all this campaigning. \nOn the animation side, for example, this past week saw a Friday Academy screening of Universal/Illumination’s animated contest musical “Sing,” directed by live-action director Garth Jennings and starring voice-talent charmer Matthew McConaughey, who worked the afterparty at the fancy Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills. Then on Saturday Universal mounted a lavish afternoon premiere at LA Live. There was a post-screening concert with performers including Seth Macfarlane, Tori Kelly, Jennifer Hudson, and Stevie Wonder, who sang classics such as “Sir Duke” and “Superstition” — but oddly enough, not his original song from the film, “Faith.” Under the new Academy guidelines, he wouldn’t have been able perform it at the party the night before. \nTrying to land an Oscar nominated song requires serious promo work, as music branch members are not only sent tracks to listen to but invited to meet the well-known pop artists recruited to participate in the process. \nAlso promoting an Oscar song is Netflix, which hosted a screening and lunch reception at the Four Seasons Hotel on Saturday for teen sexual assault documentary “Audrie & Daisy,” which features the heartbreaking song “Flicker” by Tori Amos, a rape survivor and activist. She was on hand, natch. \nTrying to break into the crowded animated field is the Swiss Oscar entry, Claude Barras’ delightful stop-motion animated film “My Life as a Zucchini,” adapted by Celine Sciamma from Gilles Paris’s coming-of-age novel about a young orphan who finds friends at a boarding school for abandoned kids. After GKids’ screening at the Landmark, Barras let some of us play with his big-headed 10-inch puppets with latex foam hair, silicone arms, resin faces, and hand-sewn clothing, and boxes full of numbered magnet eyelids and mouths. Barras was next heading up to the Bay Area to screen the movie for the folks at Pixar. Two puppets from “My Life as a Zucchini.” \nComing to town, finally, was Martin Scorsese to promote Paramount’s Christmas release “ Silence ,” which he had finished only a few days ago, he told the Sunday crowd at the Village Theatre in Westwood. The day before, he conducted a Q&A at the American Cinematheque with his long-time producer Irwin Winkler (“New York, New York”), followed on Sunday by the first L.A. screenings of his feudal Japan meditation that stars Andrew Garfield (also in “Hacksaw Ridge”) and Adam Driver (who won Best Actor for “Paterson” from L.A. Critics) as scrawny long-haired Portuguese Jesuits, with Liam Neeson in a pivotal supporting role. The period movie looked great up on the big screen. (An embargo is in place.) Liam Neeson, Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield, Emma Tillinger Koskoff, and Martin Scorsese at a screening of “Silence.” Photo: Alex J. Berliner/ABImages \nAfter the movie, director James Gray meandered through a Q & A as Scorsese talked about screening “Silence” at the Vatican with a crucifix above the screen at the theater, attended not only by “The Great Beauty” Oscar-winner Paolo Sorrentino (upcoming HBO series ‘”The Young Pope”) but the Pontiff himself. \n“He was the most disarming,” said Scorsese, who gave Pope Francis a replica of the Madonna of the Snows. “Everything was fine. He was smiling, thanked us for being there. I thanked him for taking the opportunity to meet us. I told him that Andrew went through the 30 days of the spiritual exercises of the Jesuits, which is very, very demanding to say the least. They said that the next thing for Andrew to do is be ordained.” \nScorsese risks missing SAG nominations; he got away with it last time with “Wolf of Wall Street” and bigger star Leonardo DiCaprio, but that was a far more entertaining ride than this somber crisis-of-faith film. \nYou can tell from the critics groups’ votes this week that “Silence” is respected and admired more than it is loved. With the first round of votes in, the contender titles are settling. What’s left to see? Critics are way ahead of Academy members at this point, who will still be catching up through the holidays. “Lion,”“Fences” and “Hidden Figures” are building buzz, especially with actors. Other late-breaking titles like Ben Affleck’s “Live By Night,” and Weinstein Co.’s “The Founder” starring Michael Keaton and McConaughey vehicle “Gold,” not so much. \nOn Saturday, I moderated a SAG screening for National Board of Review Best Film of the Year “ Manchester by the Sea ” with cheerful New York Film Critics winners Kenneth Lonergan, Casey Affleck, and Michelle Williams, who said she waited 10 years to land a Lonergan role. They talked up the necessary theater-style rehearsal process ahead of their tight shooting schedule. Even though she was in a small supporting role, Williams spent time in Manchester wandering the supermarket aisles checking out the citizens —their hair, voices, outfits. While Affleck was on call throughout production, Williams had the task of landing on a dime for scenes such as the intense encounter between her estranged ex-wife and Affleck’s ex-husband, which was saved until the end of filming. Casey Affleck and Kenneth Lonergan sign “Manchester by the Sea” posters outside a SAG screening at the Pacific Design Center. \nThat night, we all reconvened at a holiday party at the Beverly Hills estate of Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, who staked a big tent in his backyard with a bar and arrays of high-end scotch as well as crab and shrimp and rich fish stew. Bezos takes seriously his role as owner of The Washington Post, as well as Amazon Studios, which has its sights on Oscars for “Manchester.” Bezos is invested for the long haul and spending to win: He wants to build a brand that means taste and class, he said. He’s been to the Oscars before, and the person he leans on for advice is pal Harvey Weinstein. \nOn hand were “Manchester” producer Matt Damon, hanging at the bar with Lonergan, Affleck, Williams, and producer Chris Moore; “Manchester” distributor Roadside Attractions co-heads Eric D’Arbeloff and Howard Cohen; Diane Keaton, John Lithgow (Netflix’s “The Crown”), and “Mozart in the Jungle” star Gael Garcia Bernal, who stars in Pablo Larrain’s Chilean Oscar entry “Neruda;”“Snowden” star Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who hopes to find a new home for his Pivot series HitRECord on TV; producer John Goldwyn and his ex-wife, Oscar party-thrower Colleen Camp; IMDb chief Col Needham; comedienne Sandra Bernhard; WME uber-agent Patrick Whitesell; and “Before Midnight” multi-hyphenate Julie Delpy, who is shooting and starring in London-set “My Zoe” after a string of French hits. \nWorking the room was Amazon’s “Love & Friendship” director Whit Stillman (who’s written three of his six-episode Amazon series “The Cosmopolitans”) and star Kate Beckinsale, who said the degree of difficulty was increased on set when he kept changing the dialogue at the last minute. (Tough to prep in advance.) She’s coming up in an Amazon movie with director Marc Webb, “The Only Living Boy in New York.” Director Whit Stillman and Kate Beckinsale at Jeff Bezos and Matt Damon’s “Manchester By The Sea” Holiday Party.

Duplass was talking with Nick Offerman, who’s hilarious (as usual) in Weinstein’s Christmas movie “The Founder.” Also going to Sundance is Amazon Studios’ executive Josh Kramer; now that “Manchester” and “Love & Friendship” have worked well in the marketplace, he looks forward to returning to the acquisition arena with even more clout. Kimberly Pierce, Michelle Williams, and Lucy Walker \nOn the way out of the party, I walked to the valet with Williams, “Boys Don’t Cry” director Kimberly Peirce, and documentarian Lucy Walker, who has finished the sequel to “Buena Vista Social Club,” filmed in Cuba, which is expected to premiere at Sundance. \n— Steve Greene contributed to this report.",

      "title": "Mystery Solved: Ancient Mummified Legs Belonged to Egyptian Queen Nefertari",
      "text": "Don't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals Sale The mummified legs found in Egypt's Valley of Queens were never scientifically analyzed until recently \nAfter more than a century of speculation, researchers have finally proved that a pair of mummified legs found in a tomb of Valley of Queens belongs to Egyptian Queen Nefertari – the wife of the Pharaoh Ramses II. Don't Miss: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 \nThe tomb of Nefertari was discovered in 1904 by an Italian Egyptologist Ernesto Schiaparelli while excavating the Valley of Queen. The place is located in Egypt where wives of Pharaohs were buried in ancient times. Among the object found in once-lavish burial place were the pieces of mummified legs, which were assumed to belong to Queen Nefertari. But the remains were never scientifically investigated. So, their identity could not be confirmed. \nTo solve the longstanding mystery of who the mummified legs belonged to, researchers have recently ran a series of tests like radiocarbon dating, anthropology, palaeopathology, genetics and chemical analysis and concluded that the remains actually belongs to Queen Nefertari. \n“The most likely scenario is that the mummified knees truly belong to Queen Nefertari. Although this identification is highly likely, no absolute certainty exists.” The study published in PLOS One reads. \nResearchers found that the ancient pair of legs belonged to a middle-aged or older woman who was around 5 feet 5 inches tall and probably had arthritis. Analysis further suggests that the mummified woman was between 40 and 60 years old, which is consistent with the age of Nefertari. Queen Nefertari was in her 40s when she died. Moreover, the materials used for embalming the mummy are also consistent with 13th Century BC mummification traditions. \nQueen Nefertari was the second and most believed wife of King Ramses II, who was the third pharaoh of the 19th dynasty. The ancestry of Queen Nefertari is uncertain but it has been said that she was probably not from the main royal line. Historical records also suggest that Nefertari probably died at the age of 40 to 50 years. \nThe burial of Queen Nefertari has been looted in ancient times yet still many broken objects were found in the debris when the tomb was excavated. Besides mummified legs, wall paintings, broken furniture, jars, a pair of sandals and various other small items remained preserved. All the items and human remains were sent to Egyptian Museum in Turin and they are still there.",

      "title": "Amazon’s new grocery store won’t have any checkout lines",
      "text": "Amazon has unveiled its vision for grocery stores — and it doesn’t include cashiers. Or checkout lines.\nThe web-retailing giant is opening a high-tech convenience store near its Seattle headquarters where shoppers will swipe the store’s app as they pass through turnstile-like entrance ways and then grab a sandwich or other product and just walk out.\nThe technology will do the rest — tally up the purchase, charge it to the credit card linked to the app and email the person the receipt as they hit the sidewalk.\nAmazon declined to say how many of the stores, called Amazon Go, it plans to open but experts said the prototype looks like a bid to automate supermarkets and convenience stores worldwide.\nThe secret behind Amazon Go is some nifty electronic sensors and artificial-intelligence equipment in fixtures that surround the aisles.\nAs a customer grabs items from shelves — from essentials like bread and milk to artisanal cheese and chocolates and ready-made meals — the items appear in virtual shopping carts on the app, according to a video released Monday.\nThe tech is so good, Amazon boasts in the video, that it can also sense when a customer puts an item back on the shelf — it removes it from the virtual cart as well.\nWhen leaving the store, shoppers pass back through a bank of turnstile-like electronic sensors that trigger the app to add up everything they’re carrying.\n“Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,” Amazon said on an FAQ page.\nAnd like self-driving cars, the checkout-free tech, which Amazon has branded “Just Walk Out,” could threaten jobs. Currently, there are 3.5 million cashiers nationwide, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nStill, in the demo video, the Amazon Go store appears to staffed with chefs preparing readymade meals and orange-shirted clerks keeping shelves stocked.\nThe brick-and-mortar prototype looks like an admission by Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s billionaire boss, that web retailing has its limits — especially when it comes to groceries , an $800 billion business in the US.\n“Although an increasing number of people are buying and willing to buy groceries online in the future, we acknowledge some people may never be comfortable with the idea,” Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge wrote in a research note. “Hence Amazon introducing physical locations makes a lot of sense as it removes a friction point.”\nIn a Monday blog post, Amazon also said the new store will be a destination for Amazon Meal Kits — a Blue Apron-like box of ingredients that can be prepped and cooked at home in 30 minutes.\nThe 1,800-square-foot store, currently open only to Amazon employees, will be opened to the public in early 2017.\nLast year, Amazon opened its first brick-and-mortar bookstore in Seattle.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.",

      "text": "\nEach week, we scour Amazon’s list of recently published eBooks to find the most outrageous trash-erotica, libellous tell-all, outlandish conspiracy theory and bizarre personal memoir to share with you, our dear readers. \nThis week’s selection is: \nThug Love: Rap Star Romance – Gangsta Luv Hiphop Rap Romantic Ghetto Luv Erotic Hood Short Story Lady Aingealicia Amazon Digital Services LLC 20 pp; $3.77 \nThe best pop culture conspiracy theory (not counting the one that Angela Lansbury’s character in Murder She Wrote was a serial killer responsible for every character’s death over the 12-year run of the show) suggests a very close relationship between the music industry and private prisons. \nAccording to legend: In 1991, there was a secret meeting held between representatives of both sectors in which the music industry agreed to promote gangsta rap ahead of socially conscious hip-hop so that there would be an increase in young offenders for the private prisons to lock up. Music executives were invited to invest heavily in these private prisons so that they would reap a reward for their active promotion. Related eBook of the Weak: Lumberjack, because she hasn’t been with a real man…until now \nIn an anonymous letter sent to Hip Hop Is Heard in 2012, details of this meeting were described, including a strict non-disclosure agreement that everyone who attended had to sign. This is why – duh! – the evil plot has been kept under wraps for so long. And, obviously, it’s why the ‘90s saw a rise in both private prisons and gangster rap. Case closed. \nWhat no one ever talks about is a similar meeting between private prisons and eBook purveyors. Only the blindest of sheeple could view Thug Love by Lady Aingealicia as the result of anything less than a total connivance of the powerful. ",

      "text": "Amazon opens new high-tech supermarket with no queues, no cash By AFP \nAmazon has unveiled a new kind of retail store, where customers can fill their shopping carts and simply walk straight out the door without stopping at a register. \nIn the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, customers open an app on their phones as they walk in, and as they pick up items the costs are tallied up and billed on their accounts. \nAmazon Go, which is being tested in a single store with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,\" the company says. \n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\" \nThe store in Seattle of some 170 square metres is selling a variety of food products including breads, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which has the ingredients for home-cooked dishes. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers. \nThe online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar outlets but so far has only announced a handful of bookselling outlets. © AFP 2016 ",

REUTERS/Rick …\n\nBy Narottam Medhora and Jeffrey Dastin\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains.\nAmazon Go, the online shopping giant's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what shoppers have picked off the shelf and bills it to their Amazon account if they do not put it back.\nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service.\n\"It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh.\n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said.\nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down nearly 1 percent in mid-day trading. Shares of Amazon were up about 2 percent.\nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said.\nIt was not immediately clear if and when Amazon Go would expand outside Seattle.\n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\"\nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said.\nSome people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said. \"There is a bit of education needed for consumers.\"\nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches and dinners made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.\nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well.\nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce giant to open.\nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.\n\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Andrew Hay)",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains.\nAmazon Go, the online shopping giant’s new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what shoppers have picked off the shelf and bills it to their Amazon account if they do not put it back.\nThe store marks Amazon’s latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service.\n“It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,” said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh.\n“If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat” to supermarket chains, he said.\nThe S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down nearly 1 percent in mid-day trading. Shares of Amazon were up about 2 percent.\nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said. \nWhat do you think of Amazon Go's \"just walk out technology\"? It was not immediately clear if and when Amazon Go would expand outside Seattle.\n“The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. “Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.”\nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said.\nSome people may “feel like they stole” an item, Saunders said. “There is a bit of education needed for consumers.”\nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches and dinners made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.\nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well.\nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce giant to open.\nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.\nLas Vegas credit scores...",

      "text": "Video: The freaky deaky fully automated “no checkout” Amazon store posted at 3:31 pm on December 5, 2016 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES \nTreat this as a palate cleanser if you like but it’s big news if the idea can be replicated in a cost-effective way, especially at supermarkets where checkout times can get long. Amazon’s replacing the checkout concept with check-in: You wave your phone at the sensor as you enter the store, alerting it to your presence, and then the store itself somehow tracks what you’re pulling off the shelves. How it does that is unclear; obviously it’s sensing more than just your phone as you approach the shelf, or else it would get confused when two shoppers are both pulling items off the same shelf at the same time. Once you’ve got what you want, you just … leave. No line. No credit card swipe. Just walk out with your stuff. Your Amazon account will be charged. \nWhat makes this newsy, in light of the Carrier deal and Trump building a great big beautiful protectionist wall to keep U.S. businesses in , is what the store lacks — namely, workers. You’ll need a few people to keep the shelves stocked and maybe someone wandering around to answer questions and help with any tech issues, but you don’t need cashiers or bagboys. Since the shelves can sense inventory, you might not need anyone to keep track of that either. Once self-driving trucks are introduced in a few years, you won’t even need drivers to deliver the goods from Amazon’s warehouse to the store. Trump spent Sunday morning on Twitter ranting about outsourcing but automation is the deeper threat to America’s work force, especially in transportation. Libertarian Justin Amash asks the inevitable question: Should the govt allow a company to use more advanced technology without retribution or consequence? Slap a 35% tax on any company that does? \n— Justin Amash (@justinamash) December 5, 2016 \nAs Amazon and its imitators refine this technology, prices at automated stores will drop to undercut stores still using service workers. Do we hit Amazon with a “tariff” too to boost those prices back up and level the playing field? Pass a federal statute outlawing certain types of automation? If I were Jeff Bezos, I’d go knock on Trump’s door and demand $5 billion in tax breaks not to roll out this system. If Carrier can get special treatment in the name of giving Trump a political win, why shouldn’t Amazon? I’m confident we can hold back the technology forever if we throw enough money at stopping it. \nExit question: Why would you need a brick-and-mortar Amazon store when Amazon and its nascent army of delivery drones can and will deliver anything right to your home? The answer, I assume, is that the sort of store you see here will specialize in mid-day food options — lunch, snacks, drinks, and dinner “meal kits.” Anything you might need immediately while you’re at work and away from home. The interesting question is which model supermarkets eventually adopt as the delivery/automation economy develops further. Do most people end up having their groceries delivered, a la Instacart, or do most people head down to the “no checkout” supermarket to do their own grocery shopping? ",

It’s called “ Amazon Go .” Basically, you can go into one of these special grocery stores, pick up whatever you want and then leave. No standing in the checkout line. Not even the “15 items or less” line. No waiting at all. If you don’t believe me, watch the video announcement below. Even then, you probably still won’t believe it. I barely do. The video says it’s coming early 2017 which is really, really soon. How is technology that advanced? I can barely figure out how to operate my French Press .

      "text": "Amazon announced a new in-store shopping experience on Monday called “Amazon Go.” The idea is simple: it’s a store where you can walk in, take stuff and leave without ever visiting a checkout counter. Yes, you can pretend to be a shoplifter. Kind of.\nYou’ll need to have the Amazon app installed and, unlike a shoplifter, you’re actually paying for the goods you decide to take with you. Sorry, Winona Ryder. You’ll scan your phone as you walk in the store, according to the video above that demonstrates the technology, and Amazon will know what you’re picking up to take home.\n“Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,” Amazon explained. “Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.”\nThis sounds kind of tricky, and I wonder how many people might accidentally either get charged for something they didn’t buy, or make off with goods they thought they paid for. The former reminds me of a hotel minibar fridge that can automatically detect when beer is removed, sometimes charging the guest even if he or she places it back.\nKind of like shoplifting.. but legal Amazon’s first store will take the form of a grocery market with pre-made breakfast, lunch and dinner options, in addition to snacks, chocolates, cheeses and other products. In other words, you’re not going to walk in and out with an $8,000 UHD just yet, which suggests perhaps Amazon is still just confident enough in its technology that it wants to beta test with food first.\nThe first location will open at 2131 7th Ave in Seattle, Washington ,on 7th Ave and Blanchard in early 2017, when the public can begin entering the store. It’s already open for Amazon employees.\n\n\nSource : Amazon ",

Tech Amazon’s New Seattle Store Will Let People Pay Without Checking Out Enter a store, pick what you want, and walk out. It calls the system, um, “Just Walk Out.” Pranav Dixit BuzzFeed News Reporter \nAmazon just released a video showing its crazy store of the future — which it says is opening in Seattle in early 2017 — that will let people pay without ever waiting in line or even itemizing purchases. \nIn a promotional video, it shows shoppers walking in, placing items in their bags, and walking out again without ever having to check out in a grocery line. youtube.com ID: 10108109 \nAmazon says it uses a combination of sensors, computer vision, and deep learning, much like what is found in self-driving cars, to figure out what people picked out. \nOnce you walk out of the store, an Amazon Go app automatically bills your purchases to your card on file with Amazon and sends you a receipt.

      "text": "(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) \nAmazon debuted its new Go store on Monday, and the design of the store hints at a future of shopping with no human interaction. \nThe grocery store will allow shoppers to check in to the store with their phones, grab what they need, and simply walk out of the store.\nThe shopper's Amazon account will be billed for the cost of the goods. Customers won't have to stand in line, and critically, they won't have to interact with a cashier.\nThat's great news for Amazon customers who detest human interaction or waiting , but it's bad news for cashiers, a critical part of the US workforce, and it highlights the challenge Donald Trump will face as he bids to boost the US labor market.\nDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to \" bring back the jobs \" by cutting taxes and regulation and pulling out of trade deals . Free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or Trans Pacific Partnership allowed companies to shift jobs overseas to places like Mexico and China and decimate the middle class, he said. \nThe argument struck a chord, particularly with white working class voters , propelling Trump to the White House.\nMore recently, he has threatened to clamp down on companies moving jobs overseas . \nDespite the convincing nature of Trump's anti-offshoring argument, Amazon Go proves the biggest danger isn't jobs going overseas, but rather the march of technological progress.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , 856,850 Americans were employed as grocery store cashiers in May 2015, the most recent data available. Theoretically, Amazon Go's model grocery store puts a chunk of these jobs at risk. Include all cashiers (there doesn't seem to be a reason the Amazon Go model couldn't work for say, clothes or books) and that's roughly 3.5 million people in roles that are at risk of being automated away. \n(Joe Raedle / Staff / Getty Images) \nTo put that into perspective, t he World Trade Organization estimated that between 2001 and 2013 the US had lost 3.2 million jobs due to outsourcing to China. This isn't an apples to apples comparison, but the numbers are striking. \nThat's not to say that every cashier job is going to disappear overnight. Amazon is only opening a pilot Go store in Seattle next year. And cashier jobs have held remarkably steady of the last decade, even as online shopping became the dominant trend in retail. \nThe change, however, highlights the ever-shifting landscape of the American workforce. \nThis point isn't a new one. Everyone from liberal, Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman to Republican Senator Ben Sasse have noted that technological developments are a bigger threat to American workers than trade. The World Economic Forum estimated 5 million jobs in 15 developed economies are at risk of automation by 2020 and Citi projected that 57% of jobs in OECD nations are at risk of automation. \nIn heavy manufacturing, jobs once done by multiple humans are being replaced by robots. Panera Bread is trying out machines that take and deliver your order, all without a human server. Even in journalism there are programs that are starting to automate simple article writing. \n(Screengrab via Bloomberg) \nHoward Marks, the founder of investment firm Oaktree Capital, riffed on this topic earlier this year, pointing out that US manufacturing output is near an all-time high, even though US manufacturing employment is down 37% since the peak in 1979. \n\"Perhaps if the government wants to preserve jobs it should just outlaw productivity gains,\" he said . \nThat, of course, isn't feasible. There is likely a long-run benefit to making processes more affordable and quicker. \nRather, the point is that refocusing the labor market on the jobs and skills that will be needed in the future is a productive way to allow innovation and keep American employed. \nThat kind of policy was barely mentioned in Trump's campaign. In fact, the president-elect hardly mentioned the issue of technological advances destroying jobs at all, so it appears to be a huge blind spot in his proposed economic plan. \nTrump is focused on the wrong problem when it comes to the labor market. Instead of getting old manufacturing jobs back from overseas, the government should be focused on retraining workers for the new labor market.\nNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception \n\nMore From Business Insider \nTRUMP TREASURY SECRETARY: 'There were a lot of people in California and New York who wanted to stop being friends' \nTrump's massive economic plan is like 'taking a well-done steak and putting it on broil' \nOne restaurant group stands to be the big winner if Trump cuts everyone's taxes",

      "text": "No lines. No checkouts. … No cashier jobs? On Monday morning, Amazon unveiled its new vision for the future of brick-and-mortar grocery stores: Amazon Go.\nThe new service offered by the online-shopping colossus allows customers to walk into the store, grab what they want and simply leave the building — without interacting with another human being or waiting in line.\nAmazon says the company brought together the most advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence to eliminate cash registers in a new 1,800-square-foot store in Seattle.\nAmazon Go is already open to Amazon employees through its beta program and is scheduled to open to the public in early 2017.\nAs seen in a video released by the company, shoppers scan a code from the Amazon Go app on their smartphones at a kiosk and then proceed to fill up their carts. The video’s narrator says that a virtual cart automatically registers every time a customer picks up or puts down an item and that Amazon accounts are only charged once someone leaves the store.\n“We used computer vision, deep-learning algorithms and sensor fusion much like you’d find in self-driving cars. We call it “Just Walk Out Technology,’” he says.\nAccording to Amazon, the store will offer ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack options, as well as grocery essentials like bread and milk. It is located at 2131 Seventh Avenue in Seattle.\nReaction to the e-commerce giant’s new technology is unsurprisingly split between people who are impressed with the convenience and those alarmed by what this means for cashiers, one of the most common occupations in the United States. If this innovation is broadly adopted, it would drastically change the landscape of the retail industry.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that there are 3,478,420 cashiers in the U.S. earning a mean hourly wage of $10.09 per hour.\nAn Amazon spokesperson referred Yahoo News to the company’s announcement about the new store.\n“Four years ago, we asked ourselves: What if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout?” the website reads in part. “Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go? Our answer to those questions is Amazon Go and Just Walk Out Shopping.”",

      "text": "Users of the Amazon Go app simply check in to a store equipped for the system, shop to their hearts' content, then leave when they're finished. No waiting to pay. Point-of-sale retail employees may not want to hear this news: Amazon Web Services has announced a new app that shoppers can use to simply go into a store, take whatever they want, and leave -- without going through a checkout line. It's called Amazon Go, and that's exactly what users will do with it: Go, and fast, out the door. Go here to view a YouTube video on how the system works. Users with the Amazon Go app on their phones simply check in to a store equipped for the system, put their phones away, shop to their hearts' content, then leave when they're finished. No waiting to pay.As each item is picked up and held (or stored in a bag) by the shopper, the price is automatically added to the shopper's Amazon account and is deducted from the user's bank account when he or she leaves the store. The store gets the same info plus a copy of the item's SKU (stock-keeping unit) number for inventory management and accounting purposes.Amazon uses a complicated concoction of new-gen IT in this system: machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep-learning algorithms, sensor fusion and computer vision to determine what shoppers are buying. It's much like the technology used in self-driving vehicles, Amazon said. How Will This Affect Jobs for Humans? The potential impact on human jobs and the amelioration of shoplifting incidents could to be enormous, especially for grocery stores, general retail chains (Target, Walmart, etc.) and any other brick-and-mortar establishment with point-of-sale processes. This takes into account virtually all on-premises businesses around the world. Amazon said it has been working on this for four years and will start rolling it out \"early in 2017.\" Technology investor Roger McNamee, an early commenter, told CNBC Dec. 5 that while technologies like this are apparent threats to humans doing conventional jobs, people will remain important in the entire experience of shopping. \"The human beings are really a positive part of the experience,\" Roger McNamee, co-founder of technology investment firm Elevation Partners, said on the cable network's \"Squawk Alley\" show. \"I don't expect this to take over the world. It just doesn't seem like an earth-shattering thing.\" A Big Jump Past Self-Checkout Systems McNamee cited current use of self-checkout lanes in some businesses as having their pros and cons, but waiting lines are still in the mix there. The Amazon system, however, takes a completely different approach with no checkout lines whatsoever. \"I think this is part of a continuum that began a number of years ago when folks like Home Depot, and then CVS and Albertsons, Wal-Mart and others have experimented with self-checkout,\" McNamee said. \"And that has been a mixed experience. These things have all had rough moments, and the consumer experience has been everywhere from fantastic—for the person who otherwise would have been in line for a long time—to just dreadful. And I don't think it's been as good for the companies as they'd like to think.\" Home Depot has been successful with its implementations of mobile and self-checkout, McNamee said, after introducing features such as in-aisle location. But the home services provider has also faced challenges, including a 2014 data breach involving its self-checkout terminals . \"The early result from checkout indicates that, in fact, self-checkout works in a relatively narrow set of circumstances—with today's technology,\" McNamee said. \"Amazon's moving the technology forward.\" There's no question that by taking humans out of the sales-transaction chain, Amazon's system could help eliminate longtime problems such as straight theft or inventory mysteriously disappearing in other ways. It's far too early to examine the security implications of a system such as the one Amazon is preparing. That is an entirely different story. First Store to Use Amazon Go is Also Called Amazon Go The online retail giant has built the first store deploying this solution, called Amazon Go, across the street from its headquarters in Seattle, Wash. The Seattle Times reported Dec. 5 that tech giant new convenience store deploys a \"gaggle of technologies similar to those used in self-driving cars to allow shoppers to come in, grab items and walk out without going through a register.\" The 1,800-square-foot store is the latest project in brick-and-mortar retail attempted by Amazon, which already has bookstores and is working quietly on drive-through grocery locations. eWEEK will have more on the backend technology of Amazon Go in a future article. \nChris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK.

      "text": "By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch December 5, 2016, 3:45 PM Amazon's newest shopping disruption is a doozy Stumble \nAmazon ( AMZN ) today unveiled a prototype for a brick-and-mortar food store called Amazon Go . That sounds like a big deal, but it actually promises something far beyond what current grocers can offer: This store will let consumers make purchases while they’re tracked with cameras and artificial intelligence sensors that know what goods they’ve picked up, and then they pay via their mobile devices -- automatically -- as they leave. No need for waiting on a checkout line (and no need for the jobs of countless cashiers). \nAccording to the e-commerce giant, Amazon Go is currently being tested at a location in its Seattle hometown that’s open now only to company employees. Amazon, which will open the 1,800-square foot store to the public next year, is said to be planning a chain of convenience stores that offer perishable items as well as meals. \nIt’s a further challenge to rivals such as Walmart ( WMT ) and Target ( TGT ), which depend on their grocery businesses for more than half of their annual sales. Traditional players such as Kroger ( KR ) are also in Amazon’s sights. Making a new venture into the physical world, online retail giant Amazon is planning to open brick and mortar grocery stores. Wall Street Journal... \nAmazon’s version of a grocery store uses what the company calls “Just Walk Out” technology. Developed over the past four years, it’s similar to the gear used in self-driving cars, according to Amazon. It automatically detects which products are taken from -- or returned to -- the store’s shelves and keeps track of those goods in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you leave the store, and your Amazon account gets charged automatically (and you’ll get an emailed receipt). \n“The Go technology Amazon developed streamlines and shortens the whole consumer experience of grocery shopping and, just like Uber, removes the whole payment hassle,” said Amanda Nicholson, a professor of retail practice at Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management, in an email. \nShe added, “on the more practical side of things, problems might include customers moving stickers from item to item, how to handle ‘returns’ and, of course, if this really becomes the modern way to shop, we’re looking at significant job losses for cashiers in the U.S.” \nAmazon didn’t provide additional details on its plans for Amazon Go, such as if it will license the technology to other retailers, and it declined to make any executives available for interviews. \nClearly, the ramifications of Amazon’s “Just Walk Out Technology” could be huge for grocery stores, which are worried about turning off customers with long checkout lines, and other physical retailers struggling to draw crowds as online shopping surges in popularity, according to Howard Davidowitz, who runs New York-based Davidowitz & Associates, a firm that provides consulting and investment banking services to retailers. \n“This takes a lot of technology,” said Davidowitz, who described it as a “game changer.” If it works, he said, “it can change the way retailing is done.” \n“Just Walk Out” technology comes as shoppers are growing increasingly comfortable making purchases over their smartphones and tablets. According to ComScore , mobile devices will account for about 20 percent of total holiday e-commerce sales, in line with the third quarter when it reached an all-time high. \nA year ago, spending from mobile devices accounted for about 13 percent of e-commerce holiday spending. Although mobile payment offerings such as Apple Pay ( AAPL ), PayPal ( PYPL ) and Android Pay ( GOOG ) have gained in popularity, consumers have been slow to adopt them. \n“Self-checkout is already available to shoppers who use hand-held scanners, and Amazon Go could offer a shopping experience that eliminates even that simple step,” said Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, an e-commerce services provider that owns FreeShipping.com and ShopSmarter, a price comparison site. “It’s still in beta testing at the moment, but if Amazon can deliver on its promise, it’s likely that down the road, millions of in-store shoppers will be able to bypass checkout lines and essentially ‘grab and go.’” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

      "title": "With Amazon looming, Oreo maker dives deeper into online retail - Chicago Tribune",
      "text": "Mondelez International Inc. , trying to adapt as more shoppers buy food outside of traditional grocery stores, is diving deeper into online retail with a holiday-season website that is selling tins of Oreos directly to consumers.\nBig food companies, which have dominated the shelves at brick-and-mortar stores for decades, have had mixed results selling products directly in recent years as online retail slowly takes hold in the grocery industry. The holiday Oreo website, which kicks off Monday, marks the first time Mondelez will directly handle the supply chain and shipping logistics, without going through a store or online retailer like Amazon.com.\nMondelez created a dedicated e-commerce team last year with a goal of generating $1 billion in revenue by 2020. Most of that money will come from customers shifting their purchases online -- buying snacks like Triscuits and Toblerone chocolate on Amazon or Wal-Mart's website, rather that visiting a store. Yet, Mondelez says it can also increase sales with limited-time and seasonal offers directly through its website, selling unique products that customers won't find elsewhere.\nOrganic Oreos? A chemist explains what 'organic' really means Josh Bloom What do toenail clippers, submarine hulls and waffle irons have in common?\nNone of the three is organic — yet.\nPerplexed? Check this out: The word \"organic\" now appears prominently on some packages of Oreos and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. No, I'm not making it up. It's not that any of these tasty...\nWhat do toenail clippers, submarine hulls and waffle irons have in common?\nNone of the three is organic — yet.\nPerplexed? Check this out: The word \"organic\" now appears prominently on some packages of Oreos and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. No, I'm not making it up. It's not that any of these tasty...\n(Josh Bloom) \"There's definitely value in scarcity,\" said Arthur Sevilla, global director of e-commerce strategy at the Deerfield, Illinois-based company. \"As social media becomes the predominant market value, scarcity drives buzz.\"\nMondelez had a holiday website in the U.S. in 2015, and did a direct-to-consumer test in China with Alibaba earlier this year. But in both cases, the company outsourced the logistics, cutting down on profit margins. In the past 18 months, the Mondelez e-commerce team, which includes Amazon veterans, has grown to more than 60 employees from four when it started.\nThe 2016 holiday website, which sells Oreo tins for $19.99, lets customers send cookies to friends, using only a mobile number or email address. The technology the company has developed for the Oreo holiday experiment could be used profitably in other regions for similar limited-time offers, Sevilla said.\n\"If it's successful, we'll import this model to other markets,\" he said.\nMondelez and its competitors in the U.S. food industry are struggling to find growth amid changing consumer tastes. Most of the growth in recent years has come from natural and organic products, with smaller startups that boast clean-ingredient labels muscling into the snack market. And more food is being purchased online, with Amazon making a push into the grocery business.\nLast year, General Mills abandoned a direct-to-consumer snack subscription service after about a year-and-half. Kellogg, meanwhile, teamed up with IBM Corp. earlier this year on a website that lets shoppers order customized granola. The food-and-beverage market in the U.S. is worth about $800 billion, and currently about $33 billion, or 4 percent, of those sales occur online, according to John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co.\nWith younger consumers getting more comfortable buying groceries via the Internet, he predicts online food sales will grow to $70 billion by 2021.\nStill, it's unlikely that packaged food and beverage companies will gain traction with direct-to-consumer websites, at least when it comes to the weekly shopping trips that fill the pantry with staple items.\nFor one, it's expensive to lure online customers with marketing, and most shoppers don't want to visit dozens of website to find the items they buy on Amazon or at a grocery store. In addition, it's costly to try to match Amazon's online logistics, Blackledge said. \"Amazon has the infrastructure to do it,\" he said.\n\"There's a lot to it,\" Blackledge said. \"I'd be surprised if it scales up for the manufacturers over time.\"\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Mondelez International Alibaba Group",

      "text": "Amazon Has Launched A Cashier Free In Store Shopping Experience 2 hours ago share Source: Youtube \nIntroducing Amazon Go. The online company is now opening a store with items you'd find at a local convenience store - drinks, pre made food and various snacks. \nBut, the difference is this store will have no check out lines! When you walk in you will scan your Amazon account and then simply take any items you want. \nYour phone will monitor your movements and analyze which items you are putting in your bag. It will then charge your Amazon account for the items you took when you leave the store. \nThis eliminating the need to stand in a checkout line. Pretty cool if you're in a hurry! The store is currently in beta testing in Seattle, but will be open to the public in early 2017. Introducing #AmazonGo , a new kind of store with no lines and no checkout. https://t.co/WMii0bWevi pic.twitter.com/OmZdzobA5F ",

When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\" \nThe store in Seattle of some 170 square meters (1,800 square feet) is selling a variety of food products including breads, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which has the ingredients for home-cooked dishes. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers. \nThe online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar outlets but so far has only announced a handful of bookselling outlets. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook IMF releases another $618 mn loan installment for Iraq AFP \nThe IMF on Monday announced the release of the second installment of a loan for Iraq, despite continued financial … ",

      "text": "News After warehouse staff, Amazon to replace store clerks with robots Amazon wants shoppers to just walk out of its stores and let an AI figure out what they owe for what they took. Paris Bureau Chief, IDG News Service | Dec 5, 2016 10:44 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nAt Amazon Go stores, shoppers will be able to identify themselves with a QR code on a phone app as they walk in, then pay for their purchases simply by walking out the door. The first such store will open to the public in Seattle early in 2017. Credit: Amazon.com 4 great gifts for mobile professionals \nAmazon.com is still figuring out how to use robots to fill store shelves, but it's about done with clerks. Next year, the company will open a convenience store in Seattle where shoppers can walk in, take what they want -- and leave. \nThe Amazon Go store is on the corner of 7th Avenue and Blanchard Street in Seattle, in the heart of Amazon's new campus development and a few blocks from the company's headquarters. \nAmazon wants people to walk in to the store and then just walk out with what they want. \n[ Also on CIO.com: How to save on mobile plans: Your guide to 16 no-contract carriers ] \nIt's not giving the goods away, though. \nTo figure out who to charge, and how much, Amazon will identify shoppers by scanning QR codes on their phones as they walk in, and use sensors and computer vision technology to determine which items they take. \nThat might seem creepy, but it's not much more intrusive than the closed-circuit TV monitoring many stores already have in place to deter shoplifters, or the Bluetooth beacons others use to pitch up-to-the-minute offers to visitors. Whether Amazon's system is sharp-eyed enough to distinguish between a jar of strawberry jelly and a jar of raspberry in the same way that a clerk with a regular barcode reader can distinguish between codes 051500001639 and 051500022030 remains to be seen. \nFor now, only Amazon staff can shop at the 180-square-meter Go store, but early next year it will be ready to sell ready-made snacks and staples such as bread and milk to anyone -- anyone with the Amazon Go app running on a compatible smartphone, that is. \nPayment is automatically deducted from the associated credit card when a shopper leaves the store, and the receipt is sent to the app. \nWith robots already able to mop the floor, and the shelf-stacking problem almost solved by entrants to the Amazon Picking Challenge , the employee-free grocery store may not be far away.

      "text": "print Scene from \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Claire Fogler \nAmazon has been one of the most aggressive spenders in the video content business over the past few years. \nAnd according to Macquarie Research's Ben Schachter, the e-commerce giant could be spending \"well-over\" $3 billion a year on video streaming content. \n\"Amazon’s exclusive and original video strategy is still evolving...we believe it is currently investing well over $3 billion annually for original and licensed content,\" Schachter wrote in a note published Monday. \nThe last time Amazon disclosed its investment amount on video content was back in 2014, when it said it spent $1.3 billion. This year, it said it's doubling its spending on video content in the second half of the year, compared with last year, but didn't disclose the exact dollar amount. \nThe investments have led to a number of breakthrough original shows, including \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle,\" which collected the Emmy's and Golden Globe Awards last year. Just last week, Amazon hit another major milestone when \"Manchester by the Sea\" was named the best film of the year by the National Board of Review — the first big film award for Amazon (to be clear, Amazon didn't produce the film, but bought its domestic distribution rights.) \nSchachter writes \"Manchester by the Sea\" could even land Amazon Studios' first nomination for an Academy Award Best Picture this year. And if that happens, expect Amazon to heavily promote the film as exclusive content on Prime Video, in order to attract more users to its Prime membership program (which includes free two-day shipping, and access to a bunch of free video and music content): \"The bottom line is that Amazon is almost certainly going to highlight the critical reception of 'Manchester by the Sea' as a way to focus attention on its video efforts and the associated benefits to Prime members. Prime Video has quickly evolved into a meaningful part of the Amazon ecosystem and management believes is, in part, responsible for the rapid expansion of Prime members.\" Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

      "text": "‘Good Girls Revolt’ follows the women working at a news magazine as they fight for equal treatment at the office. (Amazon Photo) Amazon’s abrupt cancellation of the critically-acclaimed series “Good Girls Revolt” has struck a nerve with feminists and fans in the wake of recent real-world events.\nOn the surface, the series tells the story of women who demand the same opportunities as their male colleagues at the fictitious magazine News of the Week — a story inspired by real events that transpired at Newsweek in 1970. On a deeper level, it tells a dozen smaller stories of women confronting daily injustices in their own ways.\nThe show was well-received among critics, who applauded Amazon for highlighting these issues at a time when many women feel marginalized by the political dialogue. It also performed well with viewers, according to a third-party report from Symphony Data obtained by GeekWire.\nIn the three weeks after it premiered, “Good Girls Revolt” earned 620,000 viewers and ranked No. 8 in top streaming series during that time period, just after Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” Sony, the studio that produced “Good Girls Revolt” commissioned the report from Symphony. Amazon, like most streaming services, does not make ratings public.\nThe show’s cancellation, despite strong performance, feels like a familiar story for many women particularly in the wake of the presidential election. To protest the decision, fans have created the hashtag #SaveGoodGirlsRevolt.\n#GoodGirlsRevolt got some of the best ratings of any @amazon show & was dropped anyway Sounds like a perfect metaphor for being a woman\n— Nicole Chiodo Soares (@libraryyoda) December 2, 2016 \nNews that the show would be axed came as a big surprise to Darlene Hunt, showrunner, executive producer, and writer for “Good Girls Revolt.”\n“Honestly we were quite flabbergasted,” she said. “We just did not really see it coming…We really just thought, ‘wow with those numbers they should be rolling out the red carpet for us.’ So we were surprised.”\nDespite the shock, Hunt is careful to note that she doesn’t have any bad blood with Amazon. Cancellations, she says, are just part of the business. On Twitter, fans are not so forgiving.\n. @amazon just curious, how many women were on the team that decided not to renew #goodgirlsrevolt #WrongCall #SaveGoodGirlsRevolt \n— Marianne Cooper (@coopermarianne) December 5, 2016 \nHunt says she and her colleagues received the bad news from Sony the day after they pitched season two of the series for Amazon execs Roy Price and Joe Lewis. Lewis took over as Amazon Studios’ Head of Drama Development after Morgan Wandell left the position to become Amazon’s new Head of International Productions. Wandell, Hunt says, was “Good Girls Revolt’s” biggest advocate at Amazon.\nGeekWire reached out to Amazon and will update this post if we hear back. \nYo @AmazonVideo . You can't be SERIOUS that you're canceling Good Girls Revolt!? This show is a hope light in a very dark time for women #GGR \n— Sophia Bush (@SophiaBush) December 2, 2016 \n“I’m stunned by the canceling,” said Reggie Watkins, an actor who played a Black Panther activist on the show. “It had such a great following and was growing every day.”\nLet's get this trending y'all! Retweet or tweet ur own, but show ya love! #SaveGoodGirlsRevolt #goodgirlsrevolt \n— Reggie Watkins (@ReggieWatkinsJr) December 4, 2016 \nSony is looking for a new home for Good Girls Revolt. Several Twitter users have suggested that Netflix, Amazon Video’s chief rival, should pick the show up. Sony has been actively involved in promoting the hashtag #SaveGoodGirlsRevolt on Twitter, according to Hunt.\n“They are so passionate about the show,” she said. “They really, money aside, they do believe in the story we’re telling. They just love it and they’re excited about it and they’ve listened to the fans who have written such beautiful, eloquent things about how much the show meant to them.”",

      "text": "Amazon ( AMZN ) says it will open its Seattle-based cashier-free convenience store concept in early 2017.  Shoppers will be able to shop for groceries at the 1,800 square foot store, and once they are finished, walk out without checking out. The company will use technology that autimatically detects when products are taken from or returned to shelves and track those items in a virtual cart. Amazon will then charge patrons' Amazon accounts shortly after and send customers the reciept for their purchases.",

      "text": "Amazon unveils grocery store with no checkout lines CNN 12:27 PM, Dec 5, 2016 3 hours ago Share Article Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday December 5, 2016 that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. From Amazon Previous Next \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nThe-CNN-Wire ",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)  48PM NEW YORK -- Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines.Called Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app.If a shopper puts the item back they aren't charged.Check out the video Amazon released Monday:The store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits.The store is in testing and open to Amazon employees in a beta program. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017.The e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. Related Topics:",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.",

      "title": "Windows 10 “Home Hub” feature will take on Amazon Echo and more | Ars Technica",
      "text": "Microsoft is going to make the Windows 10 PC a more family-focused device, taking on Amazon's Echo and Google Home as it does, according to the latest reports and rumors about forthcoming features.\nThe story starts with Twitter user Walking Cat poking around preview builds and finding reference to a feature named Home Hub. This appears to take the multi-user features of Windows 10 in a new direction. In addition to individual per-user accounts on shared machines, Home Hub will enable a shared Family Account and Family Desktop. This account will have its own calendar, music, pictures, and other resources that are used by and shared between several different people.\nMary Jo Foley tied that to job postings from November, where Microsoft outlined its desire to build family-oriented sharing features for Windows and its desire to compete with Google, Amazon, Apple, and AT&T\nSources speaking to Windows Central added a ton of extra meat to the Home Hub skeleton. While a little groundwork has been laid already (such as the ability to use Cortana from the lock screen, which was added in this summer's Anniversary Update), the major Home Hub features will be shipping in updates codenamed Redstone 3 (late 2017) and Redstone 4 (2018).\nAccording to Windows Central, the family account will act as a kind of hybrid. It will show any user the shared, family-wide stuff but authenticate in using Windows Hello biometrics (which, for facial recognition, requires nothing more than sitting down in front of the PC). The shared data will be extended to also show private calendars and data. Sign off and the private stuff will be hidden away, leaving only the shared data. This ability to create family-enabled apps with the split level of privacy and authentication will be offered to developers, too.\nA new family welcome screen, showing appointments, sticky notes, to-do lists, and similar shared information will be included, so even a locked machine will become more useful.\nEnlarge / Windows Central produced a mock-up of the Home Hub Welcome Screen. Windows Central A key family-enabled app will be Cortana. Microsoft's digital personal assistant will have a family mode, currently referred to as \"FamTana\" internally, that will be able to serve non-personal requests such as weather lookups and news headlines. It will also be able to access shared calendars, play shared music, and so on. As with other family-enabled apps, authenticated users will also be able to use their private data with her.\nWith the Home Hub features, Windows 10 will also become a smart device hub. It'll be possible to register smart devices like lights and locks with the PC and control them centrally, including Cortana integration. Open Connectivity Foundation and Open Translators to Things devices will be supported out of the box.\nThe big point of differentiation between Microsoft's plans and the capabilities of, say, Alexa on the Amazon Echo is that Microsoft is still envisaging a conventional PC (albeit a conventional PC with biometric authentication and microphone arrays) as the hub for all your activity. What doesn't appear to be in the works is a headless, screenless, pure-voice device. This has some implications. It makes using Home Hub more expensive, especially if you want to cover more rooms—adding a new all-in-one PC is going to cost more than adding a new Amazon Echo, because the PC has a lot more hardware.\nIt also feels like it could fall foul of the same awkwardness that Cortana suffers from in Windows 10. Speaking to Alexa is natural, because there's no other way of using Alexa; she's trapped inside a box with only a microphone and a speaker to communicate with. But Cortana has a PC with a screen and a mouse and a keyboard, so there's always this pressure to just... not use her and stick with the conventional input and output schemes. Alexa has to be designed so that she understands natural speech patterns and provides all the information you need using the spoken word; Cortana doesn't have that same design discipline. After all, she can always fall back to making you look at stuff on the screen.",

      "text": "Claire Fogler \nAmazon has been one of the most aggressive spenders in the video content business over the past few years.\nAnd according to Macquarie Research's Ben Schachter, the e-commerce giant could be spending \"well-over\" $3 billion a year on video streaming content.\n\"Amazon’s exclusive and original video strategy is still evolving...we believe it is currently investing well over $3 billion annually for original and licensed content,\" Schachter wrote in a note published Monday.\nThe last time Amazon disclosed its investment amount on video content was back in 2014, when it said it spent $1.3 billion. This year, it said  it's doubling its spending on video content in the second half of the year, compared with last year, but didn't disclose the exact dollar amount. \nThe investments have led to a number of breakthrough original shows, including  \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle,\" which collected the Emmy's and Golden Globe Awards last year. Just last week, Amazon hit  another major milestone when \"Manchester by the Sea\" was named the best film of the year by the National Board of Review  — the first big film award for Amazon (to be clear, Amazon didn't produce the film, but bought its domestic distribution rights.)\nSchachter writes \"Manchester by the Sea\" could even land Amazon Studios' first nomination for an Academy Award Best Picture this year. And if that happens, expect Amazon to heavily promote the film as exclusive content on Prime Video, in order to attract more users to its Prime membership program (which includes free two-day shipping, and access to a bunch of free video and music content):\n\"The bottom line is that Amazon is almost certainly going to highlight the critical reception of 'Manchester by the Sea' as a way to focus attention on its video efforts and the associated benefits to Prime members. Prime Video has quickly evolved into a meaningful part of the Amazon ecosystem and management believes is, in part, responsible for the rapid expansion of Prime members.\"\nNOW WATCH: We sleep much differently than our ancestors — here's why \n",

      "text": "  4:39 PM \nMiracle in aisle five. \nAmazon on Monday unveiled a brick-and-mortar grocery store that allows patrons to check in using an app, grab their foodstuffs and breeze out the door with a digital receipt — all without the headache of long lines or checkout. \nThe so-called Amazon Go — located in the company’s hometown of Seattle, Wash., and stocked with grocery staples plus readymade meal options — is currently in beta testing by Amazon employees, and will open to the public early next year. \nThe 1,800-square-foot store runs on the same technological framework as self-driving cars, the retail giant explained — “computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,” per the tech jargon on its website. \nPractically speaking, customers can scan their free Amazon Go app upon entering and begin hunting and gathering, with the “Just Walk Out” technology detecting and tracking items as they’re removed or restored to shelves. The items are charged to users’ Amazon accounts after they leave the store. Amazon Go will debut to the public next year. (Amazon) \nThe self-service, cashier-less store of the future raises obvious questions about jobs. A Bureau of Labor Statistics report earlier this year pegged cashiers as the occupation with the second-highest employment, trailing only retail salespeople. \nPlans to expand beyond the Emerald City remained unclear — as did the company’s plan for addressing potential shoplifting. \nAmazon Go marks the e-commerce company’s latest foray into the grocery game, which currently includes its AmazonFresh delivery service.

ET Tech Today: Going ‘Cautious’ on Apple, Amazon ‘Go,’ Fitbit #1 By Tiernan Ray \nHere some things going on today in your world of tech : \nShares of Apple ( AAPL ) are down $1.50, or 1.3%, at $108.40, amidst news of both its rumored ambition in driverless vehicles , and more spot checks of the health of iPhone . \nOn the latter score, boutique house BlueFin moves to a “cautious” rating on the stock, from “positive,” after “supply chain checks” make the analysts, John Donovan and Steve Mullane worried that March quarter iPhone sales will be “well below Wall Street consensus.” \nPacific Crest ’s Andy Hargreaves , who has an Overweight rating, cuts his price target to $127 from $129, after cutting his estimates to “roughly in line with consensus” for December and for all of fiscal 2017. \nOn the matter of self-driving vehicles, Reuters ’s David Shepardson reported Saturday that a five-page letter from from the head of Apple’s “product integrity,” Steve Kenner, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dropped hints about the company’s interest in things like “ machine learning ” related to transportation. \nJ.P. Morgan ’s Rod Hall writes “we like the fact that Apple is clearly working on auto software though it is likely a few years down the road before the company is able to realize any revenue from these projects.” \n“More importantly, we see Apple’s focus on machine learning as critical to the future of the company given the importance of these systems in the future.” \nShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) are up 14 cents, or 0.6%$, at $23.99, after Gabelli & Co .’s Hendi Susanto started coverage of the stock wth a Buy rating, and a $29 price target,” writing that “ CEO [Meg] Whitman has successfully led strategic initiatives to lower costs, improve the company’s performance, engage in transformative transactions, unlock value and strengthen the product portfolio.” \nShares of Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL ) are down 19 cents, or 1.4%, at $13.83, after Goldman Sachs ’s Mark Delaney cut his rating on the stock to Sell from Neutral, writing that “most of the positive catalysts investors were looking for are now priced in.” \nShares of Amazon.com ( AMZN ) are up $6.50, or 0.8%, at $746.84, after the company this morning unveiled “ Amazon Go ,” which lets you walk into retail outlets and take things off the shelf without having to stop to pay for them. “No lines, no checkouts,” says an Amazon video on the matter . Items are automatically added to an electronic payment system via an app. The technology is currently featured at Amazon’s brick-and-mortar store in Seattle. \nResearch firm IDC this morning reports that wearables technology shipments rose by 3% in Q3, to 23 million units, with most of it, 85%, being fitness devices. Fitbit ( FIT ) had 23% market share, up from 21% a year earlier, while China’s Xiaomi held second place at 16.5%. Garmin ( GRMN ) was in third place, and Apple at 4th place. Apple fell to 4.9% from 17.5% a year earlier, a 71% decline. \nFitbit shares are down 4 cents, or half a percent, at $8.10. ",

      "text": "  SEATTLE — There is almost no aspect of retail that Amazon has not upended with online shopping. Now, the company is trying to computerize the experience of buying sandwiches and soda from the corner convenience store.\nIn the latest in its expanding set of experiments involving bricks-and-mortar retail stores, Amazon has created a small grocery store in Seattle that will allow customers to pluck drinks, prepared meals and other items off shelves and walk out without having to wait in a checkout line, the company said.\nAmazon said on its website that a smartphone app and various other types of technology in the store had eliminated the usual bottleneck of cashiers and registers that typically stand between shoppers and the store exit.\nFor now, only Amazon employees can shop in the 1,800-square-foot store, which is on the ground floor of one of the company’s new office towers in downtown Seattle. The company said that it planned to open the store to the public early next year and that it would offer chef-made meal kits with ingredients for quickly preparing dinners at home.\n“Four years ago, we started to wonder: What would shopping look like if you could walk into a store, grab what you want and just go?” a narrator says in a video about the store concept, called Amazon Go, which the company posted online on Monday.\nAmazon Go Promotional Video Video by amazon Amazon did not say what its expansion plans were for Amazon Go. If they are anything like the what the company has done with its other bricks-and-mortar stores, new locations will open elsewhere slowly over time as Amazon learns how customers use the first one.\nAmazon opened its first physical book store just over a year ago in a Seattle shopping mall. It has added others in the San Diego and Portland, Ore., areas and has said it will open new book stores in Chicago and Boston.\nAdvertisement\n  It is also working on an another grocery store concept that would allow customers to order food items online and then pick them up quickly by pulling into parking stalls. Two such stores are under construction in Seattle, according to documents filed with the city’s planning department and people with knowledge of the effort who asked for anonymity because the plans were confidential.\nPia Arthur, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the grocery pickup locations.\nIn the grand scheme of Amazon’s business, analysts consider the retail stores to be an infinitesimal portion of the more than $135 billion in sales expected from the company this year.\nBut the plans reflect a growing recognition by the company that certain categories of shopping are unlikely to move completely online. In some cases, it is simply more convenient to buy items in a store or more attractive to browse for them on physical shelves.\n“The way we think about it is the size of online retail is going to continue to grow dramatically but there will always be an offline option,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “They’re trying to streamline and capture a portion of that offline experience.”\nAmazon still views technology as being useful in overhauling shopping in traditional retail shops. While the company has not said exactly how the Amazon Go stores will work, visitors will gain entry to them through a smartphone app. The company said the stores relied on a variety of technologies similar to those in self-driving cars, including those defined by buzzwords such as “computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning.”\nUnanswered for now are questions about how the stores would handle shoplifting and whether there would be employees on hand to check identification cards for alcohol purchases.\n  We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

      "text": "December 05, 2016 at 09:45 AM EST Tech Today: Going ‘Cautious’ on Apple, Amazon ‘Go,’ Fitbit #1 Here some things going on today in your world of tech : Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) are down $1.50, or 1.3%, at $108.40, amidst news of both its rumored ambition in driverless vehicles , and more spot checks of the health of iPhone . On the latter score, boutique house BlueFin moves to a “cautious” rating on the stock, from “positive,” after “supply chain checks” make the analysts, John Donovan and Steve Mullane worried that March quarter iPhone sales will be “well below Wall Street consensus.\" Pacific Crest ’s Andy Hargreaves , who has an Overweight rating, cuts his price target to $127 from $129, after cutting his estimates to “roughly in line with consensus” for December and for all of fiscal 2017. On the matter of self-driving vehicles, Reuters ’s David Shepardson reported Saturday that a five-page letter from from the head of Apple’s “product integrity,” Steve Kenner, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dropped hints about the company’s interest in things like “ machine learning ” related to transportation.",

      "text": "Amazon opens a grocery store with no checkout line Sells 'grocery essentials,' pre-made meals Author: By Seth Fiegerman Damir Loretic/CNN NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - \nAmazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. Related Content The NFL is now hiring \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.

No, it's not shoplifting—it's a reality at Amazon Go, the retail giant's new grocery store in Seattle that is opening to the public in 2017. \nTo shop, you download the Amazon Go app and scan it on your way in. The store and its shelves are equipped with \"computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,\" so it knows when you pick stuff up and put it back. So you just shop around, adding items to your bag, and when you're done, you walk out and the app will charge your Amazon account—no waiting, no sizing up which checkout line will move the fastest. They're calling it... Just Walk Out Shopping. Not a revolutionary name, but a pretty big leap in convenience and retail technology. \nCheck out more about Amazon Go in the video below or on the FAQ page . Would you try Amazon Go?

      "text": "More recently, he has threatened to clamp down on companies moving jobs overseas . \nDespite the convincing nature of Trump's anti-offshoring argument, Amazon Go proves the biggest danger isn't jobs going overseas, but rather the march of technological progress. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , 856,850 Americans were employed as grocery store cashiers in May 2015, the most recent data available. Theoretically, Amazon Go's model grocery store puts a chunk of these jobs at risk. Include all cashiers (there doesn't seem to be a reason the Amazon Go model couldn't work for say, clothes or books) and that's roughly 3.5 million people in roles that are at risk of being automated away. \nJoe Raedle / Staff / Getty Images \nTo put that into perspective, t he World Trade Organization estimated that between 2001 and 2013 the US had lost 3.2 million jobs due to outsourcing to China. This isn't an apples to apples comparison, but the numbers are striking. \nThat's not to say that every cashier job is going to disappear overnight. Amazon is only opening a pilot Go store in Seattle next year. And cashier jobs have held remarkably steady over the last decade, even as online shopping became the dominant trend in retail. \nThe change, however, highlights the ever-shifting landscape of the American workforce. \nThis point isn't a new one. Everyone from liberal, Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman to Republican Senator Ben Sasse have noted that technological developments are a bigger threat to American workers than trade. The World Economic Forum estimated 5 million jobs in 15 developed economies are at risk of automation by 2020 and Citi projected that 57% of jobs in OECD nations are at risk of automation. \nIn heavy manufacturing, jobs once done by multiple humans are being replaced by robots. Panera Bread is trying out machines that take and deliver your order, all without a human server. Even in journalism there are programs that are starting to automate simple article writing. \nScreengrab via Bloomberg \nHoward Marks, the founder of investment firm Oaktree Capital, riffed on this topic earlier this year, pointing out that US manufacturing output is near an all-time high, even though US manufacturing employment is down 37% since the peak in 1979. \n\"Perhaps if the government wants to preserve jobs it should just outlaw productivity gains,\" he said . \nThat, of course, isn't feasible. There is likely a long-run benefit to making processes more affordable and quicker. \nRather, the point is that refocusing the labor market on the jobs and skills that will be needed in the future is a productive way to allow innovation and keep America employed. \nThat kind of policy was barely mentioned in Trump's campaign. In fact, the president-elect hardly mentioned the issue of technological advances destroying jobs at all, so it appears to be a huge blind spot in his proposed economic plan. \nTrump is focused on the wrong problem when it comes to the labor market. Instead of getting old manufacturing jobs back from overseas, the government should be focused on retraining workers for the new labor market.

After evaluating hundreds of submissions and judging on dog toppings and dog name creativity, the management team of the Charlotte’s favorite Hot Dog and Sausage joint today named its 12 Finalists. \nBeginning Wednesday, December 7 through Saturday, December 17, each finalist has one day to promote and sell his or her Hot Dog. One winner, based on most hot dogs sold for that day, will win a $150 Amazon Gift Card and have bragging rights for one year that their Hot Dog ruled its respective day and the 2016 holiday season in the Queen City. The finalists, their dog name, their day to sell and the toppings each chose, include the following (images of all of the dogs are available upon request): \nCojita Please \nJJ’s Original Hot Dog (Sahlen’s Smokehouse Hot Dog) Charred Poblano Corn, Avocado Mash, Cojita Cheese and Cilantro Lime Crema \nWho Left the Dog Out? \nThursday, 12/8/2016 Davis Cary – Who Left the Dog Out?

The brand raised national eyebrows for two years running by being honored by Fast Casual in its annual Top 100 Movers & Shakers list. JJ’s is the smallest chain to ever make the list and the only Hot Dog/Sausage concept to receive the honor. In addition, JJ’s has swept all of Charlotte’s Best Hot Dog awards in 2016 and most recently, JJ’s was named by Tabelog as One of The 10 Most Unique Hotdog Joints in America and was cited by Spoon University as The 50 Best Foods to Eat in Charlotte Before You Die and as one of 10 Best Hot Dog Joints Across the State by North Carolina’s Our State magazine. \nAbout JJ’s Red Hots \nJJ’s Red Hots is the premier purveyor of “hand-crafted” char-grilled hot dogs and sausages with two locations and several portable vehicles in the Charlotte metropolitan area. The restaurant concept is built on solid, hardworking values and is modeled after venerable establishments like Ted’s in Buffalo, NY, Gene and Jude’s in Chicago, and many others. Still, JJ’s is a true American original featuring house-made, scratch prepared sides and toppings served alongside time tested, revered American brands like Weber’s Mustard, Martin’s Rolls, Cheerwine and Coca-Cola. Perhaps most proudly, JJ’s Red Hots serves smokehouse hot dogs from Sahlen’s Meat Packing Company in Buffalo, NY. Sahlen’s is a 146-year-old company that remains family owned and operated, and makes, in our opinion, the best hot dogs in the world. \nContact: 150PR for JJ’s Red Hots 704-941-7353 Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes, all others at least 20 minutes.

      "text": "You can now ask Amazon Echo to pay your credit card bill \nIf you’re an avid Google Home or Amazon Echo user, you should know or already are aware that both of the home assistants can and do record your voice. They’re listening, and they’re definitely keeping track of what’s been said. This isn’t a new concept or anything like that. Your internet history and activity online is recorded every time you visit a site, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the ‘always-listening’ devices in your home are retaining some of that data. \nThat means each time you make a request with your voice the snippets of your request are processed and sent to a server to analyze what you’re asking for and to return results in a manner that’s useful for you. Obviously, the innards of Google Home and Amazon Echo aren’t the end all be all of what’s required to make the devices work, so they’ve got to relay the information to be quick and snappy. Anything you say, however, before commanding Alexa or Google Home is not recorded. \nBut the reason why either device would even listen in the first place has to do with “wake words,” as explained in this Wired article . The process has much to do with buffering data and ensuring the products don’t miss out on a request by being too slow. So by keeping an “ear” out so to speak ensures the machines can do what you need them to as soon as you ask instead of there being a delay. There are security measures in place to keep the information that could be heard in your home out of the hands of hackers, but with any information shared on the internet, there’s the potential that someone could get a hold of your communications. \nIn short, yeah — the assistants do record you, but it’s for a good reason, and you don’t have to worry what’s being done with this communication. It’s all in the name of making these products more helpful. If you’re worried about sharing confidential information they may not be for you. Share",

      "text": "via plus.google.com Stay on target Amazon lets you make Alexa audio adventure games You can now ask Amazon Echo to pay your credit card bill If you’re an avid Google Home or Amazon Echo user, you should know or already are aware that both of the home assistants can and do record your voice. They’re listening, and they’re definitely keeping track of what’s been said. This isn’t a new concept or anything like that. Your internet history and activity online is recorded every time you visit a site, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the ‘always-listening’ devices in your home are retaining some of that data.\nThat means each time you make a request with your voice the snippets of your request are processed and sent to a server to analyze what you’re asking for and to return results in a manner that’s useful for you. Obviously, the innards of Google Home and Amazon Echo aren’t the end all be all of what’s required to make the devices work, so they’ve got to relay the information to be quick and snappy. Anything you say, however, before commanding Alexa or Google Home is not recorded.\nBut the reason why either device would even listen in the first place has to do with “wake words,” as explained in this Wired article . The process has much to do with buffering data and ensuring the products don’t miss out on a request by being too slow. So by keeping an “ear” out so to speak ensures the machines can do what you need them to as soon as you ask instead of there being a delay. There are security measures in place to keep the information that could be heard in your home out of the hands of hackers, but with any information shared on the internet, there’s the potential that someone could get a hold of your communications.\nIn short, yeah — the assistants do record you, but it’s for a good reason, and you don’t have to worry what’s being done with this communication. It’s all in the name of making these products more helpful. If you’re worried about sharing confidential information they may not be for you.",

Amazon.com is calling this a \"just walk out\" shopping experience. It tracks which items you take off the shelf and even, which items you put back. Everything is stored in your virtual shopping cart as you browse. Amazon says it spent four years developing this concept and it borrows technology from self-driving cars, computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning.",

      "text": "You have successfully emailed the post. × You can get a free $50 Amazon gift card when you sign up for Dropbox Pro today only Dec. 5, 2016, 4:57 PM 0 \nThe Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nBusiness Insider \nLooking to make 2017 the year you take advantage of the cloud? \nAmazon has struck a deal with Dropbox, the platform-agnostic cloud storage system with an exclusive deal. \nIf you buy a one-year subscription to Dropbox Pro — that gets you a full 1TB of cloud storage — Amazon will throw in a $50 gift card. \nThat halves the initial investment in the subscription if you're a frequent Amazon shopper. If you haven't used Dropbox, here's a primer to help you understand why this is a good deal. \nA lot of people talk about \"the cloud\" as a nebulous thing that exists. You can keep files on it, get files from it, and even back your phone up using it. Every major tech company has a cloud solution: Apple, Google, and even Amazon all want you to use their cloud. The problem is that some of them only work, or work well, on one platform. \nDropbox is platform agnostic. That means it's available everywhere: Need files synced between a Mac and PC? Fine. Android and iOS? Easy. iOS, Android, Mac, and PC? No problem. \nHere's how it works: You sign up for a Dropbox account and download their client. Dropbox lives as a folder on your computer, and anything you put into that folder is then synced to Dropbox's servers. \nAll you have to do to access it on any other machine is log into your account. It's a good, but flawed way to do backups of your computer. You'll still want a local backup, but keeping a copy of important documents can't hurt. \nYou can choose to share certain files or folders with people, which is useful if you're collaborating on a big project. All the other people will need is a generated link to that specific folder. Collaborators won't be able to see anything else you have in Dropbox. \nYou can get Dropbox for free, but you only have 2GB of storage. A pro account nets you 1TB — that's 500x that much. There are also pro-only features, including shared folder permissions (let some folks only view the folder's contents while others can add to it), shared link passwords, and shared link expiration dates. \nMost crucially, pro users can remote wipe their Dropbox. That means if one of your devices with access gets stolen, you can set it to automatically delete Dropbox access to that machine the next time it's turned on. \nIf you're just getting started with cloud storage, Dropbox Pro's annual subscription fee might seem like a big investment. With Amazon's deal, though it's a lot easier to recommend. \nThis is a one-day-only sale, though, so if this all sounds appealing, you have to act quickly. \nDropbox Pro (1TB), $99.99 (annually), available at Amazon Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team. We aim to highlight products and services you might find interesting, and if you buy them, we get a small share of the revenue from the sale from our commerce partners, including Amazon.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Worried about what to get the loved ones this holiday from the tech world?\nBarclays analysts Blayne Curtis and company are here to help.\nHe and his colleagues today offered up a note on what gadgets are hot this season, and what to look forward to in the upcoming CES gadget fest that kicks off in Las Vegas on January 3rd.\nThe point of the exercise, from an investment standpoint, is to show off companies the analysts cover, such as Apple ( AAPL ) and Amazon ( AMZN ), and the chip companies that supply them, such as Cirrus Logic ( CRUS ) and Silicon Labs ( SLAB ).\nFor each category of gadget, the analysts offer a summation of where the market stands.\nIn the area of audio gadgets , the authors see Cirrus as a should-have-been winner, but one that missed out amidst an onslaught of wireless headsets and wireless speakers : \nCRUS is an early enabler of lightning and USB-C noise cancelling headphones, but they missed our list this year given the delays in manufacturing, which pushed the launches into Q1:17. Instead we focused on the wireless audio side, which Apple championed with its AirPod release. Unfortunately, Apple is also seeing manufacturing delays and we left the AirPods off the list as well, but we are hopeful they are available by late December as the product appears very compelling based on announced features. What we did include is two categories – Bluetooth (BT) wireless headphones and BT speakers. The BT speakers offer a fun portable way to project sound and increasingly they are linked to the Internet, which starts to blend this category with IoT/home automation. We ultimately chose the wireless Bose headset for this category given it’s still the de facto standard for noise cancelling headphones, and this is the company’s wireless version of a very popular product line. We see the launch of the AirPods as the next milestone for wireless audio as it utilizes a proprietary wireless technology to deliver independent stereo sound while the rest of the world will have to wait for BT LE to arrive. \nThe authors single out for special mention products such as the Bose “QuietComfort 35” headphones; the Jaybird “ X3 ” headphones; the JBL “ Pulse 2 ” wireless speaker; and Sonos ’s “ Play 1 ”\nThe Internet of Things “is a product category that has received a lot of hype in recent years but has largely failed to deliver on its promise.”\n“It seems like that is finally beginning to change,” write the analysts.\nThey highlight five products in IoT, including Amazon’s “ Echo ” appliance; the Philips “ Hue ” LED lights; Rachio ’s “ Smart Sprinkler Controller 2 ”; Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) “ Nest ” security cam; and the Kwikset “ Kevo ” “ touch-to-open smart lock .”\nThey seem to zero in on Amazon as the category winner:\nAmazon’s Echo products are the first devices to really deliver on the promise of home automation. The Alexa enabled speakers allow you to seamlessly stream music throughout your home while also controlling your Thermostat, Lights, AV equipment, and other devices with natural language voice commands. We like the Dot for the low price and ability to connect to discrete speakers. \nIn the category of wearables , they highlight Apple’s “ Watch Nike+ ,” a special version of the new second-gem device developed with Nike ( NKE ); Garmin ’s ( GRMN ) “ Vivosmart HR+ ”; Fitbit ’s ( FIT ) “ Charge 2 ,” and privately held China telecom giant Huawei ’s “Huawei Watch.”\nThe authors write that wearables are “ currently still clearly finding their way ” as a category. Curtis’s colleague, Mark Moskowitz , follows Apple, and the firm’s opinion is that the company is “a clear leader in the high end of the market even though the product has been less successful to date than many hoped,” and they add, “We chose the Apple Watch Nike+ based on high build quality, tight integration with the iPhone, clear focus on fitness applications.”\nFor smartphones , they choose Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7-Plus, Samsung’s “ Galaxy S7 ,” Google’s “ Pixel ,” and Lenovo Group ’s ( 0992HK ) Motorola unit’s “ Moto Z .”\nThe authors offer that suppliers to watch most in smartphones are Broadcom ( AVGO ), Skyworks Solutions ( SWKS ), Qorvo ( QRVO ), “with additional effects on Intel ( INTC ), CRUS, and Texas Instruments ( TXN ).”\nIn the category of drones , products to watch are DJI ’s “ Mavic Pro ” and Parrot ’s “ Bebop 2 .”\nFor virtual reality gaming stuff, you know the suspects: HTC ’s “ Vive ” and Facebook ’s ( FB ) Oculus unit’s “ Rift ,” and also Sony ’s ( SNE ) “ PlayStation VR .”\nThey also note the Nintendo ( 7974JP ) “ NES Classic Edition ” console and the Sony PS4 Pro update to the console.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here some things going on today in your world of tech :\nShares of Apple ( AAPL ) are down $1.50, or 1.3%, at $108.40, amidst news of both its rumored ambition in driverless vehicles , and more spot checks of the health of iPhone .\nOn the latter score, boutique house BlueFin moves to a “cautious” rating on the stock, from “positive,” after “supply chain checks” make the analysts, John Donovan and Steve Mullane worried that March quarter iPhone sales will be “well below Wall Street consensus.”\nPacific Crest ’s Andy Hargreaves , who has an Overweight rating, cuts his price target to $127 from $129, after cutting his estimates to “roughly in line with consensus” for December and for all of fiscal 2017.\nOn the matter of self-driving vehicles, Reuters ’s David Shepardson reported Saturday that a five-page letter from from the head of Apple’s “product integrity,” Steve Kenner, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dropped hints about the company’s interest in things like “ machine learning ” related to transportation.\nJ.P. Morgan ’s Rod Hall writes “we like the fact that Apple is clearly working on auto software though it is likely a few years down the road before the company is able to realize any revenue from these projects.”\n“More importantly, we see Apple’s focus on machine learning as critical to the future of the company given the importance of these systems in the future.”\nShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) are up 14 cents, or 0.6%$, at $23.99, after Gabelli & Co .’s Hendi Susanto started coverage of the stock wth a Buy rating, and a $29 price target,” writing that “ CEO [Meg] Whitman has successfully led strategic initiatives to lower costs, improve the company’s performance, engage in transformative transactions, unlock value and strengthen the product portfolio.”\nShares of Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL ) are down 19 cents, or 1.4%, at $13.83, after Goldman Sachs ’s Mark Delaney cut his rating on the stock to Sell from Neutral, writing that “most of the positive catalysts investors were looking for are now priced in.”\nShares of Amazon.com ( AMZN ) are up $6.50, or 0.8%, at $746.84, after the company this morning unveiled “ Amazon Go ,” which lets you walk into retail outlets and take things off the shelf without having to stop to pay for them. “No lines, no checkouts,” says an Amazon video on the matter . Items are automatically added to an electronic payment system via an app. The technology is currently featured at Amazon’s brick-and-mortar store in Seattle.\nResearch firm IDC this morning reports that wearables technology shipments rose by 3% in Q3, to 23 million units, with most of it, 85%, being fitness devices. Fitbit ( FIT ) had 23% market share, up from 21% a year earlier, while China’s Xiaomi held second place at 16.5%. Garmin ( GRMN ) was in third place, and Apple at 4th place. Apple fell to 4.9% from 17.5% a year earlier, a 71% decline. \nFitbit shares are down 4 cents, or half a percent, at $8.10.",

But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. From Amazon Previous Next \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nThe-CNN-Wire",

      "text": "Amazon’s ambitious physical retail plans extend well beyond its new cashier-less convenience store unveiled earlier today. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal , Amazon hopes to ultimately operate more than 2,000 grocery and convenience stores across the US in a number of different formats. The goal is for Amazon, the biggest online retailer in the US, to completely control the physical flow of products from its warehouses to the end consumer, opening up the possibility for a more robust delivery network and a retail presence that rivals Target and Walmart. \nOf the three varieties of stores Amazon is considering opening, the convenience store model is the most concrete. Earlier today, the company took the wraps off Amazon Go, an ambitious cashier-less store in its hometown of Seattle that uses artificial intelligence and sensors to track which items consumers take off shelves. That way, you can simply walk out of the store without having to go through a checkout line. This gives Amazon a critical way to track consumer buying behavior offline. \nAmazon is poised to completely reinvent physical retail The other store formats Amazon is considering include a smaller drive-thru variety and a huge, European-style discount chain. The drive-thru prototypes are weeks away from becoming a reality, The Wall Street Journal reports, with two stores under construction in the Seattle area. The larger discount chain model would involve constructing 30,000- to 40,000-square-foot stores that combine instant purchasing with a kind of IKEA model. That way, consumers could order in-store via touchscreens or online and then pick up the finished packages curbside later on. \nThis is all part of Amazon’s grand plan to become the logistics backbone of retail, both online and offline. More brick-and-mortar locations make it easier for the company to conduct grocery delivery through its Amazon Fresh brand. And as more customers begin turning to Amazon for groceries and everyday supplies, the lower Amazon can bring its prices as it scales upward and purchases inventory in larger amounts. The deeper these layers intertwine, the more likely a consumer is to subscribe to Amazon Prime, which will surely begin incorporating offline benefits to complement its free shipping and video freebies. \nAt the end of the day, Amazon wants to sell consumers any and every product it can, while having the network to move that product into a person’s home that very same day. With planned physical locations that cater to every style of shopping, the company is well on its way to realizing that vision. \n- Source: The Wall Street Journal",

      "text": "No cash? No time to wait? No wish to stand in close proximity to another human? No problem, says Amazon, which has announced a new store that makes use of sensing and artificial intelligence to do away with the checkout altogether.\nThere’s just one shop so far, in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle. Called Amazon Go, its modest 1,800 square feet of retail space has a very time-poor kind of customer in mind. There are ready-to-eat meals, basic groceries, and meal kits to cook at home lining its shelves.\nBut the experience of buying goods from this store is certainly not one for the privacy advocates among us. Upon arrival, you have to scan an app to pass through the entrance—like you do with a digital boarding pass. From this point on, it knows you’re there, and can keep track of what you do.\nAmazon says that the store uses on-shelf sensing and computer vision to keep track of every item that you pick up, adding each one to a list to charge you for later. (Though it can also remove items when it sees you put them back). When you leave, it double-checks the list by detecting the items you’re removing from the store.\nThen it charges your Amazon account, leaving you to eat your sandwich without having to stand in line for a single moment. This, it seems, is how people shop in the future.\nThe Amazon Go store uses on-shelf sensing and computer vision to keep track of every item that you pick up. It joins a history of attempts to automate the grocery store. Keedoozle tried its luck in 1937 with a system of conveyor belts, glass cabinets, and personalized keys to remove people from the process, though it shut down when its back-end couldn’t support its popularity.\nEarlier this year, a supermarket in Sweden opened that uses an app to grant access to customers, though it demands people scan barcodes via their phone —essentially working on a tech-enabled trust model, with CCTV as backup.\nAmazon looks to be running a much tighter ship. While finding ways to circumvent the system may appeal to hackers, it sounds as if most ordinary folks would find themselves unable to cheat a system bristling with sensors and cameras that monitor shoppers’ every move.\nIf it works as advertised, lifting products off the shelves and simply walking out may become the new way to shop (as opposed to shoplift)—part of Amazon’s bet on the idea that delivering unparalleled convenience will keep customers coming back.\n(Read more: “ Amazon's Next Big Move: Take Over the Mall ,” Amazon Go , “ Amazon Wants to Disrupt the Bodega ”)",

      "text": "MORE SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon is testing a grocery store in downtown Seattle that lets customers walk in, grab food from the shelves and walk out again, without ever having to stand in a checkout line.\nCustomers tap their cell phones on a turnstile as they walk into the store, which logs them into the store's network and connects to their Amazon Prime account through an app.\nThe service is called Amazon Go. It uses machine learning, sensors and artificial intelligence to track items customers pick up. These are then added to the virtual cart on their app. If they pick up an item they later decide they don't want, putting it back on the shelf removes it from their cart.\nThe Seattle-based company calls it, \"Just walk out technology.\"\nWhen the customer leaves, the app adds up everything the customer has taken and charges their Amazon account.\nAmazon said it began to work on the project in 2012. It is currently being tested by Amazon employees at the location at 2131 7th Ave., near Amazon's offices, but will open to the public in early 2017, the company said.\nThe technology \"is amazing,\" said Phil Lempert, a food marketing expert based in Los Angeles.\nHe's even more intrigued by the multiple images of \"meal kits\" show in Amazon's video. These \"everything you need to cook a quick, high-quality dinner\" kits have become popular but the economics of delivering them has meant they're difficult to make economically viable. Stores such as Amazon Go may provide a sweet spot for them.\n\"When you look at the store itself in the video (and presumably it is the actual store) they have done a great job of merchandising and having \"meal kits\" available is simply brilliant. As the meal kit industry struggles due to the shipping/logistics aspect,\" Amazon go could be a venue where they could succeed, said Lempert.",

No lines. No registers. \nThat's a project Amazon started on four years ago. The result is Amazon Go . \nSEE MORE: Walmart Is Eliminating 7,000 Office Jobs Across The US \nCustomers enter the store using the free app on their phone. As they shop, items are added to their virtual cart. When shoppers leave, their Amazon account is charged for whatever they picked out. \nThe concept has garnered some criticism as being the next step to phase out cashiers — at 3.4 million people, it's the country's second-largest occupation. \nAutomation has increasingly been seen as a threat to service employees. A former McDonald's executive recently blamed the high cost of U.S. labor for the company's decision to roll out automated ordering kiosks . \nBut Amazon's new store idea is a bit more ambitious than a touchscreen menu. \nSimply put, it's a form of artificial intelligence that learns constantly. The system tracks shoppers with cameras, and sensors detect when they pick something up or put it back. \nSEE MORE: How Self-Driving Cars Could Make Pedestrians More Annoying \nCreators compare the \"Just Walk Out\" technology used in the store to what enables self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning algorithms. \nThe single beta store is located in Seattle, and it's only open to Amazon employees.

      "text": "(\"The Man In The High Castle\" ad.Amazon) \nAmazon's original series \"The Man in the High Castle\" has quickly become known for its provocative marketing. \nLast year, advertisements for the first season of the show — which depicts a world in which the Allies lost World War II — included seats in New York City subway cars on its shuttle line between Times Square and Grand Central covered in the US flag with a German imperial eagle and iron crosses on one side and Japanese rising-sun flags on the other. \nAmazon puled the ads due to public outrage over the Nazi-inspired imagery.\nNow for season two, Amazon has ads of the Statue of Liberty giving the Nazi salute (also known as the Hitler salute). A giant billboard of Lady Liberty giving the salute is now up in Times Square, Gothamist reports.\n\nStatue Of Liberty Gives Nazi Salute In Huge Times Square Billboard For Amazon's 'The Man In The High Castle' https://t.co/OS7uS7QLM6 pic.twitter.com/YGhvpfENP2 \n— Gothamist (@Gothamist) December 5, 2016 People on Twitter can't help but compare the ad to the current political landscape, in which there have been reports of Nazi supporters celebrating the victory of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nA month ago this was just a TV ad. Today, I can't help but have a more queasy feeling seeing this. #themaninthehighcastle #election2016 pic.twitter.com/W9cfjZlRHj \n— Lawrence Neals (@LNealsNYC) December 4, 2016 \nI mean this probably isn't realistic *enough* at this point https://t.co/GIGMAWJij6 \n— Chris Evangelista (@cevangelista413) December 5, 2016 The ad also showed up on IMDb. Some people have been outraged by the advertising.\n\n@IMDb are you aware your site features an image of the Statue of Liberty giving a Nazi salute???? Very poor taste. pic.twitter.com/1SGh1o8LuC \n— Daniel A. (@TheReal_DannyA) November 29, 2015 \nHey @IMDb um i think your website has been hacked considering theres a Statue of Liberty giving a Nazi Salute lmfao? pic.twitter.com/hP8DnKsWz1 \n— Scott Farkus (@Dommili29) November 22, 2015 Business Insider reached out to Amazon for comment but did not receive an immediate response. \nNOW WATCH: 7 details you may have missed on episode 9 of 'Westworld' \n\nMore From Business Insider \nHere are the most popular Netflix original shows ranked, according to a research company \nThe 20 best things you can now download and watch anywhere on Netflix \nA 'Fuller House' star makes his directing debut on the new season, and the creator was 'nervous'",

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Amazon hopes to ultimately operate more than 2,000 grocery and convenience stores across the US in a number of different formats. The goal is for Amazon, the biggest online retailer in the US, to completely control the physical flow of products from its warehouses to the end consumer, opening up the possibility for a more robust delivery network and a retail presence that rivals Target and Walmart .\n\nOf the three varieties of stores Amazon is considering opening, the convenience store model is the most concrete.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking Reuters Dec 5, 2016 at 4:51 pm | Print View \nAmazon.com Inc’s new bricks-and-mortar grocery store doesn’t have at least one thing that supermarkets have — lines at the checkout counter. \nThe online shopping giant’s new 1,800-square-foot convenience store, Amazon Go, in Seattle uses sensors to detect what shoppers have picked off the shelf and bills it to their Amazon account if they don’t put it back. \nAmazon Go, currently available only for its employees, is expected to be publicly available early next year, the company said on Monday. \nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches and dinners made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.

      "text": "Photos:Todd Williamson/ Getty Images \nJeff Bezos, the head of Amazon, and Matt Damon hosted a holiday party for Manchester By The Sea this weekend in LA. That’s officially what they’re calling it, a “holiday party”, which, I guess is a new euphemism for “campaign event”? It’s not like they’re actually exchanging gifts there. Why are we pretending this is anything but what it actually is? Never mind. Why am I bothering to ask? Pretending, after all, is what everyone’s been doing around Casey Affleck’s past and those sexual harassment allegations which is what Duana and I are talking about on this week’s podcast, still not officially titled. But we’re getting closer to removing that question mark after Working Class. \nDid you know that Shia LaBeouf was also up for the role that Casey ended up getting in The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford? At least according to Shia? More and more, actors are talking about what they’ve unsuccessfully auditioned for, most recently Taraji P Henson last week. The question here though is: do you have to reach a level of success before you can actually talk about that sh-t? Speaking of success – the Oprah Winfrey Show and the new podcast about how it was made and the work involved in making it. We call it producer porn but, really, why isn’t it everyone porn? It’s work porn. And it’s, like, kind of a requirement, isn’t it? \nHere’s our third episode – available on iTunes by end of day! Related on LaineyGossip",

      "text": "| Cool Stuff Found \nAmazon’s servers provide the backbone for much of the Web, and while upload speeds are improving , what happens when you need a few dozen petabytes backed up to the cloud? Enter Amazon Snowmobile, literally a giant truck with a mobile data center capable of physically moving up to 100 petabytes of your data to Amazon’s cloud servers. The concept is the evolution, both in name and function, of the company’s “Snowball” service, which ships customers data units with capacities up to 80TB. As for price, it’s in the “if you have to ask…” category, although Amazon says it aims to make the Snowmobile cheaper than any network-based data transfer which, even at gigabit speeds, would take a while.",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.",
