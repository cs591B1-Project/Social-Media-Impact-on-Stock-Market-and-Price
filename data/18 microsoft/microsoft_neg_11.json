      "text": "Hacking news , Technology Chinese Security Researchers Hack Microsoft’s Much Vaunted Windows 10 Edge Browser in 18 Seconds \nGone in 18 seconds!!! The much vaunted Microsoft’s Edge browser that it ships with Windows 10 OS was hacked in just 18 seconds. This feat was achieved at the PwnFest being held in Seoul. \nOn Thursday during the PwnFest 2016 event within Seoul’s Power of Community security conference, a team from vulnerability firm Qihoo 360 and South Korean security researcher JungHoon “Lokihardt” Lee demonstrated two different hacks that took advantage of vulnerabilities within Microsoft Edge, completing one in a mere 18 seconds. \nThe researchers used the Edge internet browser running on a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Anniversary Edition (aka Redstone 1), to remotely execute code at the system level. For this effort, the Qihoo Team and Lokihardt won $140,000 from the organizers. \nThe team discovered vulnerabilities in the Windows 10 browser enabled system-level remote code execution. To better understand system-level access, you have to look at how device operating systems are layered in a security sense. At the top layer, consumers will see the applications they normally use. Under that are device drivers with low privileges followed by device drivers with high privileges further underneath. The final, bottom layer consists of the operating system’s central core, aka the kernel, that controls everything. Running a malicious program below the “user” layer grants a hacker special privileges that can go undetected by the device owner. \nThe Qihoo 360 team was working on developing the attack for the past 6 months. However, the team had to revise the code within 30 hours prior to the Pwn fest as Microsoft patched 3 out of 4 vulnerabilities available for attack. \nThe event also witnessed the world’s first attacks on VMware Workstation 12.5.1, thanks to another Qihoo 360 team and Lee who won $150,000 for the exploits.",

      "text": "By Shreyas Gandhe News Reporter Neowin LLC @__shreyas · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft launched a $14.99 DVD Player app for Windows 10 , which was rather buggy and needed workarounds for a bearable experience . The app is still in development and has been updated frequently since then. Now, the Insider Preview version of the app on the Fast ring has received a significant update that squashes numerous bugs and promises a better user experience. \nAs per Microsoft's announcement, the following enhancements are introduced in the DVD Player Preview app: Now when you insert a DVD into the drive while the app is running, it will automatically read the DVD. No longer do you have to manually tell the app to look for a disc in the drive. Playback bar is simpler and more polished so that it’s easier to use. Less used actions are now hidden under the “…” menu The closed caption button is included in the playback bar The look and feel is modeled after the Movies & TV app Playback bar is now disabled when there is no DVD in the drive. If your DVD drive region does not match the region set in Windows, the app will prompt you to change the region of your DVD drive to continue. Basic keyboard interactions are now supported: double-clicking on the video will go full screen, escape will exit full screen, spacebar will pause/play. We improved the keyboard navigation and made Narrator strings clearer. If you have the N SKU of Windows installed, the app will recognize the lack of Media Foundation Package and prompt you to install it. \nIf you happen to own this app and are a Windows Insider on the Fast ring, you might have already received the update; if not, you can head to the Store and search for updates manually. Let us know what you think about the update in the comments section below! \nSource: Feedback Hub (Open via Microsoft Edge) Tags",

      "text": "Microsoft Finalizes Windows 10 and Releases it to Manufacturers   Uncategorized Comments 0 \nMicrosoft will finally finish the improvement of Windows 10 this week! Right after ten months of testing and a number of preview builds, Microsoft will initially release Windows 10 to makers this week, and after that, as you probably know, to standard users, on July 29th. \nFor prior versions of Windows RTM process was really large deal, but for Windows 10, just like lots of other stuff, it was changed. Microsoft is pushing Windows to a “Windows as a service #8221″ mode, which suggests that the operating system will receive new updates frequently, and much more than ever. This can be precisely why it is actually believed that Windows 10 are going to be the last version of Windows, and that Microsoft won’t release the new operating technique. \nWindows chief Terry Meysrson mentioned “We will by no means be completed, #8221″ which suggests that Microsoft will almost certainly concentrate on updating Windows 10, rather than building a brand new operating system. This could be the double-edged sword, simply because Microsoft won’t take the risk of producing one more unsuccessful operating method, like it was the case with Vista following buy cheap microsoft office and Windows 8 right after Windows 7, but however, people may get fed up with Windows 10 and demand a transform. Only the time will show us what will be the scenario. \nBut Microsoft is undertaking an incredible job with Windows 10 and its updates, just as a reminder, the firm released even three builds for Windows 10 Technical Preview last week, with much more than 300 bug fixes, which can be impressive. And when Windows 10 gets released for the producers, the corporation will continue to work on final improvements and bug fixes with the method till the release of the final version on July 29th. Members of Windows Insider system will likely be the first ones to obtain the new operating method, but some customers will receive Windows 10 a few days later than other people.",

Founder Eugene Kaspersky took to the company’s blog to explain how Microsoft is hurting security companies, eventually calling for an investigation against the software giant in Russia and the European Union. First and foremost, Kaspersky says, Windows 10 disables incompatible security software when installing OS updates and replaces them with Windows Defender. And while at first glance this might seem like the right thing to do, what people didn’t know is that Microsoft is now giving developers only one week to test their security solutions and make them compatible with new OS version, down from no less than two months.

In a blog post today, the company explains that it focused specifically on these steps in order to bolster security in the case of ransomware, so Windows 10 Anniversary Update fights against threats even before they reach your computer. For example, Adobe Flash Player, which is one of the software solutions that are most often attacked by cybercriminals, runs in Microsoft Edge in an isolated container, which means that any successful exploit using one of its vulnerabilities cannot be expanded to system level. Furthermore, Microsoft locked the browser, so an exploit ru...",

In the last couple of days, Microsoft rolled out updates for two different apps available for insiders, both of which come with improved live tiles – what it’s worth noting is that while these updates are currently shipped to insiders only, they should become available for everyone very soon, after Microsoft collects the feedback it’s interested in. First and foremost, the MSN News app has been updated to version 4.17.72.0 and one of the highlights is the introduction of chaseable live tiles. This means that whenever you tap a story displayed in the live tile on your Start, the first thing you’ll see when the app launches is that story, mak...",

(Source: Reuters) \nDonald Trump winning the US presidential elections, shocked the world as he defeated Hillary Clinton to head the most powerful country in the World. The 2016 US presidential election is arguably one of the most convoluted and hateful ones ever, with the maximum divide between the people. As a matter of fact, reports have suggested, both Clinton and Trump were the most unpopular presidential candidates ever. After Trump’s win, people reacted in extremes, giving conflicting reasons. This has prompted the heads of top tech giants to address the win and the employees. In such uncertain times, the sentiment is quite evident in the addresses of the tech executives. Trump, according to his earlier campaign speeches has an ‘American-centric’, and it is expected that companies which outsource jobs to countries like China, India and others, will have to pay higher corporate taxes. So, in an uncertain situation, agreeable or not, the CEOs will have to look for opportunities, but at the moment they needed to assure their employees. But is that what most of these CEOs did by taking a middle ground? \nFacebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post wrote: “Holding Max, I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children. This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line. The most important opportunities of Max’s generation — like curing all disease, improving education, connecting everyone and promoting equal opportunity — will take a long-term focus and find new ways for all of us to work together, sometimes over decades. We are all blessed to have the ability to make the world better, and we have the responsibility to do it. Let’s go work even harder.” \nAlso read | Is Facebook responsible for Donald Trump becoming the President? Here’s how it influenced the US election results \nApple CEO Tim Cook, wrote a memo to Apple employees: “We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. While there is a discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.” \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a LinkedIn post, said: “Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. With that in mind and looking to the future, Brad Smith today outlined in a blog Microsoft’s thoughts and recommendations for the new Administration and Congress .” Please Wait while comments are loading...

      "text": "Microsoft Windows: ‘Gigantic’ tip for freeing hard disk space By J. Carlton Collins, CPA Related Information Management and Technology Assurance Q. What's the best way to free up space on a computer hard drive? A. My short answer to freeing up space on a computer hard drive is to not waste your time freeing up hard drive space; instead, I recommend that you add more hard drive space. Rather than replacing your existing hard drive (which can be a complicated and time - consuming process), either add an external USB hard drive to your computer or sign up for free cloud - based storage using Microsoft's OneDrive.com website (or a similar cloud - based storage solution). However, if you want to rid your computer of unnecessary files, here are a few tips for accomplishing this goal. 1. Delete large data files. Open an Explorer window, navigate to This PC (or My PC ), and search your computer using the phrase size:gigantic. (You could also search size:gigantic from the Start Menu .) This action will identify all of the files on your computer greater than 128 megabytes. As an example, I performed this action on my computer and found 431 files larger than 128 MBs, including six Outlook data files totaling 58.27 gigabytes, 40.18 GBs of which were unnecessary duplicate files (as pictured below). Therefore, this tool has assisted me in reclaiming an additional 40.18 GBs of hard drive space. 2. Run Disk Cleanup. Windows includes a built-in tool that automatically locates and deletes temporary files and other unimportant data files. To access this tool, open an Explorer window, navigate to This PC (or My PC ), right-click one of your hard drive icons (one at a time), and select Properties , and then on the General tab, click the Disk Cleanup button (a portion of the Disk Cleanup dialog box is pictured below). In my case, Disk Cleanup identified up to 3.84 GBs of leftover installation and other temporary files that could safely be deleted from my hard drive. 3. Clear browser caches. Because the Windows Disk Cleanup tool doesn't delete temporary files used by other programs, such as the Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browsers, you will need to remove those unnecessary files separately, as follows: Internet Explorer. Select Tools , Internet options , and on the General tab in the Browsing history section, click the Delete button, check the box for each type of history file you want to delete, and then click the Delete button. Chrome. Select History from the Chrome menu, and then on the History screen, click the Clear browsing data button, check the types of history files you want to delete, and then click the Clear browsing data button. Firefox. From the Firefox menu select History , Clear Recent History , select the types of files you want to delete, and then click the Clear Now button. Microsoft Edge. Select the More menu (displayed as three dots) in the top right corner. Next, select Settings , and then in the Clear browsing section area, click the Choose what to clear button. Select the types of history files you want to clear, and click the Clear button. \n4. Uninstall unnecessary applications. To remove unnecessary applications, launch Control Panel and select Programs and Features to view all of your installed applications, including the amount of hard drive space required by each application. On my computer, I noticed I have the KompoZer application installed, though I no longer use it. Since it takes up only 22 MBs, it's hardly worth the time to delete it, but removing the application will help keep my computer less cluttered; therefore, I left-clicked on the application and chose to uninstall it (as pictured below). \n5. Other measures. Other possible measures include reducing the amount of hard drive space dedicated to the System Restore function, searching for and deleting duplicate files, or running a third-party hard drive cleanup tool such as Piriform's CCleaner ( piriform.com/ccleaner ). \nAbout the author \nJ.

      "text": "Summary \nDonald Trump’s surprise election victory could be an unexpected boon for Microsoft shareholders. \nTrump's Tax Plan would not only mean a one-time dividend amnesty but also a reduction in the business tax rate from 35% to 15%. \nIf Microsoft were to repatriate $50 Billion of its overseas hoard to the United States, dividend investors could see a special dividend equivalent to a yield of 5.28% to 10.55%. \nMeanwhile, Trump’s tax plan could boost Microsoft’s earnings by around $0.02 per share for every $5 Billion in profits. \nOverall, we see the Trump Tax Plan as providing Microsoft’s dividend shareholders with the potential for a One-Year Total Return of as much as 21%. \nTrump Wins - is a Dividend Amnesty in Play? \nAs the markets digest the victory of Donald Trump and his potential impact on the US Economy, blue chips like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) are looking at one area where Trump has been decidedly pro-business: a special one-off 10% tax on the profits of US Corporate Subsidiaries. This would be a 25-percentage point reduction from the tax's current level and is likely to pass easily through a Republican-controlled Congress . \nFor Microsoft, which could have as much as $113 Billion in cash stashed overseas by the end of 2016, Trump's plan implies a huge tax savings windfall. It also takes some of the bite out of any potential adverse EU tax rulings - perhaps not on current income, but certainly future earnings if the 15% business tax rate that Trump has proposed also applies to earnings from overseas. \nDividend and Outlook \nMicrosoft's current dividend yield of 2.58% remains among the lower ones of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's technology components - IBM (NYSE: IBM ), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) all have higher dividend yields, though only Cisco stands to earn a huge windfall from Trump's plan with its $62 Billion in overseas cash . Nonetheless, Microsoft's yield is still nearly 40 basis points better than the yield of the S&P500 . \nWhat would a 10% Tax amnesty do for Microsoft investors? Depending on whether Trump's tax plan also provides relief on dividend income to complement the amnesty, Microsoft could elect to pay special dividends - much in the same way that it did in 2004 . Investors should note that during the last tax amnesty in 2004, when congress pushed through George W. Bush's Homeland Investment Act (which had an even more generous one-time rate of 5.25%), companies used 92% of the windfall to increase dividends or share buybacks . \nIn our view, returning money to shareholders is likely the path Microsoft would take on whatever portion of cash it would send back to the United States - whether it's in the form of added dividends, share buybacks or some combination of both. \nNaturally, some investors might wonder if Microsoft shouldn't elect to pay down its debt with the repatriated money. After all, at the end of its fiscal 2017 first quarter (which ended on September 30), Microsoft had nearly $14 Billion of cash and $123 Billion of short-term investments against total debt of close to $75 Billion. \nThe answer is fairly simple: debt capital is cheaper for Microsoft. To illustrate: When Microsoft issued $19.75 Billion in multiple maturity bonds this past August, it sold these for around 180-basis points above the relevant Treasury Yields. If we assume that it could get similar pricing today, that works out to just 3.8% for a 10-Year bond compared to its equity cost of 9.5%. \nAll else being equal, if Microsoft returned $50 Billion to investors (meaning it would have to repatriate around $55.6 Billion to account for the 10% tax), it could lower its weighted capital cost to 8.62% from 8.7%. That doesn't seem like much but if it reduced its debt by $50 Billion, its weighted capital cost would actually increase to 9.21%. In short, debt capital is cheaper than equity capital - and even if Microsoft were to repatriate $50 Billion, it would still have over $60 Billion in overseas cash. \nThat being said, we don't see Microsoft returning all its overseas stash. For one thing, paying a one-off tax of 10% on its repatriated monies would actually be more than the taxes it currently pays in some of its overseas domiciles , which could fall as low as 1% in some cases. For another, Microsoft could elect to make overseas acquisitions and given Trump's pre-election rhetoric, his administration could just as well introduce protectionist policies that would penalize companies for deploying capital overseas. \nIncidentally, a $50 Billion cash dividend would work out to a special one-time dividend of $6.34 per share, for a special dividend yield of 10.55%. \nAnother thing that Microsoft could do with its excess capital is to increase its share buybacks. Let's say that Microsoft elected to repatriate $50 Billion of its overseas hoard and paid half as a special one-time dividend equivalent to a 5.27% yield and while deploying the rest of the funds to buy back shares. It already has an existing buyback plan of $40 Billion and raising that by $25 Billion would enable the company to reduce its share count by another 5.7%. If we applied this theoretical buyback to its fiscal 2017 first quarter results, its earnings per share would have been $0.63 per share, rather than the $0.60 per share that it reported. \nThe other benefit of Trump's tax plan is a reduction in Microsoft's effective overall tax rate, which was around 11.9% in the last four quarters. If we assume the same distribution of Microsoft's cross-company revenues as in the past , but applied Trump's 15% business tax rate, its effective tax rate would come down to around 8.7%. That would have been equivalent to additional earnings of $0.02 per share during Microsoft's fiscal 2017 first quarter. \nConclusion \nAll things considered, Trump's tax plan is a huge boon for Microsoft's investors. In addition to Microsoft's already solid prospects for the current fiscal year, which started with the company beating earnings estimates by $0.08 per share in the first quarter and was driven by its strength in the cloud , the plan creates the potential for a windfall dividend for investors and higher earnings per share in the form of lower tax bills and an increase in its share buybacks. \nOn this basis alone, Trump's tax plan represents a solid incentive for dividend investors to buy Microsoft shares - or to increase their existing positions. The Redmond giant, which has a price target of just $65 in the next year , could potentially boost its 1-year total return from a middling 10.6% (i.e. a potential capital appreciation of 8% plus dividend yield of 2.6%) to a solid 21.2%, depending on how much of its overseas stash it elects to repatriate.

To participate, eligible students must take, and pass, a MOS exam (Excel, PowerPoint or Word) before 15 May, 2017.

      "text": "Microsoft’s problems in Russia continues, as the Federal Antimonopoly Service has decided to start an investigation against the Redmond-based software giant amid claims of unfair practices regarding antivirus software in Windows 10. Russian-based security company Kaspersky complained that Microsoft is abusing of its dominant position by forcing users to stick with Windows Defender in Windows 10, while also implementing changes that impact the adoption of third-party software. Founder Eugene Kaspersky explained that Microsoft has reduced the period of time the company offered to software developers for testing purposes from 2 months to 7 days, and this led to many security apps being flagged as incompatible and replaced with Windows Defender. The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) is now investigating these claims...",

      "text": "Microsoft's iOS app augments hues for color-blind people November 12, 2016 - 12:15 AMT \nPanARMENIAN.Net - Color Binoculars landed on the App Store, promising to infuse the real world with color for anyone with the three most common forms of color blindness. This isn't the first app designed to help color-blind folks see a broader spectrum of colors, but it comes from two Microsoft software engineers (one of whom is color blind), and its straightforward filter method is simple to use, Engadget reports. \nThe app uses the iPhone camera to adjust colors in a way that makes them easier to distinguish for color-blind people. The enhanced image shows up on the iPhone screen, allowing users to pick out flowers, choose matching outfits or take in the beauty of fall, for example. \nTom Overton and Tingting Zhu started working on Color Binoculars during Microsoft's 2015 Hackathon and they finished it in the company's Garage program, which helps experimental apps go public. Overton is color blind, so he was both a developer and the app's main tester. \n\"It's an app that helps color blind people distinguish color combinations that they would normally have trouble telling apart,\" Overton tells the Microsoft blog. \"For example, since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious. It replaces difficult color combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.\" Related links:",

      "text": "Microsoft Office Apps for Android Will Be Officially Supported on Chrome OS Reddit \nGoogle's fast-growing Chrome OS recently got the ability to run Android apps , adding a huge breadth of apps to the platform. However, apparently there were some Chromebooks that were not compatible with Microsoft Office apps for Android. Now, Microsoft has clarified that these are teething issues and every Chromebook will soon be able to run Office apps for Android without any problems. \nAccording to a report by 9to5Google , some Asus Chromebook Flip users earlier encountered the message 'unsupported on this device\" when attempting to download Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, or OneNote. Though other Chromebook users were able to use the apps without any problem, this led to questions if Microsoft was blocking some Chromebooks from using these apps, since the presence of Microsoft Office adds an important feather to Chrome OS's cap, increasing the platform's appeal for enterprise users. \"Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store. While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability,\" Microsoft told 9to5Google, implying these are just teething issues.\nLike on other platforms, Chrome OS devices with screen size less than or equal to 10.1-inch will be able to open and edit Office documents for free, but more advanced features will require an Office 365 subscription. On devices with displays bigger than 10.1-inches, only viewing documents is free, and everything else requires a paid subscription. Incidentally, the Asus Chromebook Flip comes with a 10.1-inch display and its users will be able to edit Office documents for free, once the chinks are ironed out.",

      "text": "Posted By: Arash Fekri   Technology Page 1 of 2 1 2 » \nIt’s been quite some time since tech enthusiasts have heard any news about the much-gossiped Microsoft Surface Book 2. The Microsoft Surface Book 2, has been overshadowed by another product of the Microsoft family, the Microsoft Surface i7. The newly launched Microsoft 2-in-1 laptop is indeed worthy of all the adoration it is getting. \nGiven, its unrivaled performance specs and power, lead many skeptics to believe that the Microsoft Surface i7 is, in fact, Microsoft Surface Book 2. \nHere’s what we know till now, the new Microsoft Surface i7 newly launched in the Microsoft October event, to the pleasure of several laptop fans. The highlight of the device was its dual-core Intel Core i7-6600U chip, consisting of a custom NVidia GeForce GPU. \nIt also came boasting a 1GB GDDR5 memory, according to PCWorld. It’s hyped as the “crème de lacrème,” and is manufactured by giants like Microsoft and Intel themselves. Leading many people to believe that it might be the Microsoft Surface Book 2 they have all been waiting for. \nPreviously, people thought that the Microsoft Surface Book 2 would sport the upcoming Intel Kaby Lake processors plus, the Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU. According to TechRadar, it is also believed to support 4K video and architecture. \nOn the wish list of major upgrades and changes, what Microsoft fans wanted, was to see longer battery life of Microsoft Surface Book 2. This is because the laptop allegedly drains only after use of 4 hours. While the Surface i7 has a battery life of 16 hours reportedly. \nAnother wish list for the Microsoft Surface Book 2 was a development on its prominent feature: the hinge, as it was susceptible to accumulate dust and receptacles. Fans wanted a separable screen, or, at the very slightest, a hinge that is functional. \nAlthough we know that expecting the Surface Book 2 to come out this year would be mere wishful thinking. However, we can certainly hope that in the coming year it will be launched alongside the also much awaited Microsoft Surface Pro 5. \nAccording to rumors The Redmond-based tech Goliath was expected to the seventh-generation of Intel processor, the Kaby Lake in this new model of the successful notebook. It will be a complete blessing for the Surface Book 2, the Kaby. It will make the use of USB 3.1 Type-C and provide Thunderbolt 3 support. \nThe first should enable faster and more effective data transmission and battery charging. While the latter is labeled the fastest, most adaptable connection to any dock, display, or peripheral device, which ought to offer smooth connectivity and performance on the Microsoft Surface Book 2. \nThe latest processor from Intel, toincreaseKaby Lake will also be manufactured on a 14-nanometer technology, it is to increase the performance of the chips by 12 percent about the Skylake, which is the among the initial Microsoft Surface Book and the i7 variety exhibited last month. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book 2 is also likely to have a much better display, and this will also be to the credit of the Kaby Lake because it will enhance the performance of the graphics. \nAccording to TechRadar, as far as the design is concerned, on the front Microsoft has to think of a way of detaching the display from the software-based keyboard, a less complicated job. They have to do it in such a way so that it could be done even when the device is off. Page 1 of 2 1 2 »",

      "title": "Surface Phone rumors: Microsoft to announce the device in early 2017",
      "text": "  \n(Microsoft Official) Shown in the photo is the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL. Rumor has it that Microsoft will replace its Lumia line with the Surface Phone. Rumors claim that Microsoft will unveil the device early next year. \nAlthough Microsoft has been mum on its alleged Surface Phone, many still expected that the device would be unveiled at the Microsoft event last month. However, after being a no-show at the said event, it is now rumored that Microsoft will unveil the Surface Phone in early 2017. \nAccording to various reports , Microsoft may launch its Surface Phone within the early part of 2017. While the phone is said not to be in direct competition with those more popular brands that run on Android, rumors claim that the Surface Phone may share the market with Apple's iPhone as, reportedly, it will come with features that are targeted toward the business sector â thanks to its rumored Windows 10 OS, which, indeed, is ideal for business people. \nTo support its alleged Windows 10 OS, rumors also claim that the Surface phone will come with Snapdragon 30, which is said to be currently developed by Qualcolmm. \nEarlier, there were also rumors claiming that the Surface Phone would come in three variants based on its RAM, with the premium model boasting of 8 GB internal storage paired with 512 GB internal storage. Advertisement \nIt is also said that the alleged device will boast of a 5.7-in AMOLED screen, 21-megapixel rear camera, and a USB-C port. \nMeanwhile, with the news on Microsoft ending the production of its Lumia Phones, the line of phone it acquired from Nokia in 2014, speculations on the existence of the Surface Phone have become even louder. Furthermore, suspicions on the tech giant soon releasing a new line of phone to replace its Lumia have become even more persistent when, last September, Laura Butler, Microsoft's director for engineering, said on her Twitter account that the \"Surface Phone is not NOT confirmed.\" \nMany tech pundits couldn't help but jump to the conclusion that there is, indeed, a surface phone as the tweet has double negatives, which means affirmative. While some believe that the said tweet must not be given much weight, as the double negatives can just be a typographical error, many think otherwise as the second \"not\" was written in all caps.

      "title": "Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer says smartphones caused rift with Bill Gates",
      "text": "Steve Ballmer said his decision to push Microsoft into the hardware business contributed to the breakdown of his relationship with longtime friend and company co-founder Bill Gates. Ballmer's only regret: not doing it sooner.\nBallmer, who was chief executive officer of Microsoft for 14 years, told Bloomberg Television that if he could do it all again, he would have entered the mobile device market years earlier. When he finally did, Gates and other members of the board disagreed, he said.\nBallmer, now owner of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, told Bloomberg Television's Emily Chang, that he and Gates have \"drifted apart\" partly due to a disagreement over whether Microsoft should make its own handsets and tablets.\n\"It was definitely not a simple thing for either one of us,\" he said. There was a \"little bit of a difference in opinion on the strategic direction of the company.\"\nBallmer said they had a \"brotherly relationship in the good parts and the bad parts.\"\n\"Towards the end, that was a bit more difficult than not, particularly with the strategic direction change and you know, the stock price isn't going anywhere, so the rest of the board felt pressure -- despite the fact that profits were going up -- so I think you had kind of a combustible situation,\" he recalled.\n\"There was a fundamental disagreement about how important it was to be in the hardware business,\" Ballmer said. \"I had pushed Surface. The board had been a little -- little reluctant in supporting it. And then things came to a climax around what to do about the phone business.\"\nMicrosoft entered the market in 2012 with the Surface RT, a tablet that sold poorly and required Microsoft to take a $900 million charge to write down the value of inventory. Now, the rejiggered Surface business is profitable and generated more than $4 billion in sales for the most recent year.\nMicrosoft's foray was a mess almost from the start, with Microsoft's board rejecting Ballmer's initial plan to acquire Nokia's handset unit. By the time the $9.5 billion deal closed, Ballmer had handed the reins over to Satya Nadella and the Nokia business was in tatters. Microsoft has now written down almost the entire value of the deal and laid off most of the workers.\nBallmer said the mistake was getting into handsets and tablets too late.\n\"I would have moved into the hardware business faster and recognized that what we had in the PC, where there was a separation of chips, systems and software, wasn't largely gonna reproduce itself in the mobile world,\" he said.\nWhat about that famous quote where Ballmer said Apple Inc.'s iPhone would never sell because it cost too much? He now wishes he'd realized how Apple was going to make it work -- through mobile carrier subsidies.\n\"I wish I'd thought about the model of subsidizing phones through the operators,\" he said. \"You know, people like to point to this quote where I said iPhones will never sell, because the price at $600 or $700 was too high. And there was business model innovation by Apple to get it essentially built into the monthly cellphone bill.\"\n  Business Technology Bloomberg",

      "title": "Kaspersky accuses Microsoft of anticompetitive bundling of antivirus software",
      "text": "Billionaire Russian anti-virus developer Eugene Kaspersky has penned an angry blog post titled \" That's It. I've Had Enough! \" to complain about Microsoft and Windows 10. Specifically, Kaspersky argues that the way Microsoft bundled Defender with Windows 10 is anti-competitive: he says that Microsoft has created obstacles to third-party products and is acting against the interests of the developers of third-party security software.\nAccordingly, Kaspersky says that he has filed complaints with competition authorities in the EU and Russia. He asks that they force Microsoft to cease the behavior he feels is anti-competitive.\nMicrosoft has integrated anti-malware software to ensure that every Windows system has a basic level of protection without requiring any additional third-party purchases or installations. Here's how the Microsoft setup works, and the way it has worked since Windows 8 : built-in MS anti-malware software automatically disables itself if it detects a third-party product is installed and up-to-date. Microsoft chose this behavior to keep its OEM partners happy, since many of them depend on kickbacks from pre-installed third-party antivirus software.\nIf the third-party product expires, Windows will show warnings for a few days. If the user does nothing after this period, the expired product gets disabled, and Defender turns on.\nIn his post, Kaspersky complains about a number of specific Windows 10 behaviors that he views as problematic.\nFirst, when upgrading to Windows 10, the operating system detects certain unsupported antivirus programs and uninstalls them as part of the upgrade process. Even if the user elects to \"Keep personal files and apps\" during the upgrade, anti-malware software won't make the cut.\nFurther, Kaspersky argues that when Windows 10 and its subsequent major updates were released, antivirus developers had no real opportunity to develop compatible software. Only a handful of days separated a release hitting the Insider Program and shipments to end users. Microsoft has, in fact, shipped a warning with recent Insider Preview builds that the builds are not compatible with certain third-party antivirus software and that third party software will be removed.\nTo remedy this, Kaspersky demands that regulators force Microsoft to \"provide new versions and updates of Windows to independent developers in good time so they can maintain compatibility of their software to Windows.\" It's not clear why, and Kaspersky does not explain why, the Insider Preview program does not adequately fill this role. Other developers, both of software and hardware device drivers, have used the Insider Previews to ensure that their software works correctly with each major release of Windows 10 at launch.\nSecond, Kaspersky wants the install/upgrade behavior to change. He wants Windows to be more explicit that installation will remove incompatible third-party anti-malware software. He also wants Windows to specifically recommend the installation of compatible third-party versions after the upgrade. Currently, the clear notification that incompatible software has been removed during the upgrade is only shown after the upgrade has occurred. \nThis change would likely appeal to a wide range of third-party developers. Anti-malware isn't the only software that is regularly detected as incompatible; other applications, such as certain VPN clients and system maintenance utilities, suffer the same fate.\nThe final MS behavior that Kaspersky criticizes is a subtlety of the way Windows defaults to Defender. Windows' method has two prongs. The first: Windows warning screens encourage users to enable Defender—an act that disables third-party products—even if the third-party product is currently active and up-to-date .\nEnlarge / Clicking that yellow button turns on Defender and disables third-party antivirus, even if the third-party antivirus is working correctly and up-to-date. The second is a somewhat contrived situation. Let's say a user with a third-party antivirus application installs a trial of a second third-party application which temporarily disables the first application. At the expiration of that trial, Windows reverts not to the first third-party application, but instead to Defender. To address this, Kaspersky wants Windows to always explicitly ask before enabling Defender.\nKaspersky's blog post paints Microsoft's decisions around Defender as part of a broader effort to squeeze out third-party developers. Kaspersky claims this squeeze-out is harmful to Windows users and suggests that antivirus software is simply following in the footsteps of browsers and multimedia apps (both of which have caused regulatory issues for Microsoft in the past). He claims that not only are third-party developers suffering as a result of Microsoft's decisions, but so too are Windows users. In his eyes, Microsoft is building a \"totalitarian/police-state platform in which there's no place for independent developers or freedom of choice for users.\"\nRegardless of how regulators respond, one thing is clear: they won't move fast enough to change anything any time soon, because they never do. Past remedies, such as \"Windows N,\" which shipped without Media Player to appease EU regulators after they fined the company €497 million (£395 million/$784 million) , served no demonstrable purpose at all, as nobody bothered to actually use them, unsurprisingly preferring the version of Windows that retained Media Player.\nOne of Kaspersky's proposed remedies—delaying the release of major Windows updates to give antivirus developers more time to update—feels positively anti-consumer, as it means delaying the availability of bug fixes, security updates, and new features.\nEven requiring explicit user confirmation before enabling Defender seems hard to justify: if anti-malware software is as essential to safe computing as anti-malware software companies would have us believe, it should run by default, without user intervention, to ensure that protection is in place. An explicit confirmation means that some users will be left unprotected and exposed, and this does not seem beneficial.\nOn the other hand, the above screenshot looks ominous and is likely to encourage Windows users to unwittingly switch from third-party products to Defender. It's hard to see how this is a desirable piece of design. Similarly, the way installing Windows quietly uninstalls incompatible applications has frustrated many users. Being more explicit about compatibility issues early in the upgrade process will allow upgraders to make more informed decisions.\nAs well as calling for regulators to take action, Kaspersky calls for independent software developers to \"form a united front and all fight together\" against Microsoft.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan AdTech on Azure How MediaBrix, a mobile AdTech company, is using half a dozen Microsoft cloud data components to get its work done. | Topic: Big Data Analytics \nMicrosoft has an array of components in its cloud for data management and analysis. There are the obvious ones like Azure SQL Database , Machine Learning and HDInsight ; more infrastructural ones, like Azure Data Factory and Azure Stream Analytics ; there are IoT-related services like Azure IoT Hub and there are several others you may not even know much about. \nSo, while it's easy to see how Microsoft has its bases covered, it's less obvious whether and how these services fit together. And testimonials from customers using a great many of these services in an integrated fashion may seem few and far between. \nPoster child I found one though: MediaBrix , a five-year-old mobile advertising technology (AdTech) firm, based right near me in New York City, and focused on \" moment-based targeting .\" I spoke with MediaBrix's CTO, Christopher Beach , who explained in nerdy detail which parts of the Azure data stack his company is using, and how they're tied together. \nBefore Beach's arrival, MediaBrix was on Azure, but using a different collection of services and technologies. The new scheme retains elements of the old one, but modernizes and consolidates things quite a bit. Doing so has cut MediaBrix's monthly spend in half, from roughly $10K to roughly $5K. \nThe data pipeline While MediaBrix collects data into its 50TB corpus across a 24/7 period, it tends to process that data in batch jobs that currently run during just a fraction of the day. Data sources include telemetry data, device performance data, ad performance feeds and data from Data Management Platforms (DMPs -- essentially advertising/audience/marketing data warehouses) like Oracle's BlueKai and others. \nA lot of the data is ingested via Azure Event Hubs and Stream Analytics, then landed in Azure Blob storage , where it can be processed in different ways. For one, it can be brought into Azure SQL Data Warehouse , using the PolyBase technology that is built into that platform. MediaBrix uses Azure Premium Storage with SQL DW, to keep performance reliably consistent. Once it's in SQL DW, the data can be queried directly via T-SQL and can also be aggregated for further analysis into SQL Server Analysis Services multidimensional cubes. \nAlso read: Cloud data warehouse race heats up \nUnplug One of the neat things about Azure DW is that it can be paused -- which is to say shut down for long durations -- causing compute charges to cease, and only storage charges to persist, until it's resumed. While I've been personally a bit skeptical of adoption of this feature, MediaBrix uses it liberally -- in fact the company only keeps its Azure SQL DW up for about five and a half hours each day. \nHow is the data queried when the DW is off? Well, bear in mind that Analysis Services cubes contain a materialized view of the aggregated data, so analytical and data discovery queries can be run against the cubes regardless of whether the DW is online or off. \nOther possibilities But here's another twist: MediaBrix is looking at using Azure Data Lake Store , in place of vanilla Blob storage, as a place to land ingested data. This would then allow users to leverage Azure Data Lake Analytics and the U-SQL language to query the raw data, even when the warehouse is paused. \nOther technologies used include .NET/C# to build API-based services in front of the data, and some use of Azure Machine Learning (ML) for predictive analytics. MediaBrix is now investigating the use of R Server , in place of Azure ML, for reasons of cost. With SQL Server R Services now part of SQL Server Enterprise , the company can foresee the day when R Services is also part of Azure SQL Database or Data Warehouse, allowing MediaBrix to \"productionalize\" scoring of data against predictive models in an economical fashion. \nIn the unmanaged days... What did the old stack consist of, you might ask? In addition to the Blob Storage and SSAS components used now, it also included SQL Azure Database, SQL Server Enterprise on Azure virtual machines , MongoDB and Azure Table Storage . One striking distance between the old and new slates of technologies is the shift to fully managed services and away from self-managed ones like SQL Server and MongoDB. \nOf course, SQL Service Analysis Services can now run only on-premises or in Azure virtual machines, so that's one self-managed component that remains. Azure Analysis Services , a managed cloud service equivalent, which just recently entered preview, is a possible replacement, but not until the service supports the classic multidimensional mode of SSAS versus the Tabular mode that's supported in the preview service now. \nAlso read: Microsoft, AtScale make data news at PASS Summit \nThe clergy and the laity Clearly, MediaBrix runs a very sophisticated IT shop and is able to integrate a collection of services in a way that other organizations might be challenged to replicate. But the overall takeaway is clear: companies can today take advantage of IoT, streaming data, data warehouse, big data and SQL-on-big-data bridges, like PolyBase, today, for less than the cost of one mid-level technical employee. It can all be cloud-based, and mostly service-provider-managed, and the services can be composed and integrated. \nIn the future, these services should get easier and cheaper to use and snap together. At that point, finding customers who are taking advantage of such a large portion of the stack will be more commonplace than rare. \nBut for organizations with the right tech talent on staff, that functionality is ready now.

      "text": "\nWhile Microsoft has disabled Windows 10’s Messaging app’s SMS capabilities, as well as added a new Skype Relay app,it still hadn’t answered questions about the future of the Windows 10 Messaging app given its continued presence in Windows 10.\nAt first, the Messaging app’s existence was there to facilitate messaging via Skype Messaging and when that was removed, traditional messaging by SMS. With neither Skype nor Messaging Everywhere now using the Messaging app, some might question the seemingly vestigial presence of the Windows 10 Messaging app on PCs. It turns out, Microsoft still has a use for the client app.\nIn a message in the app, Microsoft says:\nThis app only shows SMS texts from your mobile operator about your data plan (billing, data limits etc,) and only on devices built for high-speed wireless data (LTE)\nIt can also show messages that you’ve sent and recieved from apps such as Skype via SMS relay. It can’t send texts.\nWhat this means is that while the app will remain on all devices, it will remain useful for two camps of people. People who have LTE enabled Windows 10 PCs, tablets or hybrids (Surface 3) and people who have Windows phones (as well as Android phones in the future).\nUsers who don’t want to use the messaging app however can still use Cortana to send texts to other mobile phones and view their texts in the messaging app – at least for now.\nWP-Appbox: Messaging + Skype (Free, Windows Store) → ",

      "text": "Microsoft Arrow Launcher, OneDrive get minor updates By 0 \nNo matter how minor an update, if it brings great new things or improvements to your digital life, then they should be welcomed with open arms. If you use Microsoft apps, you know that they regularly bring updates as they try to build their reputation as an app developer, which in fairness to them, they are actually doing a great job. Today, it’s the turn of Arrow Launcher, an Android personal launcher, and OneDrive, the cloud storage service, to receive some tweaks and turns. \nVersion 2.6 of the Arrow Launcher brings a few changes that long-time users may find useful. You can now customize the size of your icons, which is apparently one of the most requested features in the app. You can now also put shortcuts for apps on the apps page. The widgets page is also now back so you can have a dedicated page just for them. They also promised that memory usage has been optimized so it’s “more memory efficient than ever”, and of course the usual bug fixes and improvements. \nMeanwhile, over at OneDrive, they also have a couple of new features for version 4.6. When you take a photo of a whiteboard after a meeting or a planning session and you upload it to OneDrive, it will automatically clean up the image for you. Then you’ll be able to send it to your colleagues and collaborate on whatever it is you discussed. If you’re using OneDrive for Business, every time someone shares a file with you or one of your teammates edits a file that you shared with them, you’ll get a notification. \nIf you don’t have either Arrow Launcher or OneDrive yet, you might want to give them a try in case you’re looking for an Android launcher or a cloud storage service respectively. Go and download them though their Google Play Store pages. TAGS",

      "text": "Shweta Modgil November 12, 2016 3 min read Inc42 Staff 124 SHARES \nMicrosoft Accelerator released the Ecosystem Report on Indian Enterprise Ready Startups 2016 today at Bengaluru which revealed that banking, retail, and healthcare are the top adopters of startup technologies in India. The report is focussed on those startups that are serving large and small enterprises through deep and complex technological solutions. It showcases 151 enterprise ready startups and the 10 hottest sector s in the country. \nRavi Narayan (Global Director, Microsoft Accelerator), unveiled the report along with Jayanta Dey (Vice President & CTO Manufacturing and Technology SBU at Wipro), Peter Gartenberg, (General Manager, Enterprise and Partner Group, Microsoft Corporation India). Ben Mathias (Managing Director & India Head at Vertex Ventures) and Vinod Muthukrishnan (CEO, CloudCherry) were also present when they released the report. \nRavi Narayan stated, “ We are very happy to note that Indian enterprises are looking at startups for innovative solutions and expertise for their Digital Transformation in India. This Ecosystem Report provides insights into how this enterprise-startup partnership has evolved in last few years, underlining the value of collaboration and building the startup ecosystem.” \nAs per the report, the top 151 Enterprise Ready startups in the ecosystem today are as follows- \nThe 10 hottest sectors came out to be healthcare, retail, banking, data sciences, security, IoT, edtech, manufacturing, media, and IT/ITES. Key Highlights \nThis report focusses on B2B and B2B2C business models, taking market traction and external funding as indicators of growth. It focusses on those startups that are serving large and small enterprises through deep and complex technological solutions. The Accelerator based the evaluation on available data to lend objectivity to the analysis and reviewed close to 500 enterprise-ready startups that were founded post-2000 and are headquartered in India . \nThe methodology, inspired by e=mc2, focusses on Enterprise Readiness Score , which is measured based on three parameters – customer traction, funding, and size of the company. 50% of the Enterprise Ready Startups Are In Healthcare, Retail, and Banking \nDriven by optimisation, these three sectors have emerged as the biggest adopters of enterprise technology solutions. Banking and healthcare have proven to be the most receptive to startup solutions. With the rise of digitisation across sectors, deep technology companies play a pivotal role in empowering these corporates to build innovative ways to engage with customers and address complex business requirements. \nFor example, at ICICI Bank, software robots have been deployed across 200+ processes, resulting in reduced the response time to customers by up to 60% and increased accuracy to 100%. Data Sciences And Security Startups Find It Easiest To Find Customers \nThis is because of the broad base of customers and sectors that these startups can address natively. Disruption of technology has helped these businesses to build deep expertise and position them uniquely vis-à-vis other companies in multiple sectors and domains. Startups Catering To Banking Sector Find It Easiest To Raise Funds \nThe report also noted that startups catering to the banking sector are at the forefront of the digital transformation of India. The tremendous scope of opportunity these startups can leverage is one of the key reasons these startups are successful in attracting funding. \nThe entire report can be viewed here: aka.ms/entreadyindia .

      "text": "Russia Starts Microsoft Antivirus Investigation After Kaspersky Complaint GO Case “opened” against Microsoft, FAS Russia announces Nov 12, 2016 09:14 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft’s problems in Russia continue, as the Federal Antimonopoly Service has decided to start an investigation against the Redmond-based software giant amid claims of unfair practices regarding antivirus software in Windows 10. Russian-based security company Kaspersky has complained that Microsoft is abusing its dominant position by forcing users to stick with Windows Defender in Windows 10, while also implementing changes that impact the adoption of third-party software. Founder Eugene Kaspersky explains that Microsoft has reduced the period of time the company offered to software developers for testing purposes from 2 months to 7 days, and this led to many security apps being flagged as incompatible and replaced with Windows Defender. The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) is now investigating these claims, explaining that Microsoft might violate Part 1, Article 10 of the Federal Law regulating protection of competition. The law “prohibits actions (omissions) of an economic dominant with the dominant position that lead or can lead to preventing, restricting, eliminating competition and (or) infringing the interests of other persons (economic entities) in business activities or consumers at large.” Equality for all companies in Russia Russia says that it’ll look into accusations as it wants “equal conditions” for all companies doing business in the country. “Since Microsoft itself develops antivirus software - Windows Defender that switches on automatically if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time, such actions lead to unreasonable advantages for Microsoft on the software market. Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market,” Deputy Head of FAS Anatoly Golomolzin explained in a statement. This isn’t Microsoft’s only problem in Russia, as the government has recently announced that it would ban LinkedIn , the service that Redmond purchased earlier this year, after it failed to move user data on local servers and comply with Russian laws. Furthermore, Microsoft is at the center of Russia’s push off foreign software, with President Vladimir Putin himself seeing the software giant as a main threat to national security, as he believes that products such as Windows and Office could be used by other governments to spy on the country. Microsoft hasn’t yet issued a statement on Kaspersky’s claim or on this investigation started by Russia, but we’ve already contacted the company and we’ll update the article when an answer is received.",

      "text": "Microsoft Improving Live Tiles in Several Windows Phone Apps GO Transparent and chaseable live tiles part of latest updates Nov 12, 2016 08:23 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Live tiles continue to be a top Windows phone feature and since users love them so much, it’s no surprise that Microsoft is always looking into ways to improve their performance and usability. In the last couple of days, Microsoft rolled out updates for two different apps available for insiders, both of which come with improved live tiles - what it’s worth noting is that while these updates are currently shipped to insiders only, they should become available for everyone very soon, after Microsoft collects the feedback it’s interested in. First and foremost, the MSN News app has been updated to version 4.17.72.0 and one of the highlights is the introduction of chaseable live tiles. This means that whenever you tap a story displayed in the live tile on your Start, the first thing you’ll see when the app launches is that story, making it easier for you to read the content you are looking for. Improved Weather live tile Then, it’s the Weather app which also got updated, in this case with a transparent live tile. If you’re a long-time Windows phone user, you probably know that for some reason, Microsoft isn’t offering transparent live tiles for a few of its apps, as is the case of Weather, Skype, and Office apps. So the new update rolled out today finally brings a transparent tile for the Weather app, which so many of us are using, but it’s not entirely what you’re expecting. Basically, the live tile features transparency only when it’s static and shows the Weather app icon, but when you switch to live tile functionality to display the forecast for a specific location, the same solid-color background continues to be used. Most likely, Microsoft will introduce full transparency in the coming updates, but it’s weird to see a company the size of Microsoft needing so much time for such a little thing like live tile transparency. In the meantime, if you’re a fast ring insider, you'd better grab the new updates from the Store because Microsoft needs feedback to improve live tiles and make them look better on phones and PCs.",

      "text": "Leaked Video Reveals Microsoft’s Discontinued Apple Watch Killer GO Nokia Moonraker smartwatch demoed in hands-on video Nov 12, 2016 07:17 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft is yet to launch a genuine smartwatch, as the Band was more of a smart wristband with activity tracking features, but it turns out that the company was at some point very close to bringing to the market what seems to be the closest thing to an Apple Watch killer. Nokia Moonraker is a smartwatch that was developed by Nokia for the Lumia series of phones, but which was eventually discontinued by Microsoft after purchasing the Devices and Services unit from the Finnish firm. And in a video published today by Nokibar, we finally have a closer look at the Moonraker, confirming what we already knew: this smartwatch was a pretty exciting rival to the Apple Watch, as it was supposed to come with similar design and features. Notification and phone calls support As you can see by yourselves by hitting the play button below, Nokia Moonraker is a smartwatch in all its glory, but it seems to lack more advanced activity tracking - and this could be one of the reasons Microsoft abandoned the project. It has interchangeable bands, customization faces, support for notifications, and integration with the most popular mobile apps, such as Facebook and MixRadio. Additionally, it can display emails and messages, while also featuring phone call support - it’s not yet known if the Moonraker had a speaker and a microphone so you can talk to your contacts, as it’s possible on the Apple Watch, or it was only supposed to let you dial a phone number. The Moonraker also had an app store and included physical buttons to let you access the home screen easily. Double tap was offered to quickly wake up the smartwatch, just like it works on Lumia phones. It goes without saying that this could have been a pretty compelling product, but for some reason, Microsoft decided to kill it soon after the Nokia acquisition. With the Band lineup nearly discontinued, we can only hope that Microsoft still plans to launch a smartwatch and all eyes are on Panos Panay, as a Surface Watch seems to be the most logical step that Redmond could do in the coming years.",

      "text": "Microsoft Reveals How It Made Windows 10 “the Most Secure Windows Ever” GO Windows 10 Anniversary Update offers best security, it says Nov 12, 2016 06:51 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft improved security features in Windows 10 Anniversary Update, and this helped the company achieve what it describes as “the most secure Windows ever,” as it not only fights against malware but it can also prevent, detect, and remove ransomware. In a blog post today, the company explains that it focused specifically on these steps in order to bolster security in the case of ransomware, so Windows 10 Anniversary Update fights against threats even before they reach your computer. For example, Adobe Flash Player, which is one of the software solutions that are most often attacked by cybercriminals, runs in Microsoft Edge in an isolated container, which means that any successful exploit using one of its vulnerabilities cannot be expanded to system level. Furthermore, Microsoft locked the browser, so an exploit running in Edge cannot execute another program on your system. Additionally, Windows 10 Anniversary Update fights ransomware with email protection using machine learning models and heuristics to detect links and email file attachments distributing infected files. And last but not least, machine learning is obviously playing a key role in prevention, with Microsoft saying that it’s investing massively in identifying and blocking malware more quickly. Windows Defender comes built-in As far as the detection phase is concerned, it all comes down to Windows Defender, which itself integrates improved features, such as cloud protection and automatic sample submission. If a system is infected, Microsoft says that Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) will come to the rescue by alerting security teams about breaches, providing security events information and cloud analytics. Microsoft says that users who want to benefit from this improved security need to update to Windows 10 Anniversary Update “and accept the default security settings,” but also to keep machines up to date with the latest updates. And last but not least, backups are super important, just in case something goes wrong and you need to restore your files or settings.",

      "title": "Nokia Moonraker shown off in new video, the smartwatch that could have been",
      "text": "  \nNokia has been noted to work on a smartwatch before Microsoft’s acquisition of the company’s hardware division in 2014. The Moonraker was discontinued by Microsoft Mobile and unfortunately never saw the light of day. The watch featured a nice and clean design bundled with an operating system that matched the design of Nokia software for Windows Phone at the time. \nThe video that was leaked shows the device in, what we assume, is the state it was in just before the cancellation. The quality of the video leaves much to be desired but what’s important is there. \nThe interface seems a little sluggish and unpolished but that is not a surprise as the device was still under development and never left that state. It features a magnetic charging port, just like the Pebble and supports all the basic features one would expect from a smartwatch. \nThe sad part about this is that this project is already confirmed dead, as the cancellation resulted in the Microsoft Band that is also dead now. For the few of us that use Windows 10 Mobile out there, there are no more first-party or second-party smartwatches available.",

The next generation of Microsoft tablets known as Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 went on sale today, as well as some new Surface accessories. It's now time to reveal more about the 2017 Microsoft Surface Pro 5 as it strikes the market next year. This new Microsoft Surface Pro 5 laptop-tablet model is expected to raise the credibility of Windows Tablets. Science World Report claims that the upcoming Microsoft Surface Pro 5 2-in-1 tablet model will be among the most powerful devices in 2017. Also, it is speculated to be revealed in the spring season of 2017 at the leaked price of USD 883 up to USD 1260. Advertisement Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumored to come with the high-end chipset, the Intel's Kaby Lake and may possibly run on the New Windows 10 Redstone 2 version, as per Master Herald . The said Intel Kaby Lake processor is expected to assure that it will provide the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 with a faster and notable performance. Advertisement Eventually, the screen of this new Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to have the 3,840 x 2,160 pixels, with a ratio or 16:9 or either with a 3,840 x 2,560 pixels, with a ratio of 3:2. Even more, rumors claim that this Surface Pro 5 will be empowered by a 16GB of RAM and a 128GB of internal storage, as well as with the new and popular USB-C ports that had just replaced the USB 3.0 ports. However, the battery of this Surface Pro 5 is said to be a little way similar to the earlier versions. But, it probably comes with the Surface Pen that automatically recharges itself to the tablet as well as the earlier cover keyboard. Consequently, the Redmondian Company, would likely to show off and reveal this Microsoft Surface Pro 5 the best time possible, before suddenly the company was able to find out it was not feasible due to the delay of the Intel's Kaby Lake processor. Mass production of this Intel Kaby Lake processor is not expected to realize until the end of this year. As 2017 is nearly approaching, better not to be negative with the release of this Microsoft Surface Pro 5, for the company is aiming for the best possible beneficial and outstanding features of the device.

When a story you are interested in shows up on the tile, tap it and go straight to the article shown. Some users have pointed out that this may be annoying over time so we will see how this feature will be handled in the future. \nThe update has already been pushed to the Store for fast ring users and should be available to download. The update also includes the usual changelog as following: Performance, reliability and accessibility improvements General bug fixes \nThis is the first time Microsoft has used Chaseable Live Tiles on their products and we hope we will see more in the coming days.",

      "title": "Microsoft Student Contests Emphasize Azure",
      "text": "Microsoft Student Contests Emphasize Azure Written by Sue Gee Saturday, 12 November 2016 \nMicrosoft has increased the prize money for the 2017 Imagine cup and introduced an additional stipulation, Azure is required for all projects. Microsoft is also running a Hello Cloud contest for building cloud development skills. \n\nThe Imagine Cup, Microsoft's flagship contest for teams of students from across the globe, is celebrating its 15th anniversary and Microsoft has: decided to up the ante and double the top prize to $100,000 for the team that is crowned the next Imagine Cup Champion. \nThe explanation for this hike in prize money is that: Student commitment to Imagine Cup has been incredibly inspiring since the competition’s inception, and we felt strongly that their enthusiasm should be met with equal commitment on our [Microsoft's] part. \nThe other significant changes are: First, as cloud technologies become more and more pervasive, we feel it’s paramount that Imagine Cup help student developers prepare for their futures by building skills using today’s premier cloud platforms. To that end, we highly encourage all Imagine Cup projects to showcase one or more Microsoft Azure services within their solutions. Also, we’re changing the way we judge projects. For the 2017 Imagine Cup competition, we’re placing greater emphasis on each project’s underlying technology. What that means is that Imagine Cup will be on the lookout for deep technology integration in fully formed apps, services and games with the potential to be viable in the commercial marketplace. Finally, we’ve decided to forego categories in favor of opening the competition up to apps and solutions that might not have neatly fit into one of those categories in past years . . . in other words, all big ideas are welcome in Imagine Cup. \nReplying to a question about the requirement to use Azure, Pablo Veramendi, Microsoft Imagine Cup Competition Manager confirmed: Azure is required for all Imagine Cup projects including game projects. Almost all of our games World Finalists in the past have used Azure for savegame data as well as leaderboards. I’m sure there are much more innovative ways of using Azure for games projects as well! \nStudents who want to get into cloud computing will find an additional incentive with Microsoft's 2017 Hello Cloud Challenge . From now until June 2017, they have a chance each month to win $1,000 by creating and deploying a web app to the cloud using Microsoft Azure, which is free to students. \nThis contest is a Sweepstake with one entry in the monthly draw for each completed activity. One winner will be chosen each month and sweepstakes entry tickets that are not chosen go forward to the next draw, There are 10 monthly prizes, the first of which has already been awarded. \nThe contest is open to students least 16 years of age as of July 31 2016 and are actively enrolled as a student (including home schools) at any time between 1 January 2016 and 31 May 2017 and not resident in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria \nTo participate: Sign up for Microsoft Azure Complete one or more activities following a step-by-step guide Submit your entry by the last of Wednesday of each month",

      "text": "Microsoft's canceled Nokia Moonraker smartwatch shown in hands-on video Microsoft's canceled Nokia Moonraker smartwatch shown in hands-on video Posted: Tags : Nokia - Nokia + Microsoft - Microsoft + Wearables - Wearables + We've been having news about the so-called Nokia Moonraker for quite some time now, even though the smartwatch hasn't been given the green light. The Moonraker is a smartwatch developed by Nokia and delayed by Microsoft right after the company bought the Finnish company's mobile division.Several pictures of the canceled smartwatch emerged in the past. We even had the chance to take a look at a UI tutorial that surfaced online last summer, so some of you might already know what the Nokia Mooraker can actually do.However, it appears that the Moonraker was more than just a canceled project, it was actually a real device that was only waiting for Nokia or Microsoft to give it the green light. Unfortunately, that didn't happened so we're left with the documentation and pictures that show us what it could have been.Today, we've spotted a new leak related to the Nokia Moonraker , which actually shows the smartwatch in action. The video shows the wearable has features like missed calls, messages, Facebook and steps tracker.The Moonraker features the swipe up/down type of navigation, so it's pretty much a standard UI that many smartwatches have embraced in the past. Check out the hands-on video and share your thoughts with us.",

      "text": "Microsoft Poised to Enter Growing Virtual Reality Market Will Microsoft's plans be enough to compete with Facebook, Google and Samsung? By Leo Sun On 11/12/16 at 5:10 PM Microsoft Event: 90 Second Recap \nThis article originally appeared on the Motley Fool. \nThroughout most of 2016, Microsoft seemed to be a laggard in the virtual-reality market. Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC 's Vive courted high-end PC gamers, Samsung's Gear VR and Alphabet's Google Cardboard introduced VR to mobile users, and Sony's PlayStation VR made PS4 games more immersive. Microsoft, however, merely hinted at Oculus Rift compatibility with its Xbox Scorpio upgrade.   \nBut that all changed in late October at Microsoft's Windows 10 event, which finally revealed the tech giant's VR ambitions. Let's discuss five key things investors should know about the company's upcoming VR headsets. 1. Tethered, with \"inside out\" sensors \nLike the Rift and Vive, Microsoft's VR headsets will be tethered to PCs. That means users can't freely move around as they could with a mobile-based device such as the Gear VR, or a standalone one such as Intel's Project Alloy. \nHowever, Microsoft claims that these new headsets can track a user's head rotation and position without setting up additional sensors around the room. The Rift and Vive, by comparison, both use external sensors to track the headset's position in space. Microsoft claims that its headsets use \"inside out\" sensors that can track a user's position with internal hardware—making it much easier for multiple people to use headsets in the same area. 2. A much more affordable VR experience \nMicrosoft won't make these headsets by itself. Instead, it's relying on its longtime hardware partners HP, Lenovo, Dell, Asus and Acer to deliver the goods. The headsets will start at just $300, which is much cheaper than the $600 Rift and $800 Vive. \nDava J. Newman, deputy administrator at NASA, demonstrates augmented reality with the Microsoft Hololens as she visits the martian landscape with the \"Wall Street Journal's\" Geoffrey A. Fowler at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, October 26. Mike Blake/Reuters \nMicrosoft has also stated that its headsets won't require pricey high-end PCs as the Rift and Vive do. Hololens and VR head Alex Kipman recently told Polygon: \"We've lowered the specs you need for PC from a $1,500 system to a $500 one.\" 3. Possible training wheels for the HoloLens \nDuring the demo, Microsoft's VR headset was entirely controlled by voice commands and hand gestures. That was quite different from the Rift, Vive, or PSVR—which all use external controllers. But those controls closely resembled the ones for the HoloLens. \nSince the HoloLens' development kit costs $3,000 , it remains out of the reach of mainstream consumers. But if Microsoft floods the market with $300 VR devices that use the same controls, they could serve as \"training wheels\" for the HoloLens before it's officially launched. 4. Locking in developers with a big Windows 10 update \nTo establish a new computing platform, Microsoft needs to win over developers. It intends to do so with the upcoming Windows 10 Creator Update, which will add 3D image capture and editing tools. These tools will enable artists and developers to create 3D objects which can be viewed in Microsoft's VR headsets or HoloLens. \nTo reach the largest number of developers, Microsoft is simplifying the tools so that 12-year-olds can use them. If the platform attracts enough new developers, Microsoft's vision of turning Windows 10 into a \"holographic\" OS±as it has repeatedly demonstrated in HoloLens demos—could become a reality. 5. Is this Microsoft's answer to the PSVR? \nMicrosoft has spent a lot of time strengthening the bonds between Windows 10 and the Xbox One, with a shared app store and game streaming. Therefore, it's logical for Microsoft to tether its new headsets to the Xbox One as well. Doing so would help Microsoft counter the PSVR and offer Xbox One owners a way to play new games with VR features. \nThat also means Facebook's Oculus VR and Microsoft won't really be allies in the VR market. The Oculus Rift runs on Windows PCs, but the company is aggressively growing its own VR ecosystem, Oculus Home, which would ultimately clash with Microsoft's vision for an AR/VR-powered Windows 10. Oculus has also been developing its own standalone device, the Santa Cruz headset, which would naturally become a rival to Microsoft's VR devices. The key takeaway \nMicrosoft's VR ambitions seem well planned and could serve as a natural stepping stone between PCs and HoloLens. They could also finally help Microsoft evolve into a market-leading innovator to counter rivals such as Sony, Facebook, and Google across multiple markets. 10 stocks we like better than Intel \nDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: Investing geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market. David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Intel wasn't one of them! That's right—they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nThe Surface Dial came out of nowhere during Microsoft’s event last month. We were all expecting a new mouse, keyboard and device, but most were caught off guard by the introduction of a new kind of peripheral. The Dial almost seems like it came right out of a science fiction novel, letting us interact with our Surface devices in countless ways with just a few simple gestures. \nIn an effort to add to the peripheral’s laundry list of uses, a Windows Platform Developer has written up a program that takes advantage of the Surface Dial API to turn it into a debugging tool. The interface is actually pretty simple, and you can see it in action in the video below. Turn the Dial clockwise to Step-Over, turn the dial counter-clockwise to Step-Into. \nThis was written up by Nico, of the Nico’s Digital Footprint blog. Nico’s blog post shows the step-by-step process to how he managed to pull this off, and could make for a fun project for aspiring developers who want to play around with the Dial. If you decide that you want to do it, you’re going to need a Surface Dial (obviously), Visual Studio 2015, and the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (or any update more recent than that.)",

      "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite \nI have found out that if you delete a file from OneDrive’s Recycle Bin, it is ‘deleted from the server’. But obviously, the server will have backups offline at some Microsoft datacentre. In fact, from what i can ascertain, your data is backed up in at least 2 datacentres at any time. (See e.g. http://o365datacentermap.azurewebsites.net/ ). \nAre these backup copies deleted at some point, and if so, after how long an interval? I'd like to think that if I want something to be deleted that it is permanently deleted and that Microsoft doesn't have a copy. Or at the very least to know where I stand with regards to what happens to my data. Thanks in advance for any replies.",

      "text": "\nPhil Spencer once said at the Microsoft’s January 2015 event that Windows 10 will make “new ways to extend gaming across devices.”\nWith the first release of Windows 10, Microsoft announced its Xbox app which would be bundled with the operating system. This addition allowed gamers to buy games for their devices, communicate and interact with their friends, and the most exciting aspect – the ability to stream their Xbox to their PC. This feature allowed users to continue their existing Xbox experience and game progress on any PC or tablet on the same local network, and with a pretty decent connection and a paired controller, your computer turned into a remote Xbox.\nThere have been rumors for a while that Windows 10 Mobile might be able to jump in on the Xbox action, and with the remote devices prompt that was included in an update to the Xbox app a while back, the excitement was real – only to be foiled by a DPI compilation bug that particular update had since the app was universal.\nNow claimed Microsoft employee Nawzil, who is active on twitter, has posted the above picture, saying he is testing game streaming of Forza Horizon 3 from his Xbox One to his Lumia 950.\nPlaying #ForzaHorizon3 on my #Lumia950 . ?\nStreaming from my #Xbox . ?\nThis feature is already in PC, beta testing on #Windows10 Mobile. pic.twitter.com/O3aMXrPkhp \n— Nawzil (@Nawzil10) November 12, 2016 \n\nWith recent changes Microsoft has added Xbox One Bluetooth controller support to Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile, meaning it should actually be possible to control the game pretty well from your phone.\n\nIf the app supports streaming to Continuum for Phones then it may in fact turn your windows phone into a pretty great Xbox One extender.\nGiven that Nawzil does not have the most reliable reputation we should take this one with a large measure of salt, but this is of course a long overdue feature which we hope Microsoft does finally deliver on.\n",

SHANNON STAPLETON September 23, 2013 07:29pm EDT \nA new contender in the smartphone industry is soon expected, as Microsoft is said to release a new device soon. \nWith the success Microsoft has been receiving due to their Surface line, there are high expectations for their new smartphone. Many are now hoping that Microsoft will be able to go head-to-head with Apple once again. \nThough there is still no official news regarding the matter, reports indicate that Microsoft will soon unveil the Surface Phone. The device is said to be available in three variants, which will each bring innovative features to the line. \nIt is rumored that the Surface Phone will carry an all-metal body design which will be consistent with Microsoft's current Surface line. In addition, new features such as a barometer, compass, fingerprint reader as well as a proximity sensor will be available on the device. Advertisement \nAs for the camera, a Carl Zeiss 20-megapixel back camera could also be included as well as tools that will help users take stellar photos. The Microsoft Surface Phone is said to have an AMOLED screen measuring 5.5 inches. Reports also indicated that the device will most likely run on an Intel Atom X3 processor, which will boost the smartphone's performance. \nIn addition, one of the variants could have a RAM up to 8GB, making it an efficient device. A large storage is also expected, as it is rumored to reach up to 512 GB. \nMeanwhile, there are reports that the upcoming variants will boast similar aesthetics as the leading smartphone brand Apple. That being said, many can expect to see some iPhone-inspired designs for the upcoming Microsoft device. \nUnfortunately, there has yet to be any confirmation on what exactly the device will present. With that, fans are just waiting for January to find out more about it. The device will reportedly release early 2017. Copyright ÂŠ   Like Us",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nIf you’ve been using computers for a while, there’s a chance you may have heard of Kaspersky Labs. Kaspersky is a cyber security suite that’s been seeing a significant amount of use recently among those who refuse to use some of the more mainstream antivirus tools, and has become trusted by many in the cyber security scene as a competent defense against cyber criminals. Kaspersky Labs’ Eugene Kaspersky put out a blog post recently calling out Microsoft for “slowly killing off the independent security industry”. In the blog post, he announced that he’s seeking legal action against Microsoft for anti-competitive behavior. \nKaspersky frequently cited that he imagines himself to be “David,” where big companies like Microsoft are “Goliath.” He paints the picture of Microsoft as engaging in a devious plot to make the world safer for cyber criminals by deactivating competing anti-virus software and replacing it with Windows Defender. \nWe’ve taken the decision to address official bodies in various countries (including the EU and Russia ) with a request to oblige Microsoft to cease its violation of anti-competition legislation and to remove the consequences of that violation. \nSpecifically : \nTo oblige Microsoft (i) to provide new versions and updates of Windows to independent developers in good time so they can maintain compatibility of their software to Windows; (ii) explicitly inform the user of the presence of incompatible software before upgrading Windows and recommend the user to install a compatible version of the software after the upgrade; (iii) always explicitly ask the user for his/her approval to enable Windows Defender. \nWe’ll see if this complaint ends up getting any sort of response from Microsoft, or if it makes any sort of impact at all. Kaspersky seems fairly convinced that Microsoft’s policies regarding anti virus are malicious towards independent cyber security developers, so there’s no question that he’s going to be trying his hardest to pursue this further somehow.

      "text": "The Microsoft Bing Ads team continues to quietly build out a native search advertising network, testing it with a handful of advertisers, and plans to roll out the platform early in 2017.\nRik van der Kooi, Microsoft search advertising corporate VP, told Search Marketing Daily at the company's annual Bing Next Ads event in Redmond that the ad units not only expand on Microsoft's ad services, but also provides the company's syndication partners and their advertisers will a slew of new opportunities to use what he calls \"re-imagined\" search.\nPublishers like AOL, which is a Bing Ads syndication partner, could take advantage of this type of search ad through their portal and on Huffington Post. \nBing Ads pilots are focused on commercial verticals such as automotive, financial services and travel, and selectively building a network of experiences where intent exists. The ads could have images of just text. \nVan der Kooi said the team plans to reach out to other publishers within the next few months to expand the network as the Microsoft Bing Ads team continues to \"redefine\" search on publisher sites and create new opportunities for marketers by identifying that user intent exists outside of traditional text and image ads on search engines.\n\"Search is a service that is ultimately supply constrained,\" he said. \"We have enough demand and more advertisers seeking to create new connections or ad clicks. Many of the content services are demand constrained, so this is a way to connect the dots between the two.\"\nvan der Kooi explains that Microsoft's technology scrapes the page and run the analytics against it and based on outcome determines what ad will provide the highest value, which he says is a much better way to target ads compared with display that relies on demographics. Search takes advantage of finer intent signals.\nWhat does Microsoft Bing mean by Intent? When Market Watch visitors come to the site to research investments options, they come with the intent of researching financial options. There's an opportunity for financial companies to capitalize on the intent.\nIn another example, cruise ships, airlines and automotive rental companies would have an opportunity to reach out to potential travelers who visit travel sites looking for vacation options. And finally, people who use Microsoft Outlook Email are signed in users with the potential of being served a native ad because Microsoft has access to the data and search records.",

      "text": "\nWhile Microsoft’s Windows 10 is an improvement in the status quo of Windows in many ways, the firm also took a few features some power-users might find necessary – like network Sharing (the ability to create an Ad Hoc Network and allow your computer to act as a makeshift router for other users)\nWhile you can still set an Ad-hoc network in Windows 10, it is a fair but more complicated than it used to be:\nRun command line as Admin by right-clicking on the Windows 10 Start button. You should see a bevy of options, including one which is (Command Prompt Admin) – Alternatively, use Win + X to open this directly if you are more comfortable with Keyboard Shortcuts. Click yes to the UAC (User Account Control) prompt that follows In the command line Windows that opens, enter the following command ”\nnetsh wlan show drivers”. This command allows you to see if your device can support virtualization or not. If it shows “Hosted Network Supported – Yes” then you’re good to go. (Note: Surface devices do NOT support this feature so if you’re using a Surface – you should probably stop reading here) Enter the following command “netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid= mynetworknamehere key= mynetworkkeyhere ” Once this is done, start the hosted network by entering the following command “netshwlanstarthostednetwork Open the Windows 10 Settings app. Navigate to Settings > Wifi > Network and Sharing center. On the left-hand side, there is an option labeled “change adapter settings” this will open up “Network Connections” Once in the Network Connections menu, you should now right-click your the internet connected device (wifi or ethernet) and then navigate to properties > sharing. . Check the option which states “Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection” option, and choose the newly created WiFi connection from the drop down list located under Select your newly created Wifi Network you named in step 4 from the list under the drop-down menu in “Home networking connection”. You should now be able to connect your devices to your Windows 10 PC. There you have it, that’s how you create an Ad-Hoc network in Windows 10. Do you have any other Windows 10 related concerns?

Then, sign into your Xbox account when prompted.\nDownload for:\niOS Android\nStep 2: Connect to your network xbox-app-screen-3 More Navigate to Network settings on your Xbox One — and your network preferences on your smartphone — and ensure they’re connected to the same Wi-Fi network. If your Xbox One is not connected, select Set up wireless network , choose your desired network, and enter the respective password if prompted. Obviously, both devices must also be within range of your network to connect.\nRead More We recommend connecting your smartphone and your Xbox One to the same wireless network, as it will strengthen the connection. However, it is possible to use your cellular network to connect as well.\nStep 3: Sync your smartphone with your console xbox-app-screen-1 More While using the Xbox app, tap the three horizontal bars in the upper-left corner to bring up the main menu. From here, you can access most features, but for now, just tap Connection . After a second, a Connect to your Xbox One option should appear near the top of the screen.\nTapping that should bring up a list of available Xbox consoles that you can connect to. Assuming yours is the only one on the list, tap the icon — labeled “Xbox-SystemOS, unless you’ve renamed it– and then “Turn on.” Voila! Your smartphone and your Xbox are now soulmates. You should now be able to use your smartphone as a controller and keyboard, though this functionality is limited to the Xbox OS. There’s currently no in-game, second-screen integration.\nStep 4: Use the app xbox-app-screen-4 More Connecting is easy, but learning how to use the Xbox app takes a little time and understanding. Again, tapping the three horizontal bars in the upper-left corner of the app will bring up the menu, which allows you to view your profile and achievements, your recorded clips and screenshots, and access the Xbox Store, among other options. Tapping your avatar icon will bring up your friends list, while the icons next door control messages and notifications, respectively.\nBuy an Xbox One S bundle with a free game and $50 credit The best of the last-gen: Our 15 favorite Xbox 360 games The best Xbox One compatible Xbox 360 games",

      "text": "Fon and Microsoft teamed up to make purchasing pre-paid plans for hot spot access easier on Windows 10 devices by incorporating Windows Store credentials. Customers can now select a Fon hot spot and automatically purchase a pre-paid plan. More Internet hot spot service provider Fon said on Tuesday that consumers with a wireless Windows 10 device can now purchase a pass to access its network of Wi-Fi hot spots using their Windows Store credentials. This is ideal for customers who aren’t subscribers to the “Fon Community” service but need an internet connection on their Windows 10 device outside the home from time to time.\nTo get a pass to Fon’s network, Windows 10 users simply load up the list of available Wi-Fi hotspots by selecting the Network icon residing next to the system clock on the Windows taskbar. One of the hot spots showing up on the list should have the “Fon” name. Click on the access point and Microsoft’s built-in Paid Wi-Fi & Cellular app will load up and list all the pre-paid plans made available through the Windows Store.\nMore: Microsoft drops 100,000 apps from German and Italian Windows Stores\nThe big selling point with this new feature is that Windows 10 device owners can purchase a pre-paid hot spot plan with just a simple click. Of course, if customers haven’t previously provided a payment method for the Windows Store, they will be required to make this extra step before grabbing a pre-paid plan from Fon.\n“Each plan is valid only in the country where you bought it for the device you bought it on,” Microsoft states. “If you go somewhere else in the same country where you bought a plan and another participating hot spot is in range, you’ll be connected automatically to that hot spot as long as you have time left on your plan. Note that the number of participating hot spots varies by country/region.”\nCurrently, Fon provides four pre-paid plans for accessing its hot spots: 60 minutes, 24 hours, five days, and thirty days. When customers purchase the 60-minute plan, those minutes can be spread out for up to one year after the original purchase. All other plans essentially roll over, meaning if customers purchase a 24-hour plan one month and another plan the second month, the unused time from the previous plan is applied to the current plan.\nBased on a map provided by Fon, its “global” Wi-Fi network doesn’t appear to be offered in the United States. The listed countries consist of the following:\nAustralia Belgium Brazil Croatia France Germany Greece Hungary Italy Japan Netherlands Poland Portugal Romania South Africa Spain U.K. News of Fon’s agreement with Microsoft arrives after the networking company expanded its footprint by teaming up with mobile carriers to provide premium Wi-Fi locations on a wider scale. The company’s service can now be accessed in 50 airports scattered across Europe alone, along with numerous access points established in the countries listed above. Fon set out to create a global access point with a constant user experience across all territories.\nFon powers more than 20 million Wi-Fi hot spots worldwide, the company said on Tuesday.\nGoogle Fi’s Wi-Fi Assistant comes to all Nexus devices Internet on the go: Tesla equipping new vehicles with Wi-Fi hot spot chips London Metropolitan Police pays Microsoft to keep its 27K Windows XP PCs running",

      "text": "To house Microsoft’s new Surface Book i5/i7, WaterField Designs announces the custom-fitted Syde Case, a svelte bag for mobile professionals that bridges the gap between sleeve and briefcase. WaterField’s new Surface Accessories Pouch provides customized, padded storage for the Surface Pen, power supply, new mouse, Surface Dial, cords, USB, ear buds and a few additional necessities, all in one padded organized place.\nSan Francisco, CA (PRWEB) November 10, 2016\nWaterField Designs announces the Syde Case for the new Surface Book i5/i7—a custom-fitted minimalist carry that bridges the gap between sleeve and briefcase—and the Surface Accessories Pouch designed to meet the needs of new Surface Book i5/i7 users on the go.\nThe lightweight, slim Syde Case protects a minimalist professional’s entire mobile office: a ballistic nylon or waxed canvas laptop sleeve carries the Surface Book i5/i7, and a roomy leather front compartment stores critical Surface accessories plus daily essentials. To keep Surface Accessories organized within another bag, WaterField’s new Surface Accessories Pouch is customized to fit the laptop-hybrid’s most critical extras—the Dial, the new mouse, the power supply, cords plus other miscellaneous items. WaterField has been designing and manufacturing laptop sleeves, bags, and cases for digital gear in its San Francisco studio since 1998.\n“The custom-fitted Syde Case is an ideal laptop case for minimalist professionals who want to protect their powerful new Surface Book on the go; it keeps the laptop-hybird safely cushioned, and the beautiful leather front compartment includes a custom spot to keep the Surface Pen secure,” noted company owner, Gary Waterfield. “We designed the Surface Accessories Pouch to help users keep the unique Surface accessories protected and organized for easy access.”\nThe all-in-one Syde Case combines a custom-fitted, black ballistic or waxed canvas, neoprene-lined, laptop sleeve with an attached full-grain leather, spacious accessories compartment. A unique magnetic closure runs side-to-side across the top of the sleeve allowing for easy, noise-free laptop access. Lined with soft, scratch-free material, the front compartment houses internal organizational pockets to securely hold the Surface Pen and a smartphone, with ample additional space for the Dial, power block, new mouse, wallet and keys. An open-topped back pocket stores an extra magazine or files. An external bottom loop helps ease the laptop out of its snug-fitting case. Leather handles and a removable shoulder strap allow users to carry the Surface Book briefcase- or messenger-style.\nWaterField Designs’ new, padded Surface Accessories Pouch sports custom pockets to protect and organize the Dial, power block, extra cables and a new mouse, plus a special easy-to-access loop to secure the Surface Pen and extra space for additional necessities. The water-resistant exterior comes in waxed canvas and chocolate full-grain leather or black ballistic nylon and black full-grain leather, with a plush interior and self-locking zippers.\nWaterField’s additional custom-fitted Surface Book cases include: the SleeveCase and Dash Sleeve for device protection within another bag, and the Outback Solo , Muzetto vertical messenger and Staad Laptop Backpack for carrying the Surface and additional items.\nAvailability & Pricing\nThe Syde Surface Book Case\nPrice: $159.\nSize: Custom-fitted sleeve fits Surface Book dimensions.\nColor options and materials: Black ballistic nylon with full-grain leather pouch in black or grizzly leather. Tan waxed Canvas with full-grain leather pouch in grizzly. Lined with 6 mm shock-absorbing neoprene. All Syde cases include a removable, matching-color, 1-inch shoulder strap.\nSurface Accessories Pouch\nPrice: $59\nColor options and materials: Tan waxed canvas with full-grain grizzly leather trim or black ballistic nylon with full-grain black leather trim.\nSleeveCase for Surface Book i7\nPrice: $69.

      "title": "Microsoft/LinkedIn - The E.U.'s Misguided Competition Analysis",
      "text": "Brussels is set to rule on Microsoft's LinkedIn acquisition on November 22, 2016. \nThe EU is itching to strike down a deal where there is \"unique\" data. \nIs LinkedIn's data \"unique\"? Yes. Duh. \nCompetition laws need to focus on competition and market power, not veer off into vague concepts of \"unique data\" that lead to absurd results. Brussels is set to rule on Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) acquisition on November 22, 2016. Originally seen as a slam-dunk M&A arbitrage opportunity given that the two companies have no overlap, some skepticism seems to have crept in with shares trading as low as $188, or $8 off the offer price, earlier this week. With all approvals lined up other than the EU, and a decision expected by the EU within two weeks, that's a pretty hefty arbitrage opportunity. So what are people so concerned by? Assessing product and market overlap and market power is the traditional way of analyzing anti-trust cases. But earlier this year EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager gave a speech in which she said that the commission would look at whether \"data purchased in the deal has a very long durability and might constitute a barrier for others, or if they can be replicated so that others stand a chance to enter the market.\" In that vein, the commission has sent out questionnaires to competitors to assess the value of LinkedIn's data and the difficulty in replicating it. I have a feeling that the questionnaires - at least those completed by Salesforce (NYSE: CRM )! - will answer that, yes, LinkedIn has a lot of great data and it would be nearly impossible to replicate it. And of course that's true. LinkedIn benefits from strong network effects that make it very difficult to replicate the data that they have. It's very unlikely that there will ever be two professional networking sites. What would be the point? So I think that's nearly a given. Microsoft may argue that Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) holds a lot of personal data, along with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ). Perhaps this argument is bolstered by Facebook's new job listing functionality and profile tags features that were announced this week. But at the end of the day, if the commission is inclined to define the \"data\" at issue as resume-type data and professional network data, and say that LinkedIn has a ton of data and it's nearly impossible to replicate that data, who can really be surprised. But the odd part of this new, cutting edge way of analyzing anti-trust issues is that if you say that LinkedIn has a lot of great data that others can't replicate, is the conclusion then that nobody can ever acquire LinkedIn? Is LinkedIn then to be left out in the cold, forever prisoner of their great data? Keep in mind, LinkedIn's data and whether it can be replicated is going to be exactly the same whether LinkedIn is independent or part of Microsoft. I am hopeful that the European Commission can apply sensible rules when analyzing the importance of data in competition. They are clearly itching to block some merger because of its data characteristics, but this is most definitely not the right one. Clearly, Microsoft will agree to continue to provide certain user data to other CRM providers like Salesforce (for a fee). But the answer can't be that nobody is every going to be able to acquire LinkedIn because of its user info, regardless of whether the buyer operates a social network or not.

      "text": "11/12/16 AT 11:01 PM Close \nUnbeknownst to many, Nokia developed a smartwatch that was intended to complement its Lumia smartphones. However, around the same time that the Finnish company’s mobile division was bought by Microsoft, the project was delayed for some time until it was officially scrapped. This week, however, the wearable that didn’t see the light of the day has now surfaced in the flesh thanks to a leaked hands-on video. \nOn Friday, YouTube channel 诺记吧 nokibar uploaded an exclusive hands-on video of Nokia Moonraker Lumia smartwatch. The owner of the channel also spread the word about the video on Twitter via the @baidunokibar account. The video lasts for a little more than three minutes, and it showcases the UI and the different features of the canned smartwatch. \nNokiaPowerUser describes the UI of the Moonraker as Swipe-navigation based. The tech site that focuses on Nokia and Windows Phone news, reviews and leaks also praised the device for its beautiful design. Furthermore, the site noted that the Nokia smartwatch was designed to track steps, notify users whenever they missed calls and received messages and even Facebook notifications. \nThough this is the first time that a real and functioning Moonraker is spotted, this isn’t the first time for the tech community to see the UI of the device. PhoneArena reports that several pictures of the smartwatch have emerged in the past, including a GIF of its UI that leaked back in June. At the time, a GIF showcasing a 3D Gesture Test app for McLaren also landed on the internet. Related Stories",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft Accelerator released a new report on Indian enterprise-startup partnership ecosystem. According to the report titled “the Ecosystem Report on Enterprise Ready Start-ups 2016”, “Banking, retail, and healthcare are the top adopters of start-up technologies based on their growth potential, willingness to adopt start-up solutions and availability of such complex solutions locally.” The report explained that all these sectors are driven by optimization and have emerged as the biggest adopters of the enterprise technology solutions. Enterprises Are Adaptive Toward New Technologies \nAs the digitalization is increasing amongst enterprises, it is motivating them to adopt new start-up technologies. Ravi Narayan, Global Director, Microsoft Accelerator said, “We are happy to note that Indian enterprises are looking at start-ups for innovative solutions and expertise for their Digital Transformation.” In his blog, Ravi Narayan explained, “Our research shows that contrary to popular belief, the most conservative yet disruptive sectors like BFSI are embracing start-up solutions more openly than others.” He added, “This should inspire other sectors too to finding solutions from start-ups. The rapidity of changes in the business environment and global climate can no longer be addressed in enterprises by incremental changes from traditional vendors, but small and nimble start-ups.” \nThe report demonstrated about the 10 sectors that have shown momentous growth in past few years. A list of top 151 companies which are ready start-ups headquartered in India and they came into the existence after the year 2000 also disclosed. Warehouse automation robots-maker Grey Orange, Freshdesk Inc., a customer support software maker and InMobi, an advertising technology provider are few names among the most “enterprise-ready” start-ups in India. Security start-ups and Data Sciences find it easiest to find customers. They all are driven by the broad base of customers and sectors that these start-ups can address natively. Banking sector startups find it easiest to raise funds \nInvestors are considering banking sector’s startups. Why? Well the report said “India already has a billion mobile phone users, as well as a billion citizens with active bank accounts that are linked to their digital identities by way of Aadhaar. The tremendous scope of opportunity these start-ups can leverage is one of the key reasons these start-ups are successful in attracting funding.” According to Ravi Narayan’s blog, “Banking sector is a process driven industry and full of tremendous scope for optimization. With the increasing population of serviceable customers, and with increase financial inclusion, the need to optimization is only increasing.” He added that banks realize this, and are at the forefront of adopting innovative solutions to drive this optimization. According to the list of top fintech start-ups disclosed by the report MSwipe, TechProcess Solutions and BillDesk are on highest position. Healthcare sector thriving fast \nA joint report from the CII and KPMG said that India’s healthcare sector poised to grow to $280 billion by 2020. It forecasted that India to be a leader in e-health by 2019 because of digital empowerment and a lot of other actions taken especially by the Indian government. However the Microsoft Accelerator confirmed that digitalization is extended to fitness, preventive healthcare and patient awareness. It is also helping in maintaining patient record and helping doctors in many other ways too. Narayan has written in his blog, the next wave of disruption is being seen in partnership of various services, as well as in the application of machine learning and data Sciences to aid domains that were traditionally owned by highly qualified medical practitioners, such as diagnostic, prescriptive and preventive healthcare. He has also motioned that a rise of 88% in the number of funding in health care start-ups is expected for the year of 2016. eCommerce enterprises acquiring tech startups for customers satisfaction \neCommerce industry is evolving fast with listing, online marketplaces, online portals and mobile based services launches. As a result India has been become famous for its eCommerce boom and B2C startups burgeoning. Seven of the nine biggest eCommerce players in India are B2C startups. Together they all have raised 15x more funding than the B2B companies in India. The rapid ecommerce growth has led eCommerce companies sourcing new technologies from tech startups. According to the Mircosoft Accelerator report, Practo, pharmaceutical company Celon Laboratories, and genomics-based diagnostics solutions Medgenome Labs are the three top start-ups in healthcare. \nMicrosoft Accelerator assessed many other sectors to get to know about the maturity of Indian start-up ecosystem. It also studied the role of new technologies in manufacturing and other traditional industries and a lot of many other related things. \nThe report took into account a company’s customer traction, funding, and size, to compute an ‘enterprise readiness score’. The report provided by Microsoft also provides insights into how this enterprise-startup partnership has evolved in last few years and highlighted the value of collaboration and building the start-up ecosystem.",

      "text": "Billionaire Russian anti-virus developer Eugene Kaspersky has penned an angry blog post titled \" That's It. I've Had Enough! \" to complain about Microsoft and Windows 10. Specifically, Kaspersky argues that the way Microsoft bundled Defender with Windows 10 is anti-competitive: he says that Microsoft has created obstacles to third-party products and is acting against the interests of the developers of third-party security software.\nAccordingly, Kaspersky says that he has filed complaints with competition authorities in the EU and Russia. He asks that they force Microsoft to cease the behavior he feels is anti-competitive.\nMicrosoft has integrated anti-malware software to ensure that every Windows system has a basic level of protection without requiring any additional third-party purchases or installations. Here's how the Microsoft setup works, and the way it has worked since Windows 8 : built-in MS anti-malware software automatically disables itself if it detects a third-party product is installed and up-to-date. Microsoft chose this behavior to keep its OEM partners happy, since many of them depend on kickbacks from pre-installed third-party antivirus software.\nRead 16 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "4 hours 37 minutes ago 3 View Comments \nThe software giant, Microsoft, in collaboration with Africa’s Number one recruitment platform, gr8jobsng.com, recently organised a recruitment day programme to empower Nigerian youth with job opportunities in Lagos. \nMeanwhile, a statistics released by the National Bureau of Statistics earlier this year placed the unemployment rate of Nigeria at 10.4 per cent. \nThe event with the theme: “Learn and be hired!” was aimed at creating an opportunity for potential job seekers to meet with career experts and recruiters to understand the job market, be positioned and take advantage of available jobs. \nCurrent statistics has revealed that 50% of youths between the 18 and 35 years are either unemployed or underemployed. \nGraduates at the event held at Microsoft Office in Lagos had the opportunity to learn about important career related subjects like CV writing, Career Planning, Interviewing etc. Rate this article",

      "text": "\nWith Visual Studio “15”, Microsoft has included several improvements to make developer tools easier to install, increasing performance, and enhancing developer productivity. Recently, Visual Studio team detailed the improvements they have made related to extensions. For example, If VS 15 detects a slow-performing extension, it will now display a message that identifies the extension and gives the user the opportunity to disable it. Also, Visual Studio “15” now lets you batch up extension change operations to occur at once.\nA quick summary of the changes:\nWe’ve added a performance monitoring system for extensions. Customers will now see a gold notification bar when an extension is slowing load time or typing speed; We now batch extension updates and installs to make it easier to install or update multiple extensions; We’ve made it possible for extensions to detect and install dependent components, now that the default installation footprint of Visual Studio is much smaller; We’ve made several performance improvements that have an impact on extension authors, such as lightweight solution load and NGEN support for extensions; Lastly, we’ve updated the Visual Studio marketplace to make it easier to find and install extensions; Read more about these changes in detail here .\n",

Attackers can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to view a specially crafted web page. Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently logged-in user. Failed attacks will cause denial of service conditions.

To reduce the impact of latent vulnerabilities, always run nonadministrative software as an unprivileged user with minimal access rights.

      "text": "Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer XSS Filter CVE-2016-7239 Information Disclosure   Edge and Internet Explorer are prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability that affects the XSS Filter. An attacker can exploit this issue by tricking an unsuspecting victim into viewing a page containing malicious content. An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the user running the application. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and other sensitive data that may aid in further attacks. Other attacks are possible. Internet Explorer 9, 10, 11, and Edge are vulnerable.   Recommendations Run all software as a nonprivileged user with minimal access rights. Run all non-administrative software as a non-administrative user with the least amount of privileges required to successfully operate. This will greatly reduce the potential damage that successful exploitation may achieve. Do not follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Never follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Set web browser security to disable the execution of script code or active content. Since the exploitation of some of these issues allows the execution of malicious script code in web clients, consider disabling support for script code and active content within the client browser. Note that this mitigation tactic might adversely affect websites that rely on the execution of browser-based script code.   Masato Kinugawa via Google VRP Copyright © Symantec Corporation.

      "text": "Microsoft Edge CVE-2016-7208 Scripting Engine Remote Memory Corruption   Edge is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to view a specially crafted web page. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently logged-in user. Failed attacks will cause denial of service conditions.   Recommendations Run all software as a nonprivileged user with minimal access rights. To reduce the impact of latent vulnerabilities, always run nonadministrative software as an unprivileged user with minimal access rights. Deploy network intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for malicious activity. Deploy NIDS to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This includes but is not limited to requests that include NOP sleds and unexplained incoming and outgoing traffic. This may indicate exploit attempts or activity that results from successful exploits Do not follow links provided by unknown or untrusted sources. Web users should be cautious about following links to sites that are provided by unfamiliar or suspicious sources. Filtering HTML from emails may help remove a possible vector for transmitting malicious links to users. Implement multiple redundant layers of security. Memory-protection schemes (such as nonexecutable stack and heap configurations and randomly mapped memory segments) will complicate exploits of memory-corruption vulnerabilities.  ",
