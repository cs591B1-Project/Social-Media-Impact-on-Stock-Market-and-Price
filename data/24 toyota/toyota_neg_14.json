      "text": "\n-The new Toyota C-HR is one of the most radical things the Toyota brand has done in years. But although the Euro-focused crossover will be making it to the United States next year, we won’t be getting its 1.2-liter turbocharged four-cylinder or hybrid powertrains. We initially reported this news in our first-drive review of the Europe-spec version, but there’s more background on the decision. \n-Chief engineer Hiroyuki Koba told us at the launch that the only engine for the U.S. will be a 144-hp naturally aspirated 2.0-liter four-cylinder that will work solely in conjunction with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). That’s a higher output than the new 114-hp 1.2-liter unit can muster, but the older 2.0-liter engine’s relative lack of torque—its peak of 139 lb-ft arrives at a high 3800 rpm, while the turbo’s 137 lb-ft is available from just 1500 rpm—means that Toyota claims near identical zero-to-62-mph times for both cars (11.1 seconds for the front-drive turbo, 11.0 seconds for the front-drive 2.0-liter).\n- \n-The lack of a gasoline-electric model for the U.S. is acknowledgment of how tough it is to sell hybrids at the moment. The C-HR sits on the same global TNGA-C platform as the new Prius, and Koba confirmed there is no engineering reason to prevent the hybrid from being sold in the States; Toyota simply thinks that demand isn’t there. The hybrid uses the familiar Atkinson-cycle 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine in conjunction with a 70-hp electric motor, with Toyota claiming an 11.0-second zero-to-62-mph time. This could well be the first time a car has been sold with three different engines offering nearly identical acceleration numbers.\n-The hybrid’s role isn’t to offer a sexier alternative to the Prius but rather to help sell cars in emissions-conscious Europe. Toyota says it will never build a diesel-powered C-HR, meaning the hybrid is aimed squarely at those who get taxed on CO2 emissions, as in most European countries. The company is predicting that three-quarters of the C-HRs sold across Europe will be hybrids.\n- - 2017 Toyota C-HR Euro-Spec Driven: Previewing Our Version - 2018 Toyota C-HR Debuts in U.S.: From Scion Concept to Production Toyota - Nissan Juke AWD Tested: Juke-Not-a-Box Hero - -Koba also admitted that a faster version is a possibility, although he stressed that there are no plans for one yet. He raced a prototype C-HR with a more powerful 160-hp version of the turbocharged engine at the Nürburgring earlier this year, so there’s certainly the potential, if not necessarily the will, to make a performance derivative.\n- \n- ",

Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nThe Camry was last redesigned for the 2013 model year. \nThe 2018 Camry will come out next summer. Sales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent through November. But they concede the car may soon be outsold by the RAV4 SUV. \n ",

      "text": "Toyota gives first glimpse at edgier 2018 Camry First look suggests America's perennial best-selling car will embrace a bolder look. Up Next Shootout: Ford Focus RS vs. BMW M2 \nThis is the world's first look at the 2018 Toyota Camry, and it's an appropriate photo. Poised to enter its eighth generation when it bows at the Detroit Auto Show in January, the Japanese automaker's venerable sedan has been showing its taillights to the competition from atop the sales charts for going on 15 years. \nIn that time, the Camry has been best described as safe, solid, and reliable, but rarely has it raised pulses for its aesthetics any more than it has for its its driving dynamics. With the mid-cycle refresh of its current seventh-generation model, Toyota clearly began to embrace more adventuresome styling, and this teaser suggests its designers have been further emboldened. \nIt's important to note that the shadowy photo seen here depicts an XSE model, which is traditionally sportier. In this case, that means that the midsize sedan's rump arrives replete with lip spoiler and a rear bumper cap with unusual vertical air extractors whose character lines spill down from the tail lamps. No word yet on whether the vents actually do anything -- they seem likely to be non-functional pieces. The unusual body crease visible on the rear pillar also suggests the Camry could have a more steeply raked roofline, an increasingly common designer's tool to amp up visual excitement (often at the expense of rear seat room). Enlarge Image \nToyota's best-selling Camry will enter its 8th generation wearing this rear end. Photo by Toyota \nWhile the Camry appears to be in no immediate danger of losing its sales crown to rivals like the Honda Accord , Hyundai Sonata and Nissan Altima , sedan sales across most industry segments continue to take a beating at the hands of surging crossover SUV sales. As that's a trend likely to continue for the foreseeable future, more emotional design may be a technique that automakers increasingly employ to hold buyers' attention. \nNo word yet on the 2018 Camry's availability, powertrains, or anything else just yet, but there's not long to wait -- January is just around the corner.

      "text": "Toyota tallied 197,645 sales in November, a 4.1% decline from year-ago on a daily-selling-rate basis, according to WardsAuto data. There were 25 selling days last month vs. 23 in November 2015. \nThe Toyota brand slipped 3.2%, while Lexus sales fell 8.9% daily. \nWhile Toyota’s car sales again slumped, down 12.3% in November, light trucks helped offset some of their loss. \n“All-time best-ever Highlander sales combined with November best-ever RAV4 volume extends the Toyota Div.’s 2016 streak of consecutive light truck sales records to 11 months,” Bill Fay, group vice president-Toyota Div., says in a statement. \nHowever, the RAV4’s 28,116 units were down 5.5% from year-ago. Some 3,757 of those RAV4s were hybrid models. Year-to-date, Toyota has sold 40,324 RAV4 Hybrids, while overall sales of the CUV have increased roughly 30,000 units. \nThe RAV4 was edged out as the No.2 best-selling Toyota last month by the Camry, which tallied 28,189 units, down 16.2% on a DSR basis from November 2015. \nThe Corolla, thanks to the addition of the former Scion iM hatchback to its lineup, was the No.1-selling Toyota last month, with 28,262 sales. The iM accounted for 1,515 of that total. \nThe Prius lineup continued its 2016 plunge, down 23.2% in November, depressing sales 26.8% for the year. \nToyota’s other stand-alone green car, the Mirai fuel-cell vehicle, performed better, selling 105 units in November and bringing its 2016 tally to 918, an unprecedented retail volume for an FCV in the U.S. \nLexus posted November sales of 29,050 units, with cars down even more steeply than at Toyota, 22.6%. Lexus’ ES had the smallest decline, 20.2%, while the GS posted the biggest, 49.2%. \nThe IS was the lone-gaining Lexus car, up 7.3% in November from year-ago. \nLexus light trucks inched up 1.6% on a DSR basis, with the NX, GX and LX offsetting a rare decline in sales of the RX midsize CUV. The RX slipped 12.3%, but at 10,269 it still was Lexus’ top-selling U.S. model last month. \nThe compact NX shot up 43.4% and through November is up 23.0%, with total sales of 47,509. \nThrough November, total Toyota U.S. deliveries were down 2.4% from like-2015 to 2.206 million.",

      "text": "Ford, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and General Motors posted U.S. sales increases in November as a rise in incentive spending helped put the industry back on a winning track after three straight monthly declines.\nIndustrywide sales hit a record for the month -- easily topping the 1.328 million mark in Nov. 2001.\nA 10 percent gain at GM and a 4.3 percent rise at Toyota Motor Corp. marked their strongest advances this year. Nissan Motor Co. climbed 7.5 percent, while Ford Motor Co. ended a four-month skid. The Volkswagen brand soared 24 percent. Fiat Chrysler was the exception among the first companies to report, tumbling 14 percent as fleet deliveries shrank.\nContinued demand for light trucks amid low gasoline prices helped boost automakers’ results, as did two additional selling days compared with November of 2015. Incentive spending last month, including Thanksgiving holiday deals, was up 13 percent vs. a year-earlier but down from October, according to TrueCar data. (See table below.)\nU.S. light-vehicle sales in November are forecast to rise about 3.8 percent from a year earlier, based on a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.\nWhat’s more, November is shaping up to leave the industry in a better position to top last year’s 17.47 million tally. Sales through October were 0.3 percent behind their year-earlier pace after three straight monthly declines.\nIf the industry manages to eke out an annual gain, 2016 would mark the first time in a century that U.S. sales topped year-earlier levels for seven straight years. Sales rose every year in a nine-year stretch through 1917.\nCompany by company \nGM's 10 percent increase reflected rises of 8.1 percent at Chevrolet, 14 percent at GMC, 16 percent at Buick and 14 percent at Cadillac.\nGM said sales to retail customers were up 7.9 percent to 197,609 in November while rental shipments jumped 27 percent.\nToyota's corporate increase reflected a 5.3 gain at the Toyota division. Deliveries slipped 1 percent at Lexus.\nToyota outsold Ford Motor Co. for the first time this year after coming close twice this summer. Toyota's margin was 1,204 units to rank No. 2 in the industry, behind GM.\nFord posted a 5.1 percent rise in November volume. Sales rose 4.5 percent at the Ford division and 19 percent at Lincoln. Ford's retail sales were up 10 percent while fleet shipments dropped 9 percent. \nVolume dropped at FCA on sharply lower fleet shipments, a 12 percent decline at Jeep and a 47 percent decrease at the Chrysler brand. It was the third straight monthly decline at Jeep.\nDeliveries rose 12 percent at Ram but slipped 21 percent at Dodge and 15 percent at Fiat. FCA said overall retail demand dropped 2 percent and fleet volume was off 42 percent last month.\nSales advanced 7.5 percent at Nissan Motor last month, with deliveries rising 8 percent at the Nissan division and 3.6 percent at Infiniti.\nHonda Motor Co. ended a three-month losing streak with a 6.5 percent increase.  Honda division volume climbed 7.9 percent, offsetting a 5.1 percent decline at Acura.\nThe VW brand’s 24 percent increase ended a streak of 12 consecutive monthly declines in the wake of the automaker's diesel-emissions scandal. VW’s Audi, meanwhile, extended its winning run to 85 months with a 2.5 percent gain.\nThe VW brand's 24 percent increase ended a streak of 12 consecutive monthly declines in the wake of the automaker's diesel-emissions violations. Photo credit: DAVID PHILLIPS Subaru of America continued its hot streak with November marking the 60th consecutive month of U.S. sales increases. Subaru also set a monthly sales record with 51,308 vehicles sold in November, an increase of 11 percent from a year earlier.\n“With December typically being one of the best retail sales months of the year, the Subaru franchise is in a great position to achieve its eighth consecutive all-time sales record in 2016,” said Tom Doll, president of Subaru of America.\nStrong SAAR \nThe seasonally adjusted, annualized sales rate is projected to remain strong but drop to 17.7 million vehicles, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg. That would be down slightly from this year’s highest rate -- October’s 17.98 million -- and the 18.07 million pace in November 2015, the second-strongest month of last year.\nGM today estimated the November SAAR at 17.9 million units.\nBob Carter, Toyota senior vice president of automotive operations , said Toyota projects a SAAR on the month of around 17.7 or 17.8 million, putting the industry at a \"solid 17.4 million and change.\" He said he anticipates Toyota forecasting a SAAR in the low 17 million range in 2017.\n\"That's a great, great market. Any time we're talking mid-17s, that's a wonderful market and a wonderful indication of where the North American economy is,\" he said.\nThe early launch of Black Friday sales events helped offset declines in fleet sales in November, said Eric Lyman, TrueCar’s chief industry analyst.\n“The retail sales environment remains strong for new car sales,” Lyman said. “Incentives are also down slightly [from October] as automakers begin to address supply side imbalances with planned reductions in vehicle production.”\nSteady economic and job growth and the recent rise in U.S. equity prices have also encouraged consumers to make big-ticket purchases, analysts say.\nIncentive spending by automakers averaged an estimated $3,475 per vehicle in November, TrueCar estimates.\n‘Plateau’ \nMike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation Inc., the largest U.S. new-vehicle dealership group, said there is some relief among dealers and automakers now that the presidential election, and the uncertainty that the campaign cast over consumers, is over.\n“I still think we're in a plateau,” Jackson said this week. “There is a point of diminishing returns when whatever you give at the front end in incentives comes off residual values at the back end. We're right at that tipping point.”\nJessica Caldwell, an analyst for Edmunds.com, said luxury vehicles and light-truck demand in December will determine whether the industry hits a new milestone.\n“November sales have the industry well-positioned to set a new annual sales record this year, but a new record is far from guaranteed,” said Caldwell.\n“Expect to see a flood of ads for holiday season sales events in the coming days and weeks, especially for luxury brands, trucks and SUVs. If we see any year-over-year lifts in these segments in December, then it's a good bet that the industry will top last year's record-high sales.\"\nNick Bunkley and John Irwin contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Toyota to revamp America’s top-selling car amid boom in SUVs  54 am Share story TOM KRISHER The Associated Press \nDETROIT (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America’s top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit’s North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota’s RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn’t a pickup truck. \n“It’s possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,” said Bob Carter, Toyota’s senior vice president of auto operations.

      "text": "Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nToyota Motor Corp. plans to unveil a redesigned Camry in Detroit next month, rolling out a new take on the best-selling car in the U.S. after just three years as Asian automakers defend their turf in a shrinking market for midsize sedans. \nAutomakers usually wait about six years between major changes to a model. The current Camry design is dominated by a straight line that slopes forward between the body panels and the windows, all the way from back to front. \nIn contrast, internet spy photos of the upcoming 2018 Camry show shoulder-like curves beneath the back window, and a hood that plunges toward a grille that stretches almost all the way across the car. \n\"For years, we've had a reputation for high-quality, durable products that were perhaps somewhat conservative in design,\" said Bob Carter, head of sales for the Toyota and Lexus brands in the U.S. \"We're looking to hold that position, and to add to it emotional design and fun-to-drive characteristics. \" \nAt a Thursday reception in Detroit, Toyota executives revealed the plan to show a revamped Camry at the city's North American International Auto Show in January. \nThe automaker's new model likely will have some company: Nissan Motor Co., Honda Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. will all be unveiling updated designs for their core midsize sedans at the show, according to the trade journal Automotive News. \n\"The midsize segment hasn't had a lot of product news,\" Carter said. \"But perhaps now we're going to see some real innovation that should sustain it, and who knows, bring some growth back.'' \nKia Motors Corp. proved design matters in midsize cars when sales climbed after a bold revamping of its Optima sedan in 2008 and then fell with conservative styling that came later, said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision, a San Diego consumer-research company. Now Kia and Hyundai, its corporate affiliate, are getting more aggressive with styling, too. \n\"The Japanese are leading for now, but if these new entrants provide high quality and innovative styling, they'll conquest the Japanese just like the Japanese conquested Detroit in the 1990s,\" Edwards said. \nToyota sold 327,015 Camrys in the U.S. during the first 10 months of this year, down 9.4 percent from a year earlier. That's in line with the industrywide drop for midsize cars. \nThe Camry is still the most popular U.S. car, and midsize cars remain the second-largest segment of the market, trailing only car-based sport utility vehicles. Those so-called crossover SUVs, with higher seats and more cargo space, posted an 8.1 percent increase through October. This included a 12 percent jump for Toyota's RAV4 crossover to 286,809. By next year, the RAV4 could be outselling Camry, Carter said. \nThe new Camry represents a large volume increase for the so-called Toyota New Global Architecture, or TNGA, which debuted on the Prius hybrid last year. Toyota officials have said the TNGA program aims to trim manufacturing costs by as much as 30 percent through, among other things, long-term contracts that help suppliers invest in flexible component sets for a wide variety of vehicles. \nBy the end of the decade, front-wheel-drive TNGA vehicles will account for two-thirds of Toyota's global output, said Alan Baum, an independent auto analyst in Bloomfield Township, Michigan. \nJohn Lippert, Bloomberg",

      "text": "December 1, 2016 2:57 PM Toyota to revamp America's top-selling car amid boom in SUVs By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT \nToyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations.

      "text": "7 mins ago by Eric Loveday 0 Comments Toyota Motors President Akio Toyoda as he holds the key of a Tesla Roadstar handed to him by Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk. \nToyota has announced a major shake up in the roles of some of its highest level employees, including its CEO/President Akio Toyoda. Toyota Prius Prime \nIn a shift that certainly shows Toyota is now serious when it comes to electric vehicles, the automaker has appointed its CEO, Akio Toyoda, to head up its newly formed electric vehicle division. \nIn addition to Toyoda getting the top spot, the automaker’s #2 in charge (two individuals, actually), Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi, have both been appointed to spots on the electric vehicle team. \nToyota spokeswoman Kayo Doi stated: \n“By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars.” \n“The president will directly oversee the department’s operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.” \nAkio Toyoda has long had a passion for plug-ins (and racing), but he’s been unable to push forward his ideas of developing electric cars that are desirable in terms of performance. He’s been a fan of Tesla from the get-go and with him in charge of Toyota’s electric vehicle division, we expect to see some exciting plug-in products in Toyota’s near future. \nHere’s the full list of changes posted by Toyota: \nSource: Reuters , Toyota, hat tip to spark EV!",

Due to the decline, the Camry probably won’t return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said.",

      "text": "Toyota to revamp America's top-selling car amid boom in SUVs By Tom Krisher, AP Auto Writer Posted: # Comments \nDETROIT (AP)  Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. Advertisement \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. \nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\" \nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said.",

The automaker announced that the 2018 Camry will debut at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January. \nRelated: What's the Best Midsize Sedan for 2016? \nThe automaker calls the 2018 model \"all-new\" but only revealed a sliver of the mid-size sedan. It shows a sharper, more streamlined looking taillight that wears rings similar to those seen on the new C-HR subcompact SUV , as well as just the hint of a spoiler. Check back on Jan. 9 for more details from Detroit. \nAssistant Managing Editor Jennifer Geiger is a reviewer, car-seat technician and mom of three.

      "text": "Toyota to revamp America's top-selling car amid boom in SUVs by Associated Press \nFILE - In this Nov. 7, 2015 file photo, Chevrolet vehicles are fo sale at a dealership in Fremont, Calif. General Motors says its U.S. sales fell 1.7 percent last month as all brands but Buick reported declines. The Detroit automaker, the first to report on Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, says it sold nearly 259,000 cars and trucks in October. But it increased retail sales to individual buyers by 3 percent. GM has been shunning low-profit sales to rental car companies in favor of more lucrative retail sales.(AP Photo/Ben Margot) A A \nDETROIT (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. close ",

      "text": "Toyota put out a teaser image of the new Camry’s rear quarter-panel. (Photo: Toyota) \nDetroit – The North American International Auto Show is still a month away, but Toyota is already teasing news of one of the show’s most anticipated products: the all-new, 2018 Toyota Camry sedan.\nThe midsize Camry has been the best-selling car in the U.S. market for 14 years running and is on course to be No. 1 in 2016 as well. But with sedan sales under assault from crossovers – including Toyota’s own RAV4 and Highlander – the eighth-generation Camry will be particularly important as one of the Japanese company’s franchise cars.\n“This car has had a dominant image of quality, dependability, and reliability, but our styling has been conservative – some would call it boring,” said Toyota North America Chief Bob Carter in announcing the new Camry Thursday in Detroit. “So we’ve really been focusing on passionate emotional design and making it more fun-to-drive. This will car will be the most significant vehicle we have brought out in a long time.”\nToyota put out a teaser image of the new Camry’s rear quarter-panel. Sharper body lines and a long, thin vertical taillight graphic suggest the car continues styling cues from the newly released Toyota Prius and Prius Hybrid. The sharp body lines also echo Toyota’s Lexus luxury brand which has forged a more polarizing design direction in recent years.\nToyota announced no further details on powertrain or interior.\n“That segment is under pressure from changing consumer taste, so this car really needs to make an emotional statement,” said IHS Automotive senior auto analyst Stephanie Brinley. “It’s unlikely it will change current trends, but does need to make sure the segment is solid. Exterior and interior design – and technology – are the keys to that.”\nThe Camry is made in Georgetown, Kentucky, alongside the Avalon and Lexus ES where it is manufactured for domestic consumption and export. The plant produces over 550,000 units a year total.\n“This car is very significant for us in North America so we want to use Detroit as the platform to announce that we’re bringing to market,” said Carter.\nHenry Payne is auto critic for The Detroit News.

      "text": "Related Content View Photo This photo provided by Toyota shows the 2018 Camry. On Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, Toyota announced it would …\n\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks.\nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer.\nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions.\nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years.\nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end.\nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future.\nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck.\n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations.\nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm.\n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\"\nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said.",

      "text": "Toyota to revamp America's top-selling car amid boom in SUVs By Tom Krisher , Associated Press | Posted Dec 1st, 2016 @ 4:40pm 0  \nDETROIT (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. \nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\" \nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. \n ",

      "text": "Toyota Teases 2018 Camry, Says “Prepare To Stare” | By Share For a nameplate that has become synonymous with the automotive equivalent of ‘beige’, Toyota is sure hyped about the styling and character of its next generation sedan coming to the Detroit Auto Show in January. On Thursday, Toyota dropped the first official teaser of the 2018 Camry revealing the rear quarter of the car. From this angle, it looks more aggressive and stylish than anything else we’ve seen from the Camry, with swooping lines, (fake) vents under the thinner LED lamps, and a boot spoiler. But then again, that doesn’t say much, as Toyota’s mid-size sedan family hasn’t exactly been on the forefront of design. Toyota execs have high hopes for the new iteration of the Camry that will have a difficult task ahead of it, as SUVs have eroded the segment in recent years, with the RAV-4 poised to steal its sales crown in the USA for the first time ever next year. According to Autonews , Bob Carter, senior vice president of automotive operations at Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A, told reporters at the brand’s holiday party in Detroit: “The first time that I had the opportunity to see and drive this vehicle, this was a Camry that sent chills up my back.” Spy shots of the 2018 Camry suggest that, if anything else, the new model will look sharper and more planted on the road ( see our artist’s rendition here ). Under the skin, it will ride on Toyota’s TNGA modular platform that we first saw on the 2016 Prius, while a recently spied prototype hinted at the development of a hotter TRD-tuned variant with a 3.5-liter V6 pushing upwards of 300 horses. Standard models are expected to be powered by a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated four and a 2.0-liter turbocharged four from the Lexus NX and IS. A hybrid version will also be available. Photo Gallery",

On Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, Toyota announced it would reveal the new version of America's top-selling sedan at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January 2017. (Toyota via AP) \nDETROIT (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. \nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\" \nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. Tags",

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America’s top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks.\nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit’s North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer.\nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions.\nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years.\nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end.\nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota’s RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future.\nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn’t a pickup truck.\n“It’s possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,” said Bob Carter, Toyota’s senior vice president of auto operations.\nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm.\n“They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,” Schuster said. “Unless there’s some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it’s going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.”\nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won’t return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said.\nGet breaking news, weather and traffic on the go.

On Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, Toyota announced it would reveal the new version of America's top-selling sedan at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January 2017. (Toyota via AP) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Detroit • Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. The Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. Toyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. A teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Sales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. Toyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. So far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. A redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\" Midsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said.",

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks.\nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer.\nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions.\nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years.\nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end.\nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future.\nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck.\n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter , Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations.\nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster , senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm.\n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\"\nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said.",

      "text": "By Ira Siegel T he Avalon, Toyota’s flagship sedan since 1995, is an impressive premium full-size offering. Several years into its fourth generation, the 2016 Avalon receives a minor face lift. The most noticeable difference between it and last year’s model is new front-end styling. New front turn signals and a bolder new front grille create a new face for the sleekly styled large sedan. The Touring trim level benefits from sportier styling and sporty suspension tuning. Based on the same platform as the Toyota Camry and Lexus ES, the Avalon distinguishes itself with differentiated styling and a more spacious cabin. The Avalon is much more than a stretched Camry. A comparison reveals that Avalon is much more refined and plush. Avalon’s exterior styling is appealing and sporty, and Touring models bump it up a few notches with unique styling cues, including LED headlights and 18-inch dark gray painted alloy wheels. A luxurious and quiet cabin has been a hallmark for the Avalon. That tradition continues, thanks to strategically placed sound-absorbing and sound-insulation materials, acoustic-type glass for the windshield and side glass and foam injected into the A-, B- and C-pillars and rocker panels. The result is a cabin that remains extremely quiet and tranquil, even at highway speeds. With prices starting around $33,000, the 2016 Toyota Avalon is available in five trim levels: XLE, XLE Plus, XLE Premium, Touring and Limited. The sporty Touring model is priced at about $37,000, and the top-of-the-line Limited will set you back about $41,000. All Avalon models are powered by a competent 268-horsepower, 3.5-liter V-6 engine mated to a smooth-shifting six-speed automatic transaxle. There are no other engine or transmission choices available, and power goes out to the front wheels. All-wheel drive is not offered in the Avalon. Avalon’s 3.5-liter engine burns 87-octane fuel and, remarkably, this large sedan is rated for an impressive 21/31 mpg city/highway. The base XLE trim level comes well equipped, including automatic headlights, 17-inch alloy wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, full power accessories, leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with paddle shifters, heated front seats, eight-way power driver’s seat, four-way power front passenger seat, Smart Key System on driver’s door and trunk with push-button starting, rear-view camera, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a 7-inch touchscreen interface, eight-speaker audio system and more. Also included in the XLE is Toyota’s Star Safety System, which includes stability control, traction control, anti-lock brakes, electronic brake force distribution and brake assist. Avalon’s controls are easy to reach and operate. There is plenty of room for six-footers in the front and in the rear. Its 16 cubic feet of cargo space is welcoming, too. Besides all that, Avalon delivers a pleasing ride. My Avalon tester was a Touring model. While some have complained about its stiffer ride, I found it to be well-mannered and moderately firm.

      "text": "More Than Ever, CUVs Seen as Long-Term Trend \nDETROIT – Toyota will debut the redesigned, eighth-generation Camry next month at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. \nLook for the car to follow the mandate from Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda for more exciting styling and performance, says Bob Carter, senior vice president-automotive operations for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., today at the Toyota holiday media party. \n“We’ve been somewhat conservative in our styling…(but) we’ve been focusing on passionate, emotional design, and (making our cars) more fun-to-drive. This is the most significant vehicle that we’ve brought out forever, or perhaps in a long time,” he says. \nThe Camry has slumped, as have all midsize sedans this year, while American car buyers embrace light trucks, specifically CUVs. Through November, Camry sales were off 9.4% to 355,204 from 392,056 in the same period year-ago. \nNovember segmentation data is not yet available, but in October WardsAuto ’s Middle Car segment, where the Camry lives, declined 15.6% on a daily-selling-rate basis and in January-October lost 12.3% of its year-ago volume. \nCamry sales fell 16.2% last month on a DSR basis, however, the car’s 28,189 sales kept it as Toyota’s No.1 seller in the U.S. \nCarter says he expects the Camry to remain the top-selling car in the U.S. for the 15 th straight year, but reiterates within Toyota it may succumb to the RAV4 compact CUV. \n“Is the trend (of moving to utility vehicles) going to continue? My answer to that would be absolutely,” Carter says. “My goal is the Camry will always be the No.1-selling sedan, but the No.1-selling Toyota could be a RAV4.” \nRAV4 sales tallied 314,925 January-November, and Toyota has a goal to sell 400,000 in 2017 in the U.S. \nYet, Carter expects a new generation of the Camry to perform well, and likely lift the Middle Car segment up, as the Chevy Colorado’s introduction lifted the Small Pickup group. \nCarter doesn’t comment on rumors of a possible Camry EV, nor does he say if the car will retain its hybrid and V-6 engine options. Many competitors in the Camry’s group, such as the Hyundai Sonata, have discontinued a V-6 and use strictly a 4-cyl.",

Following this teaser tail light photo, it appears Toyota will be updating the Camry as an all-new model for the 2018 model year. \nThe new Camry, set to make its reveal at the North America International Auto Show (NAIAS), will be one of three parts of Toyota’s display. Apart from a display from Toyota, Lexus will have a press conference and there will be a ‘tech showcase’ as well. \nApart from this image, no official details have been shed regarding the new Camry. Judging from the design cues of the tail lights, we may likely see a more aggressive profile for the whole car’s design. \nHere's a set of photos snapped by our spies of a camouflaged 2018 Camry conducting road tests . \nUnder the hood we’ll probably find a 2.5-liter four cylinder for the base model, with a 2.0L turbocharged four cylinder powerplant option available for higher trims. We may find that powerplant in a performance-oriented variant of the Camry as well. As of today there is still no word regarding the return of the V6 motor to the Camry’s lineup, but a hybrid powertrain is in the cards. \nThe new Toyota Camry will make its debut at NAIAS in January, with units to be first released by late 2017 or early 2018.

(Toyota via AP) AP Toyota to revamp America's top-selling car amid boom in SUVs By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer Updated ( … ) HONS \nThis photo provided by Toyota shows the 2018 Camry. On Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, Toyota announced it would reveal the new version of America's top-selling sedan at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January 2017. (Toyota via AP) \nDETROIT (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. \nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\" \nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. Tags",

      "text": "Thursday, Dec 1st, 2016 @ 3:56 pm Toyota has released its first official teaser picture for the 2018 Camry , due to be unveiled in Detroit.The zoomed-in shot focuses on the rear taillight, which appears to blend into a vertical styling element that resembles an air duct.Aside from the redesigned taillights, the image hints at a more sculpted body with a few extra creases in the rear bodywork. In some ways the design hints at a slightly coupe-like or hatchback-inspired shape.The new Camry will presumably be underpinned by the Toyota New Global Architecture platform, but specific details are being kept under wraps for now.Toyota faces an uphill battle in retaining the Camry's position as the most popular model in the US market. The model could be due for a wider range of packages to attract new customers as many buyers shift toward higher-riding SUVs and crossovers. \n ",

      "text": "Technology News | Fri Dec 2, 2016 | 3:35am EST Honda outselling Toyota in China, sets up photo finish for 2016 A man is reflected on a window at Honda Motor's showroom in Tokyo, Japan, May 13, 2016. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo By Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu | BEIJING \nBEIJING Honda Motor Co's sales in China surpassed those of Toyota Motor Corp for the first 11 months of 2016 as fresh models lured consumers and set the Japanese rivals up for a photo finish for full-year sales ranking in the world's top auto market. \nChinese consumers have flocked to Honda's raft of new models, including a new version of the staple Civic sedan as well as particularly strong offerings in the booming sport-utility vehicle (SUVs) segment. \nTo meet rising demand, Japan's No. 3 automaker plans to break ground on Dec. 8 on a new factory in central China's Wuhan, according to a media invitation Honda has sent out. \nAuto sales in China remain under pressure from slowing economic growth, with analysts predicting weak growth next year despite a rebound in 2016 thanks to tax incentives. SUVs, though, have been a major exception, with the segment growing 45.6 percent year-to-date, as Chinese warm to larger cars. \nA Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment on its sales performance vis-à-vis rivals. \n\"We don't have a blind focus on boosting sales,\" he said. \"Our main objective in China is to achieve steady growth of our business, by focusing on customer satisfaction, including creating a quality sales and service environment.\" \nHonda sold roughly 14,500 cars more than Toyota for January to November to surpass it for the first time this year, according to sales reports released by the two firms on Friday, potentially setting up the Tokyo-based company to narrowly overtake Toyota in full-year sales if the trend continues. \n\"Beating a particular rival brand isn't our business objective in China,\" a Beijing-based Honda spokeswoman said. \"We focus on Chinese consumer needs and feel the strong sales momentum we have in China now is evidence that our strategies are working.\" \nHonda has recorded nine consecutive months of double-digit sales growth in China and is nearing its sales target of 1.18 million vehicles, which it revised upward by roughly 100,000 units in October. \nToyota, Japan's top automaker, met its 1.1 million vehicle sales target as of November. The automaker has traditionally lead its rival in the Chinese market, selling 240,000 cars more than Honda as recently as 2014. \nThe Japanese automakers still trail far behind market leaders General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ), which both sold around 3.6 million vehicles last year in China. \n(Reporting by Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) -- Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks.\nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer.\nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions.\nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years.\nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end.\nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future.\nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck.\n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations.\nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm.\n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\"\nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said.",

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo 3/3 By Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu | BEIJING \nBEIJING Honda Motor Co's sales in China surpassed those of Toyota Motor Corp for the first 11 months of 2016 as fresh models lured consumers and set the Japanese rivals up for a photo finish for full-year sales ranking in the world's top auto market. \nChinese consumers have flocked to Honda's raft of new models, including a new version of the staple Civic sedan as well as particularly strong offerings in the booming sport-utility vehicle (SUVs) segment. \nTo meet rising demand, Japan's No. 3 automaker plans to break ground on Dec. 8 on a new factory in central China's Wuhan, according to a media invitation Honda has sent out. \nAuto sales in China remain under pressure from slowing economic growth, with analysts predicting weak growth next year despite a rebound in 2016 thanks to tax incentives. SUVs, though, have been a major exception, with the segment growing 45.6 percent year-to-date, as Chinese warm to larger cars. \nA Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment on its sales performance vis-à-vis rivals. \n\"We don't have a blind focus on boosting sales,\" he said. \"Our main objective in China is to achieve steady growth of our business, by focusing on customer satisfaction, including creating a quality sales and service environment.\" \nHonda sold roughly 14,500 cars more than Toyota for January to November to surpass it for the first time this year, according to sales reports released by the two firms on Friday, potentially setting up the Tokyo-based company to narrowly overtake Toyota in full-year sales if the trend continues. \n\"Beating a particular rival brand isn't our business objective in China,\" a Beijing-based Honda spokeswoman said. \"We focus on Chinese consumer needs and feel the strong sales momentum we have in China now is evidence that our strategies are working.\" \nHonda has recorded nine consecutive months of double-digit sales growth in China and is nearing its sales target of 1.18 million vehicles, which it revised upward by roughly 100,000 units in October. \nToyota, Japan's top automaker, met its 1.15 million vehicle sales target as of November. The automaker has traditionally lead its rival in the Chinese market, selling 240,000 cars more than Honda as recently as 2014. \nThe Japanese automakers still trail far behind market leaders General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG, which both sold around 3.6 million vehicles last year in China. \n(Reporting by Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Next In Business News",

      "text": "By: Todd Lassa December 1, 2016 \nD ETROIT, Michigan – Though the American public continues its mass migration to crossover/utility vehicles, midsize sedans still rule the roost at brands like Toyota, which teased us Thursday with a look at the rear quarter-panel and roof sail of the all-new Camry. The 2018 Toyota Camry will be unveiled in January at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Bob Carter said here Thursday. \nCarter, who is senior vice president of automotive operations for Toyota Motor Sales (Toyota and Lexus) in North America, made another attempt at injecting sizzle into the Toyota brand’s bread-and-butter sedan. \n“This was a Camry that sent chills up my back,” Carter said, describing his first drive of the upcoming eighth-generation model. Though an automotive appliance by our No Boring Cars standard, Toyota has sold 355,204 through November. That’s off 9.4 percent versus the first 11 months of 2015, though it’s still the brand’s bestseller, ahead of Corolla (346,999, up 3.7 percent year-to-date) and RAV4 (314,925, up 11.1 percent year-to-date) and will be its bestseller again for the entire year, Carter predicted. \nThe Camry also will retain first place among U.S. car sales in calendar 2016, he predicted, or fourth behind the Ford F-Series, Chevrolet Silverado, and Ram pickup trucks. It makes a big contribution to Toyota’s bottom line, allowing plenty of capital to build very low-volume, interesting cars, like the Lexus LC 500 that Carter said is set for a Spring 2017 launch. Carter also said that the Toyota CH-R entry-CUV, which was originally intended for Scion will go on sale “later in the summer” of next year. \nToyota Motor Sales has scheduled an unprecedented three press conferences at NAIAS17 in Detroit, Carter said — one for the 2018 Toyota Camry, one for Lexus, and “a technical-based press conference that affects both brands,” which hints at a major advancement in Toyota Motors’ autonomous development. Media days for NAIAS are January 9 and 10.",

The automaker has traditionally lead its rival in the Chinese market, selling 240,000 cars more than Honda as recently as 2014. \nThe Japanese automakers still trail far behind market leaders General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and Volkswagen AG ( VOWG_p.DE ), which both sold around 3.6 million vehicles last year in China. \n(This story corrects Toyota 2016 sales target figure in penultimate paragraph to 1.15 million vehicles from 1.1 million) \n(Reporting by Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Share This:",

      "text": "By Shane McGlaun \nI can say in all seriousness that the Camry is one boring car. Toyota sells hoards of them, but they just don’t look that good to my eyes and I am not alone. It’s the car your mom or grandmother drives. Toyota is making an all-new Camry for 2018 and has offered up a signal teaser image of the car. \nThe shot shows the passenger side bumper and not much else. What we can tell from the image is that it actually looks pretty good. Take that with a grain of salt though because this is the company that builds the Prius, which is one of the kookiest, and ugliest cars on the road. \nI continue to hope that one day EV and hybrid designers will realize it’s ok to put the tech inside a normal looking car. The official debut of the new Camry will come at the North American International Auto Show and I wouldn’t be surprised of some more teaser shots come before that official unveil.",

On Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, Toyota announced it would reveal the new version of America's top-selling sedan at Detroit's North American International Auto Show ... more Photo: AP Toyota to revamp America's top-selling car amid boom in SUVs 1 / 1 Back to Gallery DETROIT (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. The Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. Toyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. A teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. Sales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. Toyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. So far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter , Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. A redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster , senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\" Midsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

      "text": "Toyota deal adds city tech executive to billionaires list Posted on Dec 2, 2016 5373 Views Mr Mike Macharia, Seven Seas Technologies CEO. PHOTO | DIANA NGILA By MUTHOKI MUMO, [email protected] \nSeven Seas Technologies co-founder and group chief executive Mike Macharia is the newest billionaire in town. \nA recent sale of stake to the Africa development fund of Japanese multinational Toyota valued Seven Seas Technologies (SST) at an estimated Sh3.2 billion. \nThe transaction put the value of Mr Macharia’s 35 per cent shareholding in the company at Sh1.12 billion, just about 15 years since the company was started. \nThe tech firm is the poster child of his entrepreneurship journey. \nAt his swanky boardroom on Riverside Drive, it is hard to imagine Mr Macharia as the 25-year-old who “accidentally” started a tech company at a time when owning a mobile phone was a big status statement and the IT sector in Kenya was virtually non-existent. \n“I don’t think the word billionaire fits. Maybe I am a billionaire at heart,” he protests matter-of-factly. \nThe venture capital arm of Toyota Tsusho’s injection of Sh300 million ($3 million) into Seven Seas in return for a 9.5 per cent stake, however, confirms that Mr Macharia, 41, is indeed a billionaire. \nDROPPED OUT \nA born Nairobian who grew up in the neighborhood that would later become Thika Road’s Garden Estate, Mr Macharia dropped out of a mathematics and physics course to become an accountant. \nAt the inception of Seven Seas, he had been working for a local IT company while exploring opportunities to study in the United States. \nHis journey would be diverted to Rwanda. His first contract involved helping the country’s national carrier set up its IT systems. \nIt was this contract that necessitated the setting up of the company, an initial partnership with Dutchman Rob Van Hoek — who left the company recently but retains a minority stake. \nThe ambition was burning. The name Seven Seas was meant to evoke the spirit of a company unlimited by geography or sector. \n“Seven Seas aviation. Seven Seas hospitals,” Mr Macharia quips. \nRwanda proved a fertile ground for Seven Seas. Just as he was finishing the Rwanda Airlines job, the country’s military approached him with their own contract. \nHe soon found himself making a presentation to uniformed officers in a derelict building where the signs of Rwanda’s history of conflict were yet to be erased. \nHe clinched that deal too. Mr Van Hoek attributes this initial success of Seven Seas partly to Mr Macharia’s abilities as a salesperson. \nCONVINCING APPROACH \n“He was convincing in his approach. He was good at getting the customers and the deals. I was good at operations and executions,” he told the Business Daily in a phone interview. \nThe company grew, attracting the attention of James Gachui, a tycoon with a dominant presence in Kenya’s business circles with interests that ranged from manufacturing to retail trade. \nThe late Gachui was among the original 29 investors that founded TransCentury, then quaintly termed as an investment club. \nMr Gachui bought into the company, served as its board chairman for years, injecting into it “maturity”. \n“He played a key role in guiding a young team toward institutionalisation of the business,” says Mr Macharia. \nToday, a portrait of Mr Gachui greets all visitors walking into the third-floor boardroom at Seven Seas. \nAnother major investor in Seven Seas is the Abraaj Group, with 21 per cent stake. Mr Gachui’s estate still holds a stake in the company. \nSeven Seas ventured where many others dared not. It spread to Nigeria, a market that was and remains daunting for many East African firms. It even has a foothold in Europe through a Portuguese subsidiary. Latest Stories ",

      "text": "After years of trash talking battery electric cars and promoting hydrogen fuel cells , Toyota is in the midst of a major strategy shift. The Japanese automaker is assembling a team to develop a mass-market electric car. Its choice of leader for that team indicates Toyota is taking the project very seriously.\nCEO Akio Toyoda — who is also the grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda — will personally lead the electric car team, a Toyota spokesperson told Reuters earlier this week. Toyoda’s involvement is meant to speed up the development process of the company’s first mass-market electric car , the spokesperson said.\nWhile his company has spent the past few years concentrating on hydrogen fuel cell cars, Toyoda is not a complete electric car newbie. He engineered a 2010 deal with Tesla that saw the Silicon Valley automaker purchase a Toyota-owned factory in Fremont, California, which became Tesla’s sole assembly plant. Toyota also invested in Tesla, while the smaller automaker developed an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4 EV, a limited-production electric SUV built to satisfy California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate. The two companies have since parted ways.\nMore: Lucid Motors’ Tesla-fighting electric car will be built in Arizona\nToyoda will oversee a newly formed team of engineers. That Toyota is just assembling the team now indicates the decision to build a mass-market electric car was made relatively recently. That decision may have been made in response to low sales of the Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell car , and a slower-than-expected ramp up of hydrogen fueling infrastructure.\nOn the flip side, Toyota has grown more confident in the lithium-ion batteries that are an essential ingredient of modern electric cars. Recent statements by engineers indicate that Toyota feels it now has enough experience with lithium-ion batteries to use them in an electric car.\nReports so far indicate Toyota is aiming to debut its electric car in 2020, in time for the Tokyo Olympics. The vehicle may turn out to be a small SUV, and could use the same Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform as the Prius hybrid and 2018 C-HR .\nForget cars, Toyota wants hydrogen fuel-cell commercial trucks Strategy shift: Toyota commits to all-electric vehicles, forms special team Will Toyota change course and build a mass-market electric car?",

      "text": "Honda outselling Toyota in China, sets up photo finish for 2016 Updated: December 2, 2016 — 7:19 AM EST Share Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu Reuters Mail icon \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co's <7267.T> sales in China surpassed those of Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> for the first 11 months of 2016 as new models lured consumers and set the Japanese rivals up for a photo finish in their rankings for full-year sales in the world's top auto market. \nChinese consumers have flocked to Honda's raft of new models, including a new version of the staple Civic sedan, as well as particularly strong offerings in the booming sport-utility vehicle (SUVs) segment. \nTo meet rising demand, Japan's No. 3 automaker plans to break ground on Dec. 8 on a factory in central China's Wuhan, according to a media invitation Honda has sent out. \nAuto sales in China remain under pressure from slowing economic growth, with analysts predicting weak growth next year despite a rebound in 2016 thanks to tax incentives. \nSUVs, though, have been a major exception, with the segment growing 45.6 percent year-to-date, as Chinese warm to larger cars. \nA Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment on its sales performance vis-à-vis rivals. \n\"We don't have a blind focus on boosting sales,\" he said. \"Our main objective in China is to achieve steady growth of our business, by focusing on customer satisfaction, including creating a quality sales and service environment.\" \nHonda sold roughly 14,500 cars more than Toyota for January to November to surpass it for the first time this year, according to sales reports released by the two firms on Friday, potentially setting up the Tokyo-based company to narrowly overtake Toyota in full-year sales if the trend continues. \n\"Beating a particular rival brand isn't our business objective in China,\" a Beijing-based Honda spokeswoman said. \"We focus on Chinese consumer needs and feel the strong sales momentum we have in China now is evidence that our strategies are working.\" \nHonda has recorded nine consecutive months of double-digit sales growth in China and is nearing its sales target of 1.18 million vehicles, which it revised upward by roughly 100,000 units in October. \nToyota, Japan's top automaker, fell about 50,000 vehicles short of reaching its 1.15 million vehicle sales target as of November. The automaker has traditionally lead its rival in the Chinese market, selling 240,000 cars more than Honda as recently as 2014. \nThe Japanese automakers still trail far behind market leaders General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG , which both sold around 3.6 million vehicles last year in China. \n(This story corrects sales figure in second to last paragraph) \n(Reporting by Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Published: December 2, 2016 — 3:35 AM EST | Updated: December 2, 2016 — 7:19 AM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "Toyota to revamp America's top-selling car amid boom in SUVs Updated: December 1, 2016 — 3:09 PM EST Share TOM KRISHER The Associated Press \nDETROIT (AP) - Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. \nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\" \nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. Published: ",

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nBEIJING -- Honda Motor Co.'s sales in China surpassed those of Toyota Motor Corp. in the first 11 months of 2016 as new models lured consumers and set the Japanese rivals up for a photo finish in their rankings for full-year sales in the world's top auto market. \nChinese consumers have flocked to Honda's raft of new models, including a new version of the staple Civic sedan, as well as particularly strong offerings in the booming crossover and SUV segments. \nTo meet rising demand, Japan's No. 3 automaker plans to break ground on Dec. 8 on a factory in central China's Wuhan, according to a media invitation Honda has sent out. \nAuto sales in China remain under pressure from slowing economic growth, with analysts predicting weak growth next year despite a rebound in 2016 thanks to tax incentives. \nSUVs and crossovers, though, have been a major exception, with the segment growing 46 percent year-to-date, as Chinese warm to larger cars. \nA Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment on its sales performance vis-à-vis rivals. \n\"We don't have a blind focus on boosting sales,\" he said. \"Our main objective in China is to achieve steady growth of our business, by focusing on customer satisfaction, including creating a quality sales and service environment.\" \nHonda sold roughly 14,500 cars more than Toyota for January to November to surpass it for the first time this year, according to sales reports released by the two firms on Friday, potentially setting up the Tokyo-based company to narrowly overtake Toyota in full-year sales if the trend continues. \n\"Beating a particular rival brand isn't our business objective in China,\" a Beijing-based Honda spokeswoman said. \"We focus on Chinese consumer needs and feel the strong sales momentum we have in China now is evidence that our strategies are working.\" \nHonda has recorded nine consecutive months of double-digit sales growth in China and is nearing its sales target of 1.18 million vehicles, which it revised upward by roughly 100,000 units in October. \nToyota, Japan's top automaker, fell about 50,000 vehicles short of reaching its 1.15 million vehicle sales target as of November. The automaker has traditionally lead its rival in the Chinese market, selling 240,000 cars more than Honda as recently as 2014. \nThe Japanese automakers still trail far behind market leaders General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG, which both sold around 3.6 million vehicles last year in China.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nAfter years of trash talking battery electric cars and promoting hydrogen fuel cells , Toyota is in the midst of a major strategy shift. The Japanese automaker is assembling a team to develop a mass-market electric car. Its choice of leader for that team indicates Toyota is taking the project very seriously. \nCEO Akio Toyoda — who is also the grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda — will personally lead the electric car team, a Toyota spokesperson told Reuters earlier this week. Toyoda’s involvement is meant to speed up the development process of the company’s first mass-market electric car , the spokesperson said. \nWhile his company has spent the past few years concentrating on hydrogen fuel cell cars, Toyoda is not a complete electric car newbie. He engineered a 2010 deal with Tesla that saw the Silicon Valley automaker purchase a Toyota-owned factory in Fremont, California, which became Tesla’s sole assembly plant. Toyota also invested in Tesla, while the smaller automaker developed an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4 EV, a limited-production electric SUV built to satisfy California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate. The two companies have since parted ways. \nMore: Lucid Motors’ Tesla-fighting electric car will be built in Arizona \nToyoda will oversee a newly formed team of engineers. That Toyota is just assembling the team now indicates the decision to build a mass-market electric car was made relatively recently. That decision may have been made in response to low sales of the Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell car , and a slower-than-expected ramp up of hydrogen fueling infrastructure. \nOn the flip side, Toyota has grown more confident in the lithium-ion batteries that are an essential ingredient of modern electric cars. Recent statements by engineers indicate that Toyota feels it now has enough experience with lithium-ion batteries to use them in an electric car. \nReports so far indicate Toyota is aiming to debut its electric car in 2020, in time for the Tokyo Olympics. The vehicle may turn out to be a small SUV, and could use the same Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform as the Prius hybrid and 2018 C-HR . Also watch:",

The Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. Toyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. A teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. Sales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. Toyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. So far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter , Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. A redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster , senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\" Midsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. Latest News Video ",

      "text": "toyota ceo will lead electric car division akio toyoda More After years of trash talking battery electric cars and promoting hydrogen fuel cells , Toyota is in the midst of a major strategy shift. The Japanese automaker is assembling a team to develop a mass-market electric car. Its choice of leader for that team indicates Toyota is taking the project very seriously.\nCEO Akio Toyoda — who is also the grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda — will personally lead the electric car team, a Toyota spokesperson told Reuters earlier this week. Toyoda’s involvement is meant to speed up the development process of the company’s first mass-market electric car , the spokesperson said.\nWhile his company has spent the past few years concentrating on hydrogen fuel cell cars, Toyoda is not a complete electric car newbie. He engineered a 2010 deal with Tesla that saw the Silicon Valley automaker purchase a Toyota-owned factory in Fremont, California, which became Tesla’s sole assembly plant. Toyota also invested in Tesla, while the smaller automaker developed an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4 EV, a limited-production electric SUV built to satisfy California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate. The two companies have since parted ways.\nMore: Lucid Motors’ Tesla-fighting electric car will be built in Arizona\nToyoda will oversee a newly formed team of engineers. That Toyota is just assembling the team now indicates the decision to build a mass-market electric car was made relatively recently. That decision may have been made in response to low sales of the Toyota Mirai hydrogen fuel-cell car , and a slower-than-expected ramp up of hydrogen fueling infrastructure.\nOn the flip side, Toyota has grown more confident in the lithium-ion batteries that are an essential ingredient of modern electric cars. Recent statements by engineers indicate that Toyota feels it now has enough experience with lithium-ion batteries to use them in an electric car.\nReports so far indicate Toyota is aiming to debut its electric car in 2020, in time for the Tokyo Olympics. The vehicle may turn out to be a small SUV, and could use the same Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) platform as the Prius hybrid and 2018 C-HR .\nForget cars, Toyota wants hydrogen fuel-cell commercial trucks Strategy shift: Toyota commits to all-electric vehicles, forms special team Will Toyota change course and build a mass-market electric car?",

      "text": "Honda outselling Toyota in China December 2, 2016 - 16:41   Honda Motor Co's (7267.T) sales in China surpassed those of Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) for the first 11 months of 2016 as fresh models lured consumers and set the Japanese rivals up for a photo finish for full-year sales ranking in the world's top auto market, Reuters said. \nChinese consumers have flocked to Honda's raft of new models, including a new version of the staple Civic sedan as well as particularly strong offerings in the booming sport-utility vehicle (SUVs) segment. \nTo meet rising demand, Japan's No. 3 automaker plans to break ground on Dec. 8 on a new factory in central China's Wuhan, according to a media invitation Honda has sent out. \nAuto sales in China remain under pressure from slowing economic growth, with analysts predicting weak growth next year despite a rebound in 2016 thanks to tax incentives. SUVs, though, have been a major exception, with the segment growing 45.6 percent year-to-date, as Chinese warm to larger cars. \nA Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment on its sales performance vis-à-vis rivals. \n\"We don't have a blind focus on boosting sales,\" he said. \"Our main objective in China is to achieve steady growth of our business, by focusing on customer satisfaction, including creating a quality sales and service environment.\" \nHonda sold roughly 14,500 cars more than Toyota for January to November to surpass it for the first time this year, according to sales reports released by the two firms on Friday, potentially setting up the Tokyo-based company to narrowly overtake Toyota in full-year sales if the trend continues. \n\"Beating a particular rival brand isn't our business objective in China,\" a Beijing-based Honda spokeswoman said. \"We focus on Chinese consumer needs and feel the strong sales momentum we have in China now is evidence that our strategies are working.\" \nHonda has recorded nine consecutive months of double-digit sales growth in China and is nearing its sales target of 1.18 million vehicles, which it revised upward by roughly 100,000 units in October. \nToyota, Japan's top automaker, met its 1.15 million vehicle sales target as of November. The automaker has traditionally lead its rival in the Chinese market, selling 240,000 cars more than Honda as recently as 2014. \nThe Japanese automakers still trail far behind market leaders General Motors Co (GM.N) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), which both sold around 3.6 million vehicles last year in China.

      "text": "Toyota to revamp America’s top-selling car amid boom in SUVs Tom Krisher, Associated Press Published: December 1, 2016, 7:46 pm Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) This photo provided by Toyota shows the 2018 Camry. On Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, Toyota announced it would reveal the new version of America's top-selling sedan at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January 2017. (Toyota via AP) \nDETROIT (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America’s top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit’s North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota’s RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn’t a pickup truck. \n“It’s possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,” said Bob Carter, Toyota’s senior vice president of auto operations. \nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \n“They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,” Schuster said. “Unless there’s some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it’s going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.” \nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won’t return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. \nGet breaking news, weather and traffic on the go.

      "text": "by Mark McNabb + \nToyota has released a teaser shot of the 2018 Camry ahead of the 2017 North American International Auto Show happening in January in Detroit, Michigan. No details were provided with the image other than the descriptor of “all-new.” Yep, apparently Toyota’s hot-selling sedan is getting a ground-up overhaul. \nThe image might not show much, but what is visible is rather appealing. The new LED taillights have a racetrack-style design that swoops and curves around the light housing. The prominent vertical vent bisects the taillight, created a rather dynamic piece of design. We doubt the vent is functional, but it can’t hurt to hope. \nAlso clearly seen are sharp character creases running horizontally down the body. Two heavy creases are seen coming off the top of the rear fender and another that runs through the fender, briefly interrupted by the wheel arch. These lines run into the truck lid and give the Camry’ s tail a muscular appearance. \nAlso of note is the C-pillar. It has an interesting C-like shape to it far different than the current Camry. This leads up to think Toyota’s “all-new” claim isn’t just marketing speak. The XSE trim level badge is seen on the truck, denoting this is the Camry’s sportiest model. A tall decklid spoiler is present as well, likely accompanying the XSE badge. The wheels are visible as well and feature machined faced front and dark-painted pockets, all wrapped in low-profile tires. \nWe’ll have to wait until Detroit to see the rest of the 2018 Camry, but if the rest of the car looks as good as the XSE’s rear quarter, Toyota should have a hit on its hands. \nContinue reading for more information. continue reading Why It Matters \nThe Camry is Toyota’ s biggest seller by far, with 429,355 units sold in the U.S. in 2015 alone. A half-million Camrys sold – that’s huge. (Or as Donald Trump would say, “YUGE!”) Toyota designers and engineers must shoulder the burden of remaking the brand’s biggest seller. They have to cater to a wide audience that includes everyone from young families to retirees looking for a new car. Needless to say, the stakes are extremely high. Gallery Toyota Camry \nThings could go wrong. Remember the ninth-generation Honda Civic that debuted in 2012? Its fresh design lasted a single year before Honda revamped its appearance for 2013 due to abysmal reception and spiraling sales. Honda completely replaced the Civic for the 2016 model year with the 10th generation. But the damage had already been done. The Civic lost ground in its market share as its fierce competition ate up the lost territory. Only now is the Civic slowly rising back to prominence again. \nOf course, that’s a horror story that no one hopes (or expects) Toyota to experience. The revamp of the Camry is a welcomed one – and from the looks of things – will usher in a new era of an exciting mid-size entry from Toyota. We’re betting that if the rest of the 2018 Camry looks this good, Toyota will have officially shaken the Camry’s appliance-like character that plagued the previous (and some of) the current generation.

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) \nDETROIT (AP) - Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America’s top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit’s North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota’s RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn’t a pickup truck. \n“It’s possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,” said Bob Carter, Toyota’s senior vice president of auto operations. \nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \n“They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,” Schuster said. “Unless there’s some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it’s going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.” \nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won’t return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post... ",

      "text": "By Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co's <7267.T> sales in China surpassed those of Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> for the first 11 months of 2016 as new models lured consumers and set the Japanese rivals up for a photo finish in their rankings for full-year sales in the world's top auto market.\nChinese consumers have flocked to Honda's raft of new models, including a new version of the staple Civic sedan, as well as particularly strong offerings in the booming sport-utility vehicle (SUVs) segment.\nTo meet rising demand, Japan's No. 3 automaker plans to break ground on Dec. 8 on a factory in central China's Wuhan, according to a media invitation Honda has sent out.\nAuto sales in China remain under pressure from slowing economic growth, with analysts predicting weak growth next year despite a rebound in 2016 thanks to tax incentives.\nSUVs, though, have been a major exception, with the segment growing 45.6 percent year-to-date, as Chinese warm to larger cars.\nA Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment on its sales performance vis-à-vis rivals.\n\"We don't have a blind focus on boosting sales,\" he said. \"Our main objective in China is to achieve steady growth of our business, by focusing on customer satisfaction, including creating a quality sales and service environment.\"\nHonda sold roughly 14,500 cars more than Toyota for January to November to surpass it for the first time this year, according to sales reports released by the two firms on Friday, potentially setting up the Tokyo-based company to narrowly overtake Toyota in full-year sales if the trend continues.\n\"Beating a particular rival brand isn't our business objective in China,\" a Beijing-based Honda spokeswoman said. \"We focus on Chinese consumer needs and feel the strong sales momentum we have in China now is evidence that our strategies are working.\"\nHonda has recorded nine consecutive months of double-digit sales growth in China and is nearing its sales target of 1.18 million vehicles, which it revised upward by roughly 100,000 units in October.\nToyota, Japan's top automaker, fell about 50,000 vehicles short of reaching its 1.15 million vehicle sales target as of November. The automaker has traditionally lead its rival in the Chinese market, selling 240,000 cars more than Honda as recently as 2014.\nThe Japanese automakers still trail far behind market leaders General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG , which both sold around 3.6 million vehicles last year in China.\n(This story corrects sales figure in second to last paragraph)\n(Reporting by Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

      "text": "Hybrid Rivals: Ford Fusion vs Chevrolet Malibu vs Toyota Camry Three popular mid-size hybrids, one fuel-sipping winner.\nby Emme Hall 9:29 Close Drag I remember the days when hybrids were weird-looking cars that only the most green of the green eco-folks would buy. Well, those days are gone, as manufacturers churn out gasoline-electric versions of their most popular models, making them look almost indistinguishable from their gas-only counterparts.\nFor this turn of Roadshow Rivals, we've taken the hybrid versions of the 2017 Ford Fusion , 2016 Toyota Camry and 2016 Chevrolet Malibu and put them to the test to see which one takes the hybrid podium. We did a fuel economy test on the mean city streets, but we also spiced things up with a drag race at an abandoned air strip.\nThird Place: Toyota Camry The Toyota Camry Hybrid boasts the most power out of our three contenders.\nPhoto by Antuan Goodwin/Roadshow The 2016 Toyota Camry hybrid has the biggest power output of our three rivals. The 2.5-liter engine on its own puts out 156 horsepower and an equal amount of torque. Add the 105 kw electric motor and the total power goes up to 200 horses, enough to thoroughly spank the Malibu and the Fusion in our drag race.\nBut when it comes to real-world efficiency, the Camry suffered a bit. Toyota claims an EPA fuel rating of 40 miles per gallon in the city, 38 miles per gallon on the highway and 40 miles per gallon combined. That's enough for it to go 680 miles on one 17-gallon tank of fuel, but the Camry returned 42.4 miles per gallon in our real-world testing loop.\nWe all agreed the Camry was the least pleasing to drive, with sloppy handling and a ride that left us all feeling disconnected from the road. While it came out on top in our drag race, it was slow to leave the line, relying on horsepower to make up the difference.\nThe Camry comes with Toyota's Entune system, which doesn't have anything to complain about, save for the absence of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, but neither does it have any stand-out features. The 7-inch touchscreen responds to inputs fairly quickly and satellite radio, iPod connectivity and Bluetooth are all in the mix. In the XLE, trim blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control and lane departure alert are all optional.\nThe 2016 Toyota Camry hybrid in the XLE trim starts at $30,140, just slightly less than the Fusion.\nSecond Place: Ford Fusion The 2017 Ford Fusion incorporates the excellent Sync 3 infotainment system and boasts fuel economy in the 40s.\nPhoto by Antuan Goodwin/CNET Roadshow The Ford Fusion hybrid features a 2-liter four cylinder engine, good for 141 horsepower and 129 pound-feet of torque. When paired with an 88 kw electric motor, the total power output is 188 horsepower. While the Fusion came in last in our drag race, we all thought it was the most rewarding to drive, offering up a spry chassis and direct steering.\nThe Fusion has an EPA fuel rating of 43 miles per gallon in the city, 41 miles per gallon on the highway and 42 miles per gallon combined. However, during our 10-mile test of city driving, the Fusion returned an impressive 47 miles per gallon.\nThe Fusion features Ford's Sync 3 infotainment system, using an 8-inch LCD touchscreen with pinch-to-zoom capabilities. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both included, as well as voice recognition, and satellite radio. The system boasts crisp graphics and a quick response time.\nThe 2017 Ford Fusion in Titanium trim starts at $30,520, making it the most expensive of our three rivals. Expect to pay more if you want safety technology like blind-spot monitoring and lane departure warning or convenience features like adaptive cruise control and park assist.\nFirst Place: Chevrolet Malibu Enlarge Image The Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid comes out as a completely new car for the 2016 model year, with a hybrid drivetrain borrowing technologies from the Volt plug-in hybrid.\nPhoto by Antuan Goodwin/CNET Roadshow The big winner was the 2016 Chevrolet Malibu. The 1.8-liter four cylinder engine is helped along by a 76 kw motor, bringing the total output to 182 horsepower and 277 pound/feet of torque. All that twisting power made the Malibu pretty quick off the line at the drag race, but the more powerful Camry was able to pass it halfway through.\nThough it came in as first loser in flat-out speed, the Malibu easily won the real world efficiency test, returning over 50 miles per gallon on the city driving loop. The EPA estimates the Malibu's fuel economy at 47 miles per gallon in the city, 46 miles per gallon on the highway and 46 miles per gallon combined, making the Chevrolet a frugal machine, indeed.\nStandard tech in the cabin includes a 7-inch touchscreen loaded with Chevrolet's MyLink infotainment system. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto make it easy to pair your smartphone, and OnStar and a 4G LTE hotspot are all included in the base price of $28,645.\nFor an extra $1,195 Chevrolet will add park assist, forward collision alert, rear cross traffic alert, lane keeping assist and blind spot monitoring. Also available are a larger touchscreen, navigation and adaptive cruise control.\nWhile not quite as fun and zippy to drive as the Ford Fusion, the Malibu proved itself to be a comfortable commuter. The steering felt a little light but the chassis was well sorted and the brakes were very linear, exhibiting none of the grabby feel that plagues many hybrids.\nWe gave the win to the Chevrolet Malibu hybrid first for its impressive fuel economy, but we also liked its looks, available technical features and easy ride. It also starts at less than the Ford Fusion or Toyota Camry hybrids.\nWith their hybrid drivetrains, all of these mid-size sedans get exceptional fuel economy, far above their gasoline-only counterparts.\nPhoto by Antuan Goodwin/CNET Roadshow ",

      "text": "Toyota to revamp top-selling Camry Thursday Dec 1, 2016 at 7:12 PM Dec 1, 2016 at 7:43   \nDETROIT — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations.

      "text": "Honda outselling Toyota in China, sets up photo finish for 2016 Fri Dec 2, 2016 7:19am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co's (7267.T: Quote ) sales in China surpassed those of Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T: Quote ) for the first 11 months of 2016 as new models lured consumers and set the Japanese rivals up for a photo finish in their rankings for full-year sales in the world's top auto market. \nChinese consumers have flocked to Honda's raft of new models, including a new version of the staple Civic sedan, as well as particularly strong offerings in the booming sport-utility vehicle (SUVs) segment. \nTo meet rising demand, Japan's No. 3 automaker plans to break ground on Dec. 8 on a factory in central China's Wuhan, according to a media invitation Honda has sent out. \nAuto sales in China remain under pressure from slowing economic growth, with analysts predicting weak growth next year despite a rebound in 2016 thanks to tax incentives. \nSUVs, though, have been a major exception, with the segment growing 45.6 percent year-to-date, as Chinese warm to larger cars. \nA Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment on its sales performance vis-à-vis rivals. \n\"We don't have a blind focus on boosting sales,\" he said. \"Our main objective in China is to achieve steady growth of our business, by focusing on customer satisfaction, including creating a quality sales and service environment.\" \nHonda sold roughly 14,500 cars more than Toyota for January to November to surpass it for the first time this year, according to sales reports released by the two firms on Friday, potentially setting up the Tokyo-based company to narrowly overtake Toyota in full-year sales if the trend continues.

      "title": "Styling Size-up: 2018 Toyota C-HR vs. Compact CUV Competition",
      "text": "  \nToyota is late to the subcompact crossover party, but what it lacks in timeliness it makes up for in loud, impossible-to-ignore styling with the 2018 Toyota C-HR . The small crossover was finally shown in U.S.-spec trim at the L.A. auto show, and now we can better compare it against three of its top rivals, including the Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, and the equally polarizing Nissan Juke. \nThe C-HR’s front end probably won’t offend anyone, as it doesn’t stray far from the design language we’ve seen on the Corolla, Camry, RAV4, and other models. The narrow grille meets the wide, angled-inward headlights, which are swept back across the sculpted front fenders and reach almost to the end of the wheel well. The front fascia isn’t as polarizing as the Juke’s, which has its headlights in the bumper and a set of faux-headlights (actually daytime running lights) above the grille. \nThings get really interesting when you look at the C-HR from the side. Toyota takes the coupe styling trend to a new level with a profile that’s nothing like anything else in the class. The rear glass is raked even more than that of the Juke, and there are two rear spoilers just for kicks – one that visually extends the roofline and another ducktail-like piece molded into the liftgate. Want character lines? The C-HR has them in spades. \nIn back, the taillights protrude outward and extend beyond the bodywork. The rear bumper tapers upward, giving the crossover a kind of hourglass shape when viewed directly from behind. Compared to the other three competitors , the C-HR easily has the busiest rear end, but that might not be a bad thing to this vehicle’s target market. \nThe C-HR’s interior is less extroverted than its exterior, but there are still a few unique touches. The headliner has designs pressed into it at the front corners, and the door panels feature textured plastic inserts with a pattern that evokes carbon fiber weave. The rest of the cabin is fairly pedestrian, with its free-standing infotainment screen and common two-binnacle gauge cluster design. \nThe 2018 Toyota C-HR definitely stands out from its peers, but is that a good or bad thing? How does it compare against the Nissan Juke, Honda HR-V, and Mazda CX-3? Of course, there’s also the Jeep Renegade, Fiat 500X, Chevrolet Trax, and the new-to-the-U.S. Ford EcoSport to consider. Tell us how the C-HR stacks up in the comments below. \nLast week, we asked you about the 2017 Jeep Compass , and most of you were fans of the crossover’s redesign. \n“Refreshing. It doesn’t have the overly bulbous curves of other crossovers in its class nor does it look like a minivan with swing doors instead of sliding doors,” said RolandCole . \nRCD agreed, saying, “The design is based on the Grand Cherokee but the finished product is unique enough to stand out. Refreshing.” \nAt least one commenter was so stoked about the crossover’s looks, he was willing to defend it physically. “If anyone calls this revolting, I’m going to punch them,” said MadisonTSX . \nStill, some weren’t sold. “In comparison to the outgoing model, refreshing. On its own, it’s generically good looking. It wears a generic corporate face. It’s nothing to be disappointed about, but it’s nothing to be excited about either,” said Lord Wou .
