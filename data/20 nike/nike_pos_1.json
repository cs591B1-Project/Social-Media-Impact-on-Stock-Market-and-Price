      "text": "AFP | November 9, 2016 \"I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company,\" Ronaldo said in a Nike press release announcing a \"new, long-term contract\". \nMADRID: A day after signing a bumper fresh contract with Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo has boosted his mind-boggling earnings with a new deal with Nike, the American sports giant said on Tuesday. \nTogether the multimillion mega-deals are expected to cement Ronaldo’s status as the world’s highest-paid sportsman, ahead of great Barcelona rival Lionel Messi. \nAccording to American magazine Forbes, Ronaldo trumped Messi in 2016 with an income of $88 million (80 million euros, £71 million). \nThere are no concrete figures, but Ronaldo’s new five-year contract with Real is expected to net the 31-year-old Portuguese forward in the region of a basic salary of 25 million euros a year. \nHe could also bag up to 40 million euros a year for the Nike deal, according to Marca. \nMarca and AS, the Spanish sports dailies, said the Nike deal is for life, rather like the one between Nike and basketball legend Michael Jordan. \n“I have a great relationship with this brand, I have great friends here in the company,” Ronaldo said in a Nike press release announcing a “new, long-term contract”. \n“We work as a family too,” he added. \n“This is my brand.” \nRonaldo on Monday signalled his intention to keep playing for 10 more years after rounding off a “dream year”. \nThe three-time World Player of the Year has enjoyed his most successful year at a collective level, scoring the winning penalty as Madrid won the Champions League for an 11th time in May before captaining Portugal to their first major tournament win at Euro 2016.",

      "text": "Tweet 0 shares / likes \nOh, hey – this Kevin Durant guy is pretty good. Since joining the Golden State Warriors, a basketball team in the Western Conference that won 73 out of 82 regular season games last year, KD has been nothing short of his usual self, which includes averages of 28 ppg and 8 rbg. His Nike KD 9 has been a stellar performance model thanks to a 3/4 length Zoom-cushioned midsole unit, dynamic Flyknit upper for a malleable, ventilated fit, and unique mid-top ankle support that you just slip into. \nThe colorways have been releasing en masse since the start of the regular season with the likes of a KD 9 “Oreo” and KD 9 “Christmas” bridging the gap between on-court functionality and aesthetics that would work equally as well in a lifestyle context. This Niek KD 9 Dark Obsidian continues that momentum with the perfect pop of Hyper Turquoise on the visible Zoom midsole while shades of Dark Obsidian and a lighter slate blue gives the upper a 50/50 split. A metallic Swoosh finishes things off with a premium touch to contrast a stark black midsole. \nCheck out more photos of this upcoming KD 9 Dark Obsidian release and we’ll keep you in the loop on an official release date right here on Sneaker News.

      "text": "Tweet 0 shares / likes \nWhen it comes to the greatness of Kevin Durant, his achievements speak for themselves. From being the MVP of the 2014 NBA season to his countless All-NBA Team awards, these accomplishments reflect years of grueling drudgery in his earlier years. As a kid, Durant’s hometown of Baltimore, Maryland encountered harsh weather conditions during the winter but that wouldn’t stop Durant from pursuing his dreams. While practicing his shots out on the courts, his hands would freeze from the frigid temperatures and in an attempt to warm up his hands, he would often pour hot water on them. \nThe new Nike KD 9 “Fire and Ice” are inspired by this hardship on the court in his earlier days. The sneakers feature a red left shoe with a fiery graphic and a blue left shoe with an icy toe to represent the “Fire and Ice” concept from Durant’s humble beginnings. The sneakers are available now as a kid’s exclusive at select Nike Basketball retailers such as Solefly . \"Air Jordan 11 Premium Grey Suede\" \"nike kd 9\" ",

      "text": "The price of Nike’s self-lacing sneakers revealed, and yeah, they’re *definitely* going to cost you If you ever dreamed of dressing like Marty McFly, the time to sport Back to the Future -inspired fashions is mere weeks away. Since Nike unveiled its tech-meets-fashion HyperAdapt 1.0 earlier in the year, we hope you’ve been saving your coins because the self-lacing sneakers will cost you a pretty penny.\nHow much is that exactly? Think expensive, but slightly less pricey than the $895 pair of Louboutins that almost wrecked Zendaya’s feet on the red carpet. Fine, we’ll stop teasing now and give it to ya straight: Gizmodo reports that the highly anticipated self-lacing sneakers will go for $720 when they drop on Dec. 1.\n\nUm…wow. So, clearly the price of these kicks will test the loyalty of die-hard Back to the Future fans and shoe lovers who *so* badly want present reality to reflect the coolness of the film’s futuristic dystopia. Like, who knew laziness cost this much?!\nIntroducing The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 Lacing up will never be the same. Click the link in our bio to learn more. \nA photo posted by nike (@nike) on Mar 16, 2016 at 9:53pm PDT \nBut as the saying goes, beauty is pain and fashion is beauty (or something like that), so we have a feeling that for many folks who want to rock these shoes, the choice between owning a pair or paying a credit card bill and buying groceries for the month just got that much more difficult.\nThe post The price of Nike’s self-lacing sneakers revealed, and yeah, they’re *definitely* going to cost you appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "title": "Nike Is Worth A Closer Look",
      "text": "Summary \nNike has had an excellent business and security history over the years. \nIf you were to screen for dividend yields or valuations, Nike probably wouldn’t come up on your list. \nHowever, due to the inherent quality and potential for growth, the security could now be worth a closer look with a materially lower share price this year. Upon first glance, shares of Nike (NYSE: NKE ) may not appear all that attractive. Depending on where you look, the security is trading hands around 22 or 23 times earnings. With a $0.16 quarterly dividend this equates to a \"current\" starting yield of about 1.3%. Neither metric is especially compelling, especially for such a well-established firm. And to be sure, Nike likely gets skipped over in many stock screens looking for a minimum yield or lower earnings multiple. Yet I would contend that Nike's inherent quality and remaining potential ought to warrant a closer look. The investing world is fun because not everything trades at (or should trade at) 15 times earnings year-in and year-out. Instead you have to contemplate faster growing companies with loftier valuations as compared to slower growing businesses with more reasonable values. Or a lower starting yield coupled with fast growth prospects as compared to a higher beginning dividend with slower expected rates of increase. Nike is on very sound footing . Long-term debt sits at $2 billion, as compared to cash of $2.6 billion and short-term investments of $2.1 billion. Total liabilities come in at $9 billion, whereas cash, short-term investments and accounts receivable alone nearly equal this amount. That's without inventory, property, plant and equipment. Most importantly, that's the structural position the company finds itself in prior to thinking about the brand. A brand, which routinely finds itself ranked as one of the best in the world. Sure you could buy a generic pair of sneakers or a plain t-shirt, but there's just something about that swoosh. For Nike this has resulted in a consistent premium for decades. From 2005 to 2014, $100 invested in Nike would have turned into $460 - representing an average compound gain of nearly 19% per annum. (Meanwhile the average $100 pair of sneakers may now be out of commission, thrown away or lost.) Which brings us to more recently. Towards the end of 2015, shares of Nike were trading hands at a split-adjusted price in the mid-to-high $60's. Today the number is closer to $50 per share, equating to a decline of about 25% in the last year or so. For some this is the sort of thing causes angst, especially if you purchased shares in the last year or so. However, I think it's important to be reminded of two things. One, in my view, the change in share price is partially a result of changing business expectations but mostly a consequence of valuation. You had a security that regularly trades with a valuation in the low-20's jump to over 30 times earnings. At that elevated level any small hiccup can become a large decline. It's sort of like how small issues can turn into large ones in space. The higher the valuation, the more \"perfect\" the results and expectations have to be, the wiggle room loses its wiggle. The second thing to note is a short-term price decline may not be the worst news for a long-term investor. Indeed, as a long-term investor you're apt to be a long-term net buyer either through new capital, reinvestment or on your behalf with share repurchases. As such, it's lower rather than higher prices in the short to intermediate-term that will provide the ultimate benefit. This much lower price makes the \"investment bar\" a bit lower than it was. If shares were still trading at 30 times earnings, I wouldn't be writing this article. The closer look is a result of an unreasonable valuation turning into a more reasonable one. Let's work through an example to see what this could mean for today's investor or prospective investor. Last fiscal year Nike reported earnings-per-share of $2.16 . For those looking for some historical context, over the past decade this number has grown by an average rate about 12.6% per annum. It depends on where you look, but the expectation for future intermediate-term growth is anywhere between 12% and 15%+. Given the company's past record as a smaller firm, and keeping some caution in mind, let's use 9% annual growth. At that rate yesterday's $2.16 in earnings would turn into $3.30 or so in per share earnings in the next five years. The dividend payout ratio has been climbing over the last decade, but this cash component still makes up less than a third of total earnings. If the dividend were to grow inline with earnings (leaving ample room for a good deal of share repurchases) you might anticipate collecting $4.20 or so in cash payments during the next five years. We have just one metric left to conjure up before calling it a \"back of the envelope\" base case scenario: the ending earnings multiple. Naturally this is unknown, but the idea is to come up with a reasonable, perhaps cautious assumption. Over the past two decades the average multiple has been about 22. The same goes for the last 10 years. During the last five years the number has been closer to 25 times earnings, although this was skewed by a few near or above 30 P/E years of the recent past. We've seen a range anywhere from 11 times earnings in the depths of the recession up to 33 times in the last couple of years. With those numbers in mind something around 20 times earnings appears to be a reasonable starting point. This isn't going to be perfect - and indeed you should come up with a wide range of scenarios to prepare your psychological side. But the point is to have some sort of baseline. At 20 times earnings and 9% growth, you'd be looking at the potential for a future price of about $66 - interestingly right about where shares were this time last year. When you add in the dividend you come to a total value, prior to thinking about reinvestment of ~$70. This equates to an average compound gain of about 7% per annum. Now this isn't a spectacular return, but it nonetheless is solid. You can do worse than compounding your wealth at 7% per year. The point of the exercise is to demonstrate that the security could be worth a further look, even if an initial screen didn't immediately recognize the business. Whether or not shares are ultimately compelling to you depends on your personal anticipations. In the above example, I tried to bake in a touch of prudence: slower growth than what is expected, a slightly lower multiple than what has been average and perhaps understated dividend growth potential. And yet shares could still provide reasonable gains under this scenario. If you believe the business and/or security could perform better -- say 12% growth and 22 times earnings -- suddenly you're looking at the prospect for 12% annual gains. Or if you believe the above assumptions is too lofty, 6% growth and an ending multiple of 18 times earnings results in 2.5% yearly gains. Nike needs to grow to justify its valuation, no doubt about that. However, the degree to which it must grow and still provide a reasonable return is now a good bit lower than it was at this time last year.

      "text": "Nike just teamed up with Bandier to deliver us the most delicious rose gold sneakers Before you cast your Christmas wishes for those sparkly gold layering necklaces you’ve scouted out on Etsy all year long, consider changing your plan. Not from gold to …something else, that’d be insane. But from rose gold metals to a fresh-to-death rose gold sneaker . YES, WE KNOW! How dare Nike and Bandier release these beauties when our holiday desires have already been documented and distributed?! Nonetheless, Nike’s limited-edition rose gold sneakers , exclusively available at Nike.com or in person at Bandier, aka the one-stop shop for everything that’s dope , are making us rethink everything and anything else we asked for. Just one pair of these beauties, please? And then maybe a back up? A pair for just the gym? Come on, we’ve been so good this year. \nstore.nike.com “Rose Gold is a color that represents a woman’s strength and femininity ,” cited Bandier’s founder and our best friend at the moment, Jenn Bandier. “When you put on sneakers or apparel from Nike’s Rose Gold collection, you feel like Superwoman — it’s empowering!” \nAnd speaking of good, we didn’t know Santa himself was behind the counter at Bandier this season. Get this: when (not if, when ) you pick out a pair of rose gold sneaks for yourself somebody at Bandier, “you’ll get a complimentary rose-flavored Balm Dotcom from Glossier and a matching rose-gold Nike notebook.” That’s a free stocking stuffer duo that’s just thrown in for the hell of it because Bandier’s got our back (they’re also in the middle of their first ever online warehouse sale right now , where everything is up to 70% off. …GO!). Just imagine the selfies, the pairing of your warm, pink metallic shoes to your rose gold iPhone, the athleisurely ease of never needing another pair of sneakers again. Remember, it’s all in the name of empowerment! \nCannot get enough of this #RoseGold collection by #Nike :: Reminder: our girl @kirstygodso teaching at 5:30pm tonight & stop by and shop the collection to receive your *free* @glossier rose balm dotcom! ✨ \nA photo posted by BΛNDIER (@bandier) on Nov 15, 2016 at 12:12pm PST \nTo restate: we were good, but were we this good? Shh. Sure we were. \nThe post Nike just teamed up with Bandier to deliver us the most delicious rose gold sneakers appeared first on HelloGiggles .",
