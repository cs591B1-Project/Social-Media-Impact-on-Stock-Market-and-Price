      "text": "Will Boeing and Airbus Suffer as European Airlines Cut Capital Spending? newsfeedback@fool.com (Adam Levine-Weinberg) 0 \nLast week, two of the largest European airline companies -- British Airways parent International Airlines Group (IAG) and Deutsche Lufthansa (NASDAQOTH: DLAKY) -- announced plans to reduce their aircraft spending. Under pressure due to high labor costs, the strong dollar, and vicious competition from budget carriers, both companies want to save money by keeping older planes in service while bringing in some used aircraft. \nObviously, this isn't good news for Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) . Both aircraft manufacturers certainly preferred the order frenzy of a few years ago. Nevertheless, these moves by airlines to reduce capital spending aren't quite as disastrous for Boeing and Airbus as they may appear to be on the surface. Order deferrals by Lufthansa and IAG won't hurt Boeing and Airbus too much. Image source: Boeing. What the airlines are doing \nLast Wednesday, in conjunction with Lufthansa's Q3 earnings report, CEO Carsten Spohr stated that the company was looking to buy more used aircraft in the coming years. This would allow it to reduce its capital expenditures after 2017. \nSpohr explained that the combination of low fuel prices, new programs to extend the useful lives of existing aircraft, and good availability on the used aircraft market makes it a great time to pivot away from buying new aircraft. He said that Lufthansa was particularly interested in buying used aircraft for short-haul routes. \nMeanwhile, at an investor meeting on Friday, IAG announced plans to reduce capital spending over the next five years by 1 billion euros. It will do so by extending the lives of the British Airways Boeing 747 and Boeing 777 fleets, squeezing in 52 more seats on some 777s that will be used for leisure routes from Gatwick Airport and buying more used aircraft -- for both short-haul and long-haul routes. Narrowbody backlogs are huge \nEfforts by Lufthansa and IAG to reduce spending on narrowbody aircraft won't hurt Boeing at all -- both companies use Airbus A320-family planes for short-haul routes. \nHowever, Airbus doesn't have much to worry about, either. It has a backlog of roughly 5,500 firm orders for A320-family aircraft. That represents more than 10 years of output at today's production rate. Airbus plans to increase A320-family output over the next few years, but even at the peak production rate of 60 per month, it would take eight years to build that many planes. Airbus has a massive order backlog for the A320neo family. Image source: Airbus. \nThus, if a few dozen orders are deferred, it won't impact Airbus' production plans. If anything, it could be helpful by opening up scarce A320neo slots over the next several years. \nFurthermore, the austerity moves at Lufthansa and IAG are largely a response to expansion by European budget carriers like Ryanair , EasyJet, and Norwegian Air Shuttle. Boeing and Airbus are happy to sell lots of new 737s and A320s to those up-and-coming carriers, even if it means selling fewer to established airlines. Widebodies will be replaced eventually \nIn the widebody market, order backlogs tend to be shorter. Thus, deferrals are more likely to negatively impact production. \nHowever, Lufthansa is making most of its adjustments on the narrowbody side of its fleet. With a large number of aging four-engine A340s and 747s in its fleet, Lufthansa probably wants to take delivery of the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777X aircraft it has ordered to replace them. Lufthansa still wants to retire its aging 747-400s relatively soon. Image source: The Motley Fool. \nIAG subsidiary British Airways seems more interested in keeping older widebodies in service and buying used widebodies. As a result, it is reviewing its orders for Boeing 787s and A350s between now and 2020. Fortunately, those models have longer backlogs than the A330 and 777 families, which haven't been selling as well recently. Boeing is nearly sold out on the 787 until 2020, while Airbus' A350 backlog stretches even longer. 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes \nAdditionally, while British Airways is extending the lives of its 747 and 777 fleets, those planes will need to be replaced eventually. All of its 747s were built in 1999 and earlier, which means the last ones will probably leave its fleet around 2025. Meanwhile, most of British Airways' 777s were built between 1995 and 2001 and will become ripe for retirement in the mid-2020s. \nThus, while British Airways might defer some 787 or A350 orders by a few years, over the next decade it will need more widebodies than what it has already ordered. Even if it goes with used aircraft, that's not the end of the world for Airbus and Boeing. By taking up used planes from Middle Eastern and Asian carriers, British Airways would help make room for new widebodies in those airlines' fleets. Order backlogs are a big insurance policy \nWhen the last big aircraft order cycle peaked in 1999, the order backlogs at Boeing and Airbus were a fraction of their current size. That made both companies vulnerable to a temporary downturn in demand. Even today, aircraft types with shorter backlogs like the 747, current-generation 777, A380, and A330 have proven vulnerable to demand fluctuations. \nBy contrast, order backlogs for the 737, 787, A320, and A350 aircraft families are quite long. This serves as an insurance policy against short-term demand fluctuations for Boeing and Airbus. \nThe shifting fleet plans at British Airways and Lufthansa will mainly impact orders for the A320 and to a lesser extent the 787 and A350. Both manufacturers are well positioned to absorb some order deferrals over the next few years while waiting for a new replacement cycle to take hold in the mid-2020s. \nA secret billion-dollar stock opportunity \nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

      "text": "Will Huge Pension Liabilities Lead to Forced Landing for Boeing? PART 2 OF 6 What Are the Different Types of Pension Plans? By Ally Schmidt | Nov 8, 2016 12:29 pm EST Defined benefit plan \nIn a DB (defined benefit) plan, the employer guarantees payment to the employee of a defined amount upon retirement. To provide that amount, the employer needs to make certain assumptions and hope the plan performs according to these assumptions or—better yet—outperforms. \nIf the DB plan doesn’t perform according to the assumptions, it’s too bad for the company. Since the company assumes the investment risk, it will have to find a way to bridge any gap, as has been the case with Boeing ( BA ), Lockheed Martin ( LMT ), Raytheon ( RTN ), General Electric ( GE ), and many other large US companies. Defined contribution plan \nIn a DC (defined contribution), the money that will go into the retirement fund is decided today and no assumptions are to be made. The investment risk is borne by the employee, who can choose to invest in stocks, mutual funds, or money market instruments. \nThe risk to the company is thus significantly lower in a DC plan than it is in a DB plan. The amount available upon retirement will depend on how much money is contributed by the employer (depending on plan description), how much money is saved by the employee, where, and for how long the money has been invested. The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution \nAs DB pension plans have substantially higher risks for companies, after 2008, many companies froze their DB pension plans and shifted to DC pension plans. According to a Willis Towers Watson analysis, among Fortune 500 companies, the number of firms now offering a traditional DB plan to new hires has fallen from 50% in 1998 to only 5% in 2015. The number of companies offering a traditional or hybrid DB plan has fallen to 20%. \nBoeing ( BA ) still offers a DB pension plan to some of its employees. Notably, Boeing makes up ~5.4% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF ( DIA ). \nNow let’s take a look at the assumptions Boeing has made in its DB plans in order to arrive at its $17.9 billion pension obligation in 2015. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"BA\",\"LMT\",\"GE\",\"RTN\",\"DIA\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"The Boeing Company\",\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\",\"General Electric Company\",\"Raytheon Company\",\"SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF\"]} X",

      "text": "SHOW LESS System noise assessments of a state-of-the-art reference aircraft (similar to a Boeing 777-200ER with GE90-like turbofan engines) and several hybrid wing body (HWB) aircraft configurations were recently performed using NASA engine and aircraft system analysis tools. The HWB aircraft were sized to an equivalent mission as the reference aircraft and assessments were performed using measurements of airframe shielding from a series of propulsion airframe aeroacoustic experiments. The focus of this work is to auralize flyover noise from the reference aircraft and the best HWB configuration using source noise predictions and shielding data based largely on the earlier assessments. For each aircraft, three flyover conditions are auralized. These correspond to approach, sideline, and cutback operating states, but flown in straight and level flight trajectories. The auralizations are performed using synthesis and simulation tools developed at NASA. Audio and visual presentations are provided to allow the reader to experience the flyover from the perspective of a listener in the simulated environment.",

      "text": "It begins with a roaring sound not dissimilar from a freight train or a Boeing 747 in takeoff.\nThen, a wall of water, with an unimaginable force that can flatten an entire building in seconds.\nIf you survive the initial blow, you now face an unrelenting pounding of wave after wave, and like a pinball machine, you are being battered by debris, uprooted trees and cars that share the same violent trajectory as you.\nThose who have lived through a tsunami describe an almost unsurvivable scenario.\n“The first wave just looked like a wall of white coming toward you, and the sound … it was just screams everywhere and just the crashing sound. .. the water just kept coming and coming,” one tsunami survivor told CNN.\nSo how do people survive one of Mother Nature’s most deadly forces?\nGet to higher ground \nTsunamis are giant waves triggered by anything that disrupts the ocean, including earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea, so the first sign may be a rumbling Earth, or a rapid rise or fall in ocean waters.\nDon’t wait for a warning. Run.\nFor people in low-lying, coastal areas, a tsunami could arrive just minutes after an earthquake, far too quickly for official warnings to be disseminated.\n“Similar to storm surge in a hurricane, if you are on the beach when a tsunami comes ashore, you would not survive it,” said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller.\n“The force of the water, as well as all the turbulence and currents within, would be too strong. A 6-10 foot tsunami, while it doesn’t sound huge, would be extremely damaging, and can run ashore great distances, depending on the elevation of the coastline,” Miller said.\nToo late to run. Now what? \nSometimes it may be impossible to avoid a tsunami.\nIf you are trapped or unable to evacuate to higher ground, your next step is to find a sturdy vertical refuge.\nThis is not ideal as the structure itself could collapse, but if it is your only course of action, head to the highest possible point.\nIn areas with a heightened threat of tsunami, you may see buildings or escape routes marked with the international symbol for tsunami, follow these.\nIf you are swept up in a turbulent current, your best course of action is to cling to something that floats, such as a door or a tree trunk.\n“I was saved by holding onto the roof, but my wife was swept away,” said one man who survived the deadly 2011 tsunami in Japan.\nStay vigilant \nDo not return to coastal areas until the tsunami threat is declared over by authorities.\nPay close attention to your local alert system — radio announcements, official websites, social media accounts and emergency cellphone alerts — and heed the advice.\nTsunamis can last for hours, so use common sense.\nDuring the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the most devastating on record, many people were killed when they returned to the beach to watch the retreating ocean exposing the seafloor.\nA rapidly receding ocean is a phenomenon that usually precedes a killer wave, according to NOAA.\nThe aftermath \nCheck yourself and others for injuries. Give first aid to people who are injured or trapped as you may now be in an area temporarily inaccessible to emergency assistance.\nDo not re-enter buildings until they have been cleared for structural integrity. Tsunami waters, like floodwaters, can undermine a building’s foundations and cause floors to crack or walls to collapse.\nBodies, destroyed sewer lines, contaminated freshwater supplies and downed power lines create the biggest health risks long after the tsunami waters recede.\nIt is always a good idea to be equipped for any disaster with an evacuation plan for you and your family and an emergency preparedness kit.\nClick here for more information on what to do in the event of a tsunami.

      "text": "SHOW LESS Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA have worked together to complete a parametric sizing study for NASA's Large Civil Tilt Rotor (LCTR2) concept 2nd iteration. Vehicle gross weight and fuel usage were evaluated as propulsion and drive system characteristics were varied to maximize the benefit of reduced rotor tip speed during cruise conditions. The study examined different combinations of engine and gearbox variability to achieve rotor cruise tip speed reductions down to 54% of the hover tip speed. Previous NASA studies identified that a 54% rotor speed reduction in cruise minimizes vehicle gross weight and fuel burn. The LCTR2 was the study baseline for initial sizing. This study included rotor tip speed ratios (cruise to hover) of 100%, 77% and 54% at different combinations of engine RPM and gearbox speed reductions, which were analyzed to achieve the lightest overall vehicle gross weight (GW) at the chosen rotor tip speed ratio. Different engine and gearbox technology levels are applied ranging from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) engines and gearbox technology to entry-in-service (EIS) dates of 2025 and 2035 to assess the benefits of advanced technology on vehicle gross weight and fuel burn. Interim results were previously reported1. This technical paper extends that work and summarizes the final study results including additional engine and drive system study accomplishments. New vehicle sizing data is presented for engine performance at a single operating speed with a multispeed drive system. Modeling details for LCTR2 vehicle sizing and subject engine and drive sub-systems are presented as well. This study was conducted in support of NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program, Subsonic Rotary Wing Project.",

      "text": "SHOW LESS Boeing and NASA are conducting a joint study program to design a wing flap system that will provide mission-adaptive lift and drag performance for future transport aircraft having light-weight, flexible wings. This Variable Camber Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCCTEF) system offers a lighter-weight lift control system having two performance objectives: (1) an efficient high lift capability for take-off and landing, and (2) reduction in cruise drag through control of the twist shape of the flexible wing. This control system during cruise will command varying flap settings along the span of the wing in order to establish an optimum wing twist for the current gross weight and cruise flight condition, and continue to change the wing twist as the aircraft changes gross weight and cruise conditions for each mission segment. Design weight of the flap control system is being minimized through use of light-weight shape memory alloy (SMA) actuation augmented with electric actuators. The VCCTEF program is developing better lift and drag performance of flexible wing transports with the further benefits of lighter-weight actuation and less drag using the variable camber shape of the flap.",

      "title": "Most Important Boeing News In October",
      "text": "Boeing shares gained almost 9% on bullish outlook. \nBoeing 747 production will now stretch in the length of years. \nBoeing uses success of Commercial Airplanes segment to guarantee jobs of Boeing Defense workers. \nEvery month I cover the orders and deliveries for Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSY ) ( OTCPK:EADSF ). Now, there is a lot more than just orders and deliveries. Some subjects are worthy of a more elaborate analysis and some are not. Those subjects that are not, are not necessarily unimportant. Therefore, I have decided to launch a monthly article that bundles some of the most interesting news items that do not justify a separate article or deserve to be mentioned again. You can read the September report here . \nClick to enlarge \nStock price in October \nBoeing shares won 8.9% in October, and by the end of the month traded 2.2 % off their September high and are closing in on its 52-week high. The latest earnings call gave Boeing shares direction as the company raised its guidance and took away fears of possible pressure on cash flow as a second rate cut on the Boeing 777 program might be needed. I discussed the results as well as the status of the Boeing 777 program. \nThe major upswing in share prices is caused by the fact that Boeing reaffirmed its positive look on the future, updated its guidance and assured investors it will see cash flow improve further even if it cuts rates on the Boeing 777 once again. The quarter results were not the reason for Boeing's strong October month. \nCommercial Orders and Market \nOn the side of \"commercial orders and market,\" there was not a lot of news, but there were two important announcements. \nBoeing and Qatar reached an agreement for the purchase of 40 aircraft, a deal that had been expected for months. The Gulf carrier will purchase 30 Boeing 787-9 airframes at 10 Boeing 777-300ER airframes. \nIn the form of an order for 14 Boeing 747-8F aircraft, UPS (NYSE: UPS ) threw the Boeing 747 program a lifeline. The program desperately needed some order inflow to prevent the production line from being shut down. \nAtlas Air ordered the freighter conversion of 9 Boeing 767 second-hand passenger jets. The orders for the Boeing 767 and Boeing 747 comes in a month in which Boeing forecasted demand for 2,370 freighter aircraft in the coming 20 years. \nBoeing said it is in the final stages to finalize a deal with Iran Air. What an upcoming firm order is worth remains to be seen as lawmakers are exhausting their means to block US financing for the deal. President Obama will likely veto the legislation, but President-elect Donald Trump could still try to block the deal. \nNot unimportant is the deal Boeing reached with COMAC to open a Boeing 737 completion facility in the city of Zhoushan. Partly due to pricing as well as having a facility in China, Airbus has been able to acquire a significant share of the narrow body market. \nWith the upcoming opening of the facility in China, Boeing tries to win back market share, while transferring some of the jobs to China and guaranteeing even more jobs in the US. \nDefense and Space \nOn Defense side there was not much news other than Boeing opening a facility in the St. Louis area. The area is the heart of Boeing's Defense unit, but as Defense has been coping with declining revenues for the Military Aircraft unit it is hard to keep some of the production lines running on the long term. The facility will be a Commercial Airplanes facility dedicated to producing composite parts, with production starting in 2017 for parts for the Boeing 777X. \nThe opening bring should generate 700 jobs by the end of the decade, but it is likely that Boeing will place workers from the Defense units that are no longer needed to work at the newly opened facility. So it can be seen as a move to keep jobs in the area. \nConclusion \nThe main takeaways are: Higher stock prices during the October month are primarily caused by Boeing's reassurance that it will be able to grow cash flow even when it cuts rate on the Boeing 777 program. There seems to be an uptick in investing activity from cargo carriers, which is beneficial to Boeing as a market leader for freighter aircraft . Boeing is using strength of Commercial Airplanes unit to guarantee jobs in an area that thus far had been focused on Defense. \nIf you would like to receive updates for my upcoming articles, please click the \"Follow\" text at the top of this page next to my profile.

By: FE Online | Updated: November 14, 2016 6:19 PM During his campaign for presidential elections, Donald Trump had continuously lashed out at China saying that Beijing will be punished with ‘defensive’ 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and officially declared a currency manipulator.(Reuters) \nChina’s state-run newspaper has said that if ‘naive fool’ Donald Trump launches an all-out trade war against China, it would reply with counter-measures. During his campaign for presidential elections, Trump had continuously lashed out at China saying that Beijing will be punished with ‘defensive’ 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and officially declared a currency manipulator. President-elect Trump had then said,”When they see that they will stop the cheating. He accused China of doing ‘the greatest theft in the history of the world.’ An editorial came in a state-run newspaper right after Trump spoke to Chinese president Xi Jinping. \nGlobal Times, a State-run newspaper warned the US that it would be a grave mistake to take such measures. It said that such a move by a ‘shrewd businessman’, to change tariffs will be replied with a tit-for-tat approach. The newspaper wrote, “If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired. Finally, the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence. The paper added, “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. Making things difficult for China politically will do him no good.” \nThe newspaper wrote, “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.” \nAlso read | Why Modi’s India & Xi’s China have best growth stories and will be the driver of world economy \nMeanwhile, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang had reportedly said, “I believe that any US politician if he takes the interests of his own people first, will adopt a policy that is conducive to the economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

      "text": "2016 November 14, 2016 \nUS president-elect Donald Trump spent a lot of time China bashing on the campaign trail, labeling China a currency manipulator , accusing it of stealing jobs from the US, and threatening high tariffs on Chinese goods. \nBut during his first interaction with Chinese president Xi Jinping since the election, he was nothing but nice, Chinese state media reports. “China is a great and important country, and China’s development is remarkable to the world,” Trump was quoted as saying by Chinese state media CCTV (link in Chinese) in a phone call with Xi on Sunday (Nov. 14) night. \nHe also picked up on one of Beiijing’s key catchphrases, “win win,” state media reported. “The US and China can achieve mutual benefits and win-win results. I would love to work with you to enhance the cooperation between US and China. I believe the US-China relations will achieve better development,” Trump was cited as saying. \nXi called Trump to congratulate on his victory and said there are many areas where the two countries could cooperate. “The facts prove that cooperation is the only correct choice for China and the US,” CCTV quoted Xi as saying. Trump’s presidential transition office also confirmed the call on Nov. 14, saying the two leaders have “established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another.” \nState-backed Chinese tabloid Global Times, though, took a much harder line , calling Trump’s earlier stance on China “unprofessional” and threatening retaliation if he started a trade war in an editorial. If Trump puts high tariffs on Chinese goods, it said: \nA batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. \nThe US’s top agricultural export to China in 2015 was soybeans, Chinese companies bought $102 billion in planes in 2015, and China is a key market for Apple’s iPhone sales . \nThe paper doesn’t reflect the official point of view of China’s government, but it does often reflect what government officials are actually thinking, editor Hu Xijin told Quartz earlier . In this case, then, they’re not thinking great things about Trump. If he “wrecks” China-US trade, he “will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences,” it says. \nBut they may share a similarly dark view of the US press—the editorial concludes “We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president.” Read full story ",

      "text": "When a company announces to the world that it will begin offering air tours on a Boeing 777 that will be more luxuriously appointed than most private jets, it almost goes without saying that the itineraries for such tours should be equally, if not more, awe inspiring than the lavish plane.\nThe company in question in this case is Crystal. And it has done just that with the recent, much anticipated release of the global itineraries for its soon to launch Crystal AirCruises .\nThe journeys aboard Crystal's new private Boeing 777, which is currently being customized to meet the company's standards, will range from 15 to 29 days and include visits to some of the world's most coveted, exotic and remote destinations such as Easter Island, Polynesia; Lhasa, Tibet; Mauritius, East Africa; Siem Reap, Cambodia and Gan Island, Maldives, to name a few.\n\nAirCruise travelers will spend an average of two to three nights in each destination, rather than quickly being herded from one place to the next.\nAnd while in each location, travelers will bunk in the finest hotels, resorts, safari-lodges and eco-villages available, according to Crystal, (although the names of the specific properties have yet to be released).\nPerhaps most interestingly, each AirCruise itinerary can be endlessly customized to include curated activities each day focused on the individual traveler's interests and tastes - whether that be a culinary theme, history focus, adrenaline based activities or even more exotic requests.\n\"Within each itinerary there's about 100 options,\" Crystal CEO and President Edie Rodriguez explained during a recent telephone interview. \"You don't have to be with the group of 84 travelers. Readers should not think, 'I'm going to be in a herd with all of these other people.' Not at all. This is intimate and exclusive.\"",

      "text": "SHOW LESS This paper presents high fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations of the Boeing Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research truss-braced wing wind-tunnel model and compares the results to linear MSC. Nastran flutter analysis and preliminary data from a recent wind-tunnel test of that model at the NASA Langley Research Center Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. The simulated conditions under consideration are zero angle of attack, so that structural nonlinearity can be neglected. It is found that, for Mach number greater than 0.78, the linear flutter analysis predicts flutter onset dynamic pressure below the wind-tunnel test and that predicted by the Navier-Stokes analysis. Furthermore, the wind-tunnel test revealed that the majority of the high structural dynamics cases were wing limit cycle oscillation (LCO) rather than flutter. Most Navier-Stokes simulated cases were also LCO rather than hard flutter. There is dip in the wind-tunnel test flutter/LCO onset in the Mach 0.76-0.80 range. Conditions tested above that Mach number exhibited no aeroelastic instability at the dynamic pressures reached in the tunnel. The linear flutter analyses do not show a flutter/LCO dip. The Navier-Stokes simulations also do not reveal a dip; however, the flutter/LCO onset is at a significantly higher dynamic pressure at Mach 0.90 than at lower Mach numbers. The Navier-Stokes simulations indicate a mild LCO onset at Mach 0.82, then a more rapidly growing instability at Mach 0.86 and 0.90. Finally, the modeling issues and their solution related to the use of a beam and pod finite element model to generate the Navier-Stokes structure mode shapes are discussed.",

M2 Browning machine guns in remote controlled turrets 20,000 lbs. of bombs (standard load) \nDesign: \nOne of the most advanced bombers of World War II , design of the Boeing B-29 began in the late 1930s. In 1939, the initial design was presented to the Army Air Corps who, while impressed, requested an increase in defensive armament and the addition of self-sealing fuel tanks. These changes were incorporated and three initial prototypes were requested in 1940. The following year, the Army Air Corps examined a mock-up of the aircraft and were sufficiently impressed that they ordered 264 B-29s before ever seeing the aircraft fly. The aircraft first flew on September 21, 1942, and testing continued through next year. \nAmong the features incorporated into the B-29 were a fully pressurized cabin and remote-controlled machine gun turrets. Designed as a high-altitude daytime bomber, the aircraft was capable of reaching 40,000 ft., allowing it to fly higher than most Axis fighters. Dubbed the \"Superfortress\" as a nod to its predecessor the B-17 Flying Fortress , the B-29 was beset with problems throughout its development. The most common of these involved issues with the aircraft's Wright R-3350 engines which had a habit of overheating and causing fires. A variety of solutions were ultimately designed to counter this problem. \nProduction: \nA highly sophisticated aircraft, problems persisted even after the B-29 entered production. Built at Boeing plants in Renton, WA and Wichita, KS, contracts were also given Bell and Martin who built the aircraft at plants in Marietta, GA and Omaha, NE respectively. Changes to the design occurred so frequently in 1944, that special modification plants were built to alter the aircraft as they came off the assembly line. Many of the problems were the result of rushing the aircraft in order to get it into combat as quickly as possible. \nOperational History: \nThe first B-29s arrived at Allied airfields in India and China in April 1944. Originally, the XX Bomber Command was to operate two wings of B-29s from China, however this number was reduced to one due to a lack of aircraft. Flying from India, B-29s first saw combat on June 5, 1944, when 98 planes struck Bangkok. A month later, B-29s flying from Chengdu, China struck Yawata, Japan in the first raid on the Japanese home islands since the Doolittle Raid in 1942. While the aircraft were able to attack Japan, operating the bases in China proved costly as all supplies needed to be flown in over the Himalayas. \nThe problems of operating from China were averted in the fall of 1944, following the US capture of the Marianas Islands. Soon five major airfields were constructed on Saipan , Tinian, and Guam to support B-29 raids on Japan. Flying from the Marianas, B-29s struck every major city in Japan with increasing frequency. In addition to destroying industrial targets and firebombing, B-29s mined harbors and sea lanes damaging Japan's ability to resupply its troops. Though meant to be a daytime, high-altitude precision bomber, the B-29 frequently flew at night on carpet-bombing incendiary raids. \nIn August 1945, the B-29 flew its two most famous missions. Departing Tinian on August 6, the B-29 Enola Gay , Colonel Paul W. Tibbets commanding, dropped the first atomic bom on Hiroshima. Three days later the B-29 Bockscar dropped the second bomb on Nagasaki. Following the war, the B-29 was retained by the US Air Force and later saw combat during the Korean War . Flying primarily at night to avoid Communist jets, the B-29 was used in an interdictive role. \nEvolution: \nFollowing World War II, the USAF embarked on a modernization program to enhance the B-29 and correct many of the problems that had plagued the aircraft. The \"improved\" B-29 was designated the B-50 and entered service in 1947. That same year, a Soviet version of the aircraft, the Tu-4, began production. Based on reverse-engineered American aircraft downed during the war, it stayed in use until the 1960s. In 1955, the B-29/50 was withdrawn from service as an atomic bomber. It continued in use until the mid-1960s as an experimental test bed aircraft as well as an aerial tanker. All told, 3,900 B-29s were built. \nSources:",

      "text": "SHOW LESS The Boeing HS-376 spin stabilized spacecraft was a popular design that was launched continuously into geosynchronous orbit starting in 1980 with the last launch occurring in 2002. Over 50 of the HS-376 buses were produced to fulfill a variety of different communication missions for countries all over the world. The design of the bus is easily approximated as a telescoping cylinder that is covered with solar cells and an Earth facing antenna that is despun at the top of the cylinder. The similarity in design and the number of spacecraft launched over a long period of time make the HS-376 a prime target for studying the effects of solar weathering on solar panels as a function of time. A selection of primarily non-operational HS-376 spacecraft launched over a 20 year time period were observed using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope on Mauna Kea and multi-band near-infrared photometry produced. Each spacecraft was observed for an entire night cycling through ZYJHK filters and time-varying colors produced to compare near-infrared color as a function of launch date. The resulting analysis shown here may help in the future to set launch date constraints on the parent object of unidentified debris objects or other unknown spacecraft.",

      "text": "Is Boeing's Cash Flow Growth In Danger? Nov.18.16 \nUnited Airlines brings Boeing 737 deferrals to 200+ for the year. \nBoeing's cash flow growth is not in danger. \nRate increases are required to rebalance the backlog. An important metric for Boeing (NYSE: BA ) investors is cash flow. Since product development in the aerospace industry is a cash intensive process, the free and operating cash flow are heavily eyeballed by investors and analysts. The [free] cash flow shows how much cash is going in and how much is going out and that basically is a key metric to determine the current health of any company. Also during times in which a company is seeing increased capital expenditures that should pay off in the future, the operating cash flow is a more useful metric to investors. Next to telling something about a company's ability to generate cash, the free cash flow also says something about the company's ability to repurchase stocks or hike dividends. Click to enlarge Growing cash When Boeing developed the Boeing 787 and had to deal with the grounding of the airplane the jet maker kept pointing at its strong cash flow statement as it deemed that metric more informative to investors. Whether Boeing will be able to recoup the deferred balance it built for the Boeing 787 program remains to be seen. Investors, however, are currently looking for cash flow growth. For Boeing to make cash flow grow it can either cut costs for day-to-day operations, which it currently is trying to do by cutting jobs where possible, or by increasing the cash inflow. Increasing cash inflow can be done by price hikes or by increasing the delivery volume. Another measure that can temporarily increase cash inflow is the timing of progress and milestone payments from customers. Increasing sales prices will do no good to Boeing's competitive position on the aircraft market, leaving production increases as the only suitable way to grow cash flow. Growing production Since 2010 Boeing has increased output of its Commercial Airplanes unit from 462 aircraft in 2010 to 762 aircraft in 2015. At the same time the company grew its operating cash flow from $2.95B to $9.4B and its free cash flow. The company's annual dividend increased from $1.38 per share in 2010 to $4.36 for 2016. This shows how important cash flow growth is to investors. For most the year, aircraft sales have been under pressure and this has raised concerns among investors and analysts whether Boeing's plans to raise production beyond 900 units by decade end is realistic and sustainable This concern grew as United Airlines (NYSE: UAL ) deferred and converted its order for 61 Boeing 737-700 aircraft. The deferral itself is no cause for concern, but given Southwest's (NYSE: LUV ) deferral of 67 aircraft and the news that Turkish Airlines deferred delivery of 75 Boeing 737 aircraft there is some fear that this might be the start of a deferrals. The reason for deferring deliveries is cash preservation and increasing yield. Deferring deliveries means that no progress or milestone payments are being made and airlines will take delivery of the airframe at a later point. As capacity has grown excessively compared to demand a significant pressure has developed on load factors and fares, airlines are seeking to defer deliveries. Additionally, airlines defer deliveries or delay orders to buy second hand aircraft, which carry lower acquisition costs than a brand-new aircraft, or to pressure their crews in negotiations. Currently Boeing's ability to increase cash flow hinges on the Boeing 737 program. On the Boeing 767 and Boeing 747 programs, production rates are nicely aligned with demand. On the Boeing 787 program, increasing production to 14 aircraft per month is risky as the aircraft fares well in an environment with high oil prices. Staying at 12 per month for now seems to be safest. On the Boeing 777 program, a production cut is more likely than an increase and by 2018 the production is already set to drop to 66 aircraft per month. So Boeing's ability to increase cash flow stands or falls with its ability to increase production for its narrow body product. It is also that product that has been seeing some deferrals this year. Given that Boeing will increase annual Boeing 737 output to 564 units next year and increase production to 684 units in 2019, the deferrals in 2016 might seem rather big. In total 3 airlines deferred 203 deliveries or over a third of planned production in 2017. It is also the comparison between deferral and annual production that might spark some fear among investors; Some nuance needs to be added here. None of these airlines were planning to take delivery of their order in a single year. Most of the times deliveries stretch out several years. So the 203 deferred deliveries amount to 30-70 aircraft per year, depending on the specific delivery schedule. This makes the 'production holes' somewhat smaller. Additionally, it is important to look at the backlog. Boeing's rate increases are geared towards growing cash, but doing this in a manageable way. At the earnings call in October, Boeing said it had a backlog of over 5,600 aircraft. Historically annual deferrals and cancellations have been around 5%-6%. For Boeing this means that the historical deferral and cancellation trend suggests up to 340 cancellations. In 2016 Boeing received 88 cancellations and 203 deferrals. Adding the cancellations to the backlog of 5,635 aircraft and then taking that number to calculate the deferral and production rate, we get to a cancellation rate of 5%. This is in line with 5%-6% historical trend. Sustainability Judging from the historical deferral rate I am not seeing anything out of the ordinary. Additionally, there are 2 things to consider. The first thing being the fact that for the Boeing 737 there is a high probability that other customers will be happy to fill up freed up delivery slots. So there is no immediate reason to worry about deferrals. The second thing is that Boeing has been oversold on its narrow body program most of the years. If we look at the maximum planned output for the Boeing 737 of 684 jets per year and the 5,635 backlog a quick calculation shows that backlog stretches out over 8 years. Without order inflow and 10% of the backlog being canceled each year Boeing will run out of backlog in 5-6 years. So Boeing will not run out of backlog any time soon. It does need to be noted that a sustainable production rate does not mean keeping backlog constant per se. Currently Boeing and Airbus have backlogs that stretch out many years, which also makes it unattractive for airlines to commit to a product that will be delivered years from now. By increasing production rate the backlog can be reduced from the current 8 years to 3-5 years. Conclusion Even with production rate increases and keeping into account forecasted demand, Boeing's backlog is not expected to fall to alarmingly low levels. Boeing's backlog has functioned as a soft cushion, but also shows how oversold the jet maker is on the program and does make it harder to sell its product to airlines. I do not think that cash flow growth is in danger. The contribution of the Boeing 787 to cash flow will grow in the coming years as well. So cash flow growth will be driven by improvements in the Boeing 787 program and higher rates on the Boeing 737 program. I do think that the timing of the increase to 57 units per month is optimistic, because there are some short-term concerns regarding yield but also on macro level there are some key economies seeing slowing growth figures. On the longer term, despite Boeing's cyclic Commercial Airplanes department, I still do think Boeing could increase rates to 63 aircraft per month, which is the factory limit in Renton, for either the Boeing 737 or the aircraft family replacing the Boeing 737 for good.

      "text": "Rediff.com » News » India's dream fighter jet: Boeing says it can deliver India's dream fighter jet: Boeing says it can deliver November 19, 2016 12:24 IST \nBoeing plans to set up an Indian factory and the aerospace ecosystem to build the Block II Super Hornet.Ajai Shukla reports from St Louis, Missouri. \nF ollowing the lead of Swedish company Saab, Boeing has linked its offer to build a fighter aircraft in India with the promise of assistance in designing and building an Indian fifth-generation (Gen-5) fighter. \nIn a presentation to the Indian media in St Louis, Missouri, where Boeing builds the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter, Boeing's Dan Gillian outlined a detailed road map from the Super Hornet to India's Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft, the Gen-5 fighter that the Defence Research and Development Organisation hopes to build. \nBoeing's plan involves first setting up an Indian factory and the aerospace ecosystem to build the Block II Super Hornet, which will then be improved into the 'Advanced Super Hornet.' \nThat infrastructure and design capability would give Indian designers the instruments to build the AMCA. \nBoeing's India chief Pratyush Kumar hardly disguises his scepticism of Saab's promise to help India in designing the AMCA. \n\"America is the only country that has actually designed and manufactured stealthy, Gen-5 fighters,\" points out Kumar. \n\"Stealth design is not a science. It is an art that is developed only after years of trial and error. Boeing has actually mastered that art while co-designing the F-35 joint strike fighter.\" \nB oeing is not in direct competition with Saab, which is pitching to build 100 to 200 single-engine fighters in India. \nInstead, Boeing will compete with European manufacturers, Dassault, and Eurofighter, to establish a factory that will churn out a similar number of twin-engine fighters. \nThe Indian Air Force has already solicited interest from global aerospace vendors in the single-engine category, and a similar request is expected soon for building twin-engine fighters. \nKumar claims the F/A-18E/F, which was designed in the 1990s, is a decade more contemporary than its rivals like the Rafale and the Eurofighter Typhoon, which started being designed in the 1980s. \n\"The Super Hornet is sometimes confused with the older F/A-18A/B Hornet fighter, which dates back to the 1970s. While they are superficially similar, the Super Hornet's brand new design incorporates a high degree of stealth.\" \n\"For America, the Super Hornet was a stepping stone to the F-35, and it can be a stepping stone to the AMCA for India,\" argues Kumar. \nBoeing's new Super Hornet factory in St Louis is churning out two Super Hornets each month for the US Navy, which will continue inducting the fighter well into the 2020s. \nEach of America's 9-12 aircraft carriers (the final number will depend upon President Donald Trump's defence policy) will embark four squadrons of Super Hornets until 2028, when the F-35 Lightning II starts being inducted in significant numbers. \nBy 2028, each carrier will have one squadron of the F-35, and by 2035 there will be two squadrons each of the Super Hornet and the F-35. \n\"But the fighter will remain in service out to the 2040s and, until then, we will be developing upgrades every two years as part of a continuous development programme,\" says Gillian. \nThe first improvement on the cards is an advanced cockpit system in 2018-2019. \nA lso being developed, even without US Navy sanction and funding, are 'conformal fuel tanks' that will extend the fighter's 1,000-km strike range by 200 km; and a more powerful and fuel-economical F-414 engine that will increase the thrust by 18 per cent. \nGillian says the Super Hornet is highly regarded by the US Navy not just because it is a capable and easy-to-maintain fighter, but also because it is the cheapest to operate in the entire US fighter fleet, even cheaper than the single-engine F-16. \n\"The US Government Accountability Office rates the F/A-18E/F as the most economical fighter to operate on a cost per hour basis,\" says Gillian. \nThe challenge for Boeing will be to build a supplier chain in India, like the one that feeds into the Super Hornet line at St Louis. \nThis consists of 800 vendors in 44 states, which employ 60,000 people. \nBoeing's current Super Hornet vendors in India include Bharat Electronics Ltd, which builds electrical panels. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd is building wire bundles and gun bay doors. \nSmaller companies are also joining the supply chain, including Rossell and SASMOS, which supply electrical equipment. \nIMAGE: F/A-18 Super Hornets fly over the Western Pacific Ocean.

      "text": "Boeing’s E-6B Mercury aircraft, evolved from the E-6A Hermes, is flown by the U.S. Navy from Tinker AFB and replaces the EC-135 aircraft employed for Looking Glass missions. The Navy Air Systems Command web site has the following information about this powerful aircraft :\nA U.S. Navy Boeing E-6B Mercury, somewhere over the Nevada/CA border, during August 2016 moving in to refuel from a USAF KC-10 tanker aircraft—U.S. Air Force photograph/Heide Couch\nMission Communications relay and strategic airborne command post aircraft. Provides survivable, reliable, and endurable airborne command, control, and communications between the National Command Authority (NCA) and U.S. strategic and non-strategic forces. Two squadrons, the “Ironmen” of VQ-3 and the “Shadows” of VQ-4 deploy more than 20 aircrews from Tinker Air Force Base OK to meet these requirements.\nBoeing derived the E-6A from its commercial 707 to replace the aging EC-130Q in the performance of the Navy’s TACAMO (“Take Charge and Move Out”) mission. TACAMO links the NCA with naval ballistic missile forces during times of crisis. The aircraft carries a very low frequency communication system with dual trailing wire antennas. The Navy accepted the first E-6A in August 1989.\nThe E-6B was conceived as a replacement for the Air Force’s Airborne Command Post due to the age of the EC-135 fleet. The E-6B is an improved E-6A by way of adding battlestaff positions and other specialized equipment. The E-6B is a dual-mission aircraft capable of fulfilling either the E-6A mission or the airborne strategic command post mission and is equipped with an airborne launch control system (ALCS) which can launch the U.S. land based intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well. The first E-6B aircraft was accepted in December 1997 and the E-6B assumed its dual operational mission in October 1998. The entire E-6 fleet was completely modified to the E-6B configuration in 2003.\nA U.S. Navy Boeing E-6B Mercury airborne command post aircraft provides airborne command, control, and communications as well as ALCS—U.S. Navy photo\nCharacteristics Primary Function: Communications relay for fleet ballistic missile submarines (A and B models) and airborne command post for U.S. Strategic forces (B model).\nContractor: The Boeing Company.\nDate Deployed: October 1998.\nUnit Cost: 141.7 million.\nPropulsion: Four CFM-56-2A-2 High bypass turbofans.\nLength: 150 feet, 4 inches (45.8 meters).\nHeight: 42 feet 5 inches (12.9 meters).\nWingspan: 148 feet, 4 inches (45.2 meters).\nWeight: Max gross, take-off. 342,000 lbs (154,400 kg).\nAirspeed: 522 knots, 600 miles (960 km) per hour.\nCeiling: Above 40,000 feet.\nRange: 6,600 nautical miles (7,590 statute miles, 12,144 km) with 6 hours loiter time.\nCrew: 22\nAn E-6B Mercury being moved into a hangar at the Boeing Aerospace Support Center/Cecil Field FL to be retrofitted with a new cockpit and an advanced communications package. The E-6B is a dual-mission aircraft capable of fulfilling either the E-6A mission or the airborne strategic command post mission and is equipped with an airborne launch control system (ALCS) to control the launching of U.S. land based intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as the Navy’s—U.S. Navy photo\nA Boeing E-6B Mercury taxis for another mission—U.S. Navy image",

      "text": "SEATTLE — Boeing named General Electric executive Kevin McAllister as the head of its Commercial Airplanes unit Monday as part of a corporate reorganization that will add a third pillar to its sprawling aerospace business.\nBoeing intends to elevate its airplane services arm to be a major division on the level of its two premier divisions: defense and space, and commercial airplanes.\nThe reorganization was unveiled Monday along with the announcement that chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplanes unit, Ray Conner, 61, is leaving the post, effective immediately. Boeing said Conner will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017.\nConner will be succeeded by McAllister, 53, who leaves as head of GE’s Aviation services business.\nThe new Boeing Global Services unit will be headed by company veteran Stan Deal, 52, who currently runs Boeing’s commercial aviation services business.\nThe creation of the new dedicated services division has been a longtime ambition for the aerospace giant. Boeing, best known for building jetliners, fighter jets, rockets and satellites, has sought to diversify away from the ups and downs of manufacturing and tap into the steady revenue that comes from servicing aircraft throughout their multi-decade lifetime.\n“Substantial services growth is core to Boeing’s strategy,” said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive.\nSelling services and spare parts to airlines, maintenance shops and governments is an increasingly lucrative business for the company. The company has plotted a steep expansion of its services business aiming to more than triple sales to about $50 billion by 2025, from an estimated $15 billion in 2015, according to Muilenburg.\nBoeing has less than 10% market share in the services operations at both its civil and defense aerospace businesses, providing “ample room to grow,” he said.\nMuilenburg said the new services unit would be up and running in the third quarter of 2017 and based in Dallas.\nBoeing’s push into the spare parts business threatens to further destabilize the business models of many of its own suppliers. Boeing’s own suppliers rely on selling parts at a steep markup to airlines and other buyers to offset the lowest prices that plane makers receive when building airplanes on the assembly line.\nMcAllister inherits a host of challenges at Boeing, including steep production ramp ups of its updated single-aisle 737 Max aircraft and introduction of its long-range 777X jetliner in 2020. McAllister will also helm Boeing as it weighs designing an all-new medium-range aircraft that wouldn’t be ready until around 2025.\nConner, a 39-year Boeing veteran who started as a mechanic building 727s and rose to company vice chairman, will retire at the end of 2017.\nIn a letter to employees, Conner said he would continue to “stay engaged in the ongoing product strategy work that will shape the future of our airplane family.”\nThe Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO role is as much an executive position as it is a U.S. diplomatic role, acting as a highly-visible figure representing the U.S.’s largest exporter at airlines around the globe. The appointment also further cements the relationship between Boeing and GE, which supplies most of its jet engines. Muilenburg’s predecessor, Jim McNerney, came to Boeing from GE and retired in March.\nMcAllister’s appointment as head of Boeing’s commercial business is also a break with tradition. It marks the first time the company has tapped an outsider for that top job.\n“He’s a great partner of Boeing, he knows us well,” said Muilenburg.",

REUTERS/Canadian Forces Combat Camera, DND/Handout \nOTTAWA: Canada said on Tuesday it would launch an open competition to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets and consider buying 18 Boeing Corp Super Hornets as an interim measure. \nThe fighter jet decision is among one of the most contentious facing the one-year old Liberal government. \nThe previous Conservative government said in 2010 that it would buy Lockheed Martin's F-35s, but during last year's successful election campaign the Liberals promised not to buy the planes on the grounds that they were too expensive. \nThe government said on Tuesday that, with the current fleet of CF-18 jets more than 30 years old, the country is facing a capability gap. In addition to the competition, the government will immediately explore the acquisition of the Super Hornets. \n\"As we promised, our government will be conducting an open and transparent competition to replace the long-serving CF-18 jets,\" said Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote. \nCanada is one of the nine original partner countries that helped fund development of the F-35. \n(Reporting by David Ljunggren and Leah Schnurr; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Bernard Orr) - Reuters",

Canada remains a partner in the development program of Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter jet. In 2010, it ordered 65 of the aircraft but reversed the deal a year ago because of exorbitant costs and a campaign promise by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nPending the government's call for offers and awaiting the next aircraft to update the fleet, the 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets will be deployed from 2018 as an interim solution, Sajjan said.",

Canada to reveal decision on fighter jets Tuesday Reuters Courtesy Boeing \nF/A-18E/F Super Hornets, in a photo provided by Boeing. \nOTTAWA • Canada will announce on Tuesday how it plans to replace the country's aging fleet of CF-18 fighter jets, an official said, addressing one of the most troublesome issues facing the Liberal government. \nOfficials say the contenders are Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35, Boeing Corp's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, as well as jets built by Eurofighter, Saab AB and Dassault Aviation SA. \nDefense Minister Harjit Sajjan will hold a news conference at noon Central time. \nThe previous Conservative government said in 2010 that it would buy the F-35s, but during last year's successful election campaign the Liberals promised not to buy the planes on the grounds that they were too expensive. They also vowed to hold an open competition.",

      "text": "WhatsApp \nShifting your holiday plans to be able to fly with your favourite aircraft. Photography enthusiast Dennis Janssen (21) did just that and not without reward. He flew to Sint Maarten on the Boeing 747, where he was not only lucky enough to witness the last landing, but also got to experience the last takeoff as a passenger in his precious plane. Time for a chat with this aircraft fanatic… Since when have you been enchanted by the Boeing? \nActually, it all started when I was very young. I’ve always been captivated by aircraft in general. When I was young, my parents took me to Schiphol to watch the aircraft. I loved that. Since getting my driving licence, I regularly head off to watch and take shots of aircraft myself. I still think it’s amazing how such huge, heavy objects can take off, fly through the sky, and then land safely again. And, as for the Boeing 747, well, she’s the queen of all aircraft of course. What an amazing sight to behold, with her four engines! \nPhoto: Dennis Janssen So amazing, that you were willing to shift your holiday plans to fly with ‘the Queen’. Please share… \nI’d actually planned to go to Sint Maarten in November with a friend. I’d already booked my flight with KLM, especially for the Boeing 747. So, when I heard that by then, the B747s would have already been replaced by the Airbus, I contacted KLM. I explained that I had chosen that particular flight only to fly with my favourite aircraft. Luckily, I was able to shift not only my flight but also my holiday plans, to ensure that we would fly with the B747! \nPhoto: Dennis Janssen And so you flew to Sint Maarten in your favourite plane. But the story didn’t end there… \nIt didn’t! Things got even better. Once we were there, we heard that the B747 would be making its last landing on the island on the day of our return flight – on exactly the same aircraft. We were therefore lucky enough to witness the last landing on the island and we flew back to Amsterdam on that same last flight. How amazing is that! A group of around 4,800 people gathered on the beach for the Farewell B747. Caps and T-shirts were dished out and everyone clapped and waved. Goosebumps! \nPhoto: Dennis Janssen The same aircraft flew you back to Amsterdam only an hour later. How did you manage that in time? \nIt was certainly stressful. But with keen logistics and a patient taxi driver that was waiting for us the whole time, we managed to head off to the airport directly after welcoming the B747 on the beach. We checked in right on time, but we had to move fast; so fast that I didn’t even have time to go through the shots of the landing. Before I knew it, I found myself seated in the same plane we just welcomed, on my way home again. \nPhoto: Dennis Janssen And now? \nNow I have awesome photos of the last landing of the Boeing 747 on Sint Maarten. And on top of it, I was on the last flight back. What an exceptional experience! No pictures or words can fully describe it. I think it’s a bit like the MD11 before. You’re a lucky person if you have photos of it from back then. And that’ll be the case with the B747 in time too! \nPhoto: Dennis Janssen Bianca Samethini \nI’m an Amsterdam based, The Hague raised editor and communications professional. KLM has never really been out of my mind ever since I left the company in 2010. As a freelancer I’ve written several articles for the GS-krant and Flight Safety. Mostly beautiful stories on beautiful people. Every…",

      "text": "With Donald Trump considering James Mattis as the new defense secretary, securities in the Aerospace and Defense sector scaled higher last week, buoyed by the reputation the retired U.S. Marine Corps General has in Capitol Hill. In addition to this, a generous flow of contracts from the Pentagon kept the sector on its toes.\nConsequently, major indices for the aerospace and defense sector ended in the green during the trailing five sessions. While the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index gained 0.7%, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index rose 1.8% last week.\nAmong last week’s highlights, Pentagon’s largest defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT - Free Report ) stole the limelight with a handful of big wins. Defense majors like The Boeing Company ( BA - Free Report ) , Textron Inc. ( TXT - Free Report ) , Harris Corporation ( HRS - Free Report ) , General Dynamics Corp . ( GD - Free Report ) and United Technologies Corporation ( UTX - Free Report ) also clinched a number of important contracts from the Pentagon.\n(Read Defense Stock Roundup for Nov 17, 2016 here .)\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories\n1. Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics business division secured a huge modification contract worth $7.19 billion for the F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The original advance acquisition contract involved low-rate initial production of the Lot 10 F-35 Lightening II jets. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Mar 2020.\nPer the terms of the contract, Lockheed Martin will procure 90 jets, comprised 76 F-35As for the U.S. Air Force, non-U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) participants and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers; 12 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps and non-U.S. DoD participants; and two F-35Cs for the Navy.

CV-22 and MV-22 are two variants of the V-22 jets. With rapid rise in terror attacks in recent times, Pentagon has been allocating substantial funds to the defense contractors for enhanced security of the country. With no improvement expected in the geopolitical situation at present, defense majors like Boeing and Textron, to name a few, are poised to gain substantially.

      "title": "Defense Stock Roundup: Lockheed Martin Scores Big; Boeing, Textron, General Dynamics Make a Mark",
      "text": "Trades from $ 3 With Donald Trump considering James Mattis as the new defense secretary, securities in the Aerospace and Defense sector scaled higher last week, buoyed by the reputation the retired U.S. Marine Corps General has in Capitol Hill. In addition to this, a generous flow of contracts from the Pentagon kept the sector on its toes. Consequently, major indices for the aerospace and defense sector ended in the green during the trailing five sessions. While the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index gained 0.7%, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index rose 1.8% last week. Among last week’s highlights, Pentagon’s largest defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT - Free Report ) stole the limelight with a handful of big wins. Defense majors like The Boeing Company ( BA - Free Report ) , Textron Inc. ( TXT - Free Report ) , Harris Corporation ( HRS - Free Report ) , General Dynamics Corp . ( GD - Free Report ) and United Technologies Corporation ( UTX - Free Report ) also clinched a number of important contracts from the Pentagon. (Read Defense Stock Roundup for Nov 17, 2016 here .) Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics business division secured a huge modification contract worth $7.19 billion for the F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The original advance acquisition contract involved low-rate initial production of the Lot 10 F-35 Lightening II jets. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Mar 2020. Per the terms of the contract, Lockheed Martin will procure 90 jets, comprised 76 F-35As for the U.S. Air Force, non-U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) participants and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers; 12 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps and non-U.S. DoD participants; and two F-35Cs for the Navy. Notably, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is the fifth-generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft, equipped with an advanced stealth feature. Notably, it is the world's largest defense program. The Aeronautics business division nabbed another contract, worth $1.2 billion for upgrading the Korean F-16 fighter jets. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Nov 15, 2025. Originally manufactured by General Dynamics, F-16 became part of Lockheed Martin after it acquired the former’s aircraft manufacturing business.

      "text": "Picture this scenario: a teenager has just texted his crush, asking for a date. While driving to meet a friend, his phone dings and he thinks it might be her. Excited, he glances down just as a truck brakes in front of him. His parents’ new car, which has all the latest gadgets, senses he isn’t looking at the road and sounds an alarm. Having never heard the alarm before, the teenager is further distracted as he tries to figure out what it means. All this happens in the space of a few seconds but it ends with a rear-end collision.\nThe complexity of in-vehicle technology is staggering — a typical new car comes with 100 million lines of code, more than a Boeing Co. 787 jet — but it sometimes feels as if that technology is working at cross purposes.\nFor example, most new vehicles come with elaborate infotainment systems that provide hands-free phone calls, music streaming, voice-activated search, navigation, traffic alerts, information on nearby businesses, and so on. These may be fun and useful, but they can also be distracting as the driver navigates through complex menus to find what he or she is looking for.\n– See more at: http://news.nationalpost.com/features/fatal-distraction-driven-to-distraction#sthash.f6ID5I8q.dpuf \n",

      "text": "  \nBoeing facilities are seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. April 22, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo \nMore NEW YORK (Reuters) – The World Trade Organization is set to rule this week that Boeing Co received illegal tax breaks from Washington state, according to reports in The Telegraph and The Wall Street Journal. The Journal said the trade organization will argue that the Washington state tax break is a prohibited subsidy and will have to be withdrawn, citing people familiar with the matter. The paper said the WTO is not likely to say what the value of the prohibited tax break is, but the European Union has argued that Boeing has received more than $8 billion in forbidden subsidies. The tax breaks in question are for Boeing’s 777X airplane. The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world’s largest trade dispute, still raging after 12 years of bitter arguments over support for Boeing and rival Airbus. Representatives for Boeing and the WTO could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Peter Cooney) Share This:",

      "text": "Since President-elect Donald Trump's surprise election victory, trade is back in the spotlight in a way that it hasn't been, arguably, since the 1990s.\nThat is no surprise, given his tough talk during the campaign, which included calling the North American Free Trade Agreement \"the worst trade deal ever signed\" and dubbing the Trans-Pacific Partnership a \"disaster\" that he would abandon on day one of his presidency.\nInto that charged atmosphere came Monday's ruling against aerospace giant Boeing ( BA ) by the World Trade Organization.

When Malin’s not working, she likes to unwind by doing yoga in breathtaking locales. Thankfully for us and all of her 46,500 Instagram followers , she also enjoys posting photos of her in action.\nBut before we get to the pictures, it’s pretty fascinating how Malin got into yoga in the first place. Via the Daily Mail :\nThe pilot has said she fell in love with yoga after a snowboarding accident in 2008, which left her suffering with back pain.\n‘I tried everything and the only thing that really worked for me was yoga,’ she said.\n‘It helps me to understand myself better and also to be a better person towards others,’ Malin said, adding that yoga has become ‘a lifestyle’.\n‘To be grateful for every day and to be strong no matter what.\n‘And it gets addictive.’\nIt’s really cool that yoga can serve a purpose other than making pervs on the internet happy. In celebration of Malin’s good health and awesome job, let’s take a look at some of her hottest photos.\nElsa Hosk: 22 Hottest Photos On The Internet Coming equipped to us all with a bangin’ body and an ability to tantalize the CLICK HERE TO READ MORE → ",

      "text": "Here Is What Boeing's Defeat Before the WTO Means for Its Shares The company lost a trade skirmish on Monday, but its prospects still look bright. Chad Fraser Nov29,201610:52AMEST \nSince President-elect Donald Trump's surprise election victory, trade is back in the spotlight in a way that it hasn't been, arguably, since the 1990s. \nThat is no surprise, given his tough talk during the campaign, which included calling the North American Free Trade Agreement \"the worst trade deal ever signed\" and dubbing the Trans-Pacific Partnership a \"disaster\" that he would abandon on day one of his presidency. \nInto that charged atmosphere came Monday's ruling against aerospace giant Boeing ( BA ) by the World Trade Organization. The stock fell 0.17% on Monday, and is down again slightly on Tuesday. \nThe WTO ruled that the company received a tax break from Washington State where it is based in 2013 that violated the trade body's rules. In response, it recommended that the U.S. withdraw the incentive within 90 days. \nThe tax reduction is tied to Boeing's forthcoming 777X passenger jet . Specifically, it is contingent on the company using wings made in Washington State. \nBoeing is already committed to do that, at a facility specifically built to produce the wings in Puget Sound. \nThe requirement raised red flags at Boeing rival Airbus, and the European Union disputed it and other incentives on the company's behalf. \nAs with many things surrounding the companies' decade-long brawl over subsidies, it is tough to pin down exactly how much money is at stake. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malstrom has claimed that it is $5.7 billion, but a statement from Boeing cited \"future incentives of no more than $50 million a year.\" \nWhat is clear is that lawyers for both sides will be busy for years to come, as the ruling comes in the wake of a WTO judgment against Airbus and the EU in September, which is under appeal.

      "text": "Boeing facilities are seen in Los Angeles, California Thomson Reuters\nPARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday that the United States must comply with a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling this week against U.S. tax breaks for Boeing , and that failure to do so would give the EU legal basis for retaliatory measures.\nThe WTO said this week that a tax break from Washington state to help Boeing develop its new 777X jetliner was a prohibited subsidy, in a setback for the U.S. planemaker as it eyes victory in a parallel case against Airbus .\n\"The United States must quickly comply with the decision and put an end to these illegal measures,\" the French finance ministry said in a statement.\n\"If not, the European Union will have the legal grounds to adopt retaliatory measures concerning goods coming in from the United States,\" it added.\n(Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Brian Love)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Source: courtesy of Boeing Co. After every U.S. election, the losers very likely ask themselves, “Well, what’s the worst that could happen?” Should Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) be asking itself that same question?\nBoeing is the country’s largest manufacturing firm and its largest (by revenue) exporter of finished goods. During his campaign, President-Elect Donald Trump made trade a centerpiece of what he plans to change as soon as he takes office. He took particular aim at China, claiming that the United States and China are already in a trade war and that the United States should use what he called its “economic power” over China.\nFrom Boeing’s point of view, there are significant dangers to the company’s business if Trump should make the wrong choices on trade. Between 2000 and 2015, Boeing delivered about 5,500 new commercial jets to foreign customers. That’s about 73% of all its deliveries during those years.\nAccording to industry analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group, the percentage of Boeing’s new airplanes that are exported has risen from about 54% in 2000 to 80% in 2015. Deliveries to U.S. airlines in that period fell by a 2.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Deliveries to non-U.S. operators and lessors grew by a 6% CAGR.\nAnd while Boeing’s international customer base is important, Aboulafia also notes the “elaborate global supply chain networks” on which aircraft manufacturers depend for transfer of parts from all over the world.\nAs is almost always the case in any political undertaking, making the least amount of change and trumpeting it as a major win is probably the best outcome. If Trump leaves trade agreements and bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO) as they are but takes a somewhat harder line in negotiations, Boeing may have to adapt but it won’t be seriously affected.\nHowever, if a Trump administration imposes tariffs and other barriers to trade, especially targeted at China, Aboulafia believes this is “the greatest risk for Boeing.” Nearly 20% of the company’s 2015 deliveries were made to Chinese buyers, and a threatened 45% tariff on all Chinese imports would certainly provoke a response from China that would not be in Boeing’s best interests.\nTrump has promised to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and at least to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The new administration also could choose to ignore WTO rulings such as the one handed down recently in a dispute between Boeing and Airbus over illegal subsidies.\nSince the November 8 election, the dollar has risen more than 10%, and that decreases the buying power of Boeing’s foreign customers. Another blow to Boeing would be the loss of the U.S. Export-Import Bank that already had been the target of conservative legislators as well as the president-elect.\nOne bright spot may be expected increases in defense spending under a Trump administration. That would certainly help, but Boeing’s 2015 revenues from its defense and space division totaled less than half its commercial jet revenues. Even the company’s planned expansion of its services business would not bring overall revenues if the worst outcome should be realized.\nBoeing’s stock posted a new 52-week high of $152.11 on Tuesday, nearly a buck a share above the 12-month consensus price target of $151.22. The 52-week low is $102.10.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "title": "Take a Virtual Tour of NASA’s Giant Boeing 747 Observatory",
      "text": "Over its five-decade lifespan, the Boeing 747 has served many roles: passenger jet, cargo carrier, presidential transport ( doomsday and non-doomsday editions ), aerial laser cannon , even big spoon to the space shuttle . But when it comes to weirdly awesome versions of the iconic jumbo jet, it’s hard to beat NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy. Colloquially abbreviated to SOFIA, this 747 serves as the world’s largest flying observatory . And it’s about to head back to the skies to try and sort out some mysteries of the universe. SOFIA is equipped with a reflecting telescope with an effective diameter of 100 inches—the same size as  the Hooker Telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory that Edwin Hubble used to demonstrate that the universe is expanding . Situated behind a retractable awning at the back of the plane, the telescope is gyro-stabilized and pneumatically and hydraulically isolated from the rest of the plane, in order to keep it level in spite of the microturbulence of everyday flight. Flying at an altitude of 39,000 to 45,000 feet means the telescope is above 99 percent of the water in the atmosphere, giving it a far better view than similar ground-based observatories.\nAs the name suggests, this four-engined flying telescope spends its days peering into the infrared bands of the EM spectrum . For the 2017 observing campaign (yes, that’s what NASA calls it), which stretches from February 2017 to January 2018, SOFIA will train her eye on Jupiter's satellite Europa, in order to try and learn more about the massive water plumes spied on t he Galilean moon by the Hubble Space Telescope. The plane will also stare at Neptune’s enormous moon Triton, a massive interstellar region around the center of the Milky Way, and a supermassive black hole located roughly 12 billion light years away, among many other research projects being conducted by the telescope’s joint American/German team.\nWhile SOFIA first flew in her current form a mere six years ago, her airframe will turn 40 next year. Originally delivered to Pan Am in 1977 , the 747 was purchased by United in 1986, then bought by NASA in 2007. Considering Boeing may not build the 747 for all that much longer , it’s reassuring to see that these birds can still live full, productive lives well into their forties.",

      "text": "Solid orders for its defense and space business helped Boeing (NYSE: BA) make it through the Great Recession in one piece, despite a drop in commercial airplane demand. However, in recent years, Boeing's defense business has been under pressure because of caps on U.S. military spending and a few key contract losses.\nIndeed, just a year or two ago, the future looked pretty grim for Boeing's defense business, as the company was on track to run out of fighter orders by the end of the decade.\nHowever, Boeing recently finalized a slew of fighter orders, with more under consideration. Meanwhile, deliveries of its new military tanker are finally scheduled to begin in late 2017. This could make the defense business a growth driver for Boeing once again -- at least for the next few years.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "Search: Is Boeing's Defense Business Becoming a Growth Driver Again? Despite some high-profile contract losses, Boeing's defense business may be able to generate modest growth over the next several years. Adam Levine-Weinberg ( TMFGemHunter ) Dec 6, 2016 at 8:10AM \nSolid orders for its defense and space business helped Boeing ( NYSE:BA ) make it through the Great Recession in one piece, despite a drop in commercial airplane demand. However, in recent years, Boeing's defense business has been under pressure because of caps on U.S. military spending and a few key contract losses. \nIndeed, just a year or two ago, the future looked pretty grim for Boeing's defense business, as the company was on track to run out of fighter orders by the end of the decade. \nHowever, Boeing recently finalized a slew of fighter orders, with more under consideration. Meanwhile, deliveries of its new military tanker are finally scheduled to begin in late 2017. This could make the defense business a growth driver for Boeing once again -- at least for the next few years. Boeing will deliver the first KC-46 Pegasus military tanker to the Air Force in 2017. Image source: Boeing. Boeing's defense business stagnates \nBoeing bulked up its defense segment two decades ago by merging with McDonnell Douglas. The McDonnell Douglas-developed F-15 and F/A-18 fighters have been the centerpieces of Boeing's military aircraft lineup ever since. \nHowever, in 2001, Boeing rival Lockheed Martin ( NYSE:LMT ) won a $200 billion contract for the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. As a result, Boeing recognized that its fighter business wouldn't last forever. \nMore recently, Boeing teamed up with Lockheed Martin in a bid to build a next-generation bomber for the U.S. However, Boeing and Lockheed lost the competition to Northrop Grumman last year. An appeal was turned aside in early 2016. This was a disappointing loss, as there are only a few big military aircraft programs coming up for bid in the foreseeable future. \nIn addition, the C-17 Globemaster military cargo plane -- which also came to Boeing as part of the McDonnell Douglas acquisition -- finally ran out of orders last year, leading to the closure of the Long Beach factory where it was built. \nAs a result, revenue for Boeing's defense, space, and security segment (known as BDS) peaked in 2013 at $33.2 billion. By 2015, BDS revenue had declined to $30.4 billion. Through the first nine months of 2016, the segment's revenue is flat year over year. Boeing's fighters soldier on \nFortunately, Boeing has been able to stave off the end of fighter production by winning a series of foreign orders. Most recently, it sold 36 F-15s to Qatar and 28 F/A-18 Super Hornets to Kuwait. Together, those aircraft deals are worth $7 billion. Including weapons, support, and options to acquire additional planes, the value of these contracts could exceed $30 billion . Boeing is still seeing plenty of demand for its aging fighter models. Image source: Boeing. \nAdditionally, Lockheed Martin's F-35 has been a disaster from the start. It still isn't fully ready for service, while the total program cost has nearly doubled from the initial estimate. The U.S. was supposed to have received more than 1,000 F-35s by now, but Lockheed Martin had only delivered 179 as of earlier this year. \nAs a result of these delays and cost overruns, Canada canceled its plan to acquire F-35s a few years ago. Last month, it announced that it wants to purchase 18 F/A-18 Super Hornets to replace some of its aging Hornet fighters. The U.S. Navy is also interested in acquiring dozens more F/A-18 Super Hornets from Boeing because of the delayed availability of Lockheed Martin's F-35. \nIf all of these orders go through, Boeing may be able to keep both of its fighter jet production lines running well into the 2020s. Furthermore, these additional aircraft sales will generate billions of dollars in long-term support and services revenue. Tanker production set to ramp up \nWhile BDS' fighter jet business is declining more slowly than previously expected, its military tanker business is about to ramp up. Although Boeing has faced cost overruns and modest schedule delays for its KC-46 Pegasus, the first delivery is now on track for the second half of 2017. \nThe U.S. Air Force plans to acquire 179 KC-146 tankers over the next dozen or so years, for an estimated cost of $40 billion. Including potential follow-on orders from the Air Force and international orders, Boeing believes the total opportunity is twice as large. And of course, the KC-46 is likely to generate huge sums of support and services revenue for decades to come. \nThe combination of rising tanker sales and ongoing fighter production could drive modest growth for Boeing's defense business over the next several years. The commercial jet business will still deliver the lion's share of Boeing's revenue and profit, but it won't be working alone. With demand for some key aircraft types slowing down recently, that's welcome news for Boeing shareholders. \nAdam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

      "text": "Boeing \n\nNew orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in nearly 1-1/2 years in October, further evidence that the manufacturing sector is gradually recovering after a prolonged downturn.\nThe Commerce Department said on Tuesday new orders for manufactured goods rose 2.7 percent after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent gain in September. That was the largest increase since June 2015 and marked four straight months of gains.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 2.6 percent in October after a previously reported 0.3 percent gain in September. Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.7 percent, the biggest rise since July 2014, ending four consecutive months of decline.\nThe report added to factory surveys in suggesting an upturn in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy. Despite signs of stability, progress is likely to be limited by renewed dollar strength in the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.\nThe dollar's surge against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and January 2016 helped to undercut manufacturing activity.\nWith the dollar rally having appeared to fade for much of the year, some of the drag had eased. But the dollar has gained 4.1 percent on a trade-weighted basis since the election.\nIn October, orders for transportation equipment jumped 12 percent, the biggest rise in a year. Motor vehicle orders, however, slipped 0.7 percent.\nThere were increases in orders for computers and electronic products, capital goods, and electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for machinery were unchanged.\nThe Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - rose 0.2 percent instead of the 0.4 percent increase reported last month.\nShipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 0.1 percent in October instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent rise.\nThat suggested business spending on equipment will likely remain weak in the fourth quarter.\nShipments of overall factory goods increased 0.4 percent in October after rising 0.9 percent the prior month. Inventories of factory goods were flat. That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio unchanged at 1.34.\n(Editing by Paul Simao)\nNOW WATCH: Why almost every pair of jeans has a zipper that says ‘YKK’ \n",

      "text": "Solid orders for its defense and space business helped Boeing (NYSE: BA) make it through the Great Recession in one piece, despite a drop in commercial airplane demand. However, in recent years, Boeing's defense business has been under pressure because of caps on U.S. military spending and a few key contract losses.\nIndeed, just a year or two ago, the future looked pretty grim for Boeing's defense business, as the company was on track to run out of fighter orders by the end of the decade.\nHowever, Boeing recently finalized a slew of fighter orders, with more under consideration. Meanwhile, deliveries of its new military tanker are finally scheduled to begin in late 2017. This could make the defense business a growth driver for Boeing once again -- at least for the next few years.\nBoeing will deliver the first KC-46 Pegasus military tanker to the Air Force in 2017.

      "text": "Trump wants to cancel Air Force One order from Boeing 'Cancel order!' president-elect tweeted early Tuesday Author: By Chris Isidore and Jon Ostrower Published On: Dec 06 2016 08:20:43 AM CST Updated On: Dec 06 2016 10:24:31 AM CST \nDonald Trump wants to cancel a government order for a new Air Force One. Related Content Holiday shopping kickoff: What to know \nThe president-elect said in a tweet early Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that's being built to carry \"future presidents\" already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nAsked by reporters Tuesday morning about the tweet, he responded, \"Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program,\" he said. \"And I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nSo far the Air Force has allocated $2.9 billion through 2021 for two new Air Force Ones, which will replace the current fleet. The new planes aren't expected to be ready to fly until 2022. The Air Force has already spent about $93 million preparing to build the new jets. \nThe Air Force has yet to place a formal order for the planes. It has chosen the latest version of Boeing's jumbo jet, the 747-8, as the platform for the new Air Force One planes. Building the basic planes would take about two years. Then modifications to protect the aircraft from attack, install VIP accommodations and allow it to be refueled mid-flight would delay the delivery two more years. \nBoeing builds the 747 at its factories in Washington state, and it currently has a large back order for its commercial jets, especially the 787 Dreamliner. And airlines regularly cancel orders for planes, although it would be a loss of both prestige and revenue should the Air Force drop plans to build two new Air Force Ones. \nThe 747-8 has a longer range, can travel faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and it gets better fuel economy than the 747-200 that's used for the current Air Force Ones. \nBoeing, which is the nation's largest exporter, has built the plane used by every president since Franklin Roosevelt. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Recently retired Boeing CEO Jim McNerney was named just last week to an all-star team of corporate executives who will advise Trump on jobs and the economy. Shares of Boeing were slightly lower after Trump's comment. \n-- CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this story \n ",

      "text": "December 06, 2016 11:46 AM Trump Tweet Tanks Stock, Boeing Responds Advertisement Chip in $4 go \nMonday morning Donald Trump tanked Boeing's stock when he tweeted a demand to cancel a contract with the aircraft maker for two new Air Force One 747s. The president-elect claimed Boeing was over budget by about a billion dollars in the construction of the jets. \nIn reality, the aircraft are not even in the construction stage, according to Boeing. They are slated to be delivered in 2020. \nBoeing issued a very diplomatic statement saying they are under contract only for the planning of the aircraft, so no planes are being built – effectively debunking Trump's tweet. JUST IN: Boeing issues statement on Air Force One. https://t.co/TGMGUaWBm7 pic.twitter.com/havQhrxOeY — CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) December 6, 2016 \nBoeing stock has gained a bit of ground since earlier this morning, but it's still down. \n\nImage by Gage Skidmore via Flickr and a CC license Advertisement",

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nTue, Dec 6, 2016, 19:46 GMT - UK Markets closed Donald Trump just took a shot at Boeing in Trump Tower By Berkeley Lovelace Jr. | CNBC – 5 hours ago View Photo \nTrump threatens to cancel its order from Boeing of a new Air Force One. President-elect Donald Trump unexpectedly started negotiating with Boeing over the price of a new Air Force One on Tuesday morning. \nFirst over Twitter , Trump threatened to cancel the order for a new Air Force One, which would be used for future presidents. He said the cost of the new 747 was more than $4 billion. \nThen in the Trump Tower lobby, the president-elect amplified his message. \n\"Well the plane is totally out of control, it's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program,\" he said. \"I think it's ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nIn January, Boeing won a contract to start preliminary work on a new Air Force One program. The Air Force awarded Boeing an initial contract worth nearly $26 million to reduce risk and lower cost, Reuters reported. The Air Force has previously said that it planned $1.65 billion for two replacement jets, Reuters reported. \nNoting that the current Air Force One is 25 years old, a source familiar with the Boeing Air Force One contract told CNBC that if the program does not move forward, it could be years before the president ever flies on a new one. \nIn a statement, Boeing said: \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nAccording to the Department of Defense budget there's about $2.8 billion dollars allotted on the project until fiscal 2021. The document didn't put a total figure on the cost. The figure was marked as \"continuing\" under cost to complete. The Government Accountability Office said last year the cost could be about $3.2 billion, NBC News reported. It added by the time the aircraft is delivered it could be over $4 billion. \nThe White House said on Tuesday some of the statistics cited by Trump on Air Force One don't appear to reflect arrangements between Boeing and the Department of Defense, and Americans would expect future presidents would benefit from upgrades. \nBefore Trump's tweet, Boeing was trading at $152.16 a share. After the tweet, it fell, 1.6 percent to a low of $149.75 a share, according to FactSet. Within the first hour of trading, shares of Boeing were down about 0.5 percent. Boeing shares seesawed in afternoon trade Tuesday. \nIn Trump's 2016 financial disclosure, filed in May, he listed owning $50,001 to $100,000 of Boeing shares and listed the income from those dividends at $1,001 to $2,500. Trump's spokesperson Jason Miller reportedly said the president-elect sold all of his Boeing stock back in June. \nLast month, a report said that Trump can get paid for Secret Service agents that fly on his plane. \nThe stock is up more than 4 percent year to date. \n—CNBC's Steven Kopack and Eamon Javers contributed to this report.",

Cancel order!\" Image Credits: Kevin Dietsch - Pool/Getty Images . \nThe government should cancel its multibillion-dollar order for new Air Force One presidential planes, Donald Trump declared Tuesday, serving notice he’s ready to jump in and start making decisions six weeks before his inauguration. \nCosts for the two Boeing 747s are “totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in the lobby of his New York skyscraper. \nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build the planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn’t fly on the aircraft, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe, unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current version is becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. \nThe contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”",

      "title": "Q&A: A look at Trump's call to cancel new Air Force 1",
      "text": "  WASHINGTON \n  suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging Reagan-era models that currently shuttle the president around the world. Trump cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\" \nTrump later told reporters the cost was \"ridiculous\" and that he wanted the aircraft maker to \"make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized airborne symbols of the American presidency. \n--- \nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST? \nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion between the 2010 and 2020 federal budget years. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials say two new aircraft could cost at least $4 billion for development, construction and future maintenance, matching the figure Trump cited. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n--- \nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE? \nWhile that is true, the current aircraft that the president uses for the bulk of his foreign and domestic travel are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. Two variants of a Boeing 747 are in rotation. The planes were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One took President Barack Obama on a trip to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday. \nAir Force One, the distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal, is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that take advantage of the most-up-to-date advances in technology. \nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House. \nThe president and most of those who travel with him aboard Air Force One enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite that can function as an operating room, in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests. \n--- \nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE IN THE PROJECT? \nSo far, the Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added a commercial aircraft the president would use. Boeing has that contract. It would also build the replacement Air Force One. \n--- \nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT? \nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20. Related content",

      "title": "Q&A: A look at Trump's call to cancel new Air Force One",
      "text": "WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nThe New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was \"ridiculous,\" though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, \"but not that much.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.\n___\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump's figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n___\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nThat's true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.\n___\nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE?\nThe Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One.\nUnder the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. The new aircraft wouldn't be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force \"to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\n___\nCOULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT?\nIt's unclear. Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\n___\nDIDN'T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER?\nEarnest, the White House spokesman, said Obama didn't scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected.\n___\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

      "text": "How does canceling Boeing contract save U.S. jobs?   3:43 pm Updated December 6, 2016 at 3:47 pm President-elect Donald Trump has suggested that he wants to cancel a pending order for new Air Force One planes. (AL DRAGO/NYT) Extraordinary costs of Boeing’s new Air Force One program should be scrutinized, as President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday. But he should not abruptly threaten to cancel a contract affecting thousands of manufacturing jobs. Share story The Seattle Times \nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s scrutiny of defense-procurement costs is welcome. \nLess welcome is Trump abruptly blurting out that he’ll cancel a contract affecting thousands of American manufacturing jobs in Washington state. \nThat’s the effect of Trump tweeting Tuesday morning about Boeing’s work on the new Air Force One planes. He said, “Costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nDespite having invested in Boeing and being a satisfied 757 customer , Trump has used the company as a punching bag in attacks on trade and now procurement costs. Top Opinion stories Trump and the art of the scam | Paul Krugman / Syndicated columnist \nTrump must reconcile this stance with his promise to support American workers affected by global trade. \nPerhaps Boeing is singled out for bullying because it exposes a fatal flaw in Trump’s argument for protectionism: The aerospace company is the prime example of how America must embrace foreign trade to support its beleaguered manufacturing industry. \nTrump’s support should also extend to all American workers, not just a select few in states such as Indiana that voted for him. \nIndiana is where Trump last month pressed Carrier to keep about 800 manufacturing jobs in the state rather than move them to Mexico. It’s also the state governed by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. \nThis generated positive headlines and support, even though Carrier will now automate the Indiana factory to lower costs and reduce jobs. America will not be made greater with one-off deals involving members of Trump’s inner circle. \nAmerica and its manufacturing industry will not be made greater with one-off deals involving members of Trump’s inner circle. \nTo support current and future industry and jobs, the country needs policies supporting economic development and education from coast to coast. It must also support trade with foreign countries, which provide the majority of customers and growth opportunities for U.S. companies. \nConsider the example of Boeing’s 747 production in Everett: \nAt the start of this year, around 2,000 people were employed building 747s. The planes are globally recognized symbols of American manufacturing and technical prowess, especially customized versions that carry the president. \nThe planes are mostly sold to international-cargo companies, which have reduced purchases as trade has slowed. This has led to cutbacks and created uncertainty about how much longer production will continue. \nAmong the final buyers is the U.S. Air Force, which decided last year to use the 747-8 for the next version of Air Force One. It approved an initial contract with Boeing this year. \nMore than $3 billion is budgeted through 2021 to develop several of the jets into flying-command centers for the president. They will be among the world’s most sophisticated aircraft, with features such as aerial refueling and defensive capabilities. \nThe cost is breathtaking and deserves scrutiny before the full program is approved. \nYet even more shocking is the inconsistency in Trump’s position toward American workers, and his ongoing pursuit of headlines with knee-jerk tweets. \nTo keep it simple, here are a few tweetable replies: \nHow do threats to cancel contracts at faltering factories make America great? \nDoes Trump support all blue-collar jobs or just some? \nExactly which Air Force One features would President-elect Trump cut to save money?

      "text": "WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nThe New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was \"ridiculous,\" though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, \"but not that much.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.\n___\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump's figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n___\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nThat's true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.\n___\nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE?\nThe Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One.\nUnder the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. The new aircraft wouldn't be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force \"to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\n___\nCOULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT?\nIt's unclear. Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\n___\nDIDN'T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER?\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama didn't scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected.\n___\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.

      "text": "Follow @lynnsweet \nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump threatened Tuesday to cancel or renegotiate Boeing’s pending Air Force One deal, accusing the Chicago company, with no evidence, of “doing a little bit of a number” over costs. \nTrump hit Boeing on Tuesday morning via Twitter posts and in very brief remarks delivered in the lobby of his Trump Tower in Manhattan. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump said in a morning tweet. \nA few hours later, talking to reporters inside the Trump Tower lobby in New York, Trump said, “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nOPINION Follow @lynnsweet \nAfter that, Trump referred to one of his books when he said in another Twitter post, “Have you not read Art of The Deal? This is how I strike my deals. If Air Force One costs more than $4 Billion, Boeing you are fired!” \nBoeing’s corporate headquarters is in the Loop and has manufacturing facilities in Washington State. \nFACT CHECK \nAt present, there is no order to cancel. But there could be. \nCurrently, Boeing has a $170 million contract to “help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” the company said in a statement. \nBoeing will eventually also get the contract to make the planes — if Trump doesn’t nix the deal. \nAccording to the General Accounting Office, delivery is planned for fiscal year 2024. The $4 billion figure Trump used is sort of in the ballpark for two planes. In a March report, the GAO pegged research, development and actual procurement at about $3.5 billion. \nBACKGROUND \nAny plane the president is on is called Air Force One. The aircraft most associated with AF1 are two 747-200Bs with iconic blue markings. The current fleet was bought in 1987, when Ronald Reagan was president. The first one was used in 1990, when George H.W. Bush was in the White House. \nBIG IRONY ALERT \nThe Boeing executive in charge of the company when the U.S. Air Force decided Boeing should make the replacement AF1 jets was Jim McNerney, then Boeing’s Chicago-based Chairman and CEO. \nTrump can easily get the inside story about Boeing’s AF1 costs and profits from McNerney. On Dec. 2, Trump named him as an adviser, tapping him for a slot on his newly created “President’s Strategic and Policy Forum.” The group will meet at the White House in February. \nMcNerney plays both sides of the street. \nPresident Barack Obama appointed him to chair the advisory President’s Export Council and for a spot on another advisory panel, The President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. \nIn May 2015, Obama named McNerney to the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. In September 2015, Boeing pledged $20 million to help expand the performing arts center. \nWHY NO COMPETITIVE BIDDING? \nAF1 gives a president a flying White House. Boeing is the only U.S. company the Air Force says has the ability to build the replacement aircraft — based on a 747-8. \nThe Air Force decided on Boeing as the sole-source provider in early 2015. The only other company with that kind of capacity is the Airbus, headquartered in France. \n“Boeing is in the early stages of negotiating the next generation Air Force One — which serves as a fully-functional command center for the President. We don’t know what it will ultimately cost,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. If Trump “is suggesting we give this work to Airbus, that’s not good for American jobs.” \nWHY NOW? \nA Trump source said Trump did not act in the wake of a Tuesday Chicago Tribune story about Boeing’s concerns over Trump’s China trade policies. Rather, Trump spoke out because he learned about the costs for the aircraft. ",

      "title": "Q&A: A look at Trump's call to cancel new Air Force One",
      "text": "WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. He cited \"out of control\" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with \"Cancel order!\"\nThe New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was \"ridiculous,\" though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, \"but not that much.\"\nHere's a look at Trump's claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.\n___\nHOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?\nThe Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump's figure of $4 billion. That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n___\nWHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?\nThat's true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.\nThe distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.\nAir Force One is unlike most aircraft. It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.\nThe president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.\n___\nWHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE?\nThe Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One.\nUnder the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. The new aircraft wouldn't be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election.\nIn a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force \"to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\n___\nCOULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT?\nIt's unclear. Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\n___\nDIDN'T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER?\nEarnest, the White House spokesman, said Obama didn't scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected.\n___\nCAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT?\nYes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Lolita C.
