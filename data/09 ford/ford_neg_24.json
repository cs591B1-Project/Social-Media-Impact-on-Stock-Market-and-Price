The chargers will use a 350-kilowatt DC standard , called a combined charging system, which enhances existing standards.\nTwo automakers noticeably absent from the group were General Motors'   ( GM ) Opel subsidiary, which plans soon to begin selling a U.S.-made Ampera EV, and French automaker Renault , which pioneered the EV category with its Leaf EV.

Lighter, cheaper batteries that can store more energy have improved performance on the newest EV models, such as the Ampera, soon to be sold in the U.S. as the Chevrolet Bolt EV.\nCharging stations also will make EVs more practical for urban dwellers living in high-rise buildings who often lack convenient access to a conventional electric outlet.

      "text": "Supporters of the CCS charging standard include General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai, in addition to the automakers mentioned in this article. Photo by Ford \nThe lack of public chargers remains the major roadblock between our current auto landscape and our electrified future. Thanks to a number of European automakers, that roadblock could be knocked down within the next decade. \nBMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen have combined forces to invest in a series of fast EV chargers across Europe. The buildup is slated to start in 2017, with an initial goal of 400 charging sites. By 2020, it's believed that this network will offer \"thousands\" of chargers, which would be a huge boost to the EV market. \nThe chargers will be based on the Combined Charging System standard, which is compatible with a number of current and future EVs -- except for Teslas, which require adapters to access standards other than its own. \nThe companies behind the buildup claim the chargers will be able to achieve a charging level of 350 kilowatts, which is nearly three times as powerful as Tesla 's 120-kW Supercharger system. This would be able to provide a great deal of charge in as little as 10 or 15 minutes, which is getting closer to the time it takes to fill up a gas-powered car, even though it's still a ways off from that. \nPie-in-the-sky thinking like this is all but required in order to ramp up EV demand. Right now, long-distance EV travel is still difficult, not only because of the lack of infrastructure but also the slow charging speeds of currently available stations. To make the transition as smooth as possible, EVs will need to offer ample charging locations that minimize downtime. \nNot every automaker is getting in on this EV Justice League, though. General Motors , for example, is not a part of this massive investment, though it does back CCS. In the past, GM claimed that it doesn't dabble in infrastructure, something other automakers have said over the years, as well. But automakers have both the capital and the desire to see it through. Sitting around waiting for private companies to step up and greatly expand access to charging could very well stunt EV growth for years to come.

      "text": "Ford Motor, Volkswagen Group, BMW Group and Daimler today said they plan to set up charging stations for electric vehicles along major highways in Europe. The move will be an important step toward facilitating the mass-market adoption of EVs, the companies said in a joint statement .\nThe companies have signed an initial agreement to create the charging network in what they said is an \"unprecedented collaboration.\" The goal is to quickly build up a sizable number of stations in order to enable long-range travel for battery electric vehicle drivers.\nThe projected ultra-fast high-powered charging network with power levels up to 350 kW will be significantly faster than the most powerful charging system deployed today, the statement said.\nThe buildup is planned to start in 2017. An initial target of about 400 sites in Europe is planned. By 2020 the customers should have access to thousands of high-powered charging points, the statement said. \"The charging experience is expected to evolve to be as convenient as refueling at conventional gas stations,\" the automakers said.\n\"The joint project is another major milestone clearly demonstrating that competitors are combining forces to ramp up e-mobility,\" BMW Group CEO Harald Kruger said in the statement.\nDaimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said: \"The availability of high-power stations allows long-distance e-mobility for the first time and will convince more and more customers to opt for an electric vehicle.\"\nFord Motor CEO Mark Fields said a reliable, ultra-fast charging infrastructure \"is important for mass consumer adoption and has the potential to transform the possibilities for electric driving.\nVolkswagen Group's Audi and Porsche brands will be part of the joint venture. \"There are two decisive aspects for us: ultra-fast charging and placing the charging stations at the right positions,\" Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said in the statement.\nThe network will be based on Combined Charging System (CCS) standard technology. The planned charging infrastructure expands the existing technical standard for AC and DC charging of electric vehicles to a higher level of DC fast-charging capacity with up to 350 kilowatts. EVs engineered to accept 350 kW of power will be able to recharge in a fraction of the time as today's EVs.\nBMW, Daimler, Ford and VW Group will be equal partners in the joint venture and they will encourage other automakers, along with regional partners, to participate.\nYou can reach Paul McVeigh at pmcveigh@crain.com .",

      "text": "Ford is still heavily dependent on its U.S performance . There is an emerging star, but it will take time to yield solid results . Meanwhile, Ford’s dividend yield still makes it an attractive buy . Flickr \nIf you had invested in Ford (NYSE:F) way back in 2012 when it was around $9 - the lowest level the stock has seen in the last five years - and held it until now, your investment would have returned you a little more than 30%, as the stock is now trading a little lower than $12 at the time of writing the article. But during the 2012-2015 period Ford’s total revenue has increased from $133.55 billion in 2012 to $149.55 billion in 2015, operating margin increased from 4.4% to 5.4% and the company has also turned around its European operations from a loss-making one to a profitable one. Let's take a closer look to know what is the hidden jewel in Ford Motors' crown. The Past Year As A Snapshot Preview \nBut none of those internal improvements have mattered to the stock market, and you would have been forced to accept small returns and be happy with the dividends you would have collected in the process. The market’s current pessimism towards auto companies started late last year as U.S auto sales kept hovering around above-average levels. As a cyclical industry, the expectation was that sales had no further room to improve, which meant lower sales in the immediate future. The assumption was that even if sales levels held, auto companies will have to cut off each others arms and margins through discounts as they desperately try to hold on to their respective sales performances. \nThough, fortunately, the market didn't fall off the cliff after hitting the highest point of 18.6 million vehicles in November last year, sales indeed kept moving sideways in a tight range of 17 to 18 million cars a month. \nAlso Read: Ford Stock: Trump's Policies Could Massively Dent Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) Why U.S. Sales are Key, and the Europe Story \nDuring the third quarter of the current fiscal, Ford’s total revenue was $33.3 billion, out of which $21.8 billion came from the United States. Ford’s total pre-tax profit across all regions was $1.1 billion, with the U.S. alone bringing in $1.3 billion in pre-tax profit. Nearly 66% of their current sales are from the domestic market and, on the pre-tax profit front, without US market, Ford would have operated at a loss. \nFord’s pre-tax profit column was negative in South America and Middle East and Africa, while Europe and Asia-Pacific were just over $100 million each during the third quarter. This dependency on the United States is what is weighing down on Ford, and it is not something that the company can wriggle out of as quick as we want it to. \nEurope has the potential to bring in some cover for the United States. The second largest market for Ford had $6.3 billion in sales, accounting for nearly 19% of their sales during the third quarter. Operating margin came in at 2.2%, a far cry from the above 10% level Ford U.S hit during 2015 and the above 5% level the company reached in the United States during Q3 2016. Things have improved a lot for Ford in Europe, and third quarter 2016 was the sixth consecutive profitable quarter for the company. \nThough Brexit could throw a huge spanner in Ford’s recovery in Europe, the continent remains the single biggest hope for the company because there is plenty of room to improve their bottom line. Even doubling their margin levels while holding on to the current market share position in Europe would provide a huge booster shot for the company’s earnings column. \nAccording to Ford’s 2020 Vision , the company wants to hit an operating margin of 8% with a long term target of 8% to 9%. With more than 85% of their sales coming from two continents, unless Ford stays at or above 8% in the United States and Europe, the company won't be able to reach those levels.(See Also: Why Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Is Still A Solid Dividend Play ) Stability Supports Ford Europe’s Emergence \nThe U.S. economy is doing well and the global economy is doing reasonably well, so the odds of a recession are still low. And the best part is, Ford seems to be in much better shape to handle a slowdown now compared to the position it was in ten years ago. The stock remains at depressed levels as things will continue to stay tight in its largest market. Sales are moving sideways and gradually lower, causing a margin contraction, and it will remain so in the short to medium term. We might see some good quarters and some bad quarters, but the stock will inevitably end up staying on its current course. \nIf the company can improve Europe's operating numbers then the stock will definitely move to a higher level but that process will take time, possibly another year or two at least. Until then, all investors can do is enjoy the above 5% bond-like yield on the stock. This is a buy and hold the stock that should ideally remain in your portfolio for a very long time, and the yield should make it worth your while until we see some dramatic improvements in Ford Europe. \nLooking to invest in auto stocks?

      "text": "BERLIN—BMW AG, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG said Tuesday they plan to build together with Ford Motor Co. a network of hundreds of ultrafast, high-powered charging stations for electric cars in Europe.\nThe auto makers have signed a memorandum of understanding to start building stations next year that will make charging cars significantly faster than is possible with even the most powerful charging systems deployed presently. The initial target for the joint venture is to equip about 400 sites with power levels of up to 350 kilowatts.\nBy 2020, customers should have access to thousands of high-powered charging points, according to BMW. The goal is to enable long-distance travel through charging stations along highways and major thoroughfares.\nWrite to Friedrich Geiger at friedrich.geiger@wsj.com\n 29, 2016 09:05 ET (14:05 ",

      "text": "PHOTOS: Celebrity Weddings 2016: See the Photos! \nThe actress, 60, and Ford, 74, had the three-month affair while filming Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope in 1976. “I was in infatuation, probably. Infatuation. Love is more mature,” Fisher told DeGeneres of their relationship when asked if it was love or just sex. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford (from left) on the set of 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.' Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images \nAfter 40 years of keeping the affair a secret, Fisher is now sharing more details about the tryst. “I told other stuff to distract people, so they would never figure it out,” she explained. “And no one thought it was happening at the time.” PHOTOS: Celebrity Anniversary Rings That Outshine Engagement Baubles \nFisher also shed light on what it was like being on location, away from family and friends. “Everybody was away from home, so then the rules — I didn’t know this, I was 19, no one told me about location rules, or lack of rules,” she told DeGeneres. “But you can do whatever you want as long as you film the movie. [People] can sleep together if their family is not around.” Carrie Fisher (left) makes an appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” Michael Rozman/Warner Bros. PHOTOS: Just Like Us: Celebrity Moms \nThe actress, who played Princess Leia in the original Star Wars trilogy, and Ford, who played Leia’s love interest Han Solo, then had romantic scenes in the following film, Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back . “We practiced the kissing [for Episode V ] on the first movie off screen. That shows dedication to your craft,” Fisher joked. \nBut there were darker sides to the affair too . “It was sad because I was so insecure,” she said in an interview on the Today show on Monday, November 21. Ford, who was then 33, was a married father of two during the “three-month one-night stand.” Ford and his then wife, Mary Marquadt , later divorced in 1979. You May Also Like",

Minifigures, chequered flag and trophy will help to bring famous victories to life again and again \nDesigning the exclusive kit was a “dream project” for LEGO design lead Craig Callum, a former car designer who races Fords in his spare time \n\nCOLOGNE, Germany, Nov. 29, 2016 – The iconic Ford GT40 and new Ford GT that won Le Mans 24 Hours in 1966 and 2016 are being brought to life in LEGO® bricks. \n\nThe new LEGO Speed Champions set will include both cars as well as racing driver figures, a chequered flag and even a trophy to recreate those history-making victories. \n\n“Many people in my team grew up with the legend of Ford’s history-making 1966 victory – and experienced the excitement of building and design for the first time through LEGO bricks,” said Dave Pericak, global director, Ford Performance. “This kit is a powerful way to tell our Le Mans story, and will hopefully inspire the race drivers, engineers, and designers of the future.” \n\nFord won at Le Mans earlier this year after returning to the scene of what was a historic 1-2-3 clean sweep 50 years previously. The LEGO Group worked closely with Ford’s design and licensing teams on every detail of the 1966 winning car, and the new Ford GT race car. \n\n“This was a dream project – with a lot of pressure. The Ford GT40 is one of the most iconic race cars of all time, and the new Ford GT is just incredible,” said Craig Callum, head of design, LEGO Speed Champions. “Designed for children, but with grown-ups fans in mind too, we know these models will be closely scrutinized for authenticity.” \n\nCallum, who in his spare time races a Ford Model A hot-rod, and started out as a designer of full-sized cars, helped develop ten prototypes before the final versions of each model were selected, all created from existing LEGO bricks. \n\nYou can watch Callum assemble the new kit in record time here: https://youtu.be/lauf-iym1zM \n\nThe new 2016 Ford GT and 1966 Ford GT40 set will be available to order at LEGO.com/shop from March 1, 2017, with a recommended retail price of €34.99 (£29.99). A Ford Mustang set is on sale now, alongside a Ford F 150 Raptor with trailer and Ford Model A hot rod.",

The eighth-generation subcompact car is expected to be larger than the current generation with a restyled interior and exterior. (Photo: Ford) \nFord Motor Co. on Tuesday will unveil its all-new Ford Fiesta during one of the automakers special “Go Further” events in Cologne, Germany.\nThe eighth-generation subcompact car, which Ford of Europe tweeted a photo of Tuesday prior to the event, is expected to be larger than the current model and feature a restyled exterior, including a wavy grille and a smoother hood.\nTaking the wraps off the new Fiesta will be Mark Fields, the company’s president and CEO, and Jim Farley, the company’s executive vice president and president for Europe, Middle East and Africa.\n“The new Fiesta will be our best expression of Ford — lovable fun, sporty to drive and with an unmatched personality true to the spirit of the iconic small car that has delighted generations of customers for the past 40 years,” Farley said in a statement.\nThe unveiling will be live-streamed starting at 2 p.m. Tuesday through Ford Europe’s YouTube channel. \nDuring the event, Ford says it also will announce details on its “Smart Mobility strategy, fuel-saving technology news and reveal new commercial vehicles.” Ford in recent years has used “Go Further” events to outline new strategies for the company as well as unveil new vehicles.\nFord early Tuesday said it has signed a memorandum of understanding to develop an electric-vehicle rapid-charging infrastructure in Europe with BMW Group, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group with Audi and Porsche.\nThe goal is the quick build-up of a sizable number of stations in order to enable long-range travel for battery-electric cars, according to the company. The build-up is planned to start in 2017. An initial target of about 400 sites in Europe is planned, with customers having access to thousands of high-powered charging points by 2020.\nAbout 2,500 dealers, employees and media are expected to attend the event, which is taking place at the company’s W-Halle inside the Niehl, Cologne, manufacturing facility — one of several assembly plants for the current Fiesta.\nFord has not announced any details of the vehicle or its production plans. For the U.S., the car is currently imported from Ford’s Cuautitlan Stamping and Assembly Plant in Mexico.\nFiesta sales in the U.S. were down 26.6 percent through October.\nmwayland@detroitnews.com\n(313) 222-2504\nTwitter: @MikeWayland",

The new chargers will be capable of doling out up to 350 kW of power — which would make them almost three times as powerful as Tesla’s Supercharging stations. The result will be “the highest-powered charging network in Europe,” according to a statement released by the manufacturers.\n\nThe automakers say that construction will begin in 2017 with “about 400 sites” being targeted, and that the network will have “thousands of high-powered charging points” available by 2020.

      "text": "Next Generation Ford Fiesta Makes Debut for European Market The small but mighty Ford debuts its next iteration. Future Cars \nThe full reveal of the next Fiesta is planned for later today, but Ford released this picture to keep us entertained for the time being. \nAuto Express reported that the sub-compact will ride on Ford's Global B platform, continuing on with the current tradition. Expect the exterior to have some small refinements, including the sleek headlights and streamlined body accents. The major change, however, is on the interior. The cabin is expected to gain a bit of class, making for a higher quality feel and look. This will only help the Fiesta's case against its competitors as it already was a top contender in that category. These distinctions should help the Fiesta's evolution towards becoming a strong global competitor. \nThe powertrain options are set to be the same for the next generation, but with more empahsis on the 1.0L Ecoboost engine. This quirky inline-3 cylinder has been snagging awards left and right, so it would be reasonable to anticipate a larger presence in the Fiesta family. This well help the average fuel economy across the board, helping to market its affordability -- as if it needed any help with that. The photo shown above is of the ST model, so we will continue to see its grinning face for at least one more rendition. It would be nice to see a bump in power from its current 196 HP and 202 lb. ft. of torque, a feat that is certainly possible as the aftermarket for the small 1.6L Ecoboost has proven. \nCome back for updates once the official Euro-spec model is released at the \"Go Further\" event in Cologne, Germany.",

Their “initial target” is to have 400 charging sites in Europe and the goal is to have thousands in place by 2020. \nThe automakers say the planned network will have power levels of up to 350 kilowatts, faster than the most powerful system currently in service. They didn’t give financial details. \nThe aim is to make it easier for electric cars to travel long distances and help make them more appealing to the mass market. ",

      "text": "Ford will begin testing self-driving cars in Europe in 2017 Posted The future of front-end development is design \nFord’s pushing forward in its efforts to get autonomous cars on the road, with a plan to begin testing self-driving vehicles in Europe next year. The testing is in advance of extending its plans to debut an autonomous car specifically for ride-sharing fleets in the U.S. in 2021 to Europe, sometime in the future following that initial launch. \nFord tells TechCrunch it will be testing autonomous cars beginning at its UK-based Engineering Center in Essex, and that it will also begin testing at its Research & Advanced Engineering facilities located in Aachen and Cologne in Germany. The company said it’ll also have more to share about its specific European testing plans in the future, but noted that these facilities are already well-versed in Ford’s current and future driver-assist tech efforts, and so will be well-positioned to lead the autonomous driving efforts in Europe as well. \nFord also commissioned a survey of Europeans regarding their opinions about self-driving and what it might lead to in terms of freeing up time for and options for people. The survey of 4,000 found that 16 percent of respondents would trust autonomous cars to ferry their kids to or from school. 72 percent plan to use the time to have those phone conversations no one seems to have bandwidth for anymore, and 64 percent would use the reclaimed hours to eat. \nTime freed up by autonomous commuting isn’t insubstantial – Ford says its data shows that Europeans spend, on average, 10 full days per year in their cars. You can do a lot with 10 days back … like binge watch all existing seasons of Geordie Shore , for instance. 0",

      "text": "Spec Comparo- Hyundai Tucson vs Honda CR-V vs Innova Crysta vs Ford Endeavour 2.2 litre Spec Comparo- Hyundai Tucson vs Honda CR-V vs Innova Crysta vs Ford Endeavour 2.2 litre A complete comparison of the best selling MPVs and SUVs with the recently introduced Korean model that holds a lot of promise By: Amit Pamnani | Updated: November 29, 2016 1:12 PM The Hyundai Tucson plugs the gap between the Santa Fe and the Creta and with its price point, goes up against different models from various segments \n\nWith a high SUV demand in the country, car manufacturers have introduced new contenders in this segment. The recently introduced Hyundai Tucson might just upset the sales of the reigning champion, Toyota Innova Crysta, the heavy duty Ford Endeavour and the much-acclaimed Honda CR-V. We do a specification comparison of new-kid-on-the-block with existing players . \nHyundai Tucson Engine \nEngine: \nThe third generation Hyundai Tucson has been introduced in India with two engine options, a 2.0-litre Nu petrol engine and 2.0-litre CRDi diesel engine. The petrol engine produces 153 hp of power and 192 Nm of torque while the new R e-VGT (electronic Variable Geometry Turbo) 2.0-litre CRDi motor churns out 183 hp of power and 400 Nm of torque. Both the engines have the option of a 6-speed manual and automatic transmissions. According to the recent first drive review of the car, diesel engine is a refined unit, although the gear shifts on the automatic transmission aren't for the spirited driver. (Read the first drive review of the Hyundai Tucson diesel here) \nOn the other hand, the Honda CR-V is the only car here which is powered only by petrol engines, a 2.0-litre unit for the base version and a 2.4-litre engine for the higher variants. The 2.0-litre i-VTEC motor produces 154 hp of power and 190 Nm of torque, while the 2.4-litre i-VTEC engine churns out 187 hp of power and 226 Nm of torque. The 2.0-litre unit comes with a 6-speed manual transmission and a 5-speed automatic transmission, however, it is available only in a two-wheel drive format. The CR-V which is powered by the larger engine has a 5-speed automatic transmission and is also available in 4WD mode. \nThat said, the Ford Endeavour variants which are powered by the 2.2-litre, TDCi, inline, 4-cylinder diesel engine produces 155hp of power and 385Nm of torque. The engine is available with options -speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission with two-wheel or four-wheel drive formats. The recent price cut through all Ford models also makes it an enticing option over others. The Ford Endeavour 2.2 AT Trend 4X2 version has a sticker price of Rs 23.78 lakh while the price tag of the Tucson diesel Automatic GLS trim more expensive by Rs 1.21 at Rs 24.99 lakh (Both prices are ex-showroom, Delhi) \nIn case you are looking for an MPV, another option to consider is the Toyota Innova Crysta. It comes with three engine options, 2.4-litre GD VNT Intercooler diesel, a 2.8-litre GD diesel and a new 2.7-litre dual VVT-i petrol. The 2.4-litre unit produces 146 hp of power and 343 Nm of peak torque, and the 2.8-litre GD diesel churns out 174 hp of power and 360 Nm of torque. The 2.7-litre petrol engine produces 166 hp of power and 245 Nm torque. These units have the options of a 5-speed manual and the 6-speed automatic transmissions depending on the variant chosen. \nAlso read about: Ford Endeavour off road review Dimensions \nIn terms of dimensions, Hyundai Tuscon measures 4,475 mm in length, 1,850 mm in width and 1660 mm in height while the Honda CR-V is longer at 4,545 mm, but thinner at 1,820 mm in width and taller at 1,685 mm. \nWhen compared to the Innova Crysta which measures 4,735 mm in length, 1,830 mm in width and 1,795 mm in height, the Hyundai Tucson has considerably lesser dimensions. That said, the Innova Crysta is an MPV with seven seats while the Tucson is an SUV that can accommodate up to five occupants. \nThe Ford Endeavour has the highest numbers in this regard that measures 4,892 mm in length, 1,860 mm in width and 1,837 mm in height. This would make parking the behemoth in tight parking spots cumbersome over the other. The Tucson in this regards is compact, however, the other rivals can seat more occupants. 7 SRS airbags for driver and all passenger \nSafety Safety is paramount in Hyundai's approach to a vehicle and the Tuscon gets active safety features such as six airbags, front parking sensors (first-in-segment), HAC (Hill-start Assist Control), DBC (Downhill Brake Control), ESC (Electronic Stability Control), VSM (Vehicle Stability Management).The Tuscon achieved the 5-star EURO NCAP (New Car Assessment Programme) safety rating. \nIn comparison, the Toyota Innova Crysta has also achieved a 5-star rating at the ASEAN NCAP for South-east Asian Countries thanks to a host of safety features. These include rear parking sensors, dual front airbags and driver knee airbag, ABS (anti-lock braking system), EBD (electronic brake-force distribution), vehicle stability control (VSC) and hill-start assist control (HAC) as standard. The ESC (Electronic Stability Control) equipped trim has received the 5-star rating in for Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) while other versions have received four stars. The top-end version of the Toyota Innova Crysta also has additional airbags for added safety. \nAdditionally, the Honda CR-V is equipped with 6 airbags, Vehicle Stability Assist, Anti-lock Braking System( ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) and Hill Start Assist. The Ford Endeavour get safety features such as dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, Traction control, Hill Launch Assist, Hill Descent Control and Ford Mykey. So, in terms of safety, all cars in comparison here have safety as a priority and one can be reassured that occupants in any of the cars will remain safe during an impact. \nRead about: Hyundai Tucson AWD to launch in May 2017 \nPrices \nHyundai launched Tuscon from Rs 18.99 lakh to Rs 24.99 lakh. Although it is unable to undercut the Toyota Innova Crysta which has a huge price bracket that starts from Rs 13.70 lakh and goes all the way up to Rs 19.62 lakh for the petrol and some diesel variants, the larger diesel engine powered versions have a rather hefty starting from Rs lakh. \nComparably, the Honda CR-V is the least value-for-money in this regard as it does not have an option of a diesel engine and is priced between Rs 22 lakh and Rs 26 lakh. That said, the SUV from Honda's stable will be more reliable owing to its 2 years standard warranty. Hyundai Tucson also comes with 5 years standard warranty and 24 hour roadside assistance. \nComing to the Ford Endeavour, it is available in 4x2 and 4x4 versions, however, it has a close competition in terms of price with the Hyundai Tucson as the American SUV starts from Rs 23.63 lakh to Rs 28.15 lakh. That said, there is no option in the Ford Endeavour's portfolio of a petrol engine powered SUV. \nIf you are looking at a five-seater, tall car, the Hyundai Tucson will fit your budget easily. That said, if you are looking for a seven-seater, the Hyundai Tucson would be a let down over the other cars which is the only possible limitation of the new offering from the Korean carmaker.

      "text": "DARPA establishes group to standardize robotic space repairs Posted Ford will begin testing self-driving cars in Europe in 2017 \nIf we’re to keep thousands of expensive satellites in working order, the job isn’t going to be done by humans — and DARPA suggests we all get on the same page before we start designing robotic systems to pick up the slack. Related Articles SpaceX seeks approval for satellite-powered internet service 3D-printed satellite launcher heads to ISS with blessing of Chris Hadfield and Grant Imahara White House puts $50M in small satellites, signs order to mitigate space-weather events The reality of satellite design is that if pretty much anything goes wrong, the thing sits in orbit like a million-dollar paperweight (although absent gravity it is technically a paper mass ) and eventually burns up on reentry. After all, there’s usually no one out there to fix it except the folks on the ISS, and they’ve got better things to do.\nRobotic platforms are the obvious solution: they can get in range and tighten screws or knock an antenna into alignment… but only if the satellites in question are using the right kind of screw. DARPA wants to get everyone together to talk about getting these standards in order. \n“We’re inviting the space community to join us in creating a permanent, self-sustaining ‘one-stop shop’ where industry can collaborate and engage with the U.S. Government about on-orbit servicing, as well as drive the creation of the standards that future servicing providers will follow,” said DARPA’s Todd Master in a press release. An exciting graphic showing the flow of information through CONFERS. \nThe group would be called the Consortium for Execution of Rendezvous and Servicing Operations , or CONFERS, and its decisions would be purely advisory and non-binding. The idea is it would be a clearinghouse for discussion and technical information, not any kind of authority. \nPeople build things with 2x4s and use right-handed screw threads because they’re cheap, widely available, and generally good enough. Standards like that (a bit more thorough, of course) could keep costs down for future space platforms that want to allow for the possibility of mid-mission servicing. \nGot some ideas? Head over to Arlington on December 16 for the agency’s proposal day — all citizens are welcome, but you’ll need to go through the usual security procedures detailed in the invitation. 0",

      "text": "Why Ford and the German Automakers Just Teamed Up to Challenge Tesla Motors in Europe newsfeedback@fool.com (John Rosevear) 0 \nA group of big-name automakers announced on Tuesday that they will build a network of ultra-fast electric-vehicle chargers to rival Tesla Motors ' (NASDAQ: TSLA) Supercharger network in Europe, an important step in smoothing the way for the widespread adoption of electric cars. Who's involved in this new network \nFord Motor Company (NYSE: F) , BMW AG (NASDAQOTH: BAMXF) , Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG (NASDAQOTH: DDAIF) , and Volkswagen AG (NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) , along with VW subsidiaries Audi and Porsche , are the initial partners in a new joint venture that will build a network of ultra-fast chargers in Europe. BMW has joined with Ford and its German rivals to fund a new network of ultra-fast electric-vehicle recharging stations in Europe. Image source: BMW AG. What are they building? \nInitially, beginning next year, the venture will open about 400 ultra-fast charging stations along major \"long-distance travel routes\" in Europe. By 2020, the venture expects to have \"thousands of high-powered charging points.\" \nThe partnership isn't intended to exclude other automakers that might be interested. Here's what the partners said in their joint statement announcing the venture: \nWhile the founding partners -- BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen Group -- will be equal partners in the Joint Venture, other automobile manufacturers will be encouraged to participate in the network to help establish convenient charging solutions for BEV customers. The Joint Venture is also open for cooperations with regional partners. How fast are these new \"ultra-fast\" chargers? \nThe partners say that these \"ultra-fast\" chargers are more powerful than anything in service today, including Tesla's Superchargers. Based on the Combined Charging System (CCS) DC Fast standard, the new chargers will support power levels up to 350 kilowatts. \nThat represents an expansion of the existing standard. As of right now, there are no vehicles on the market that can take advantage of that much power. (The new chargers will automatically scale to what the vehicle can accept.) But the fact that this is happening now suggests that vehicles that can handle that level of power are in development. Will these new chargers be free to use? \nProbably not. But that wasn't made clear in the venture's initial statement on Tuesday. How do these chargers compare to Tesla's Superchargers? \nTesla's Superchargers currently deliver up to 120 kW of power. That's enough to add about 170 miles of range in 30 minutes. Tesla has 744 Supercharger stations around the world. Many more are planned. Image source: Tesla Motors. \nThe Superchargers have been free for all Tesla owners to use, but that will soon change . As of Jan. 1, owners will get 400 kilowatt-hours of free Supercharger credits a year (about 1,000 miles worth of range), but will have to pay to use the chargers after that. \nTesla promised that the fee for a recharge would be less than the price of filling up a conventional car with gasoline. I expect that the new European network will charge comparable fees. Why is this a big deal? \nRight now, while there are a few DC Fast charging stations available, most non-Tesla electric vehicles using most rechargers take a long time to recharge. That's a deal breaker for many who might otherwise consider an electric vehicle. \nTesla's proprietary Supercharger network was intended to help ease potential buyers' worries about going electric, and it has. Tesla's Superchargers are much faster than conventional EV chargers, making long road trips viable. \nIt has been clear for a while that something similar will be needed for non-Teslas. A few private companies have begun building networks, but progress has been slow. Today's announcement is a clear signal: At least in Europe, the big automakers don't want to wait any longer. 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes What's the upshot for investors? \nThis is another sign that the German luxury brands are feeling competitive pressure from Tesla. The new network will go a long way toward neutralizing a key Tesla selling advantage in Europe, helping the German luxury brands win buyers back from the Silicon Valley upstart. (Of course, they'll also need to bring competitive vehicles to market.) \nThat could put pressure on Tesla's sales in Europe. But more generally, it will help the German brands (and Ford) convince more buyers to try an electric vehicle, speeding wider adoption of the technology. \nI won't be surprised if other automakers ( General Motors , for one) join this joint venture, or at least adopt the expanded CCS fast-charging standard in future models. I also won't be surprised if something similar is announced for North America in the near future, perhaps an expansion of the partnership between BMW, VW, and Chargepoint that was announced earlier this year . \nLong story short: We may not yet have reached the tipping point for electric vehicles versus internal combustion, but it's one step closer today. \n10 stocks we like better than Ford \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Ford wasn't one of them!

The company has been investing heavily in self-driving cars, promising to have such a car ready for ride-sharing fleets by 2021. It is currently testing its vehicles in a number of locations across the United States.\n“It is important that we extend our testing to Europe,” said Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager for Automated Driving for Ford of Europe. “Rules of the road vary from country to country here, traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.” \nThe cars will be tested at several of Ford’s existing engineering centers in the United Kingdom and Germany, joining a number of other carmakers who are testing their autonomous vehicles in Europe.",

The company has been investing heavily in self-driving cars, promising to have such a car ready for ride-sharing fleets by 2021. It is currently testing its vehicles in a number of locations across the United States.\n\n“It is important that we extend our testing to Europe,” said Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager for Automated Driving for Ford of Europe. “Rules of the road vary from country to country here, traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.”\n\nThe cars will be tested at several of Ford’s existing engineering centers in the United Kingdom and Germany , joining a number of other...",

Their \"initial target\" is to have 400 charging sites in Europe and the goal is to have thousands in place by 2020.\nThe automakers say the planned network will have power levels of up to 350 kilowatts, faster than the most powerful system currently in service. They didn't give financial details.\nThe aim is to make it easier for electric cars to travel long distances and help make them more appealing to the mass market.",

Earlier reports hint at more significant upgrades on the interior, including higher quality materials and a new design.\"The new Fiesta will be our best expression of Ford - lovable fun, sporty to drive and with an unmatched personality true to the spirit of the iconic small car that has delighted generations of customers for the past 40 years,\" Ford Europe executive VP Jim Farley recently said.Full details and additional pictures will be released later this afternoon. \n ",

For comparison, Tesla's 145-kilowatt chargers can fill a battery to 50 percent in approximately 20 minutes, to 80 percent in about 40 minutes or completely full in around 75 minutes.The joint venture will start with 400 charging stations on the continent, strategically placing the sites to enable long-distance travel on major highways and thoroughfares. The companies expect to have thousands of locations established by 2020.The announcement highlights the ever increasing priority placed on electric vehicles in the coming years. The charging infrastructure will serve planned rivals to the Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Model 3. \n ",

      "text": "The 2017 Ford F150 is Laughably Good The Drive 21 hrs ago Caleb Jacobs / Contributor © Ford The 2017 Ford F150 is Laughably Good First off, let it be said that the full size truck segment is well and alive. Some manufacturers have shifted their focus towards smaller, light duty pickups for the common buyer, leading some to forget about the half-ton class. Ford wants to let you know that it's still their number one priority, as shown here in the 2017 F-150. With capability and comfort abundant, the repeatedly praised pickup continues to build its empire with more livability then you'd think to find anywhere near a worksite. Oh, and the power. Don't forget about the power.\nResearch 2017 ford f-150 See Full Specs See Pricing Not to worry -- Ford won't let you. The F-150 has undergone the first major changes since the introduction of their alumnimum body in 2015. Their premium engine selection, the 3.5L Ecoboost, has been boosted up 10 horsepower and a momentous 50 lb. ft. to bring the numbers to 375 and 470, respectively. This model year also introduces the company's new 10-speed automatic transmission that was co-developed with their unlikely partner, General Motors. And if you have any reason to doubt the twin-turbo V6, the ever-present 5.0L V8 will give you proven reliability with plenty of oomph. As more 2017 F-150's are built, we will see the new powertrain options pop up more frequently. And don't forget about the oncoming Raptor that should turn these figures up to 11.\n© The Drive The Drive Along with the truck's performance, luxury has become standard for the F-150. It trickles down throughout the range, with the Platinum and King Ranch being the stars of the show. Comfort is remarkably exceptional in the lower XL, XLT, and Lariat trim levels as well. Its cockpit provides plenty of space for both the driver and passengers, leaving enough room in the back for the legs and head of construction workers and family members alike. The higher you go on the trim ladder, the more goodies you will get -- those features including power-folding steps as well as massaging seats, like you see in Mercs and Bentleys of today. All of these creature comforts in a crazy, go-like-stink pickup. Go figure!\nTech is largely the same for 2017, and that's a good thing. The rejuvenated SYNC 3 infotainment system is back, providing easy to use controls for navigation, audio, and even climate control in some models. This is a beautifully simple setup that outperforms RAM and Chevrolet in terms of design and accessibility. Adaptive Cruise Control bolsters that next-level concept of convenience along with Blindspot Information and Lane Keep Assist, helping the F-150 achieve a five-star NHTSA safety rating. The new Sync Connect functionality works in tandem with the Ford Pass app so that you can lock the vehicle's doors and even set up scheduled remote starts, just to add a little bit of flair. You won't find a truck that outplays the Ford in technology.\nThis all inclusive package aids the Ford in improving year after year. A new powertrain option here, a convenience feature there, it all adds up to make the F-150 an unstoppable motif in the best-seller winner's circle. 2017's rendition plays on prior years to make up what is one of the most capable vehicles available. After unmeasurable amounts of attention, the details of this truck are what make it so special. We can't wait to see how Ford follows this class-act.\nRelated Video: The 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor is an off-road monster\nClick to expand Replay Video Toy Teslas, Trucks Sport Realistic Details Battery-powered vehicles for kids have become increasingly popular over the years.

      "title": "Ford will begin testing its self-driving cars in Europe in 2017 (F)",
      "text": "Ford \nFord’s self-driving cars are coming to Europe. \nThe Detroit automaker plans to begin testing its autonomous cars in European countries next year, the company announced Tuesday. \nBecause rules of the road, traffic signs, and road layouts differ from country to country in Europe, it's important that the company test in the region, Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager of automated driving at Ford of Europe, said in a press statement. \nFord has a bold vision for its driverless future. \nThe company currently has about 30 self-driving cars in its fleet, but it plans to triple that number in 2017, bringing the total number of cars in its fleet to about 100. \nWhat's more, the company also plans to launch a fleet of autonomous taxis for public use in at least one city in the US by 2021. But, unlike other automakers, Ford’s self-driving cars won't have a steering wheel, gas or brake pedals. \nScreenshot via YouTube \nMost major car companies have said that they are planning to roll out a self-driving car sometime during the next five years, but the levels of autonomy vary. Many car companies have committed to semi-autonomous systems that enable the car to be completely autonomous in certain driving situations, but that still have a steering wheels so that the driver can take back control of the vehicle when needed. \nHowever, Ford wants to make its cars fully autonomous because it sees these semi-autonomous systems as a possible liability. This is because people begin to trust the systems too much and fail to re-engage control of the vehicle when needed. \n“We are not in a race to be first, but we are in a race to do the right thing, which is why we are building on more than ten years of experience on how to responsibly deliver a ride service that is fully autonomous that does not require a driver to re-engage,” Ken Washington, vice president of advanced research and engineering, told Business Insider during an interview in August. \n“Our research has led us to understand that it [re-engagement] is very difficult to do and we don’t know how to enable that, so that is what led us to pursuing a full level four autonomous vehicle and this re-engagement issue goes away,” Washington said.",

      "text": "Party Time: All-New 2018 Ford Fiesta Breaks Cover Early Car and Driver 5 hrs ago jcapparella © jcapparella Party Time: All-New 2018 Ford Fiesta Breaks Cover Early Here's our first look at the all-new 2018 Ford Fiesta subcompact, courtesy of Ford of Europe's Twitter account. The redesigned hatchback won't make its official debut until later today, so we don't have details, but the photo does show the Fiesta's new design, at least in its Europe-spec form.\nWith headlights and a grille shape that largely mimic the bigger Focus, the Fiesta's face doesn't come as too much of a surprise. Its stance is wider and lower compared with the current Fiesta, and the side surfacing appears a bit more refined. The four-door hatch pictured above has the sporty ST Line trim package that Europeans get, with a body kit and upsized wheels, but it isn't the full-blown Fiesta ST hot hatch that we're holding out for. That performance-oriented Fiesta is likely to come out a few months later than the standard model.\nAll Fiestas will ride on the same B platform as the outgoing model and are expected to use updated versions of the same 1.6-liter four-cylinder, 1.0-liter turbo three-cylinder, and 1.6-liter turbo four-cylinder engines of the current car. Rather than a mechanical overhaul, Ford has made revisions to focus on improving interior quality and increasing the level of available technology.\nResearch ford fiesta See All Model Years See Pricing We'll get a lot more information on the new Fiesta later today, and U.S.-specific details should follow the European model's debut by a few months. The Fiesta is expected to arrive on our shores late next year as a 2018 model, with the Fiesta ST to follow shortly after that.\nBREAKING NEWS: Feast your eyes on the first ever photos of the Next Generation #FordFiesta ST-Line #GoFurther pic.twitter.com/kYyDRtdrcy\n— Ford in Europe (@FordEu) November 29, 2016\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

Hokies notes: All-ACC thoughts, a Stroman update and Ford's homecoming of sorts BY ANDY BITTER ( … ) SHABAN ATHUMAN | Special to The Roanoke Times \nVirginia Tech quarterback Jerod Evans celebrates after scoring a touchdown during Saturday’s game against Virginia. \nToday was the Hokies' regular Monday press conference. I wrote about Virginia Tech's players enjoying the win against Virginia -- and doing the bar scene with the Commonwealth Cup like usual -- but turning the page rather quickly with Clemson looming. \nIn other news, linebacker Andrew Motuapuaka earned ACC linebacker of the week honors after finishing with six tackles, an interception and a 70-yard fumble return for a touchdowns last week against UVa. \nBut there were more notes and quotes to come out of Monday. \n1. The media's All-ACC teams came out and, as usual, Virginia Tech didn't have a lot of first-team guys. \nDefensive tackle Woody Baron , in fact, was the only first-teamer for the Hokies. Baron's inclusion makes sense, since his 17.5 tackles for a loss are 5.5 more than any interior lineman in the Power 5 conferences. It's the most for a defensive tackle at Tech since J.C. Price had 23 in an All-American season in 1995. \nAll of Tech's selections are: 1st: Baron 2nd: WR Isaiah Ford , LB Tremaine Edmunds 3rd: TE Bucky Hodges , OT Jonathan McLaughlin , OG Augie Conte , K Joey Slye , Motuapuaka and CB Greg Stroman HM: OG Wyatt Teller , DE Ken Ekanem , S Chuck Clark , S Terrell Edmunds \nMy ballot had Baron, Ford and Terrell Edmunds on the first team. UNC's Ryan Switzer was the media's third WR on the first team, narrowly over Ford. He had more yards and many more receptions, considering how many short passes he catches, but Ford's yards per catch and touchdown totals were high enough, in my opinion, to warrant first-team selection. I thought Terrell had one of the best seasons of any Hokies defender. \nREAD: Virginia's QB rotation plan falls flat in blowout loss to Hokies \nMy second team included Tremaine Edmunds and my third team Jerod Evans (more on that in a second) and Slye. I did not have Hodges on my team, mostly because the Hokies and ACC mislabeled him as a tight end. Even though that's his past and future position, he's not played a lick of it this year. If he'd been accurately listed as a wide receiver, I'd probably have put him on my third team. (The voting setup does not allow write-ins.) \nEkanem did OK this year, even with the injury, but defensive end is a loaded position. Motuapuaka just missed the cut on my list. Stroman probably would have made my ballot if he hadn't missed three games late in the year. I honestly didn't think any of Tech's offensive linemen played that great this year, although I'd at least have put Teller, penalties and all, ahead of Conte and McLaughlin. \n2. Evans got snubbed. \nUsually, you can't have too much of a beef with the picks. However, Evans, who has been the team's most valuable offensive player (and perhaps overall), has reason to be a little miffed. \nHe didn't even get the 20 points necessary for an honorable mention. You get three points for a first-team vote, two for second and one for third. We're told North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky , the media's third-team pick behind Louisville's Lamar Jackson and Clemson's Deshaun Watson , got 17 third-place votes and six second-team votes, giving him 29 points. Evans got only 16 third-team votes, giving him 16 points. \nA look at the stats for the two tells me you could make a pretty good case to flip those two. Trubisky threw for 3,468 yards, with 28 touchdowns to four interceptions, along with 270 rushing yards and five more scores. Evans threw for 3,045 yards, 26 touchdowns to five interceptions, and ran for a team-best 713 yards and eight touchdowns. \nHe also played infinitely better in a head-to-head meeting in the hurricane and was an integral reason Virginia Tech won the Coastal Division. That's not to say Trubisky is a bad choice -- quarterbacks is a loaded position this year in the ACC -- just that I thought the tally might be a touch closer than it was. (Evans not getting an HM nod is more due to there being a clear-cut 1 and 2 than anything.) \n3. Stroman sounds like he'll probably give it a go this Saturday. \nThe cornerback/punt returner has missed the last three games since spraining his ankle on a punt return against Duke. Fuente said he could have gone against UVa -- he was listed as probable, dressed and even went through warmups -- but didn't play. \nREAD: UVa hoops using committee approach to fill post void \n\"It’s the same as it was with Nigel [ Williams ],\" Fuente said. \"You guys asked me what it was with Nigel when he wasn’t on the injury report. I don’t remember what game it was. That’s because he was healthy and ready to play whatever game that was. \n\"The same thing for Greg this week. I just didn’t use him. We felt like that was the best for the long-term benefit of the team and the person that they were clear. Same thing with Greg now. We’ll go out and practice Tuesday and hopefully everything is fine.\" \n4. Watson's running ability is something to worry about for the Hokies. \nWatson hasn't run the ball nearly as much as he did last year, when he racked up 1,105 yards and 12 touchdowns. He's at 444 and four touchdowns this year, although the ability is still there. \nVirginia Tech has struggled at stopping running quarterbacks. The Hokies, in fact, are 0-10 the last 10 times the opposing quarterback goes over 100 rushing yards. \n\"It’s always been a problem, I’m not going to lie,\" Ekanem said. \"What we have to do is, we’re a gap defense. We have to do a good job of controlling our gaps. As long as everyone executes, we’ll shut him down. We know Deshaun Watson is a great player, very capable of making plays. He’s not a Heisman hopeful for nothing. We know he’s bound to make some plays here and there, so we’ve just kind of got to buckle down and do our best at executing and controlling our gaps.” \nFuente doesn't see Tech's struggles there as schematic. \"There’s no schematic issue,\" he said. \"It’s difficult to defend a guy who can run and throw the ball. Deshaun’s no different. He’s extremely athletic, maybe the best athlete on the field. On top of the fact that he’s not just a guy that throws the ball. He’s a passer. He goes through progressions. Everybody has issues with those guys that can move around and throw the ball.\" Said Ekanem: “I hope that I introduce myself to him pretty early. Hopefully I throw him off his game a little bit if we show pressure and get to him quick, get him out of his element.\" \n5. Ford is familiar with what's now called Camping World Stadium. \nBarring a trip to the TaxSlayer Bowl -- which is in play this year -- Orlando is about as close to a homecoming as the Jacksonville native is going to get, a little over a two-hour drive away from home. \nFord has played at the revamped stadium, which used to be called the Florida Citrus Bowl. His Trinity Christian high school team twice played in state title games there. It won both times. \n\"My ninth-grade year and my 12th-grade year we played there,\" Ford said. \"I played against a couple of their wideouts in 7-on-7. Nothing in high school football or anything like that, but [Clemson's] Deon Cain , I played with those guys and a couple of those players.” \nWith such a close venue for his family and friends to travel to, Ford is desperately seeking tickets from his teammates. He doesn't have a target number in mind. Just as many as possible. \n\"To get as many people possible there would be really special,\" he said. \nAndy Bitter writes for the Roanoke Times. Tags",

      "title": "5 major automakers join forces to deploy 400 ultra-fast (350 kW) charging stations for electric vehicles in Europe",
      "text": "Reddit \nBMW, Daimler’s Mercedes, Ford, and Volkswagen’s Audi and Porsche announced today that they are creating a joint-venture with the goal of a “quick build-up of a sizable number of stations in order to enable long-range travel for battery electric vehicle drivers.” \nThe new venture is similar to the Ultra E project announced earlier this year to deploy 25 new charging station for electric vehicles along the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) , but it’s apparently a separate and much more ambitious project to deploy 400 stations across Europe. \nThe new network will be based on Combined Charging System (CCS) standard technology and each station will feature not only both level 2 AC chargers and level 3 DC chargers, but also the new ” ultra-fast high-powered chargers” and, like the ones of the Ultra E project, they will be able to deliver up to 350 kW – more than twice the capacity of the current best charger, Tesla’s Supercharger at 145 kW. \n400 sites are apparently just the “initial target” of the joint-venture and deployment will start in 2017. \nThe automakers confirmed that every vehicle using the CCS standard will be able to use the new network – meaning that they will create an independent network. It reflects recent comments made by Porsche executives regarding the deployment of their new 800 volts charging system being compatible with other vehicles , like Tesla’s. \nTesla currently has just over 260 Supercharger stations in Europe, but it plans to almost double that number before the Model 3 arrives in Europe in 2018. Some good healthy competition in charging station deployment is likely to accelerate adoption. \nEach Automaker has released a statement about the announcement of the joint-venture: \nBMW Group “This high-power charging network provides motorists with another strong argument to move towards electric mobility,” says Harald Krüger, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “The BMW Group has initiated numerous public charging infrastructure projects over the last years. The joint project is another major milestone clearly demonstrating that competitors are combining forces to ramp-up e-mobility.” \nDaimler AG “The breakthrough of e-mobility requires two things: convincing vehicles and a comprehensive charging infrastructure. With our new brand EQ, we are launching our electric product offensive: by 2025, our portfolio will include more than ten fully electric passenger cars. Together with our partners, we are now installing the highest-powered charging infrastructure in Europe,” says Dr. Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars. “The availability of high-power stations allows long-distance e-mobility for the first time and will convince more and more customers to opt for an electric vehicle.” \nFord Motor Company “A reliable, ultra-fast charging infrastructure is important for mass consumer adoption and has the potential to transform the possibilities for electric driving,” says Mark Fields, president and CEO, Ford Motor Company. “Ford is committed to developing vehicles and technologies that make people’s lives better, and this charging network will make it easier and more practical for customers across Europe to own electrified vehicles.” \nAUDI AG “We intend to create a network that allows our customers on long-distance trips to use a coffee break for recharging,” says Rupert Stadler, Chairman of the Board of Management of AUDI AG . “Reliable fast charging services are a key factor for drivers to choose an electric vehicle. With this cooperation we want to boost a broader market adoption of e-mobility and speed up the shift towards emission-free driving.” \nPorsche AG “There are two decisive aspects for us: ultra-fast charging and placing the charging stations at the right positions”, says Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche AG . “Together, these two factors enable us to travel in an all-electrically powered car as in a conventional combustion engine vehicle. As automobile manufacturer, we actively shape our future, not only by developing all-electrically powered vehicles but by building up the necessary infrastructure as well.” Guides",

      "text": "Enlarge / Evolution of CCS charging technology for EVs toward 350 kW. Porsche Several automakers have agreed to form a joint venture in Europe to build roughly 400 “ultra-fast” charging sites along highways on the continent to make long distance travel in electric cars more feasible. BMW, Volkswagen Group, Ford, and Daimler are heading up the venture, along with Audi and Porsche—both divisions of VW Group.\nIn a press release today, the automakers said the charging stations would deliver 350 kW over a DC charging network, which is set to “significantly reduce charging time compared to available systems.” For comparison, Tesla’s supercharging stations deliver 120 kW and can fill a Tesla up to 170 miles of range in 30 minutes.\nThe European network will use the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard that is compatible with current and future electric vehicles from all the joint venture companies as well as Fiat-Chrysler and Hyundai.\nConstruction on these sites is planned to start in 2017 and should be completed by 2020, the companies said. The group added that “the charging experience is expected to evolve to be as convenient as refueling at conventional gas stations.”\nDaimler Chairman of the Board of Management Dr. Dieter Zetsche said that by 2025, the company will be producing “more than 10 fully electric passenger cars.” Other automakers are expected to expand their electric vehicle output over the next five to 10 years as well. Porsche , Audi , and Volkswagen all announced electric cars that will have ranges between 250 and 310 miles this year, and BMW’s i6 electric crossover , due in 2020, will also have a 300 mile range. The automakers have generally claimed that their upcoming cars will be able to charge quickly, and this infrastructure buildout will make that claim a real possibility.\nOther auto companies and regional partners will be encouraged to join the network buildout, and the joint venture is still subject to approval in “various jurisdictions.”\nIn the US, the Department of Energy reports 1,881 DC fast-charging stations and 4,109 charging outlets for electric cars. But in September, ChargePoint, BMW, and Volkswagen announced that they would be building 95 fast-charging DC networks along two high-traffic corridors—one from San Diego, California, to Portland, Oregon, and another from Boston, Massachusetts to Washington, DC.\nIn early November, the Obama administration and the Department of Transportation (DOT) designated 48 corridors across the US for which the DOT will actively put up signage and support the build out of electric vehicle charging stations, backed by $4.5 billion in loan guarantees to companies that agree to build out those stations. Of course with the administrative transition, it's unclear whether those corridors will be a priority over the next four years.\nListing image by Porsche",

      "text": "  3:48 pm Just in time for the gift-giving season, Ford has teamed up with Lego to offer miniature versions of the Le Mans winning GT40 and GT race cars.In addition to being a neat stocking stuffer for the young-at-heart gear head, the mini race cars are intended to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the original Ford GT40's win at Le Mans. The set also commemorates Ford's 2016 Le Mans win with its reborn GT race car.The set includes both race cars, plus racing driver minifigures, checkered flag and trophy. Champagne is not included. \"Many people in my team grew up with the legend of Ford's history-making 1966 victory - and experienced the excitement of building and design for the first time through LEGO bricks,\" said Dave Pericak, global director, Ford Performance. \"This kit is a powerful way to tell our Le Mans story, and will hopefully inspire the race drivers, engineers, and designers of the future.\"The kit was designed by Lego design lead Craig Callum, who started his career as an automotive designer and races Fords in his spare time. \n ",

      "text": "Most Expensive American Car: 1968 Ford GT40 Gulf/Mirage Lightweight Racer Price: $11,000,000 One of just 107 examples, the Ford GT40 is considered America’s most successful foray into European racing, emerging out of a grudge match between Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari following a failed acquisition of Ferrari by Ford. Most Expensive Movie Prop: Aston Martin DB5, “Goldfinger” and “Thunderball” Price: $4,600,000 The most iconic car in the history of spy films, making a reappearance in 2012’s “Skyfall”, the DB5 is the quintessential Bond car. This particular model, chassis number DB5/1486/R, was the car primarily used for driving shots and was as a result referred to as the “Road Car” , making appearances as the preferred method of transport for Sean Connery in both “Goldfinger” and “Thunderball.” Most Expensive Watch: Henry Graves ‘Supercomplication’, by Patek Phillips Price: $24,000,000 One of the most complicated watches ever created, and by far the most complex design conceived without computer assistance. It took three years to design the watch, and another five years to manufacture it, before being delivered to Graves in 1933. The Supercomplication had long been the world’s most complicated timepiece ever assembled with a total of 24 different functions, including Westminster chimes, a perpetual calendar, sunrise and sunset times, and a celestial map of New York as seen from the Graves’s apartment on New York’s Fifth Avenue, and contains 920 individual parts. Most Expensive Painting: “Nafea Faa Ipoipo”, Paul Gauguin Price: $300,000,000 Part of an extremely valuable collection assembled by the grandfather of retired Sotheby’s executive Rudolf Staechlin, this piece was painted by famed French Impressionist Gauguin in 1892 during his first visit to Tahiti, aged 43-44, where he travelled to escape “everything that is artificial and conventional” in Europe. Most Expensive Car: 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Price: $34,650,000 Considered the dominant race cars of the mid-1960’s, just 36 examples of the Ferrari GTO rolled out of the factory (39 if you include those with slight variations) in the production run between 1962 and 1964. Most Expensive Motorcycle: “Easy Rider” Chopper Price: $1,350,000 This Harley-Davidson was a pivotal piece in the 1969 film “Easy Rider”, a counterculture classic. Sold by California-based auction company Profiles in History in 2014, this piece of movie memorabilia maintains the title of the most valuable motorcycle in existence. Most Expensive Book/Manuscript: Codex Leicester (Codex Hammer), Leonardo Da Vinci Price: $30,800,000 Codex Leicester was written around 1508, and is one of 30 or so similar books produced by Da Vinci across his lifetime. Within the Codex Leicester’s 72 loose pages are around 300 notes and detailed drawings rendered in chalk and brown ink, alongside Leonardo’s famed ‘mirror writing’. All of these sketches are based around a common theme: water and how it moved. Codex Leicester’s historical importance is further bolstered by the fact that Da Vinci is thought to have used its contents as research to paint the background of his masterwork, the Mona Lisa. Most Expensive Piece of Paper Currency: 1890 United States Small Seal $1000 Treasury Note Price: $3,290,000 This piece, the only copy in private hands, is referred to as the “Grand Watermelon” design due to the unusual resemblance of the zeroes on the reverse of the note to watermelons. The piece was such an unusual issue when printed, numbering less than 200 original pieces, that the selection of historical figures to put on the front of the bill was limited from Presidents and Founding Fathers to U.S. Civil War general George Meade, commanding officer of the victorious Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, but a figure that was constantly overshadowed by the General in Chief, and future President, Ulysses S. Grant. The note’s rarity, high denomination, and condition grade led to the record-setting sale by Heritage Auctions in early 2014. Most Expensive Pistol or Pistol Set: Pair of Steel-Mounted “Saddle” Pistols owned by George Washington Price: $1,986,000 This pair of pistols, marked by Jacob Walster, were owned by President George Washington during America’s Revolutionary War. Most Expensive Antiquity: The Guennol Lioness Price: $57,161,000 Diminutive in size, but monumental in conception, The Guennol Lioness is of Elamite origin and is thought to have been made between 3000 and 2800 BCE—the same period in which writing systems were being developed, the wheel was being invented, and cities were beginning to rise in the region of ancient Mesopotamia. Most Expensive Sculpture: “L’homme au doigt”, Alberto Giacometti Price: $141,300,000 Considered one of the most important sculptors in history, with three of his works holding positions on the top ten most valuable pieces of art of all time, Giacometti is in a category all his own, called both a Surrealist and a Formalist, and this piece (translated to “Man pointing” or “Pointing Man”) is considered to be his most iconic and evocative sculpture. Most Expensive Piece of Furniture: The Badminton Cabinet Price: $36,662,106 This piece is not actually used for the sport of Badminton in any way, but draws its name from the home of the Dukes of Beaufort, for whom it was made. The Badminton Cabinet was made for Henry Somerset, 3rd Duke of Beaufort, by the Grand Ducal workshops in Florence, from 1720-1732, under the supervision of the Foggini family. The Cabinet incorporates an amazing wealth of materials, from lapis lazuli, agate and Sicilian red and green jasper, to chalcedony and amethyst quartz. It was purchased at a Christie’s auction in 2004 by Dr. Johan Kraeftner, Director of the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna, on behalf of Prinz Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein for the same museum. Most Expensive Private Airplane/Jet: Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal’s Airbus A380 Price: $150,000,000 While the Airbus is conventionally a commercial airliner, when you’re a Saudi prince worth about $22 billion, you can afford to make it your own. Despite something of a scandal regarding the Prince’s purchase of the plane, including defaults on payments to Airbus and a rather quick resale, the aircraft still retains the spot as the most valuable plane bought privately. Most Expensive Bottle of Champagne: Goût de Diamants (Taste of Diamonds) Limited Edition Price: $1,867,000 Made from 100% Grand Cru grapes, Goût de Diamants is produced at the 8-hectare, family-owned, Champagne Chapuy in Oger, and some varieties are aged for a minimum of 40 months. But don’t go looking for this in stores, you won’t find it. This brand sells exclusively to high-end bars, restaurants, hotels, and private clients. Each bottle of Goût de Diamants is adorned with a brilliant cut Swarovski crystal in the centre of a diamond-shaped pewter design resembling the Superman logo. Most Expensive Bottle of Wine: Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon 1992 Price: $500,000 Sold in 2000, a six-liter bottle of Screaming Eagle Cabernet currently holds the unofficial title of most expensive bottle of wine ever sold at auction. It went under the hammer at a charity wine auction in Napa for the staggering sum of $500,000, and was reported to have been purchased by Chase Bailey, a former Cisco Systems executive. Most Expensive Bladed Weapon: Napoleon Bonaparte’s Marengo Cavalry Saber Price: $6,500,000 The most expensive antique weapon to have ever sold at auction is a gold encrusted sword used by Napoleon Bonaparte in battle around 200 years ago. The 32-inch sword brought 4.8m ($6.5m) against a 1.2m pre-sale estimate at an Osenat auction in Fontainebleau, France in 2007. Napoleon used the sword at the Battle of Marengo in 1800 to take control of northern Italy from Austria. Most Expensive House: Antilia Price: $500,000,000 – $700,000,000 Though not a home in the traditional sense, Antilia is the name given to the residence of Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man (at ~$23,000,000,000 net worth), who spent an unspecified amount, projected to conservatively be between $500,000,000 – $700,000,000, constructing this 27-story, 400,000 square-foot monolith in Mumbai, India. Containing, six underground parking floors (with space for 168 cars), three helicopter pads, a spa, terraced gardens, a ballroom, a 50-seat theater, and requiring a 600-person staff to maintain, Antilia is actually claimed to have risen in value to the $1,000,000,000 mark as the result of rising property values in south Mumbai. Most Expensive Substance by Weight: Californium Price: $27,000,000/gram Californium, which does not occur naturally except in very small quantities, can only be synthesized at a few locations, including the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (US) and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (Russia). Highly radioactive and unstable, some consider it a strong candidate for the development of nuclear fission. Most Expensive Movie Poster: 1931 “Metropolis”, International Version Price: $690,000 – $1,200,000 One of four copies of the international version of this poster believed to exist, advertising Fritz Lang’s influential science fiction film about a highly stylized futuristic city where a beautiful and cultured utopia exists above a bleak underworld populated by mistreated workers, was auctioned by the United States Bankruptcy Court in 2012. Of the remaining three examples of this, the “crown jewel of the poster world”, only one is in private hands (anonymously held, though popularly believed to be Leonardo DiCaprio), the other two residing in the United States Museum of Modern Art and the Austrian National Library.

      "text": "Be part of something big Ford Mustang Black Shadow and Blue Special Editions Hide press release Show press release \nFord today unveiled two special edition Ford Mustang models with unique styling and premium specification for customers in Europe. \nThe new Ford Mustang Black Shadow Edition offers special black 19-inch alloys wheels and unique black body details. \nThe distinctive Ford Mustang Blue Edition model channels the spirit of classic Ford Mustang models that featured eye-catching “Grabber” colours, offering a Grabber Blue body with sporty body stripes. \nBoth models are available in fastback bodystyle and offer a high-specification that includes heated and cooled seats, Ford’s SYNC 3 communications and entertainment system with navigation, and a premium audio system. \n“The Ford Mustang has no trouble standing out on European roads, and with the new Ford Mustang Black Shadow Edition and Blue Edition models, Mustang drivers will be turning even more heads,” said Roelant de Waard, vice president, Marketing, Sales & Service, Ford of Europe. “Special edition Ford Mustangs have been an important part of the Mustang story for more than 50 years, and now customers in Europe can play their own part in the iconic car’s rich special edition history.” \nMustang Black Shadow Edition The Ford Mustang Black Shadow Edition will be available to order with Ford’s 421 PS 5.0-litre V8 engine and six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission from January 2017. \nOffered in four body colour options – Platinum White, Triple Yellow, Race Red and Grabber Blue – the Ford Mustang Black Shadow Edition features unique bodystyling that includes a black Pony emblem for the GT grille; exclusive black 19-inch Y-spoke alloy wheels; dissolve-effect black stripes along the prominent bonnet bulge ridges and across the body-side between the lower wheel arches; and black 5.0-litre badges on the front wings. \nThe high specification limited edition model delivers parking sensors, heated and cooled front seats, a premium ShakerPro audio system with 12-speakers and a powerful 8-inch boot-mounted subwoofer, and a premium black leather interior with prominent instrument panel stitching and matching door inserts.* \nMustang Blue Edition Ford’s distinctive Grabber colours – named for their ability to grab attention – were first introduced for the 1969 Shelby GT350 and GT500 models. \nSince then Ford has periodically offered the Mustang in more than 20 different Grabber colours including Grabber Orange, Grabber Yellow and Grabber Lime – with Grabber-coloured models historically becoming of special interest to collectors. \nThe new Ford Mustang Blue Edition is available to order now with either Ford’s 421 PS 5.0-litre V8 or the more fuel-efficient 317 PS 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine and six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, and delivers the eye-catching Grabber Blue exterior body colour enhanced with central dissolve-effect black bonnet and roof stripes, and black 19-inch multi-spoke alloys wheels. \nBoth new special edition models feature Ford’s SYNC 3 system with 8-inch touchscreen, that enables drivers to locate nearby cafés, petrol stations or car parks, and find train stations, airports, and hotels simply by pushing a button and saying “I need a coffee,” “I need petrol,” and “I need to park.” About this article",

      "text": "Ford \nFord’s self-driving cars are coming to Europe. \nThe Detroit automaker plans to begin testing its autonomous cars in European countries next year, the company announced Tuesday. \nBecause rules of the road, traffic signs, and road layouts differ from country to country in Europe, it's important that the company test in the region, Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager of automated driving at Ford of Europe, said in a press statement. \nFord has a bold vision for its driverless future. \nThe company currently has about 30 self-driving cars in its fleet, but it plans to triple that number in 2017, bringing the total number of cars in its fleet to about 100. \nWhat's more, the company also plans to launch a fleet of autonomous taxis for public use in at least one city in the US by 2021. But, unlike other automakers, Ford’s self-driving cars won't have a steering wheel, gas or brake pedals. \nScreenshot via YouTube \nMost major car companies have said that they are planning to roll out a self-driving car sometime during the next five years, but the levels of autonomy vary. Many car companies have committed to semi-autonomous systems that enable the car to be completely autonomous in certain driving situations, but that still have a steering wheels so that the driver can take back control of the vehicle when needed. \nHowever, Ford wants to make its cars fully autonomous because it sees these semi-autonomous systems as a possible liability. This is because people begin to trust the systems too much and fail to re-engage control of the vehicle when needed. \n“We are not in a race to be first, but we are in a race to do the right thing, which is why we are building on more than ten years of experience on how to responsibly deliver a ride service that is fully autonomous that does not require a driver to re-engage,” Ken Washington, vice president of advanced research and engineering, told Business Insider during an interview in August. \n“Our research has led us to understand that it [re-engagement] is very difficult to do and we don’t know how to enable that, so that is what led us to pursuing a full level four autonomous vehicle and this re-engagement issue goes away,” Washington said.",

      "text": "‘Westworld’ finale spoilers: Ford, Dolores look towards the future in ‘The Bicameral Mind’   \nOver the weekend, we pondered over why “ Westworld ” had not yet released the official synopsis for the finale entitled “The Bicameral Mind,” and one of our theories on the matter was that maybe HBO had something in there that potentially spoiled the events that came in Sunday night’s new episode. \nAfter seeing the official synopsis for this episode below, we’re starting to think a little bit differently that it may have just been due to the Thanksgiving holiday: “Ford (Anthony Hopkins) unveils his bold new narrative; Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) embraces her identity; Maeve (Thandie Newton) sets her plan in motion.” \nIs there anything in there that constitutes a huge spoiler? Not exactly. Mostly, this is where you likely anticipated to see this story go as we move further and further into the series’ run. With Dolores, for example, it always felt as though we were going to arrive at a point where she could make a big play in the realm of her persona and purpose. Meanwhile, Ford was not going to sit idly by in the midst of great change, and Maeve was going to be an outstanding force to be reckoned with. This is a fine example of a synopsis that says very little, but still somehow figures out a way to generate excitement. In between this and the promo that is already out there for this episode, it definitely feels as though there is still quite a bit to look forward to in regards to the final episode. \nWhat we have already learned is that there will reportedly be an element of closure to the finale, and that season 2 will contain its own story and its own themes. Maybe it’ll be interconnected more than an “American Horror Story” season, but we don’t expect every thread this season to stay dangling entering the hiatus. \nStay tuned — we’ll have further news on “Westworld” before the finale airs.

      "text": "4831 Views \nHere's a press release about 2017 Speed Champions: Designed to Inspire Tomorrow’s Racing Drivers, Engineers and Designers – Ford’s Le Mans Victories in LEGO® Bricks Ford race cars that won 1966 and 2016 Le Mans 24 Hours will be available as part of the exclusive LEGO® Speed Champions range of models New kit brings to life iconic Ford GT40 and today’s Ford GT race car. Minifigures, chequered flag and trophy will help to bring famous victories to life again and again. Designing the exclusive kit was a “dream project” for LEGO design lead Craig Callum, a former car designer who races Fords in his spare time \nCOLOGNE, Germany, Nov. 29, 2016 – It’s a gift 50 years in the making that could set your child on the path to becoming a racing legend. The iconic Ford GT40 and new Ford GT that won Le Mans 24 Hours in 1966 and 2016 are being brought to life in LEGO® bricks. \nThe new LEGO Speed Champions set will include both cars as well as racing driver minifigures, a chequered flag and even a trophy to make it easy to recreate those history-making victories. \n“Many people in my team grew up with the legend of Ford’s history-making 1966 victory – and experienced the excitement of building and design for the first time through LEGO bricks,” said Dave Pericak, global director, Ford Performance. “This kit is a powerful way to tell our Le Mans story, and will hopefully inspire the race drivers, engineers, and designers of the future.” \nFord won at Le Mans earlier this year after returning to the scene of what was a historic 1-2-3 clean sweep 50 years previously. The LEGO Group worked closely with Ford’s design and licensing teams on every detail of the 1966 winning car, and the new Ford GT race car. \n“This was a dream project – with a lot of pressure. The Ford GT40 is one of the most iconic race cars of all time, and the new Ford GT is just incredible,” said Craig Callum, head of design, LEGO Speed Champions. “Designed for children, but with grown-ups fans in mind too, we know these models will be closely scrutinized for authenticity.” \nCallum, who in his spare time races a Ford Model A hot-rod, and started out as a designer of full-sized cars, helped develop ten prototypes before the final versions of each model were selected, all created from existing LEGO bricks. \nYou can watch Callum assemble the new kit in record time (at least you would be able to if it hadn't been deleted from YouTube...) \nThe new 2016 Ford GT and 1966 Ford GT40 set will be available to order at LEGO.com/shop from March 1, 2017, with a recommended retail price of €34.99 (£29.99). A Ford Mustang set is on sale now, alongside a Ford F 150 Raptor with trailer and Ford Model A hot rod. \n18 likes",

      "text": "Cologne (Germany) (AFP) - The head of Ford in Europe demanded a fair deal from Britain over Brexit on Tuesday, saying it should not be disadvantaged in any rush to secure a stable footing. The comments from Jim Farley follow apparent assurances Nissan received from the British government in October over the future of the Japanese company's Sunderland plant.\nIn an interview with AFP, Farley described Brexit as \"a significant headwind\" but said his team was \"staying very close to the British government\" to avoid losing ground.\n\"Free trade is the essence of our industrial infrastructure in Europe and we will fight for our employees,\" he said before alluding to the apparent deal Nissan made with British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\"At Ford, we think being the biggest player in the market there, that it's quite important for the industry to have an aligned position. We will make sure that Ford is not disadvantaged in the UK.\"\nTo contain the immediate impact of the British electorate's vote in favour of leaving the European Union, Ford has increased its prices and reduced inventories.\nNissan's decision to go ahead with the new Qashqai sport utility vehicle and four-wheel-drive X-Trail model in Sunderland eased concerns about Brexit's impact on British industry.\nBut business minister Greg Clark caused an uproar after confirming that the government made several assurances to Nissan before the announcement.\nHe has refused to reveal the letter detailing what was pledged.",

      "text": "See More Leading Ladies -- Then & Now! \nCarrie Fisher and Harrison Ford had more than just on-screen chemistry! \nThe \"Star Wars\" actress appears on Tuesday's \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" where she dishes about her \"infatuation\" with Ford. \nIn Fisher's new memoir, \"The Princess Diarist,\" Carrie says she and her co-star got intimate while working together on the set of the 1977 classic. \n\"I was in infatuation,\" she tells Ellen in the sneak peek. \nThough Harrison was married at the time, Carrie says they were free to do as they pleased ... as long as the movie got made. \n\"No one told me about location rules, or lack of rules,\" she continues. \"But you can do whatever you want, as long as you film the movie.\" \nFisher likewise says that, just like the public, the cast and crew were in the dark about their romance. \n\"I told other stuff to distract people so they wouldn't figure it out,\" the 60-year-old confesses. \"No one thought it was happening at the time ... I don't even know if he did!\" \nThe \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" star has yet to comment on Fisher's relationship revelation. \nWhat do you think about Carrie's comments?

      "text": "Reprints \nA group of major automakers have inked a memorandum of understanding to develop hundreds — and eventually \"thousands\" — of electric-vehicle charging stations in Europe. By making long-distance travel easier, the carmakers hope to broaden consumer adoption of EVs. \nBMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor ( F ) and Volkswagen Group ( VLKAY ) signed a memorandum of understanding, according to a press release from BMW, with development slated to begin next year on an initial build of 400 sites. \nThe charging stations will be \"significantly faster\" than those currently on the market, said the companies, and a successful rollout of the plan would mean that by 2020, Europe-based electric-car drivers should be able to stop by \"thousands of high-powered charging points\" for a quick recharge. \n\"A reliable, ultrafast charging infrastructure is important for mass consumer adoption and has the potential to transform the possibilities for electric driving,\" said Ford CEO Mark Fields in the statement. \nThat echoes his remarks at the Los Angeles Auto Show two weeks ago, where Fields emphasized not the latest Ford vehicles but a partnership with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and mayors worldwide to develop transit solutions in metropolitan areas. IBD'S TAKE : With automakers focusing on smart-auto tech, much of the value-add, and profits, will be under the hood. Maker of driver-assistance systems Mobileye reported better-than-expected earnings earlier in the month. \nEase of access to charging stations is a key factor for many mulling an electric vehicle purchase. \nIn June, Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) was said to be in talks with an East Coast chain of gas stations regarding the installation of Supercharger stations. \nBut it's not clear if potential EV buyers may be put off by Tesla's latest decision to charge new Tesla owners \"a small fee\" for use of its charging stations. Previously, new owners had been allowed four years of free charging. \nTesla shares fell 3.3% to 189.57 in the stock market today , continuing to find resistance at the 50-day line. Ford closed unchanged while Volkswagen fell 0.3%. \nSeparately, driver-assistance systems maker Mobileye ( MBLY ) and auto parts giant Delphi ( DLPH ) said Tuesday they will use Intel ( INTC ) chips in their previously announced plans for a turnkey autonomous driving system by 2019. Intel and Mobileye are already working with BMW on an autonomous car. \nMobileye shares slid 2.4% as it too finds resistance at the 50-day line. Delphi fell 4.3% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to sell, saying electric cars will hurt its profits. Intel eased 0.6%. \nRELATED :",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo \n\nThe head of Ford in Europe demanded a fair deal from Britain over Brexit on Tuesday, saying it should not be disadvantaged in any rush to secure a stable footing.\nThe comments from Jim Farley follow apparent assurances Nissan received from the British government in October over the future of the Japanese company's Sunderland plant.\nIn an interview with AFP, Farley described Brexit as \"a significant headwind\" but said his team was \"staying very close to the British government\" to avoid losing ground.\n\"Free trade is the essence of our industrial infrastructure in Europe and we will fight for our employees,\" he said before alluding to the apparent deal Nissan made with British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\"At Ford, we think being the biggest player in the market there, that it's quite important for the industry to have an aligned position. We will make sure that Ford is not disadvantaged in the UK.\"\nTo contain the immediate impact of the British electorate's vote in favour of leaving the European Union, Ford has increased its prices and reduced inventories.\nNissan's decision to go ahead with the new Qashqai sport utility vehicle and four-wheel-drive X-Trail model in Sunderland eased concerns about Brexit's impact on British industry.\nBut business minister Greg Clark caused an uproar after confirming that the government made several assurances to Nissan before the announcement. \nHe has refused to reveal the letter detailing what was pledged.",

      "text": "By Judy Harrison , BDN Staff  15 p.m. \nPORTLAND, Maine — The Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Tuesday sent back to the Business and Consumer Court the question of how much the Ford Motor Co. owes Darling’s Ford in damages in a 10-year dispute over a franchise modification. \nDamages of nearly $155,000 were awarded in 2014, but that only covered payments from Ford to Darling’s for a 270-day period. The justices unanimously ruled Tuesday that damages should date from April 1, 2005, through the present. That could result in a damage award to Darling’s Ford in the millions. \nAt the center of the dispute is a requirement in state law that automobile manufacturers notify franchisees by certified letter 90 days before the implementation of a modification that would “substantially and adversely affect the motor vehicle dealer’s rights, obligations, investment or return on investment.” \nThe court found Ford did not fulfill that requirement in the statute when it replaced a program that paid certain dealers, including Darling’s, a 1.25 percent cash bonus on the retail price of each vehicle the dealer sold.   \nEfforts to reach attorneys for Ford and Darling’s were unsuccessful Tuesday. \nThe Maine Automobile Dealers Association appealed the decision along with Darling’s. The organization’s attorney, Bruce Gerrity of Augusta, said Tuesday that the decision is good for Maine dealers. \n“This has been a long standing dispute and one of the things that is at the heart of this decision has been Ford’s unwillingness to send certified notice required by statute,” he said. “The law court confirmed that that is a clear unequivocal requirement of statute with which Ford and other manufacturers must comply.” \nGerrity also said that the court’s decision puts manufacturers on notice that Maine’s supreme court would strictly interpret the statute that governs the relationship between dealers and manufacturers. \nThe justices heard oral arguments in the appeal in September 2015.",

( more ) #BrickPony, a life-size LEGO® replica of the \"1964½\" Ford Mustang V8 coupe, will go on permanent display outside the Ford Driving School attraction at LEGOLAND® Florida Resort in Winter Haven, Fla. Made out of 194,900 LEGO and DUPLO® bricks, the giant model took approximately 1,200 hours to assemble by a team of veteran Master Builders at LEGO Systems, Inc., in Enfield, Conn. #BrickPony measures more than 15 feet long, nearly 6 feet wide and more than 4 feet tall. It weighs 1,712 pounds, of which 960 pounds are LEGO bricks and 752 pounds is its aluminum chassis. A few surprises were added under its hood, including a virtual horn and the sounds of a real Mustang engine — a first for a life-size LEGO vehicle — plus working headlights and taillights. Longtime partner Southern Ford Dealers has sponsored the Ford Driving School attraction since LEGOLAND Florida Resort opened in 2011 and collaborated with the popular vacation destination and LEGO Systems to create #BrickPony.

      "text": "By Patrick Rall G+ 2016-11-29 11:35 Stock 2017 Ford Raptor F150 Finishes the Baja 1000 - and Drives Home A new 2017 Ford F150 Raptor that is mechanically identical to the trucks reaching dealerships around the country recently participated in the grueling Baja 1000 off-road race, finishing 3rd in the Stock Full class and then driving the team home – in a race where 128 vehicles didn’t make it to the finish line. \nIn the world of off-road racing, the Baja 1000 is one of the most difficult races in the world while likely being the most difficult race in North America – making it the perfect test for the 2017 Ford Raptor F150. The Motor Company has billed this new Raptor as the most capable ever, but this new high performance F150 has a handful of new features which have yet to be proven in the real world. Most notably, the new 10-speed automatic transmission which was developed jointly with General Motors has been a point of concern for some, while others are curious to see how the new, highly touted four wheel drive system performs in the real world. \nWell, those components weren’t proven in the real world until Foutz Motorsports took the 2017 Ford F15 Raptor to the Baja 1000 to participate in the Stock Full class. This essentially packs 850 miles of the most brutal driving possible into a day and a half time period – and the factory-stock Raptor roared across the finish line in 3rd place in the Stock Full class. \n“We’re completely thrilled at how well the all-new F-150 Raptor performed throughout the Baja 1,000 race as it’s one of the most brutal environments you can ever compete in,“ said Ford’s Global Performance Vehicle Chief Engineer Jamal Hameedi. “Having race-proven, real-world performance experience and data to validate – further solidifies Ford’s truck leadership position and Raptor as the ultimate from-the-factory high-performance off-road truck.” \n2017 Raptor VS Baja While the 2017 Ford F150 Raptor raced the Baja 1000 in the Stock Full class, it should be noted that it wasn’t quite identical to the trucks you will see at your local dealership. The Raptor campaigned by Foutz Motorsports was fitted with a handful of safety features, including a roll cage, racing seats with harnesses, a fuel cell and a bunch of lights around the outside which would blind other drivers on the road – but which are essential when racing through the dark desert. These safety items add weight, so the suspension setup has been tuned to accommodate for the extra weight, but in every other way, the Raptor which raced Baja was mechanically identical to the production trucks sold to the general public. \nThe Baja 1000 is a brutal race, so the vast majority of the 270 vehicle field were purpose-built race cars, trucks, motorcycles and ATVs, but the 2017 Raptor was joined by four other vehicles in the Stock Full class. This included a Hummer H1, a previous generation Ford SVT Raptor F150, an early 1980s Dodge Ram with a Cummins engine driven by drift legend Chris Forsberg and a Toyota Tundra (I have been unable to find more information on this Toyota). \nOf these 5 trucks in the Stock Full class, only 3 finished – with the old school Dodge and the previous generation Raptor failing to make it to the finish line. However, Greg Foutz was able to complete the race in 35 hours, 35 minutes and 32 seconds – about 3 hours behind the class-winning effort turned in by Rod Hall in the Hummer H1.",

      "title": "Ford Sees Record October Sales in China",
      "text": "Ford Sees Record October Sales in China November 28, 2016, 12:27:01 PM EDT By Mayank Marwah,   American carmaker Ford Motor ( F ) has been tirelessly working to make its mark in China, the most attractive destination for automotive giants. The Blue Oval might be classified as a late entrant in this emerging Asian economy, but it is definitely working hard to expand its presence in the mainland. The company sold a record -…7,6-8 vehicles in October, up -4% year over year, powered by strong sales of Mustang, Explorer, New Edge, Focus and Escort. Peter Fleet, vice president of marketing, sales and service, Asia Pacific, said in a statement, \"We had a strong October and we are headed for our best year ever for sales in China.\" He added, \"We are seeing the benefits of a much more exciting lineup and an ever-stronger focus on the wants and needs of Chinese customers.\" As far as year-to-date sales are concerned, Ford, Changan Ford and Jiangling Motor Corp. delivered a total of 966,……… cars and vehicles. This is up -…% from the same period last year. Here's a comprehensive look at Ford's performance in October. Ford continues to build momentum The sales of Changan Ford amounted to 8-,'68 units, up -….-% from the same period last year when it sold 74,8-… units. Moreover, through the -… months of the year, CAF delivered 745,65… units, up -4% as compared with the last year's comparable period. The company's commercial vehicle investment in China, Jiangling Motors Corp. (SZSE:………55…), witnessed a -9% sales increase year over year to -',949 vehicles. In addition, sales from January to October exceeded -……,……… units, up '% compared to last year. Lincoln brand sales spiked 6.9% to 9,…69 units sold. In contrast, sales of MKC cars and MKS SUVs dropped -9% and '.'% respectively. Moreover, sales of MKX SUV and MKZ car surged 4.-% and '.-%. Ford brand sales posted a sales slump of --.5% year over year to -79,744 units. While Transit truck sales climbed 9%, sales of Ford Focus, Explorer SUV, Escape SUV, Fusion car and Transit Connect trucks plunged 4'%, -4.-%, 4.9%, --% and 6-.5% respectively. By contrast, imported Ford vehicles saw sales improve ….46% year over year to -,'…' vehicles. Looking ahead The October sales growth in China marks the fourth consecutive month of continuous improvement for Ford. The company has managed to pull up numbers in the later months of the year, particularly after witnessing a rough patch at the beginning of the year on account of competition from China's homegrown carmakers. Domestic competition impacted the sales of Ford Kuga. However, Ford was quick to respond to the rising competition from domestic players. The company's strategic team implemented cost-cutting measures that helped it make price adjustments without hurting the margins much. This enabled the Blue Oval to combat the competitive rates offered by domestic players. This was visible in Ford's equity income from its Chinese joint venture, which came in around $'-… million for the quarter. This is an improvement of -6% from last year. Ford's chief executive officer is confident that the company will keep the momentum going and finish the year on a high note. The automaker has started launching the face-lift version of Kuga and Mondeo. This should support the company's sales volume in the last quarter of the year. The company has taken effective steps and is seeing the results. Ford looks to be on track to post impressive performance in China. Stay tuned for the company's November figures.   hold any position in the stock(s) discussed in this article.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Ford to begin self-driving car tests on European roads in 2017 After detailing an autonomous future in the US earlier this year, Ford is ready to begin testing in Europe. Ford wants to bring self-driving to the US by 2021. (Image: Ford) \nFord on Tuesday announced it will begin testing self-driving cars in Europe in 2017. Read More \nTesting will begin in Europe at Ford's UK-based Engineering Center in Essex, the automarker told TechCrunch. Ford will also begin testing at its Research and Advanced Engineering facilities in Aachen and Cologne in Germany. It has more sites planned for the future. \n\"It is important that we extend our testing to Europe,\" Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager for Automated Driving for Ford of Europe, said in a statement. \"Rules of the road vary from country to country here, traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.\" \nEarlier this year, Ford outlined its self-driving future. Ford's goal is to build a car to the SAE Level 4 standard of automation (meaning no steering wheel or peddles) to be used in urban, geofenced regions to supplement public transportation. Testing has begun in cities across the US. \nBMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford, and Volkswagen Group on Tuesday also announced plans to build a high-power charging network along major highways in Europe. It's expected to consist of 400 \"ultra-fast\" charging sites in \"an important step toward facilitating mass-market battery electric vehicle adoption.\" \nSee also:",

      "text": "3. Dealer Selection Receive your free dealer pricing information by completing your contact information! \nThe seventh-generation Ford Fiesta debuted in Cologne, Germany, today with some big upgrades. Along with a more upscale interior, the Fiesta receives cylinder deactivation and a new Active crossover variant for Europe. \nInside the cabin, Ford removed 20 buttons on the center stack and put in a floating 8-inch touchscreen. Along with a cleaner user interface, Ford also promises upgraded materials on the new model. Expect to see Ford’s new Sync 3 system as well as a premium B&O PLAY sound system. \n\nThe European Fiesta comes with 15 new driver safety features, Ford says. A new anti-collision system up front can detect objects 130 meters ahead of the car, 20 times more than the current vehicle. If the car doesn’t come to a stop, autonomous braking will activate. \nFord hasn’t released full specs on the Fiesta, so we don’t know what all the options are. We do know that in Europe, the model will be available with a 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost engine with a new range of five-speed and six-speed transmissions. To improve fuel economy, Ford noted it is introducing cylinder deactivation on its 1.0-liter unit, a world first for a three-cylinder engine. When under light engine load, the feature can disengage or reengage one cylinder in 14 milliseconds. \nThe Euro-spec Fiesta will be available in four trims: the classic Titanium, the sporty ST-Line, the upscale Vignale , and the new slightly higher-riding Active crossover. It’s unclear which versions will make their way to the U.S. at this point, but we hope a next-gen ST is in the cards eventually. \nSource: Ford",

      "text": "Three-cylinder Ecoboost petrol engine gets the ability to run as a twin under light throttle loads, increasing fuel economy by up to 6%\n\nThe three-cylinder Ford 1.0-litre Ecoboost engine is to be offered with fuel-saving cylinder deactivation technology that will enable it to operate as a two-cylinder unit.\n\nSimilar technology is seen on many four-cylinder engines, but Ford claims this is the first time it has been engineered into a three-pot. Some manufacturers have dismissed the idea, citing refinement as one of the main issues, but Ford hasn’t been deterred.\n\nCylinder deactivation will automatically stop fuel delivery and valve operation for one of the engine’s cylinders under conditions where full capacity is not needed, such as when coasting or cruising with light demand on the engine. The technology can disengage or re-engage one cylinder in 14 milliseconds.\n\n*Read more - Ford to start testing autonomous cars on European roads*\n\nCapable of operating at speeds of up to 4500rpm, the system uses engine oil pressure to activate a special valve rocker and interrupt the connection between the camshaft and the valves of cylinder number one. Software uses factors including speed, throttle position and engine load to determine when to deactivate the cylinder.\n\nThe 1.0-litre Ecoboost - first introduced in 2012 - has a new single-piece camshaft module that has freed up space within the cylinder head for new oil channels and valve-switching componentry.\n\nFord engineers predict that the system will be active for a few seconds at a time in most driving scenarios and has the potential to improve fuel efficiency by up to 6%. \n\nInstalled in the current Fiesta, the 1.0-litre Ecoboost in 98bhp form is capable of a claimed combined economy of 65.7mpg, so a 6% improvement could take that figure to 69.6mpg.\n\nFord said it has “devised advanced solutions to counteract vibrations and ensure that cylinder deactivation is imperceptible to drivers in terms of operation and engine performance”.\n\nThe technology will be tested throughout 2017 and be made available for sale in 2018, although Ford hasn’t confirmed which car model will be the first to benefit from it. At present 11 Ford models – the Fiesta, Ecosport, B-Max, Focus, C-Max, Grand C Max, Tourneo and Transit Connect, Tourneo and Transit Courier and Mondeo – are available in Europe with the three-cylinder engine.\n\nWith the 1.0-litre Ecoboost available in three power ratings, Ford also has yet to confirm which of them will receive the cylinder deactivation technology.\n\nThe system uses an offset crankshaft configuration and deliberately ‘unbalanced’ flywheel and pulley that counteract vibration. The new dual-mass flywheel and a vibration-damping clutch disc help neutralise engine oscillations when the engine is running on two cylinders, especially at lower revs, and enable a wider operating range.\n\nIntake and exhaust valves are closed when the system is active, trapping gases to provide a spring effect that helps balance forces across the three cylinders for refinement and also retain temperatures inside the cylinder that maintain fuel efficiency when reactivated.\n\nNew engine mounts, drive shafts and suspension bushes also will be specially tuned for refinement when the revised 1.0-litre Ecoboost is installed in a car.\n\nThe engine has also been made more durable to cope with the different loading forces resulting from cylinder deactivation, with uprated parts including a new camshaft chain, and valve rockers formed using advanced metal injection moulding.\n\nThe system was developed by Ford engineers in the UK, Germany and US, in collaboration with the Schaeffler Group, an engineering partner.\n\nBob Fascetti, Ford Motor Company’s global powertrain engineering boss said the engine was proof that \"there is still untapped potential for even the best internal combustion engines to deliver better fuel efficiency for customers.”\n\n*Read more - 2017 Ford Fiesta revealed*",

      "text": "Reprints \nA group of major automakers have inked a memorandum of understanding to develop hundreds — and eventually \"thousands\" — of electric-vehicle charging stations in Europe. By making long-distance travel easier, the carmakers hope to broaden consumer adoption of EVs. \nBMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor ( F ) and Volkswagen Group ( VLKAY ) signed a memorandum of understanding, according to a press release from BMW, with development slated to begin next year on an initial build of 400 sites. \nThe charging stations will be \"significantly faster\" than those currently on the market, said the companies, and a successful rollout of the plan would mean that by 2020, Europe-based electric-car drivers should be able to stop by \"thousands of high-powered charging points\" for a quick recharge. \n\"A reliable, ultrafast charging infrastructure is important for mass consumer adoption and has the potential to transform the possibilities for electric driving,\" said Ford CEO Mark Fields in the statement. \nThat echoes his remarks at the Los Angeles Auto Show two weeks ago, where Fields emphasized not the latest Ford vehicles but a partnership with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and mayors worldwide to develop transit solutions in metropolitan areas. IBD'S TAKE : With automakers focusing on smart-auto tech, much of the value-add, and profits, will be under the hood. Maker of driver-assistance systems Mobileye reported better-than-expected earnings earlier in the month. \nEase of access to charging stations is a key factor for many mulling an electric vehicle purchase. \nIn June, Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) was said to be in talks with an East Coast chain of gas stations regarding the installation of Supercharger stations. \nBut it's not clear if potential EV buyers may be put off by Tesla's latest decision to charge new Tesla owners \"a small fee\" for use of its charging stations. Previously, new owners had been allowed four years of free charging. \nTesla shares fell 3.3% to 189.57 in the stock market today , continuing to find resistance at the 50-day line. Ford closed unchanged while Volkswagen fell 0.3%. \nSeparately, driver-assistance systems maker Mobileye ( MBLY ) and auto parts giant Delphi ( DLPH ) said Tuesday they will use Intel ( INTC ) chips in their previously announced plans for a turnkey autonomous driving system by 2019. Intel and Mobileye are already working with BMW on an autonomous car. \nMobileye shares slid 2.4% as it too finds resistance at the 50-day line. Delphi fell 4.3% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to sell, saying electric cars will hurt its profits. Intel eased 0.6%. \nRELATED :",

      "title": "Ford sends self-driving cars to Europe as testing spreads",
      "text": "Reddit \nFord is set to expand its real-world autonomous vehicle testing, kicking off on-the-road trials in Europe next year. The expansion builds on Ford ‘s existing project in North America, where the automaker has already announced it aims to launch a self-driving rideshare scheme by 2021. Now, just like an American driver taking a local driving test while abroad, Ford’s technology has to get to grips with foreign roads. \nIt’s a bigger issue than just reprogramming the car to drive on the other side of the road in the UK, Ford points out. “Rules of the road vary from country to country here,” Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager of Automated Driving at Ford of Europe, said of the announcement. “Traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.” \nThat’s not an insignificant challenge, and the efforts will be spread across three different centers initially. The UK project will be located at Ford’s Engineering Center in Essex, the automaker told TechCrunch , while its Research & Advanced Engineering facilities in Aachen and Cologne in Germany will also be involved. Together, they’ll have to get to grips with differing regulations, styles of driving, and localized foibles in numerous countries. \nNonetheless, Ford says its research suggests European drivers are generally in favor of robotic cars taking to the public highways. In a survey of 5,000 adults, 80-percent said they’d take advantage of the autonomous chauffeur to watch the scenery go past, while 72-percent said they’d use the time to make phone calls. 64-percent envisaged ignoring the road and concentrating instead on eating. \nAll the same, there’s a pretty divisive split between those who are confident in self-driving cars’ talents and those who still need some convincing. While Ford’s research found that people would rather have access to an autonomous vehicle when they went out socializing or when it comes to commuting, less than half thought driverless cars would be safer. \nIn the US, Ford’s research has been spread across both its home base in Dearborn, MI, but also at the company’s relatively new Research and Innovation Center in Palo Alto, CA. Opened in early 2015, as a way for the automaker to not only tap into local talent but build partnerships with other, tech-savvy firms, its focus has been autonomous vehicles though also car-sharing, alternative transportation, and other ways to ease congestion and emissions. Its research vehicles began plying California streets at the beginning of this year . \nThe culmination of those efforts will be Ford’s autonomous taxi service , expected to launch in 2021. Promised to be a Level 4 autonomous system, it would be capable of handling all but the most challenging situations – extreme weather might prove too much, for instance – and occupant attention to the road wouldn’t be required. As a result, there’ll be no steering wheel, pedals, or other traditional controls. \nFord is yet to say whether it has self-driving ridesharing plans for Europe yet. Just as the vehicles themselves would have to get up to speed with the rules of the road, so the regulatory environment for autonomous driving differs from European country to country.

      "text": "Hey Folks,\n\nI'm trying to diagnose a problem without having to spend $140 for a Ford Dealer to do a [similar type-of] diagnostic.\n\nI have a 2012 Ford Focus Titanium. I've enjoyed the car since I bought it, though it has had its share of transmission issues. It has just over 90k miles.\n\nA couple of months ago I noticed that when I came to a stop at a light or while parked and idling, the RPMS would momentarily drop low (like just above 500 rpm for about 3 secs) and then come back up again. I didn't find it to be too alarming until one warm day this past August, the car would not start. I kept trying it every few minutes (over a 20 minute period) until I got it to start. I drove it home with no load on the battery (air off, radio off, lights of, etc.). Got to car to Advance AutoParts and had them test the battery. Turned out at that the battery volts were too low to crank, they replaced the battery under the warranty (original factory battery went out about 2yrs earlier - this battery had a 3yr warranty). The issue went away.\n\nAfter replacing the battery, Advance AutoParts tech gave the following readings:\nBattery: 12.81v\nStarter Test (cracking): 11.16v\nCharging System\nNo Load: 14.5v\nLoaded: 14.44v\n\nOver the Thanksgiving holiday, it was a bit cool outside (Upper 40 lower 50 degrees). The issue with the RPMS started again - basically dropping low, 3sec or so (as if the car would stall) and then coming back up again.\n\nI used a multimeter for the following readings (car was off for over 2hrs):\nBattery (Car off): 12.66v\nBattery (Car Started - No Load): 14.16v\nBattery (Car Running/Load w/air, radio, headlights): 14.03v\nBattery reading with the car in Test Mode: 14.1v\n\nA day later, these were the readings (middle of the day, 74 degrees, car not driven):\nBattery (Car off): 12.57v\nBattery (Car Started - No Load): 14.52v\nBattery (Car Running/Load w/air, radio, headlights): 14.50v\nBattery reading with the car in Test Mode: 13.8v\n\nI had a local mechanic test the alternator and he didn't detect any problems - it's charging. He did recommend an AGM battery since the car has so many electronics. Other than some LED DRLs, there are no mods to the vehicle. \n\nReadings today (multimeter - After 15min of driving and about 67 degrees outside)\nBattery (Car off): 12.79v\nBattery (Car Running): 14.39v\nBattery (Car Running/Load w/air, radio, headlights): 14.35v\nBattery in Test Mode: 14.0\n\nWhat else could cause an intermittent drop in idling? Ideas and suggestions of what and how to rule out are much appreciated!\n\nThanks!\n\n-Z ",

      "text": "Ford Adds More Appeal To Transit With Custom Color And Sport Editions | By Share To most, vans are nothing more than ultra-practical vehicles perfect for moving things around and typically painted white. But for prospective van owners that want a little extra, Ford has the answer with the launch of the Transit Custom Colour Edition and Transport Custom Sport. Available in Europe, there are four different color schemes available for the Custom Colour Edition, each designed to give the Ford Transit a special look and consisting of Race Red, Deep Impact Blue, Frozen White with Jet Black contrasts and Shadow Black with Race Red contrasts. Underpinning all is the short-wheelbase, 290 Trend series Transit powered by Ford’s 2.0-liter EcoBlue diesel engine with 170 PS (167 hp). Alongside the Transits with special paint schemes, Ford has extended the Custom Sport series to now offer six variants. The range-topping model is fitted with a bold body kit complete with a color-coded exterior that includes body-color bumpers, door handles and wing mirrors. Additionally, 17-inch wheels with a silver and black design come standard but 18-inch alloys are also available as are contrasting hood stripes. Inside, the Transit Custom Sport series benefits from leather seat bolsters and the Ford SYNC connectivity package. Other modifications include a rear anti-roll bar, a thicker front anti-roll bar and firmer settings on the rear dampers for the standard van model . Double-cab-in-van models make use of different spring and damper settings. As with the Custom Color Edition, the Custom Sport series includes the same 2.0-liter EcoBlue diesel mated as standard to a 6-speed manual but also available with a 6-speed automatic. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "Business News | Tue Nov 29, 2016 | 10:34pm EST Ford takes Fiesta upmarket to lift profitability Ford Motor Company's Global Marketing Chief Jim Farley speaks at the 2013 Los Angeles Auto Show in California November 19, 2013. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nCOLOGNE, Germany Ford ( F.N ) wants to raise profitability in Europe by adding higher-margin versions of the Fiesta subcompact, its best-selling regional model, the carmaker's top European executive said. \nHigh-volume carmakers such as Ford have for several years been squeezed in a downmarket expansion by luxury rivals including Daimler's ( DAIGn.DE ) Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's ( VOWG_p.DE ) Audi. \nBut Ford, which already targets premium buyers with higher-end versions of some of its larger cars under the Vignale label, now wants to take further advantage of that opportunity too. \nThe next-generation Fiesta, unveiled late on Tuesday in front of 2,500 staff, dealers and reporters at its Cologne plant, will come with advanced safety features and cater to more customers with new crossover and upscale variants. \n\"Having that kind of special feeling in a mainstream product is where the market is going and where Ford as a brand needs to go to make money in Europe,\" Ford Europe CEO Jim Farley told Reuters. \"We don't want to build commodities anymore.\" \nBut Farley declined to say what contribution to profitability the new Fiesta may make. Ford has sold more than 17 million Fiestas globally since the first version came to market in 1976. \nBenefiting from costs cuts and growing sales of higher-margin SUVs, Ford may increase profit in Europe to around $1 billion this year, on a par with its nine-month gain in the region and up from $259 million last year, a spokesman said. \nFarley noted a full-year profit target of $600 million had already been exceeded in June. \nFord has also positioned the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+ city car below the Fiesta's base model to target budget customers, Farley said. \nStill, it remains to be seen whether new offerings for the redesigned Fiesta and other models will give Ford an edge in the crowded European market. \nFord sales in Europe may decline 5.2 percent to 1.4 million vehicles by 2025 from an estimated 1.47 million this year, compared with a 2 percent drop at General Motors' ( GM.N ) Opel division to 1.14 million and a 4.6 percent gain to 2.16 million for the VW brand, according to IHS Markit. \nSeparately, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the carmaker will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Europe next year. Ford has said it plans to offer a mass-market fully autonomous car by 2021. \n(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Edwina Gibbs) Next In Business News Iran, Iraq at loggerheads with Saudis ahead of OPEC meeting \nVIENNA Iran and Iraq are resisting pressure from Saudi Arabia to curtail oil production, making it hard for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to reach a deal to limit output and boost the price of crude when it meets on Wednesday.",

      "text": "Ford takes Fiesta upmarket to lift profitability Reuters Reuters Photo: \nCOLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Ford <F.N> wants to raise profitability in Europe by adding higher-margin versions of the Fiesta subcompact, its best-selling regional model, the carmaker's top European executive said. \nHigh-volume carmakers such as Ford have for several years been squeezed in a downmarket expansion by luxury rivals including Daimler's <DAIGn.DE> Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> Audi. \nBut Ford, which already targets premium buyers with higher-end versions of some of its larger cars under the Vignale label, now wants to take further advantage of that opportunity too. \nThe next-generation Fiesta, unveiled late on Tuesday in front of 2,500 staff, dealers and reporters at its Cologne plant, will come with advanced safety features and cater to more customers with new crossover and upscale variants. \n\"Having that kind of special feeling in a mainstream product is where the market is going and where Ford as a brand needs to go to make money in Europe,\" Ford Europe CEO Jim Farley told Reuters. \"We don't want to build commodities anymore.\" \nBut Farley declined to say what contribution to profitability the new Fiesta may make. Ford has sold more than 17 million Fiestas globally since the first version came to market in 1976. \nBenefiting from costs cuts and growing sales of higher-margin SUVs, Ford may increase profit in Europe to around $1 billion this year, on a par with its nine-month gain in the region and up from $259 million last year, a spokesman said. \nFarley noted a full-year profit target of $600 million had already been exceeded in June. \nFord has also positioned the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+ city car below the Fiesta's base model to target budget customers, Farley said. \nStill, it remains to be seen whether new offerings for the redesigned Fiesta and other models will give Ford an edge in the crowded European market. \nFord sales in Europe may decline 5.2 percent to 1.4 million vehicles by 2025 from an estimated 1.47 million this year, compared with a 2 percent drop at General Motors' <GM.N> Opel division to 1.14 million and a 4.6 percent gain to 2.16 million for the VW brand, according to IHS Markit. \nSeparately, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the carmaker will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Europe next year. Ford has said it plans to offer a mass-market fully autonomous car by 2021. \n(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

      "text": "* Ford adds crossover, upscale versions to Fiesta lineup * Ford Europe sales may drop 5.2 pct to 1.4 mln by 2025 -IHS * Ford to start testing autonomous cars in Europe in 2017 COLOGNE, Germany, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Ford wants to raise profitability in Europe by adding higher-margin versions of the Fiesta subcompact, its best-selling regional model, the carmaker's top European executive said. High-volume carmakers such as Ford have for several years been squeezed in a downmarket expansion by luxury rivals including Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's Audi. But Ford, which already targets premium buyers with higher-end versions of some of its larger cars under the Vignale label, now wants to take further advantage of that opportunity too. The next-generation Fiesta, unveiled late on Tuesday in front of 2,500 staff, dealers and reporters at its Cologne plant, will come with advanced safety features and cater to more customers with new crossover and upscale variants. \"Having that kind of special feeling in a mainstream product is where the market is going and where Ford as a brand needs to go to make money in Europe,\" Ford Europe CEO Jim Farley told Reuters. \"We don't want to build commodities anymore.\" But Farley declined to say what contribution to profitability the new Fiesta may make. Ford has sold more than 17 million Fiestas globally since the first version came to market in 1976. Benefiting from costs cuts and growing sales of higher-margin SUVs, Ford may increase profit in Europe to around $1 billion this year, on a par with its nine-month gain in the region and up from $259 million last year, a spokesman said. Farley noted a full-year profit target of $600 million had already been exceeded in June. Ford has also positioned the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+ city car below the Fiesta's base model to target budget customers, Farley said. Still, it remains to be seen whether new offerings for the redesigned Fiesta and other models will give Ford an edge in the crowded European market. Ford sales in Europe may decline 5.2 percent to 1.4 million vehicles by 2025 from an estimated 1.47 million this year, compared with a 2 percent drop at General Motors' Opel division to 1.14 million and a 4.6 percent gain to 2.16 million for the VW brand, according to IHS Markit. Separately, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the carmaker will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Europe next year. Ford has said it plans to offer a mass-market fully autonomous car by 2021. ($1 = 0.9395 euros) (Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Edwina Gibbs) Reblog",

      "text": "Ford takes Fiesta upmarket to lift profitability Stock Markets 1 hour ago (Nov 29, 2016 10:40PM ET) This article has already been saved in your Saved Items © Reuters. Ford Motor Company's Global Marketing Chief Jim Farley speaks at the 2013 Los Angeles Auto Show \nCOLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Ford (N: F ) wants to raise profitability in Europe by adding higher-margin versions of the Fiesta subcompact, its best-selling regional model, the carmaker's top European executive said. \nHigh-volume carmakers such as Ford have for several years been squeezed in a downmarket expansion by luxury rivals including Daimler's (DE: DAIGn ) Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's (DE: VOWG_p ) Audi. \nBut Ford, which already targets premium buyers with higher-end versions of some of its larger cars under the Vignale label, now wants to take further advantage of that opportunity too. \nThe next-generation Fiesta, unveiled late on Tuesday in front of 2,500 staff, dealers and reporters at its Cologne plant, will come with advanced safety features and cater to more customers with new crossover and upscale variants. \n\"Having that kind of special feeling in a mainstream product is where the market is going and where Ford as a brand needs to go to make money in Europe,\" Ford Europe CEO Jim Farley told Reuters. \"We don't want to build commodities anymore.\" \nBut Farley declined to say what contribution to profitability the new Fiesta may make. Ford has sold more than 17 million Fiestas globally since the first version came to market in 1976. \nBenefiting from costs cuts and growing sales of higher-margin SUVs, Ford may increase profit in Europe to around $1 billion this year, on a par with its nine-month gain in the region and up from $259 million last year, a spokesman said. \nFarley noted a full-year profit target of $600 million had already been exceeded in June. \nFord has also positioned the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+ city car below the Fiesta's base model to target budget customers, Farley said. \nStill, it remains to be seen whether new offerings for the redesigned Fiesta and other models will give Ford an edge in the crowded European market. \nFord sales in Europe may decline 5.2 percent to 1.4 million vehicles by 2025 from an estimated 1.47 million this year, compared with a 2 percent drop at General Motors' (N: GM ) Opel division to 1.14 million and a 4.6 percent gain to 2.16 million for the VW brand, according to IHS Markit. \nSeparately, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the carmaker will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Europe next year. Ford has said it plans to offer a mass-market fully autonomous car by 2021. Ford takes Fiesta upmarket to lift profitability ",

      "text": "Seventh-generation Ford Fiesta officially breaks cover Text: Anton Andres / Photos: Ford | posted November 30, 2016 09:39 Ford Fiesta is all-new for its 40th birthday \nSeven years have passed since the current Ford Fiesta was introduced in the global market. Now due for a complete redesign, Ford has just revealed the all-new Fiesta in Germany and aims to go upmarket. \nFrom the outside, the Fiesta goes for an evolutionary redesign by retaining the wide, hexagonal grill, now a signature for Ford sedans and hatchbacks. The headlights meanwhile feature a rounder shape when compared to the current model. \nOn to its side, the window line sweeps upwards while the roof swoops downwards, following the look of the current Fiesta. The roof line then blends into the integrated rear spoiler of the hatchback. Over to the rear, gone are the large, tear drop shaped tail lights. Replacing these units are wider, two-piece clusters that start from the tailgate on to the quarter panel. \nIn Europe, Ford has revealed four variants for the Fiesta, namely the Titanium, Vignale, ST-Line and Active. The Titnaium gets a five bar grill with upright foglight housings while the Vignale gets a wider lower air intake with a unique bumper treatment. The ST-Line takes a sportier approach with its bumper featuring more aggressive lines and a honeycomb grill finished in black. Lastly, Ford dubs the Active as a crossover and distinguishes itself from the rest of the lineup with its raised ride height, body cladding surrounding the lower half of the car, faux skid plates and a pair of roof rails. \nInside, Ford says that aim to go upmarket with the Fiesta by boosting its cabin ambiance. The dash is now soft-padded and, depending on the model selected, gets stitching around the center stack. The infotainment screen is now larger, measuring 8-inches and features a floating design. Also, the infotainment system is upgraded to a Sync 3 system, now powered by QNX instead of Microsoft. \nFord has yet to release details surrounding the all-new Fiesta's engine lineup. However, Ford did confirm that the three-cylinder, 1.0 liter EcoBoost engine will be retained for the seventh-gen model. It also gains cylinder deactivation and allows the car to run on just two cylinders. Powertrains for the international markets have yet to be announced but do expect a range of four-cylinder engines for the rest of the world, as well as turbodiesels for Europe. As for transmissions, Ford has also yet to release details but the cars seen here are equipped with six-speed manual transmissions. The Powershift dual-clutch transmission may be an option. \nThe current model bows out in favor for the all-new, seventh-generation model by early 2017 in Europe. Release dates for the rest of the world have yet to be announced. Related Articles",

It then sits on a set of distinctive black, 19-inch alloy wheels. As for the second model, the Mustang Blue Edition, it is fittingly painted in a shade dubbed Grabber Blue and incorporates the muscle car’s famed black racing stripes running along the hood, roof and tailgate. It also sits on a set of tightly-spoked black wheels and has been fitted with a new front splitter that protrudes more than base Mustangs. Both the Mustang Black Shadow Edition and Mustang Blue Edition are powered by the model’s naturally-aspirated 5.0-liter V8 engine delivering 421 PS (415 hp), down on the 435 hp offered up by U.S.-spec Mustang GTs. The duo also include black leather interiors, heated and cooled front seats, Ford’s SYNC 3 entertainment system and a premium audio system. Pricing and availability details have yet to be announced.

      "text": "BMW, Daimler, Ford, and VW Group to Build Electric Charging Network in Europe   There is a great rivalry between car companies, but it's all in good spirit, most of the time. Sure, one of them might have installed a defeat device that gave its diesel engines an unfair advantage, but it looks like all that is water under the bridge now. What do we mean by \"now\"? Well, in case you haven't noticed, everybody is currently pushing for the development of electric vehicles, and the big manufacturers have somewhat been caught with their pants down. They've been in denial for a very long time claiming that downsizing the gas engines and sticking turbos on them while perpetually developing the diesels was the way forward. Meanwhile, a young company in California thought different, and so in just a few years, it managed to build the world's arguably best EV and provide it with a super-fast charging network that covers almost the whole of the US. All while battling the opposition of the public, the media, and, later on, the traditional carmakers who were starting to feel a little threatened. Yesterday, though, four of the most important names in the automotive industry - BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford , and VW Group - have announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to build the highest-powered charging network in Europe. That, together with the recent announcements for numerous EVs over the coming years, shows they have finally decided to join Tesla, instead of trying to ridicule its efforts. This \"unprecedented collaboration\" is planned to start next year with a target of 400 sites scattered across the continent's main highways. By 2020, thousands of them are expected to pop up, enabling electric long-distance traveling and reducing charging time dramatically. The technical specifications are limited at this time, but Daimler did say it will be based on the current Combined Charging System (CCS) technology and it will provide power levels up to 350 kWh. There are no cars that can currently benefit from this much power (Teslas can suck up to 120 kWh from the Supercharger network), but expect future offerings from these brands (and others) to take full advantage. Of course, this also good news for Tesla as well as it won't be forced to invest in expanding its Supercharger network on the Old Continent anymore - assuming its cars will come with an adaptor - to offer its clients the promised ability to long-distance travel. On the other hand, it will also be losing one of its main selling points against competition, so it's not all milk and honey.",

      "text": "\nEvolution of CCS charging technology for EVs toward 350 kW. (credit: Porsche)\nSeveral automakers have agreed to form a joint venture in Europe to build roughly 400 “ultra-fast” charging sites along highways on the continent to make long distance travel in electric cars more feasible. BMW, Volkswagen Group, Ford, and Daimler are heading up the venture, along with Audi and Porsche—both divisions of VW Group. In a press release today, the automakers said the charging stations would deliver 350 kW over a DC charging network, which is set to “significantly reduce charging time compared to available systems.” For comparison, Tesla’s supercharging stations deliver 120 kW and can fill a Tesla up to 170 miles of range in 30 minutes.\nThe European network will use the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard that is compatible with current and future electric vehicles from all the joint venture companies as well as Fiat-Chrysler and Hyundai.\nRead 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo \n\nThe global boss of Ford has told Sky News that securing free trade with the EU is a \"top priority\" and any assurances given by the British government should apply to all car manufacturers.\nFord's chief executive and president, Mark Fields, was speaking at the launch of the next generation Fiesta in Cologne, Germany. \nHe said the company has been proactive in trying to secure a good deal out of the Brexit negotiations.\n\nHe said: \"Our priority is to have free trade between the UK and the EU because that would be good for both the overall economy of both countries and to secure, for example, a very stable environment for our workers in the UK of which we have over 14,000 and across Europe.\"\nWhen asked about the decision by Nissan to build two of its new models in the UK after reportedly getting assurances from the British government, Mr Fields said that it is important all manufacturers are treated equally.\nHe said: \"What our expectation is, is whatever is given should be given to the entire auto industry to keep that playing field very level.\"\nMr Field added that Ford is committed to the UK and will be watching closely and having ongoing conversations with the Government to see how the process of leaving the EU unfolds next year.\nBut these are turbulent times for international trade, not just in Europe. \nWith Donald Trump coming to power across the pond there is a nervousness among multinationals about what a new wave of protectionism could bring.\nDoug Lippoldt, a senior trade economist at HSBC, said it has not been a kind year for international trade. \nHe said: \"This emergence of an inward looking populism in the US in particular, it's emerged now that we've had the outcome to the vote but also in France there is some discussions about disrupting the existing trade regime.\n\"And I think the most vulnerable in this discussion is the industrial sectors, like manufacturing.\"\nIt comes as the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has published figures looking at what the impact of a 10% tariff on trade with the EU could cost the motor manufacturing industry.\nTheir research shows that it could cost £4.5bn a year, which would push up the average car owners bill by £1,500.",

SMITH / Statesman Journal) Buy Photo 123 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDALLAS You’re not going to trip up Jolie-Rae Ford. \nThe star senior swimmer at Dallas High School isn’t going to let on even if you ask her about it. \nBut she has goals and desire, and she knows exactly how she’s going to reach them. \nFor a three-time state placer, she’s already accomplished a lot, and she wants to do more. \n“It’s like she has a plan,” Dallas coach David Morelli said. “Some kids just have that. It’s innate. They know what they want to do and they know what they want to be and she’s always had that. \n“She’s always wanted to be a swimmer. She’s hoping to swim for college and go on. She just does what it takes. The other thing is she’s a competitor.” \nLong ago Ford established herself as one of the top swimmers in the state. \nShe has been to the 5A state meet in multiple events in each of her previous three years of high school. \nHer best placing at state was fourth in the 500 free as a sophomore in 5:17.33, and she was sixth in the state in the 200 and 500 free last season. \nBut Ford doesn’t make a big deal about it. \n“I’ve gone there since I was a freshman,” Ford said. “I really like the pool. I really like the environment. I have a lot of friends who go from other school that I swim with on club. \n“There’s never been a lot of friends from my high school, but I’ve had a lot of friends from other high schools, so it’s always really fun for me because I swim with the other people that I hardly get to see.” Buy Photo \nJolie-Rae Ford, a senior at Dallas High School, is one of the top swimmers in the state.

SMITH / Statesman Journal) \nAt every state club swimming meet, Ford swims in every freestyle event. \nShe swims every length from 50 meters to 1,650 meters. \nIt’s quite a load of races, but she’s one of the few who can handle it. \nFord is not just a distance swimmer by choice – she’s adept at most of the strokes – she is a distance swimmer by nature. \n“I have always been very good at keeping a natural pace,” said Ford, who won the Mid-Willamette Conference district title in the 200 free as a sophomore. “I kind of have a natural pace clock in my head. \n“I think it’s from all my years of swimming. Just one day I found out I was really good at distance, and it took a while for me to admit it, but I’m admitting it.” \nIt’s no surprise that Ford spends much of her time at the Dallas Aquatic Center. \nShe’s usually practicing with Dallas’ school team, the club team – the Blue Dolphins – or working at the Dallas Aquatic Center. \nRarely is a day when she’s not in a pool. \n“I work here. I swim here. I go home. I read Harry Potter,” Ford said. “I’m pretty low key.” \nWhen you look on the record boards at the Dallas Aquatic Center, her name dominates the board. \nOnly a few other girls even have their names up because her name so populates all the records. \n“Because Jolie is a really fast swimmer,” said Dallas freshman Isaiah Dressel. “She’s been committed to swimming for a long time, and she’s put in a lot of effort.” \nFord has the desire, and ability, to compete in swimming at the college level, but has to make up her mind where she will swim. \n“I’m not 100 percent sure where I want to go to college, but I know I want to go into physical therapy or pre med, and my plan is to use swimming to help me pay for college because I figure I’ll have a lot of student loans,” she said. \nFord is the one person who people can think of when they think of swimming at Dallas. \nWhen Ford’s name is called after winning yet another race, people automatically know who she represents. \n“She is the face of Dallas swimming because she has been doing it since 8, that’s 10 years,” Morelli said. “She’s the one that people look at and say that’s the swimmer in Dallas.” \nbpoehler@StatesmanJournal.com or Twitter.com/bpoehler Boys swimming Greater Valley Conference \nMcKay: The Royal Scots have a promising swimmer in sophomore Connor Breyer, a district finalist as a freshman in the 200 IM. \nMcNary: The Celtics are a young team with promising swimmers like Harrison Vaughn. \nNorth Salem: The Vikings don't return any district meet scorers. \nSouth Salem: The Saxons placed second in the conference last year and have the swimmers to compete for the championship including Tyler Cook, Parker Morris, Paul lomax, Daisuke Fitial, Maxwell Moeller and Kenneth Utter. \nSprague: The Olympians return junior Colby Evenson, a state placer in the 500 free and 200 IM last season. \nWest Salem: The Titans are led by senior Micah Masei, who has signed to compete at Hawaii and swam on the team’s state championship-winning relay team last year, and have a talented group of swimmers including Zac Carter, Ross McConnell, Sid Estes, Victor Werner and Cameron Kroeker and will be competitive in the team standings. \nAlso in the GVC: McMinnville has won the past two district championships and has the swimmers to make it three straight. \nMid-Willamette Conference: South Albany and Lebanon should contend for the district championship. Silverton has huge numbers and a young team including junior Jason Orr and could make noise this year. \n4A/3A/2A/1A Special District 3 : Salem Academy was the surprise district champion a year ago and has the swimmers to do it again including Wilson McLean, Caleb Warde, Davis McHugh, Elijah Leutwyler and Ian Schultz. Girls swimming Greater Valley Conference \nMcKay: The Royal Scots didn’t have swimmer make it past the prelims of the district meet last season. \nMcNary: The Celtics have a star swimmer in junior Marissa Kuch, a state placer in each of the past two years and a young group who give the team promise. \nNorth Salem: The Vikings have a promising young squad. \nSouth Salem: The Saxons are the defending district champions and with swimmers like Anna Despain, Joanna Zuckerman, Jamie Zuckerman and Victoria Privalova will contend for the team title again. \nSprague: The Olympians have an emerging star in Isabelle Dolezal. \nWest Salem: With a team including senior Hannah Bodkin, who has signed to compete at Dixie State, headlines a deep team with swimmers like Miranda Davis, Brianna Otterstrom, Malia Masei, Corrine Northcutt, Ellie Dacar – and benefits from the transfer of Charis Duffus from Sprague – the Titans should compete for the district title. \nAlso in the GVC: McMinnville was a close second place in the GVC last year and will be one of the team favorites. Forest Grove has a young, but talented team and should be competitive. \nMid-Willamette Conference: A Crescent Valley team that placed fourth in the state a year ago returns all of its state meet scorers and will be tough to beat. Dallas has a strong swimmer in Jolie-Rae Ford. \n4A/3A/2A/1A Special District 3: Sweet Home has been the dominant team in the conference and will continue to do so. Blanchet has a host of younger swimmers who should put the team in contention, as does Salem Academy. 123 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "title": "All-American pick-up trucks aim to lure China's wealthy",
      "text": "A \nGUANGZHOU, China: Automakers Ford and General Motors are aiming the pick-up truck, an iconic staple in the United States, at upmarket buyers in China, where most associate trucks with farmers and construction workers. \n\"The Chinese call it pika, pika - a very low-end worker's (vehicle). But the (Ford F-150) Raptor is totally different,\" said Wesley Liu, Ford's Asia-Pacific sales director, ahead of this month's Guangzhou autoshow. \nTrucks are largely restricted to overnight driving in most Chinese cities, but four provinces - Yunnan, Liaoning, Hebei and Henan - have this year launched trial programmes allowing them into urban zones in an attempt to stimulate production as economic growth, and car sales, slow. \nWith those looser restrictions, U.S. pick-up makers aim to distance their trucks from local models made by Great Wall Motor , Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) and others - and appeal to Chinese premium buyers, like Meng Shuo. \nThe 32-year-old founder of an investment consultancy, who already owned a Chevrolet Camaro when he bought an F-150 pick-up truck five years ago through an unofficial grey market importer. He has since traded it in for a Toyota Tundra, and also owns a Mercedes luxury sedan and Porsche and Mitsubishi sports cars. \nFord said in April it would bring a high-performance version of its F-series - the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 34 years - to China, the world's biggest auto market. A spokesman said the company is studying whether to also bring a mass-market model such as the F-150 or Ranger pick-up to China, depending on demand and future regulations. \n\"The people who buy the Raptor maybe own some other premium vehicle already. This is another toy,\" Liu said. \nThe truck is aimed at four types of buyers, he said - the wealthy, who want to stand out from the crowd; business owners, who want more than a traditional commercial vehicle; drivers who want a single car for all situations; and \"gearheads\", who just like the mechanics. \nEven as Chinese authorities throw vast subsidies at green, clean auto technologies, the growing wealth of Chinese consumers has driven a boom in larger cars and sport-utility vehicles (SUV). With margins now under pressure in the crowded SUV sector, automakers see potential profits in high-end foreign pick-ups. \nFord and GM - which displayed its Chevrolet Colorado and Silverado trucks around the Guangzhou show, with t-shirt clad urban cowboys and an all-leather rock band selling the trucks' macho, all-American appeal - have not yet announced prices for their pick-ups, expected to be launched next year. But they should command a sizeable premium to locally made models as China slaps a 25 percent tax on imports. \nPICKING UP \nFor now, pick-ups are a tiny fraction of China's market. \nIHS Markit sees sales increasing by 14 percent this year to 368,791 pick-up trucks, but that would still be only 1.4 percent of China's light vehicle market. \nBy contrast, sales in the U.S. are forecast at 2.7 million pick-ups, about 15 percent of the market. \nYan Ningya, an official involved in the Hebei pilot project, said the province, home to Great Wall and other automakers, accounts for half of China's pick-up production. \nThe trial has not yet resulted in higher production, he told Reuters, but the local government will need a year from the pilot project's launch in May to gauge its impact. \nAfter that, the central government may do more to drive production, possibly reclassifying pick-ups as passenger cars rather than commercial vehicles, he said. \nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which directed the provinces to launch the pilot projects, did not respond to a faxed request for comment. \n\"China's pick-up truck market will be very large in the future,\" said Yan, noting domestic brands would likely upgrade their trucks to meet the tastes of middle-class drivers. \n(Reporting by Jake Spring and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Ian Geoghegan) - Reuters",

      "text": "Ford has revealed four new Fiesta derivatives - Active, Vignale, ST-Line and Titanium and could roll out similarly inspired versions of other models\n\nThe four distinct versions of the new Ford Fiesta serve as an indication of how far Ford can diversify its big-selling small car, says European boss Jim Farley, and if the strategy proves successful, other models in Ford’s range could benefit from it.\n\nAt Tuesday’s launch of the new Fiesta in Cologne, four production variants were revealed: Vignale, Titanium, ST-Line and Active. The expanded line-up is intended to add emotional appeal to the model, push the Fiesta gently upmarket and reinforce the brand’s B-segment offerings under a growing threat from premium car makers entering the category.\n\nTitanium is aimed at traditional Fiesta buyers, albeit with a high-spec to take into account for the fact that the recently revealed Ka+ has slotted in to the range as an option for customers who might have previously considered a lower-spec Fiesta. ST-Line, inspired by Ford Performance, is the sporting offering that is also part of Ford’s “heart and soul”, as Farley puts it.\n\nBut it is the other two offerings, Active and Vignale, that represent the more radical diversions from the traditional Fiesta blueprint.\n\nFarley said that he is particularly intrigued at how the market would receive Fiesta Active “because it is something very new. I can think of a lot of places in the UK and in southern Europe where it will make sense for people – they want the SUV look and the higher ride height for driving and ground clearance”.\n\nSuch customers, he said, didn’t want a full SUV because “it is expensive, doesn’t have great fuel efficiency, they’re heavier vehicles”.\n\nFarley wouldn’t rule out other models in Ford’s range being given an Active makeover, describing Fiesta Active as ‘step one’ in the strategy: “We’re putting our shoulder into the Fiesta Active and we’re really trying to understand the customer, knowing what they visually want visually and in terms of functionality, and I do think that we will continue to look at this.”\n\nFurther Fiesta variants could also be possible if the new line-up succeeds. “I can see some people saying ‘I’d like a combination of ST-Line and Active’,” said Farley.\n\nHe dismissed any suggestion that the Fiesta Active could impinge upon sales of the Ford Ecosport, which endured a troubled birth in Europe but is said to be selling more positively now. “There’s no competition between those products - they are quite different”.\n\nFiesta Vignale variant benefits from a high-spec makeover from Ford’s luxury sub-brand and follows in the footsteps of the posh Vignale-badged versions of the Mondeo, S-Max and Edge.\n\nFarley was confident there is scope for a B-segment car such as the Fiesta to benefit from the high-end and more expensive treatment, which will also come with a raft of after-sales benefits offered by Ford’s larger Vignale models.\n\n“We can do it in scale now because we have Vignale on [other models] so a dealer can really invest money into it,” he said. “We’ve seen it grow now on Mondeo, where it is now close to 10% of the overall sales and on S-Max it is above 10%.” He wouldn’t be drawn on what percentage of Fiesta sales the Vignale derivative might account for, but said: “We have a lot of work between now and next summer to offer Vignale on a Fiesta.”\n\nFarley said the company had proof that customers were open to the prospect of more expensive, well-appointed Ford models due to the number who chose high-spec Titanium trim from the across the wider Ford line-up: “We have customers who want more. When you look at our mix of Titanium in the UK, it is basically becoming our volume model. For example, 70% of the Kugas we sell are Titanium. We have to give people more choice than to have a Titanium.”\n\nThe overarching goal, said Farley, was to offer an alternative to premium brands at a more competitive price.\n\n“We knew we had to make the brand more emotional. We can that with Mustang, but how do we do it with Fiesta? Active, Vignale and ST-Line are ways to do that. We want that pride of ownership that people have with a premium brand, but we can give it to them at a lower price. We just have to execute it in a way that gives people more choice,” he said.",

      "text": "All-American pick-up trucks aim to lure China's wealthy Jake Spring \n* Ford to launch version of F-150 Raptor pick-up truck \n* GM pushes Colorado, Silverado at Guangzhou auto show \n* Government relaxing some city restrictions on trucks \nGUANGZHOU, China, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Automakers Ford and General Motors are aiming the pick-up truck, an iconic staple in the United States, at upmarket buyers in China, where most associate trucks with farmers and construction workers. \n\"The Chinese call it pika, pika - a very low-end worker's (vehicle). But the (Ford F-150) Raptor is totally different,\" said Wesley Liu, Ford's Asia-Pacific sales director, ahead of this month's Guangzhou autoshow. \nTrucks are largely restricted to overnight driving in most Chinese cities, but four provinces - Yunnan, Liaoning, Hebei and Henan - have this year launched trial programmes allowing them into urban zones in an attempt to stimulate production as economic growth, and car sales, slow. \nWith those looser restrictions, U.S. pick-up makers aim to distance their trucks from local models made by Great Wall Motor , Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) and others - and appeal to Chinese premium buyers, like Meng Shuo. \nThe 32-year-old founder of an investment consultancy, who already owned a Chevrolet Camaro when he bought an F-150 pick-up truck five years ago through an unofficial grey market importer. He has since traded it in for a Toyota Tundra, and also owns a Mercedes luxury sedan and Porsche and Mitsubishi sports cars. \nFord said in April it would bring a high-performance version of its F-series - the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 34 years - to China, the world's biggest auto market. A spokesman said the company is studying whether to also bring a mass-market model such as the F-150 or Ranger pick-up to China, depending on demand and future regulations. \n\"The people who buy the Raptor maybe own some other premium vehicle already. This is another toy,\" Liu said. \nThe truck is aimed at four types of buyers, he said - the wealthy, who want to stand out from the crowd; business owners, who want more than a traditional commercial vehicle; drivers who want a single car for all situations; and \"gearheads\", who just like the mechanics. \nEven as Chinese authorities throw vast subsidies at green, clean auto technologies, the growing wealth of Chinese consumers has driven a boom in larger cars and sport-utility vehicles (SUV). With margins now under pressure in the crowded SUV sector, automakers see potential profits in high-end foreign pick-ups. \nFord and GM - which displayed its Chevrolet Colorado and Silverado trucks around the Guangzhou show, with t-shirt clad urban cowboys and an all-leather rock band selling the trucks' macho, all-American appeal - have not yet announced prices for their pick-ups, expected to be launched next year. But they should command a sizeable premium to locally made models as China slaps a 25 percent tax on imports. \nPICKING UP \nFor now, pick-ups are a tiny fraction of China's market. \nIHS Markit sees sales increasing by 14 percent this year to 368,791 pick-up trucks, but that would still be only 1.4 percent of China's light vehicle market. \nBy contrast, sales in the U.S. are forecast at 2.7 million pick-ups, about 15 percent of the market. \nYan Ningya, an official involved in the Hebei pilot project, said the province, home to Great Wall and other automakers, accounts for half of China's pick-up production. \nThe trial has not yet resulted in higher production, he told Reuters, but the local government will need a year from the pilot project's launch in May to gauge its impact. \nAfter that, the central government may do more to drive production, possibly reclassifying pick-ups as passenger cars rather than commercial vehicles, he said. \nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which directed the provinces to launch the pilot projects, did not respond to a faxed request for comment. \n\"China's pick-up truck market will be very large in the future,\" said Yan, noting domestic brands would likely upgrade their trucks to meet the tastes of middle-class drivers. \n(Reporting by Jake Spring and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Ian Geoghegan) SHOW COMMENTS",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind   \nFord is planning to take its self-driving car technology onto European roads next year as part of its ambitious plan to launch a fully autonomous car for ride-hailing services by 2021. \nTrials will start at its Engineering Center in Essex, U.K., followed by additional testing at its Research & Advanced Engineering facilities in both Aachen and Cologne in Germany, the car giant told TechCrunch this week. \nFord said the teams at the testing locations are already up to speed with the company’s autonomous driving technology, which made choosing the new sites easy. \nCommenting on the announcement, Ford’s Thomas Lukaszewicz said the broad range of traffic conditions in countries across the pond will help the company to hone its technology. \n“It’s important that we extend our testing to Europe,”Lukaszewicz said. “Rules of the road vary from country to country here; traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.” \nMore: Volvo is planning to let families in London test its self-driving cars \nThe American automaker is already testing its autonomous technology in the U.S. with the aim of launching a self-driving car for ride-hailing services five years from now. The company hopes the Europe-based testing will help pave the way for similar services on the continent soon after. \nThe grand plan is to mass produce an SAE Level 4 self-driving vehicle within five years. For those unfamiliar with SAE levels, “0” is for a car with no automation at all while “5” is fully automated. So Ford’s car will be pretty much completely autonomous, though driver intervention may be required in particularly adverse weather conditions or unusual environments. \nFor its on-road tests the company has been using Ford Fusion Hybrid cars kitted out with a slew of sensors and cameras. The vehicle looks pretty much like any other Fusion Hybrid but for the spinning lidar units on its roof. \nDT’s Stephen Edelstein recently experienced a ride in Ford’s autonomous prototype – find out what he made of it here .

      "text": "Ford boss says securing free trade with EU is 'top priority' CEO Mark Fields says it is important manufacturers in the UK are treated equally as Brexit looms. 07:18, UK, Wednesday 30 November 2016 Image Caption: Ford has been trying to secure a good deal with the EU out of the Brexit negotiations Share on Facebook By Charlotte Lomas-Farley, Business Correspondent The global boss of Ford has told Sky News that securing free trade with the EU is a \"top priority\" and any assurances given by the British government should apply to all car manufacturers. \nFord's chief executive and president, Mark Fields, was speaking at the launch of the next generation Fiesta in Cologne, Germany. \nHe said the company has been proactive in trying to secure a good deal out of the Brexit negotiations. He said: \"Our priority is to have free trade between the UK and the EU because that would be good for both the overall economy of both countries and to secure, for example, a very stable environment for our workers in the UK of which we have over 14,000 and across Europe.\" \nWhen asked about the decision by Nissan to build two of its new models in the UK after reportedly getting assurances from the British government, Mr Fields said that it is important all manufacturers are treated equally. Image Caption: Ford CEO Mark Fields has said Government assurances should apply to all car manufacturers \nHe said: \"What our expectation is, is whatever is given should be given to the entire auto industry to keep that playing field very level.\" \nMr Field added that Ford is committed to the UK and will be watching closely and having ongoing conversations with the Government to see how the process of leaving the EU unfolds next year. \nBut these are turbulent times for international trade, not just in Europe. \nWith Donald Trump coming to power across the pond there is a nervousness among multinationals about what a new wave of protectionism could bring. \nDoug Lippoldt, a senior trade economist at HSBC, said it has not been a kind year for international trade. \nHe said: \"This emergence of an inward looking populism in the US in particular, it's emerged now that we've had the outcome to the vote but also in France there is some discussions about disrupting the existing trade regime. \n\"And I think the most vulnerable in this discussion is the industrial sectors, like manufacturing.\" \nIt comes as the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has published figures looking at what the impact of a 10% tariff on trade with the EU could cost the motor manufacturing industry. \nTheir research shows that it could cost £4.5bn a year, which would push up the average car owners bill by £1,500.

      "text": "Keeping free trade with the European Union must be the priority for the upcoming Brexit negotiations, the chief executive of Ford told CNBC. \n\"What's really important to us is a stable trade environment between obviously the U.K. and the EU and that's our big priority, because we want to continue to build a profitable business and also secure a stable future for our over 14000 employees that we do have in the U.K,\" Mark Fields, president and CEO at Ford Motor Company, said. \nThe U.S. carmaking giant is one of the best examples of how firms based in the U.K. could be impacted from Britain's departure from the EU. Ford's factory in Dagenham supplies diesel engines to the rest of Europe and any hurdles to such supply could affect the business across the member-bloc. \n\"We are obviously monitoring the environment and the developments so we can factor that in our scenarios and at the same time we're being very forward in going to the various governments in the UK and the EU…about what our priorities are and what the impacts this could mean to the economy,\" Fields added. \nData released Tuesday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed that tariffs related to Brexit could add up to £1,500 ($,1871) to the average cost of an imported car.\nJohn Leech, head of automotive for KPMG in the U.K., said in a statement accompanying the SMMT report that \"the UK automotive industry is already the most productive in Europe but faces increasing competition from lower cost countries and uncertainty following the U.K.'s vote to leave the EU.\" \nRecently, the Japanese carmaker Nissan struck a deal with the British government to ensure it would continue investing in the U.K. despite the uncertainty around the Brexit vote. Nissan was unsure whether to proceed with investments in Sunderland after the Brexit vote. \nBoth Nissan and the U.K. government have been criticized for not making public the \"reassurances\" given to the carmaker in exchange for its investment commitment. \n\"I don't know what was given to Nissan,\" Fields told CNBC, indicating that Ford is willing to keep investing in the U.K. but at the expense that free trade with the EU is not disrupted. \n\"We want to contribute to economic development but what is a high priority for us is free trade between the EU and the U.K.,\" he said.",
