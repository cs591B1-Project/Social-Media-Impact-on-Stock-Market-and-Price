      "title": "Use Offline Data to Improve the Customer Experience",
      "text": "Tweet \nOnline retail stores like Amazon and Warby Parker have recently established brick-and-mortar stores to provide physical presences for their online customers. Of course, one of the reasons consumers might enjoy having physical stores available to them is the convenience of being able to buy products online and return them in-store if needed. But, this isn’t the primary reason an online retailer like Amazon would create a physical presence for its customers. A brick-and-mortar store opens more possibilities for omnichannel transactions, offline data collection , improved supply chain, and ultimately, better online and offline customer experiences. \nCollecting Offline Data In addition to the data collected online, stores like Warby Parker or fashion retailer Brooks Brothers can monitor traffic patterns through their stores. For many years, Brooks Brothers had its own somewhat informal way of tracking the types of suits, shirts, or ties its customers wore. But now, more systems are available that revolve around both collecting the types of data that come from direct transactions with consumers and revealing the behaviors of intent to buy. We are now able to build the digital profile. \nOne type of data that marketers can collect from physical stores is dwell time. If a customer is engaged in a particular area of a store, how is he spending that time? Is the experience good, bad, or indifferent? Is he trying to move from one location to another? Is it taking him too long to find what he wants, or is there some type of engaging experience within that particular location of the store that’s driving traffic? Technology has evolved in such a way that store operators who have had the ability to use store trackers to monitor things — such as the moment somebody enters the store and how traffic flows in and out at any given time — now have more granular datasets that enable them to track how long the volume of the store is trafficked within a 60-minute timeframe or that a high percentage of customers stood in a particular department and in front of a specific display. \nChallenges of Offline Data The challenge of offline retail data is that it is transaction-rich but intent-poor. Ninety-two percent of sales go through physical retail channels, but you lose much of the intent data that you get from things like page views, search terms, and how many times somebody linked from a particular blog page. \nWhile not used extensively due to cost and infrastructure challenges, some stores are using RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology on their products. Originally used for loss prevention, the technology enables retailers to track how many times consumers pick up a product or even whether the product was picked up, purchased, and taken from the store, giving retailers a true image of conversion — but, it still isn’t practical across all product categories. It may be feasible on a $500 jacket, but will consumers spend an additional $.011 per box of cereal? So, while the technology provides many possibilities, we have yet to overcome some of the challenges because RFID has still only been applied to a small percentage of all the products in the marketplace. \nOther ways of collecting offline data include iBeacons and near-field communications (NFCs), which allow companies to track the offline behaviors of customers who have opted into a brand’s marketing-communications program. Of course, these types of technologies come with privacy concerns. Many audiences are uncomfortable with companies tracking their movements this way. Therefore, the sample of data can be limited. However, it can provide great insights into the patterns and behaviors of your best customers. \nUsing Data to Improve the Customer Experience Ultimately, however, the data collected — whether online or offline — is about shaping the customer experience. Marketers can use this data to consider how they want to present products through the customer-experience flow. For example, grocery stores often put the dairy section in the back of the store because, if customers want to pick up some milk (what many people visit the grocery store for), they want them to walk through the entire store so they see all the different products before they reach the dairy section. The data collected can inform them of what they want their customers to see as they make their ways to the products they came to buy. \nConvenience is another factor in the customer-experience chain. Through their Cartwheel app, Target is now giving customers the ability to create and save shopping lists. Then, the app guides customers through the store to the products on their lists, improving efficiency and helping customers get in and out of the store in less time. \nFrom a store-operations perspective, the data can also inform and help store management and operations in terms of departmental support and staff management. Of course, this is going to be more relevant to a big-box, larger-footprint retailer. \nLeveraging Offline Data for the Online Experience Offline data can also be leveraged to enrich the online experience, where the online experience — while it has its nuances and benefits from a convenience standpoint — is challenged with regard to product interaction and shopping environment; sight, sound, and smell. Marketers need to make sure the customer experience is seamless between all channels. \nFor instance, if a customer visits a brick-and-mortar store on the weekend, and then visits the website or receives a communication from its email program on Tuesday morning, those interactions should complement one another. Something as simple as a postcard can drive an online/offline campaign, connecting online customers to brick-and-mortar stores and vice versa. \nWhile offline data has traditionally been more difficult to accurately track, it’s easy to see that we are at an interesting point with technology in which we can better understand consumer behaviors in physical retail locations by combining online technology with in-store action. #customer experience #Customer Experiences #offline data Michael Klein \nMichael Klein is the Director of Industry Strategy for the Adobe Marketing Cloud.

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 2 minutes ago with 1 comment Image: Amazon \nMost of us are quite content with our flash drives and external hard disks when we need to move large amounts of data around. But what happens if you’re a huge research institution like CERN, or a gigantic company that needs to upload hundreds of petabytes of data to the cloud? It used to be quite a complicated problem, but now Amazon has an easy answer. \nThe largest cloud company in the world has just unveiled its latest product. No, it’s not some new sort of processor, or e-reader , or voice assistant . It’s a big truck, that will come by your place of business, pick up your data and store it in the cloud. Called the “Snowmobile”, the large truck features a mobile datacenter that can pack in as much as 100 petabytes of data. \nIt turns out, going down the highway, is the most efficient, not to mention fastest, way to send such massive amounts of data in today’s world. Even with a gigabit connection uploading 100 petabytes would take many years, so having a truck pull up to your datacenter is much more economical. \nAmazon hasn’t release any pricing details just yet, though the company is aiming the project at researchers and large companies. The company did say its service would be both faster and less expensive than a network-based transfer model, though that’s obviously not saying much.",

      "text": "Tweet \nFollowing the massive attack that took down the servers of the DNS service provider Dyn and a number of high profile websites including Netflix, Twitter, Spotify and Reddit last month, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced a new technology to protect sites against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. \nThe new tool, which is called AWS Shield, was announced at the company's re:Invent developer event in Las Vegas. Amazon's own site was affected by the attack on Dyn and the company has now decided to launch its own DDoS protection service to ensure that its site and those that use AWS are able to withstand future attacks. \nAWS Shield will be available in two levels with the first, called AWS Standard, providing users with basic integrated DDoS protection. It will be enabled by default for all AWS customers and those looking for further protection will be able to upgrade to the premium version of the service called AWS Shield Advanced. \nAWS offers more details regarding the premium version of its DDoS protection service on its site , saying: \"For higher levels of protection against attacks targeting your web applications running on Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon Route 53 resources, you can subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. In addition to the common network and transport layer protections that come with Standard, AWS Shield Advanced provides additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near real-time visibility into attacks, and integration with AWS WAF, a web application firewall\". \nDuring the announcement of AWS Shield, Amazon's chief technology officer Werner Vogels praised the new service, saying: \"I think this will really help you protect yourselves even against the largest and most sophisticated attacks that we've seen out there.” \nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication.

      "title": "Amazon Ramps Up Cloud Position as Rivals Emerge (AMZN, MSFT) - Investopedia",
      "text": "Amazon Ramps Up Cloud Position as Rivals Emerge (AMZN, MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus | December 5, 2016 — 5:04 AM EST \nAmazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) completed its 2016 AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas last week by introducing a group of new tools for cloud developers and application builders aimed at fighting off cloud threats from the likes of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) and Alphabet, Inc. ( GOOGL ). \nAmazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy kicked off the event on Wednesday by discussing the big bets the e-commerce giant is making on next-generation technology, including tons of new cloud updates and artificial intelligence tools that will boost Amazon's portfolio of services. (See also: AWS CEO: 55% YOY Growth 'Just the Beginning' .) \nJassy talked about Amazon Recognition, which provides image recognition, categorization and facial analysis in batch analysis or real time. As an example, he explained how the facial analysis can detect a sentiment and tell whether the subject is wearing glasses. Then there's Amazon Polly, the company's text-to-speech (TTS) service that is powered by the company's deep learning technology . TTS is able to take typed text and convert it to MP3 audio that can sound like a real conversation. \nAlso on the horizon is a service called Amazon Lex, which according to Jassy will provide natural language understanding and automatic speech recognition. If that sounds familiar, it's because Amazon Lex powers Alexa, the company's popular smart-home speaker. \nNot to be outdone, during his keynote address Thursday, Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon Web Services, unveiled new tools for system management, application development and security. With a new product called AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate, Vogels explained how Amazon aims to give users more integration with infrastructure automation. \nEssentially, the new tool allows cloud developers and application builders more flexibility with system management by reducing areas of their job that are known to cause pain. In short, Amazon is addressing the needs not only of the users, but also system administrators and developers. And despite the narrowing of its cloud lead over Microsoft, Amazon – by doubling down on its tools and features – is still setting the standard for others to follow.

      "text": "Extreme Stacking the Lowe’s Amex Offer: 20% off Amazon, Delta, Disney, StubHub, and more. December 5, 2016 \nLast week we posted a number of new Amex Offers including Lowe’s Spend $50, Get $10 Back . \nHopefully you jumped on that deal right away. After seeing this Quick Deal (published by Shawn), I logged into Amex and used the multi-browser trick ( details here ) to load the offer to all 21 of my family’s Amex cards. \nHopefully you also followed the advice I laid out in the post “ Holiday giving and getting: Prepare now ,” where I described ways to increase the number of Amex cards you have that are eligible for Amex Offers. \nI’m not sure, but my guess is that this offer is no longer available if you haven’t already loaded it to your account. \nFor those who were able to load the offer, here are my thoughts about how best to use it… Offer Details Spend $50 or more in one or more transactions by 12/31/2016 and get $10 back (statement credit) Not valid for e-gift card purchases Valid at any participating location in the US. \nThe offer doesn’t specifically say that it is valid online at Lowes.com, but I tested out a $50 by-mail gift card offer and received the expected email “ Great news! You just used your Amex Offer “. That proves that online orders are fine. Buying Lowe’s Stuff \nIf your goal is to buy stuff from Lowe’s, you can maximize this deal as follows: Click through the current best portal for Lowes ( found here ). At the time of this writing, TopCashBack is offering 6% cash back. Buy a $50 physical by-mail gift card (do NOT buy an e-gift card!) Pay with an Amex card enrolled in this offer. Repeat each step above for each enrolled Amex card. \nAt minimum, the above steps will give you 20% off Lowe’s Gift Cards. Hopefully you’ll also earn portal cash back. Unfortunately the Frequent Miler Laboratory does not have recent reports of whether or not this works. I’m currently testing this and will edit this post once I have results. \nIf the portal works and you earn 6% cash back, then you’ll have bought these cards for 26% off. Pretty good! \nOnce you have the gift cards in hand, refer to our old post “ Extreme savings at Lowes ,” for details of how to save a lot more. Some of the techniques may be out of date, but I’ll do my best to update that post as readers give feedback about what works and what doesn’t. Buying stuff elsewhere via 3rd party gift cards \nIf you’re not interested in extreme savings at Lowe’s, consider instead that Lowe’s sells a huge variety of gift cards in-store. You can easily save 20% off these gift cards, as follows: Bring all of your enrolled Amex cards to Lowe’s Pick out gift cards with values adding up to $50 x the number of Amex cards you enrolled. For example, if you have four cards enrolled in the Lowe’s offer, then you can get 20% off of $200 worth of gift cards. When checking out, tell the cashier that you want to “split tender” and pay $50 with one card, $50 with another, etc. \nHere are examples of gift cards you can buy: Department store gift cards: Notice the Style Anywhere card? This one has a small fee, but can be used at any department store as well as most discount stores (like Walmart) Grocery, Travel, Pets, Crafts, and more: You can get 20% off Delta, Southwest, Disney, Whole Foods, … Great options! Restaurants: Amazon, movies, music, more: \nIf you go with Amazon, don’t forget that you can stack these 20% savings with the new option to earn 3X points per dollar from JetBlue! 17% off anything \nLowe’s sells several types of Visa and MasterCard gift cards that can be used almost anywhere: \nFees for $200 Visa gift cards hover around 3%. With 20% back, you’ll still clear roughly a 17% discount! And, don’t forget that the Five Back Visa gift card offers the ability to earn additional rebates when using the card!

      "title": "Amazon Launches AI Platform For Developers",
      "text": "Share \nAmazon announced last week the launch of its new Amazon AI platform, which brings machine-learning technologies to developers. \nAccording to a report by TechCrunch , Amazon launched the Amazon AI platform at its re:Invent developer event held in Las Vegas. In the beginning, the new service will make three tools available for developers, but more will be included in the future. While Amazon doesn’t tout all of its work in machine learning, the company said it does a lot of it behind the scenes. “We do a lot of AI in our company,” said Amazon Web Services Chief Executive Andy Jassy, according to the report. “We have thousands of people dedicated to AI in our business.” \nOne of the tools Amazon is rolling out under the new Amazon AI platform is an image recognition service that recognizes objects and scenes and falls under its Rekognition umbrella. Amazon said the system can even pinpoint the breed of a dog in an image, something its competitors don’t do, noted the report. \nAnother tool being rolled out under the new platform is Amazon Polly, which is a text-to-speech service that can produce speech that sounds lifelike. “Polly was designed to address many of the more challenging aspects of speech generation,” Amazon said, according to the report. “For example, consider the difference in pronunciation of the word ‘live’ in the phrases ‘I live in Seattle’ and ‘Live from New York.’ Polly knows that this pair of homographs are spelled the same but are pronounced quite differently.” \nThe final tool — and one that powers Amazon’s Alexa, its personal assistant — is known as Lex and allows developers to create conversational applications. “You can use Amazon Lex to build chatbots and other types of web and mobile applications that support engaging, lifelike interactions,” Amazon said, according to the report. “Your bots can provide information, power your application, streamline work activities or provide a control mechanism for robots, drones and toys.”",

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: December 5, 2016 5:15 PM Launchpad is already available in the US, UK, China, Germany, France and Mexico. (Source: Reuters) \nE-commerce giant Amazon today rolled out its global programme ‘Launchpad’ in India to provide startups in the country a platform to market, sell and deliver products across the globe. India is the seventh country where Amazon Launchpad has been made available, and the platform, “tailormade” for startups, is available for a fee of Rs 5,000 a month. \nLaunchpad is already available in the US, UK, China, Germany, France and Mexico. \nThrough the Launchpad page startups and entrepreneurs can sell products on a global scale, overcoming general marketplace challenges like requirements of large investments to get noticed and loss of margins in channels, the company said. \nAmazon Launchpad will offer startups and small enterprises access to custom pages where sellers can showcase their products through photos and videos, marketing support to help product discovery, and access to Amazon’s global customer base. \nIt has tied up with various partners including DIPP’s (Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion) Start Up India initiative, Nasscom 10,000 startups and Indian Angel Network. \n“India is a unique place…the connection to the startup community is rich in India…as a startup comes to us, we will help them launch not just in India but also get access to global markets spanning the US, UK, France, Germany,” Jason Feldman, Director Global Innovations, Amazon said at a conference here. \nThe Launchpad store on Amazon.in has over 400 products ranging from wearable technology, smart homes, food and beverages, health monitoring and educational toys among others. \nOver 25 Indian startups including Witworks, Leaf Wearables, Ducere Technologies, and Seventh Sense Technologies, have already joined the programme, the company said.

      "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif.- Dell EMC:\nNews Summary:\nDell EMC extends capabilities of its industry-leading data protection solutions to support workloads on Amazon Web Services Dell EMC NetWorker with CloudBoost supports protection of applications running on Amazon Web Services Native data tiering to Amazon S3 enabled with Dell EMC Data Domain for economical long-term data retention Full Story:\nDell EMC has announced availability of a new Dell EMC NetWorker with CloudBoost solution for added protection of enterprise applications running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as well as the extension of the industry-leading i Data Domain protection storage platform to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).\nDell EMC is a global leader in enabling businesses and service providers to transform their operations and deliver information technology as a service. The cloud is fundamental to this transformation. Through innovative products, services and partnerships, Dell EMC accelerates the journey to the cloud, helping IT departments to manage, protect and analyze their most valuable asset — information — in a more agile, trusted and cost-efficient way.\nNetWorker with CloudBoost – Added Protection for Enterprise Applications Running on AWS\nNetWorker with CloudBoost provides a complete enterprise-grade backup solution for applications running on AWS. NetWorker with CloudBoost can run completely self-contained within an AWS environment and includes client-side optimized backups, inline de-duplication, encryption and compression with backup directly to Amazon S3.\nNetWorker can enable both new and existing enterprise customers to leverage Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Standard – Infrequent Access (Standard – IA) designed to protect their AWS workloads utilizing the familiar tools and interfaces available within their on-premises environment.\n“The availability of Dell EMC NetWorker with CloudBoost on AWS is a particularly exciting announcement for all of the customers who have come to depend on Dell EMC solutions for data protection in their on-premises environments,” said Bill Vass, Vice President, Technology, Amazon Web Services, Inc. “Now these customers can get the same data protection experience on AWS, providing seamless operational backup and recovery, and long-term retention across all of their environments.”\nA single NetWorker with CloudBoost environment can span use cases such as extending on-premises data protection to the cloud for long term retention, direct-to-cloud data protection, and in-the-cloud data protection where all components – backup clients, NetWorker components, and CloudBoost appliance – are fully supported to run on AWS.\nData Domain Cloud Tier – Long-Term Retention for the Modern Data Center with Data Domain and Amazon S3\nDell EMC Data Domain consolidates backup, archive and disaster recovery all on a single system and is the industry leader in protection storage with greater than 60% market share ii . By leveraging variable-length deduplication, Data Domain systems are able to reduce the amount of disk storage needed to retain and protect data by up to 30x. With Data Domain Cloud Tier, customers can now natively tier data to Amazon S3 for long-term retention. Only unique data is sent directly from Data Domain to the cloud and data lands on the cloud object storage already de-duplicated for a highly efficient and cost-effective solution.\n“Our collaboration with Amazon Web Services allows us to follow through on our commitment to protect all of our customer’s data, regardless of where it resides,” said Russ Stockdale, Vice President of Data Protection Cloud at Dell EMC. “For those customers looking to utilize Amazon S3 storage for long-term retention, we can now offer a native tiering experience within Data Domain.”\nBusinesses today are faced with explosive data growth, strict retention policies, and pressure to reduce costs. IT is increasingly looking to low-cost, high capacity object storage in the cloud as a way to address these challenges. Data Domain Cloud Tier provides best-of-breed technology that can allow businesses to gain the advantages of cloud economics with a seamless data management experience on- and off-premise. Data Domain with Cloud Tier offers long-term retention for the modern data center that is simple, efficient and open.\nDell EMC is a Bronze sponsor of AWS re:Invent, November 28 th through December 2 nd 2016 in Las Vegas. Visit us in booth number 947 to learn more about EMC’s additional data protection solutions for Amazon Web Services.\nAvailability:\nBoth NetWorker with CloudBoost and Data Domain Cloud Tier are available for purchase today.\nDell EMC\nDell EMC , a part of Dell Technologies , enables organizations to modernize, automate and transform their data center using industry-leading converged infrastructure, servers, storage and data protection technologies.

Customers can just grab the items and leave. Watch the video below to see how the future of shopping looks like. Don't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals \nCustomers enter the store identified with the Amazon shopping app. Machine learning and sensors used in autonomous cars are used to identify the items people put in their shopping bag. When they leave the receipt is displayed on the app and the payment is automatically processed via the customer's Amazon account. \nAmazon Go is a new kind of store featuring the world’s most advanced shopping technology. No lines, no checkout, the online giant says in a statement. \nAmazon has setup brick-and-mortar locations recently to sell books and Amazon devices. The new Amazon Go stores are set to compete with grocery stores. The Amazon Go technology removes the need for store employees handling the register. There are only people necessary to restock. Amazon is likely already on robots doing that job too. A security guy might be necessary to keep the stores and customers safe.",

      "text": "Amazon just unveiled details of a new brick-and-mortar convenience store that will let shoppers pick up items off the shelves and leave without standing in line to pay.\nThe new store, dubbed “Amazon Go,” is currently in testing with the company’s employees in Seattle, and scheduled to open to the public in early 2017. It’s part of a broader push by the company into physical retail, blending elements of the online and real worlds.\n“Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,” the company says on an FAQ page for the Amazon Go store.\n“Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.”\nSee an Amazon video above explaining the concept. The store is located at 2131 7th Ave. in Seattle, on the corner of 7th Avenue and Blanchard Street. The company is separately planning a drive-up grocery store in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood and other locations.\nDeveloping story, more to come. ",

Amazon Go, a retail space located in the company’s hometown of Seattle, lets shoppers just grab the items they want and leave; the order gets charged to their Amazon account afterwards.\nAmazon Go works by using computer vision and sensors to detect what items you’re taking out of the store. You start by scanning an app as you enter the Amazon Go shop. As you leave, the sensors at the door identifies the items in your cart and charges them to your account as your phone passes back out the door.\nThe shop will stock most items you’d find in a local convenience store: snacks, pre-made food, and grocery essentials like bread and milk. It’ll also sell Blue Apron-like meal kits that let you cook your own dinners for two.\nOn the consumer level, the benefits are obvious – but for Amazon, it could potentially track you and your phone as you browse the store to track items you buy, what you were potentially interested in buying, and items you may have noticed in stores. Combine this with your Amazon.com browsing activities and it may gear up to serve even more recommended products wherever you’re online.\nThe store is currently open in beta to Amazon employees only. A public opening is scheduled for early 2017.",

      "text": "Amazon \nAmazon is breaking into physical retail in a new way. \nThe online retail giant revealed a new kind of physical store concept in a video published on Monday. \nThe store, called Amazon Go , doesn't work like a typical Walmart or supermarket — instead, shoppers use an app, also called Amazon Go, to scan the products they plan to buy, then they can walk out of the building without waiting in a a checkout line. \nThe idea is that Amazon's machine learning technology can automatically identify when a product is added to your cart, so you don't have to do it yourself. When you leave the store, Amazon automatically charges your Amazon account. \nThe stores will sell ready-made food, staples like bread and milk, and other grocery products. Amazon says their stores are about 1,800 square feet, so they are relatively small compared to big supermarkets. Business Insider previously reported that Amazon has a vision of 1000 groceries across the US in the next decade. \nThe first Amazon Go store is located in Seattle, Washington, and it will open to the public in early 2017. \nHere's what it's like to shop in one: Amazon Go sells prepared foods and other grocery staples. Amazon Everyone who shops needs an Amazon Go app. You scan a QR code when you walk in. Amazon You scan the app on a futuristic turnstile when you enter the store. Amazon Everything you add to your bag is automatically added to your cart — it'll even know if you put something back. Amazon When you're done shopping, you can simply walk out of the store. Amazon The store will automatically charge the credit card on your Amazon account and send a receipt to your phone. Amazon The first store is in downtown Seattle and opens to the public in early 2017.

      "text": "Amazon has staked out a new venue for making retail super convenient: Corner stores. \nThe e-commerce technology company announced on Monday a new Seattle location, Amazon Go, that has no registers. Instead, shoppers scan into the store with their Amazon Go app, shop as normal, and leave the store with the items billed to their Amazon.com account. \nWhile some stores have used a wedding-registry technique to allow this kind of shopping, Amazon takes it one step further. Using computer vision — the kind of technology that lets self-driving cars \"see\" — the store recognizes the user, making it unnecessary to individually scan items. \nAccording to the Seattle Times , the 1,800 square-foot store, featuring ready-to-eat meals and snacks, is open to Amazon employees participating in a testing program. CNBC has reached out to Amazon for more information.",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nAmazon Amazon is no stranger to bundling their products. \nIt's a way to get you into their ecosystem, or partner with third parties they like.\nUsually these discounts are OK, and can be filed under \"well, I was going to buy these products anyway, might as well get the deal.\"\nIn this case, though, Amazon is providing a substantial discount when buying the Echo Tap and Fire HD 8. Individually, these products cost $129.99 and $89.99, respectively. Amazon is currently selling them both for $129.99.\nThat means if you've been wanting a way to start your smart home, get a Bluetooth speaker,  and  buy a tablet, you're all covered. \nThe Echo Tap stands out in the Echo line because it's portable. Its siblings, the full-sized Echo and Echo Dot need to be plugged in at all times. It's still just as smart, though, so when you're home you can use it to control a whole lot of smart home gadgets. \nAmazon's Fire HD 8 is on the higher end of the Fire tablet spectrum. It has the same screen resolution as its smaller sibling, the HD 6 , but is overall more powerful. Better yet, it was just updated recently , with upgraded components to make the experience of using it even smoother. \nIt's fairly common for Amazon to discount or bundle their products, but I've never seen them release one that's this good a value. If you want either one of these products, you should take advantage of it; if you want both, it's a no-brainer.\nAmazon Echo Tap and Fire HD 8 Bundle, $129.99    [$210 if bought separately] \n",

      "text": "RESERVE VOUCHER \nAmazon Go is powered by a combination of computer vision, sensors and machine learning, packaged up into something the company calls “Just Walk Out technology.” \nThis means that it can determine whenever you pick something up and put it into your cart. It can also tell when you put something back. \nRight now, Amazon Go is currently being trialled in a brand new, 1,800 square-foot supermarket in Downtown Seattle, found on the corner of Seventh Avenue and Blanchard Street. It’s currently only open to Amazon employees involved in the trial, but the company expects to open it to the public by 2017. \nAmazon says that the supermarket will sell ready-to-eat meals and snacks prepared by on-site chefs or local bakeries. It will also sell essentials like bread and milk, as well as well-known brands, and high-end cheese and chocolate. \nAlso on offer will be special culinary kits created by Amazon, which will allow you to create an impressive meal for two in just thirty minutes. \nSo, yes. This is pretty exciting stuff. It means that you’ll no longer spend your lunch hours waiting to pay for the tuna mayo sandwich you just picked up. I imagine that the tech will come in handy at airports and train stations, where people are often pressed for time. \nBut we should also dampen our enthusiasm with the knowledge that this technology has the potential to put thousands of people out of work. Yes, on a technological level, it’s rather cool. But there’s a human consequence to advancements like this.",

But in addition to revolutionizing online shopping, the tech giant is making moves in brick and mortar.\nSEE ALSO: Amazon just unveiled its most impressive tech yet, and it's an actual truck\nOn Monday, the tech giant unveiled Amazon Go , its new initiative for in-store shopping. The first store opened in Seattle, Amazon's headquarters and offers breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.\nAt Amazon's stores, customers don't need to wait in line or checkout formally. There are no cashiers. Customers simply use Amazon's new Go app.\nThe store is powered by what Amazon has dubbed its \"Just Walk Out\" technology, which includes computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning.\n\"We created the world’s most advanced shopping technology so you never have to wait in line. With our Just Walk Out Shopping experience, simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products you want, and go! No lines, no checkout,\" a description of the project reads.\nFor now, the store is only open to Amazon employees who are participating in a testing program, according to the Seattle Times. It is expected to open to all in early 2017.\nBONUS: This coin-sorting wallet will save you from fumbling with change",

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nAmazon \nAmazon is no stranger to bundling their products. \nIt's a way to get you into their ecosystem, or partner with third parties they like. \nUsually these discounts are OK, and can be filed under \"well, I was going to buy these products anyway, might as well get the deal.\" \nIn this case, though, Amazon is providing a substantial discount when buying the Echo Tap and Fire HD 8. Individually, these products cost $129.99 and $89.99, respectively. Amazon is currently selling them both for $129.99. \nThat means if you've been wanting a way to start your smart home, get a Bluetooth speaker, and buy a tablet, you're all covered. \nThe Echo Tap stands out in the Echo line because it's portable. Its siblings, the full-sized Echo and Echo Dot need to be plugged in at all times. It's still just as smart, though, so when you're home you can use it to control a whole lot of smart home gadgets. \nAmazon's Fire HD 8 is on the higher end of the Fire tablet spectrum. It has the same screen resolution as its smaller sibling, the HD 6 , but is overall more powerful. Better yet, it was just updated recently , with upgraded components to make the experience of using it even smoother. \nIt's fairly common for Amazon to discount or bundle their products, but I've never seen them release one that's this good a value. If you want either one of these products, you should take advantage of it; if you want both, it's a no-brainer. \nAmazon Echo Tap and Fire HD 8 Bundle, $129.99 [$210 if bought separately] Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

      "title": "Amazon Unveils 'Self-driving' Brick-and-Mortar Convenience Store",
      "text": "  @10:20AM from the glimpse-of-future dept. Amazon announced Monday it has built a convenience store in downtown Seattle that deploys a gaggle of technologies similar to those used in self-driving cars to allow shoppers to come in, grab items and walk out without going through a register (Editor's note: the link could be paywalled; alternate source ). From a report on Seattle Times: The 1,800 square-foot store, officially dubbed \"Amazon Go,\" is the latest beach in brick-and-mortar retail stormed by the e-commerce giant, which already has bookstores and is working on secretive drive-through grocery locations. It's clearly a sign that Amazon sees a big opportunity in revolutionizing the staid traditions of Main Street commerce. Located on the corner of Seventh Avenue and Blanchard Street, the store is open to Amazon employees participating in a testing program. It is expected to be open to the public in early 2017.",

As you leave, the sensors at the door identify the items in your cart and charge them to your account as your phone passes back out the door.\n\nThe shop will stock most items you’d find in a local convenience store: snacks, drinks, premade food like salads and sandwiches, and grocery essentials like bread and milk....",

Subscribe Atlassian Moves Closer To Taking On CRM Leaders Like Salesforce With New Service Tools \nAmazon seems to believe in the principle of disrupting its own business before someone else does. After launching various services such as Trusted Advisor that help customers save millions of dollars, it is in the process of pushing a new paradigm that has the potential to become an alternative it to its cash cow – Amazon EC2. \nFor any cloud provider, compute, and storage, are the essential drivers of the revenue. Virtual machines are responsible for delivering the compute service in the cloud. When enterprises move complex workloads to the cloud, they will start spinning up beefy virtual machines which directly contribute to the bottom line. That’s one of the reasons why Amazon, Microsoft, and Google keep introducing powerful VM types. \nWith the rise of Docker, the focus has shifted to container images as the fundamental unit of deployment. Though containers run inside a VM, they are becoming the preferred mechanism to expose compute to outside world. Containers as a Service (CaaS) delivers an aggregate pool of resources by abstracting the underlying VMs. Today, many cloud providers offer VMs and container environments as the compute service to customers. \nAmazon's approach to computing is moving in a different direction. While continuing its investments in VMs and containers, the company is aggressively pushing the agenda of serverless computing. AWS Lambda, which was announced a couple of years ago at the re:Invent event is the serverless computing layer from Amazon. Since its launch, the service has matured with the addition of languages, capabilities, tooling, and the integration with other AWS services. \nThough there were many announcements from Amazon’s annual user conference, AWS re:Invent 2016, the updates related to AWS Lambda caught the attention of developers and customers. Amazon is taking Lambda to places which no one ever expected. \nHere is a quick summary of Lambda related announcements from re:Invent: Lambda supports C# Lambda comes to IoT devices and hubs Lambda is embedded in Snowball Lambda integrates with CloudFront Lambda supports tracing through X-Ray Step Functions bring orchestration to Lambda \nBy adding C# support to Lambda, Amazon wants to attract those Microsoft shops with massive investments in .NET. It exploited the opportunity that came in the form of open source .NET called .NET Core. Non-Windows developers using Linux and macOS will also be able to develop serverless applications on Lambda. AWS has created tools that integrate with open source .NET to easily develop and deploy Lambda functions from the command line. I think this is one of smartest moves by Amazon to beat Microsoft on its home turf. \nApart from embedding .NET Core, it also built a set of tools for Visual Studio which make the process of deploying C# functions to Lambda incredibly simple. It was not a coincidence that Microsoft announced Visual Studio tooling for Azure Functions, the AWS Lambda competitor on Microsoft’s public cloud, on the same day as re:Invent. ",

      "text": "If you ask me, the worst part of shopping is waiting on a slowly-moving, seemingly-never-ending checkout line. Amazon might agree, as today (Dec. 5) it announced Amazon Go, a new grocery store that lets customers skip the payment line, almost as if they were stealing the products in their bags. \nIntroducing Amazon Go \nCurrently in a beta program and only open to the company's employees, Amazon Go uses a mix of sensors, computer vision and what it calls \"deep learning\" to know when you've added something to your bag. The company calls this its Just Walk Out shopping experience, and it will only require you to scan the Amazon Go app when you enter the store, and it will charge you when you leave. \n\nWhile you shop, the store will monitor what you take off the shelf and what you put back, and charge you for what you keep at the end of the experience. The 1,880-square-foot store will open to the public in early 2017, and Amazon says it will be \"conveniently compact,\" which we hope doesn't end up resulting in a too-tight shopping experience. \n\nMORE: The Best Holiday Tech Deals \nAmazon go appears to offer the same products you can find in the average Whole Foods or other high-end market, including ready-to-eat mealse, staples such as bread and milk and those always costly \"artisan cheeses and locally made chocolates.\" Amazon says the store will sell products from well-known brands as well as ones you'll only then discover. \n\nAmazon Go will also compete with services such as Blue Apron, as Amazon Meal Kits pack \"all the ingredients you need to make a meal for two in about 30 minutes.\" \nIf you live in or can can travel to Seattle easily, visit this page to get a notification when the store is open to the public. \nWe hope this experience is as seamless as the promo video describes, despite the fact that today's self-checkout machines don't always quite work like they should. If it's successful, this store could bring IBM's vision of RFID-based shopping (which looked an awful lot like shoplifting) to life. \nSee Also : The Best Shopping Apps for Coupons, Price Comparisons and Deals \n11 Ways to Stay Safe When Shopping Online The Best Last-Minute Gifts Best Holiday Deals: TVs, Speakers, WiFi, Cameras & More About the author Henry T.

      "text": "Amazon Takes $80 off Fire Tablet and Tap When Bought Together, Today Only -... \nFor a decade, Salesforce.com has been both a business application and a development platform. Now, because of the number of its APIs and available adaptors, it’s increasingly being used as an integration hub for the cloud. \nSounds pretty strategic, doesn’t it? Too often, though, Salesforce.com (SFDC) has been managed as “just an app” and all the development work has been thought of as “just adding a feature,” without doing a top-down analysis of the consequences for the rest of IT. When my firm is called in to review larger SFDC instances, we often see the proverbial hallway closet, crammed full of stuff that is going to fall out if you open the door more than a crack. \n[ Also on CIO.com: Essential CRM software features: A savvy buyer's guide ] \nHere are some quick metrics we use when first evaluating an SFDC system configuration for its sustainability and manageability. It’s not that any one of these by itself is an explosion waiting to happen, but each of them contributes to technical debt and the eventual budgetary and data corruption surprises. So here, in no particular order, are some rules of thumb we look out for in an SFDC instance, and why they matter: At least 10 percent of an object’s custom fields should be formulas or roll-ups. Too often, code or child objects are used instead of clever formulas. Code means cost and maintenance. Spurious objects mean UI and reporting ugliness, which means even more code. No object should have more than a handful of validation rules (and ideally, zero). Validation rules are really useful for data quality and process conformance, but they act as fully enforced constraints on writes. This means users will be prevented from saving incomplete pages, which means they will “fill in the blank” to save the page and unwittingly contribute to data pollution. Further, the enforcement of SFDC validation rules causes code to blow up in very ugly ways, which is particularly icky when that code is outside of SFDC and integration/communication loops don’t complete. Instead write APEX and VisualForce or Javascript to validate data in a more elegant way. No object should have more than a handful of fields with constraints such as ‘required’ or ‘unique value.’ See the arguments against validation rules. No UI page (aka “page layout”) should have more than five required fields. While the fields that are made required on the page work well and don’t have the ugly failure modes of DML constraints, they do annoy users. If you have to have several required fields, at least put them “above the fold” in the page layout so the user doesn’t have to scroll a lot during initial data entry. No object should have more than 10 record types unless there is an incredibly strong reason for it, and the number of user profiles should be less than 5 percent of the total user count. These two rules of thumb by themselves seem arbitrary, but the issue is manageability. The most pressing issue is the number of check boxes and selectors that need to be maintained for user profiles, as this suffers from what is amusingly called a combinatorial explosion. If you have 20 objects with 100 fields, maintaining 10 profiles involves 40,000 check boxes just for read and write privileges — and then there are all the record-type picklist subsets and page layouts. We’ve worked on SFDC systems that had over 500,000 items for a system administrator to maintain. The system should have less than 10 percent unused objects and less than 25 percent “unused” fields. While it’s perfectly OK to have historical objects that are no longer active (but do hold data) and fields that are explicitly marked as deprecated, having hundreds of “mystery fields” just makes things harder to understand and manage. Each irrelevant field or object is contributing to the combinatorial explosion from the prior bullet. The number of reports should be less than the number of users. Don’t laugh. We’ve seen systems that had ten times that number. It doesn’t take much of a leap to conclude that 75 percent of those reports were unmaintained and produced questionable results, but they were still there to mislead the user if they were run. For any one object, there shouldn’t be a mix of code, workflows, flows. While each of these technologies works fine individually in the appropriate use cases, with any level of sophisticated processing they do not play well together. Mixing these technologies on a single object makes the transactional flow harder to understand and causes lots of flaky behavior and annoying failure modes. Troubleshooting some of the failures will take you longer than just converting everything to code (which, while generally not a good thing, is in this specific case the only real solution). APEX code test methods should be at least 75 percent the size of the code under test. If your code is the least bit interesting, it will have branches and calculations. Setting up the data conditions to cover all the branches and do any level of testing for results/outcomes takes lots of lines. If the test code is cursory, that means the project that developed the functional code did not budget enough time for it — never a good sign for quality, reliability and maintainability. For any one object, there shouldn’t be more than one trigger, and it should be small (ideally, just one line). You can get away with a couple of simple triggers on a given object, but you can't control the order of execution among an object's triggers. The only way to guarantee that any complex processing is done right every time is to have one trigger per object that is just a skeleton that calls methods in supporting classes. Plus, testing logic is easier when it is encapsulated in a class rather than loitering in a trigger. Classes can be as big as you want, but individual methods should fit in a single screen. Anything bigger than 15 lines is probably a mixture of methods and should be refactored for simplicity and comprehensibility. I’m not going to explain why: it’s an IQ test. And then there’s the data \nIn this article, we looked at the system metadata and configuration. Next time, we’ll look at data characteristics that are warning signs of problems in SFDC systems.

      "text": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.",
