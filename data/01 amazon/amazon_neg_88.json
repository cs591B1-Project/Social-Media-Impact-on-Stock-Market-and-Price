      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines.\nCalled Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app.\nIf a shopper puts the item back they aren’t charged.\nThe store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits.\nThe store is in testing and is open to Amazon employees on a trial run. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017.\nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts.\nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge says the new grocery store is just one way that Amazon has been setting its sights on the food and beverage category, a lucrative $795 billion market. It also offers grocery delivery in some markets and Prime Now for last-minute items delivered in one or two hours.\n“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge said.\nAmazon.com Inc. shares rose $18.69, or 2.5 percent, to $759.03 in afternoon trading Monday. Its shares are up almost 13 percent since a year ago.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. ",

      "text": "Our grandchildren may live in a world where there are no lines at the grocery store. And no, it’s not because all those terrible self-checkout machines are somehow going to get miraculously better.\nAmazon just created a convenience store that works differently than any other store ever. When you walk in, you scan your phone. Then, when you pick up items off the shelves, they’re automatically added to your bill, which you can check on an app.\nWhen you’re done shopping, you just leave, and you’re automatically charged for everything you bought. There’s no checking out, you just walk out.\nSo how do they know what you’re taking off the shelves and putting in your bag? Amazon says it’s a combination of “computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning.”\nAnd yes, our Amazon computer overlords can also detect when you put something back on the shelf and decide not to buy it after all, so you won’t get charged.\nThey’re testing their first store right now with their employees, and they’re going to open the first one for the public in Seattle sometime early next year.\n",

      "text": "Amazon just opened a grocery store without a checkout line WKYC 8:56 PM. EST December 05, 2016 (Photo: Amazon) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nAN FRANCISCO — Amazon is testing a grocery store in downtown Seattle that lets customers walk in, grab food from the shelves and walk out again, without ever having to stand in a checkout line. \nCustomers tap their cell phones on a turnstile as they walk into the store, which logs them into the store's network and connects to their Amazon Prime account through an app. \nThe service is called Amazon Go. It uses machine learning, sensors and artificial intelligence to track items customers pick up. These are then added to the virtual cart on their app. If they pick up an item they later decide they don't want, putting it back on the shelf removes it from their cart. \nThe Seattle-based company calls it, \"Just walk out technology.\" \nWhen the customer leaves, the app adds up everything the customer has taken and charges their Amazon account. \nAmazon said it began to work on the project in 2012. It is currently being tested by Amazon employees at the location at 2131 7th Ave., near Amazon's offices, but will open to the public in early 2017, the company said. \nThe technology \"is amazing,\" said Phil Lempert, a food marketing expert based in Los Angeles. \nHe's even more intrigued by the multiple images of \"meal kits\" show in Amazon's video. These \"everything you need to cook a quick, high-quality dinner\"kits have become popular but the economics of delivering them has meant they're difficult to make economically viable. Stores such as Amazon Go may provide a sweet spot for them. \n\"When you look at the store itself in the video (and presumably it is the actual store) they have done a great job of merchandising and having \"meal kits\" available is simply brilliant. As the meal kit industry struggles due to the shipping/logistics aspect,\" Amazon go could be a venue where they could succeed, said Lempert. ",

      "text": "Ashitha Nagesh for Metro.co.uk Tuesday 6 Dec 2016 10:48 am Amazon has opened a proper shop (Picture: Reuters) \nAmazon has just launched a physical supermarket – with no checkout counters at all. \nSounds weird, but it seems to actually work. Customers just have to install the Amazon Go app and log into their account, then take things from the shelves and walk out. \nThe shelves can apparently detect when you pick something up, and will add that item to your virtual shopping trolley. \nIf you change your mind and put something back, it can detect that too. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video For now it’s only open to Amazon employees (Picture: Reuters) \nAccording to Amazon, it does all this with ‘computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning’. How to stop Uber tracking your location after you've been dropped off \nThen, when you walk out of the shop, it adds up everything that’s in your digital checkout and charges your card automatically. \n‘Four years ago we asked ourselves: What if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout?’ Amazon said. Just put stuff in your bag and walk out (Picture: Reuters) \n‘Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go? \n‘Our answer to those questions is Amazon Go and Just Walk Out Shopping.’ \nThe shop, which is around 1,800 square feet, is based in Seattle. \nFor now it’s only open to Amazon staff while it’s in the beta stages, but is supposed to be opening to the public in early 2017.

      "text": "Follow @MiserlyGeek Share this \nOnline store giant Amazon is entering the brick-and-mortar space with its grocery store. Dubbed as Amazon Go , these stores are a lot like other grocery stores, except that you don't have to put up with long queues for the checkout process.All you need to do is walk into the store. Login to your Amazon account using a a QR code. Pick up the stuff you want and simply walk out. Amazon's in-store technology that involves computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning will work out the list of items for you. You will then be charged from your Amazon account with a receipt. As you would have guessed already, Amazon has been working on this project for years. The development began in 2012. As of this writing, the project is being tested by Amazon employees at a few locations. It will be open to public in early 2017.In order to use this service, users will need an Amazon account, a supported smartphone, and the free Amazon Go app. The service has been announced only for the US. If you are still confused about the concept. Check out the demo video embedded below. Please note that we do not encourage readers to do something similar in Indian supermarkets. Here you will be charged for shoplifting.",

News provided by Dec 06, 2016, 06:36 ET Share this article SHANGHAI , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- AWE has forged a strategic partnership with Amazon and JD.com, two leading e-commerce platforms, and invited them to showcase more smart home appliances at the forthcoming AWE 2017, allowing consumers to see first-hand internationally recognized high-end brands and their extraordinary performance. Organized by the China Household Electrical Appliances Association, AWE is a major event on par with CES and IFA, and its next edition will embrace historic new heights, expanding to almost 120,000 square meters of exhibition space in its eight halls. Fueled by the explosive demands of Chinese consumers for high-end, high-added-value products, Amazon is set to establish its presence for the first time at AWE 2017, and to set up an Amazon Life Show of high-end small home appliances spanning beauty care, kitchen appliances, health care, and more . In March 2016 , JD.com launched a smart home show at AWE 2016, with six experience areas (including an independent kitchen, an open living room, and a special area for home appliances ) showcasing products from Siemens, Samsung, Casarte, LG, Midea, Robam, Fotile, TCL, Haier, Panasonic, LeTV, Hisense, Joyoung, Phillips, A.O. Smith , and more. This brought consumers one step closer to the latest technologies. One of the major distribution channels for consumers , e-commerce platforms are star ting to step up their efforts promoting smart, high-end products, and expand ing their portfolio to include cross-border business, providing consumers products from around the world. Amazon China has registered more than 10 million overseas orders since it began offer ing cross-border service in 2014. In the first half of 2016, sales from its cross-border shopping segment surged to four times as same period last year. AWE, the highest-level exhibition in China's home appliances and consumer electronics industry, has grown to be a preferred platform for e-commerce providers to do offline promotions. Only three weeks after AWE 2017 officially launched, 80% of its booths were booked out, matching last year's record -setting pace . AWE is expanding its portfolio to include more international brands, such as ABB, KUKA, Karcher, Tiger, Vitamix, Cuisinart, Omega, Fisher & Paykel, Westinghouse, Vidal Sassoon , BaByliss, and Laurastar.

      "text": "Amazon.com, Inc. ’s ( AMZN - Free Report ) Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Salesforce.com, Inc. ( CRM - Free Report ) have strengthened their global strategic alliance with five service integrations.\nWith these integrations, the Salesforce Platform will be connected to Amazon AppStream 2.0, Amazon Redshift, Alexa, AWS IoT, and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to offer customers better ways of managing their data.\nSalesforce will now use AWS across all of its core products, namely, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud and more. Canada will be the first country to host this integration that is expected to be initiated by mid-2017.\nThe move appears to be a part of the broader infrastructure expansion plan that the duo had unveiled in May.\nThe Integrations in Detail \nAmazon AppStream 2.0, which is a fully managed secure application streaming service, will be made available in the Salesforce AppExchange as a Lightning Component. This will allow quick and easy integration of AWS cloud directly with Salesforce.\nSimilarly, Amazon Redshift which is a fully managed petabyte-scale data warehouse service will be connected to Salesforce Wave Analytics. This will enable quick and easy analysis of large data sets.\nAWS Internet of Things (IoT) will connect to Salesforce IoT to allow linkage of device data with customer data, helping businesses to develop services based on customer activity on connected devices.\nMoreover, the new Alexa Toolkit for Salesforce will now enable developers to use the Salesforce learning platform Trailhead to develop Alexa Skills for Salesforce.\nAnother tool enables customers to establish secured connections between Amazon VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) and Salesforce Heroku without having to use a public network connection.\nSalesforce is the latest to join the long list of AWS users that include big names like Netflix ( NFLX - Free Report ) , Expedia and Adobe Systems.\nAMAZON.COM INC PE Ratio (TTM) \n\nAMAZON.COM INC PE Ratio (TTM) | AMAZON.COM INC Quote \nAll in Amazon’s Favor \nThis is a big win for Amazon, which also recently helped Netflix move to the cloud. While Amazon remains the largest online retailer with significant growth prospects, all the excitement in recent times has been about AWS.\nNote that Salesforce’s flagship CRM offering competes with Microsoft’s ( MSFT - Free Report ) Dynamics CRM. Microsoft ranks second in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) segment, so Amazon (the market leader) is the best company that Salesforce could have gone to.\nAWS Holds the Key \nWe see the move as Amazon’s latest gambit to increase its market share in the lucrative cloud computing business. It intends to give both sellers and customers a solid reason to opt for AWS. \nAmazon Web Services is in the business of providing computing infrastructure so that companies don’t need to maintain their own IT infrastructure. It provides tools that support website production, social media and mobile applications that have taken the company to the top spot in the IaaS space.\nIt is the cash cow for Amazon. The business contributed $3.2 billion in the third quarter. It generates much higher margins than retail and therefore has a positive impact on Amazon’s profitability. Amazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader, well ahead of Microsoft, Alphabet and IBM.\nHowever, the speed at which businesses are moving to the cloud and innovating in the space has intensified competition. This also puts pressure on Amazon’s resources.\nShares of Amazon have been steadily treading higher on a year-to-date basis. The stock generated a return of 9.54% compared with the Zacks Electronic Commerce industry's gain of 6.49%.\n\nWe remain positive about AWS' growth prospects. Amazon’s continuous efforts to launch new features, open more data centers globally and constantly lower prices will give it a competitive advantage. We remain optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience that AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins.\nZacks Rank \nAmazon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "Femi Adesanya 28 mins ago \nAmazon has launched an ambitious new physical store it has dubbed ‘Amazon Go’, one of the world’s first stores which will have no cashiers or checkout queues. \nThe store will be powered by a web of technology that allows customers to fill their shopping bags and walk out without going through a checkout process. Customers download an app and simply swipe their smartphones as they walk through the store’s entrance. Then they start picking up groceries. Recommended for you",

      "text": "The undisputed titan of online retailing thinks shopping for food can be a lot more convenient, and is making moves that may one day upend the rote task of buying groceries.\nAmazon on Dec. 5 announced that in early 2017 it will launch a physical grocery store in Seattle, Washington, where it is headquartered. In doing so, the company is making good on rumors that circulated in October that it was planning a line of small grocery shops to help supply customers who subscribe to its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery program (think miniature warehouses).\nBut internal company documents obtained earlier this year by Business Insider suggest Amazon’s enigmatic CEO Jeff Bezos is looking to pick a more aggressive fight with entrenched grocery companies in a bid to sap up customers and reshape the industry.\nHow? By opening 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores over the next decade, starting with 20 by the end of 2018 in cities such as Las Vegas, Miami, New York, and Seattle, according to Business Insider. It would certainly be a fight. The supermarket business is one of the fiercest in the US, punctuated by markdown wars, and battles over “premiumization” that have pit grocers such as Whole Foods against more traditional brands.\nIf the online retailer does go all in to the brick-and-mortar market, it would certainly get the attention of its largest rival, Walmart, which has more than 4,600 locations in the US. It remains to be seen whether Amazon could disrupt groceries in the same way it did bookstores, but by building physical locations, the company would undercut one of Walmart’s biggest on-the-ground advantages.\nFor more than a year Walmart has used many of its stores as grocery pick-up zones to compete in the online ordering business. It currently offers free, same-day curbside grocery pick-up at around 400 locations in the US. And the company early this year spent more than $11 billion to try and evolve—giving its website a facelift and remodel existing locations, among other things. Keeping up might get tougher if Amazon tries to shoehorn itself into the same space. Already the online retailer is looking to eliminate the need for physical cashiers at checkout lanes, and it remains a domineering force for fast delivery—having brick-and-mortar facilities will only make it better at reaching customers quickly.\nOf course, it is worth noting that many Walmart locations carry more than groceries, making it a one-stop shop for its customers. Amazon may have trouble competing in that arena if it only offers groceries.",

(Source: Amazon/CNN) \n(CNN) - A grocery store with no checkout lines sounds like a dream, but Amazon is making it a reality. \nThe online giant unveiled a new brick and mortar store where it sells grocery essentials and pre-made meals. \nCustomers check in at the entrance of the store using the Amazon Go app. \nShoppers can then grab whatever they want and just exit the store when they're done. \nAmazon said it tracks purchases using computer vision and advanced sensor technology. \nThe first store is in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nRight now, the store is only open to Amazon employees. \nThe public can start shopping at Amazon Go stores early next year. \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

Thats like saying the 2 hot posts for the new COD games are dupes there's one for Xbox and another for PS4 and the pictures for the deals show both console versions of the game but they are allowed. dadofdaisy To be honest I really wouldn't buy one. They use Miyota movements which are cheap to buy and mineral crystal. At this price point you'd be better off with an Orient Mako 45mm watch if that's the size you're after. I wouldn't buy one personally either and agree that a Orient watch would be a better investment or a cheap Seiko or Citizen but these are fashion watches its all about looks not the glass quality or the movement, its each to their own whereas these wont be working in 5 years any of the 3 i mentioned will. I have 3 Seiko's the oldest is a Divers and its got to be 15 years old their all automatics and i have 1 Citizen Ecodrive Pro Diver and that's about 12 years old and all of them work as good as the day they were new.

      "text": "AMAZON ANNOUNCES 'AMAZON GO,' A GROCERY STORE WITH NO CHECKOUT 2 hours ago share \nAmazon has created a a brick-and-mortar store it calls Amazon Go. The system marries physical stores with advanced algorithms and sensors to eliminate the need for a typical store checkout. When a customer first walks into one of these stores, they use their smartphone to open a virtual shopping cart. The technology is so advanced that it can track what you pick up and walk out with, or even if you pick up an item and place it back on the shelf. Customers will only be charged for items they walk out with. The store is currently only open to employees and is located in the company's home town of Seattle, but it appears the company has ambitions beyond Seattle. Listen to San Antonio's First News with Charlie Parker Weekdays 5 a.m. - 9 a.m. Charlie is joined by news anchor Charity McCurdy, traffic anchor Megan Bishop, meteorologist Ray Stagich and producer Tim Merryman.In addition, News Director Jim Forsyth and National Correspondent Joe Gomez provide commentary and perspective on the biggest stories.Tune in each morning for the latest breaking news, perspective on the top stories, plus traffic and weather together on the 10's.

      "text": "San Francisco (December 5, 2016) By Ranica Arrowsmith \nXero has moved 59 billion records onto Amazon Web Services, completing its transition to the platform. \nThe move to AWS is part of Xero’s plan to scale to serve 1 million customers. The migration of more than 59 billion records amounts to more than 1.4 petabytes of data, and took approximately two years to complete. \n“Our focus on completing a significant data migration to the AWS platform sets Xero up to deliver fast-paced innovation, leverage machine learning technology, improve margins, increase uptime and security and drive better business outcomes to help small businesses flourish,” said Xero chief platform and product officer Duncan Ritchie in a statement. “It is a huge achievement to get through this massive transition. We expect all business software vendors to re-platform over the next few years so they too may take advantage of the commoditized innovation services in the larger public cloud platforms.” ",

      "text": "Email \nAmazon has gone after bookstores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it’s taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of “grocery essentials” and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn’t have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you’re done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It’s also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon’s move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for “getting away with murder tax-wise” and having “a huge antitrust problem.” Will the President-elect add “job killer” to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon’s effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n“Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. Introducing #AmazonGo , a new kind of store with no lines and no checkout. https://t.co/WMii0bWevi pic.twitter.com/OmZdzobA5F ",

      "title": "Microsoft's Home Hub Could Be a PC-Driven Home Assistant | Digital Trends",
      "text": "Google Home \nIn 2014, Amazon’s Alexa kicked off the craze of putting stand-alone digital assistants in the home with its Echo device . Google Home followed suit in 2016, offering a similar device that responds to voice commands, but powered by Google Assistant and the company various other digital properties. \nEver since Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant joined Apple’s Siri in providing voice-response intelligence to PCs and has grown in power and popularity, speculation has been running wild about the possibility of Microsoft introducing an Alexa- and Google Home-like intelligent home assistant. Recent information suggests that while Microsoft does indeed have plans for a “Home Hub” product, it might be entirely PC-based, as Windows Central reports . \nMore: Microsoft’s Cortana may get to know you better to make conversation more natural \nWhile the earliest rumors were around Microsoft providing a stand-alone hardware device like Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, those appear to have been premature. Code referring to “Home Hub” components has surfaced in Windows 10 Anniversary, indicating indicate Microsoft is looking to incorporate family-friendly features into Windows 10 that will make PCs — and not a stand-alone, voice-only device — serve as the center of users’ homes. \nRather than being a piece of hardware, then, Home Hub looks to actually be a set of software services running in Windows 10. The core services will expand Cortana to pull in and share family information to provide shared services for all of a family’s members. Shared calendars, task lists, notifications, and more will extend beyond the individual and allow Microsoft’s digital assistant to work with entire families as well. \nThe Windows 10 lock screen will service as a central display for Home Hub information. Rather than simply showing an individual’s various information, such as calendar notifications, the Home Hub “Welcome Screen” will provide a shared environment for families to reference and interact. Presumably, this functionality will run on a shared PC located in a home’s common area. \nFinally, Home Hub will also include the intelligence to connect to smart home components. So far, it looks like Home Hub will integrate with Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) and Open Translators to Things (OpenT2T) systems, meaning that a number of today’s smart home devices will work with Home Hub immediately. \nMore: Windows Insider members get a sneak peek of Creators Update with Office Hub \nWhile Microsoft is concentrating on providing the Home Hub software within Windows 10, that doesn’t mean its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners couldn’t come up with their own Home Hub-specific hardware devices. While Home Hub isn’t “headless” like Amazon Alexa and Google Home, that is, it doesn’t run without a display, there’s nothing stopping a Dell or an HP from making a Home Hub device that uses Windows 10 and family oriented Cortana to compete more directly with Alexa and Home. \nIf you’re looking to jump onto the home assistant bandwagon with Microsoft’s Home Hub, it appears that you’ll have to wait awhile. Home Hub may make its debut in the upcoming Creators Update due in Sprint 2017, most of it will have to wait for the Redstone 3 update coming in late 2017 and possibly even Redstone 4, estimated for 2018. In other words, it will be some time before Microsoft’s Home Hub initiative can hope to replace Amazon Alexa and Google Home in letting you control your home and interact with your family with a Cortana-driven home assistant.

      "text": "\nOnline retail giant Amazon pulled one of its products from the for-sale shelves – a doormat featuring the name of “Allah” – after Muslims complained about being offended. \nOnes bearing likenesses of Jesus, however, are still being sold. Muslims were offended at doormats being sold on Amazon that bore the name, “Allah.” \nFrom Heatstreet : \n“Amazon has decided to stop selling doormats bearing the name of Allah after complaints from British Muslims who said they were offended by the product. \n“For weeks, a handful of Muslims had complained about the mats on Twitter, saying it was offensive for people to wipe their feet on the name of Allah. Eventually, a Birmingham Labour councillor, Mariam Khan, tweeted about the mats, also reaching out directly to Amazon. The online retailer stopped selling them soon thereafter.” \nAmong the Twitter complaints was this one, from Marian Khan , who included a photo of the varied selection of doormats bearing “Allah” that had been offered for sale on Amazon. Muslims complained on Twitter about doormats sold on Amazon that bore the name, “Allah.” \nThe tweet : \n“These mats are extremely offensive to Muslims & out of order. @amazon @AmazonHelp please remove these from your site immediately.” \nAnother tweet from the same source: \n“I have spoke to @amazon and have been told that they will be removed but in order for it to be done quicker, we need more complaints in.” \nWhat a farce. Amazon offers doormats that feature Jesus, including one from Mel Gibson’s “The Passion of the Christ” movie, and another showing “Jedi Jesus,” a play on the Star Wars’ series that includes an image of the Christ holding the cross like a light saber. \nAgain, from Heatstreet : \n“This isn’t the first time Amazon’s doormat offerings have caused controversy. Earlier this year, Hindus were angered by doormats showing several dieties, including Shiva, Vishnu, Krisna and Ganesha. Amazon removed the mats after #BoycottAmazon began trending in India.” Twitter Connect with us \nStay on top of the news the media censors and scrubs. Subscribe here (it's free) .

      "text": "Email \nSEATTLE -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. \nAmazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. \nAmazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go might mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. \nIt's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. \nThe company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the president-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: What if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. ",

      "text": "Thanks to Amazon, You May Never Have to Step into a Grocery Store Again Within a decade, Amazon may open as many as 2,000 drive-through supermarkets Text by Facebook Amazon plans to build drive-through grocery stores with only 10,000 square feet of in-store space—far smaller than the average Walmart Supercenter, which occupies 187,000 square feet. Getty Images \nBid farewell to the standard shopping cart, the crowded aisles, and the question of paper versus plastic—online retailer Amazon is laying the groundwork for a chain of drive-through grocery stores. Within ten years, Amazon may open as many as 2,000 locations, each with eight or more pickup lanes and a team dedicated to delivering groceries directly to motorists in their cars. The Seattle-based high-tech retailer estimates a wait time of less than five minutes, perhaps aided by the use of license plate scanning. It also estimates that about one-quarter of visits to its stores will take place during evening rush hour, from 5 to 7 p.m. Amazon plans to use only 10,000 square feet of in-store space, meaning its buildings will be about the same size as an average Walgreens or CVS drugstore. By comparison, Walmart Supercenters average 187,000 square feet. \nThis efficiency will be fueled by Amazon’s vast wealth of data and experience with complex logistics. Amazon entered the grocery market in 2008 with AmazonFresh, a subscription-based fresh-food delivery service. Amazon has also recently entered the brick-and-mortar retail market, opening its first storefront last November, selling books to Seattle residents. If its plans for a new type of supermarket is successfully implemented, Amazon would become the nation’s fourth largest grocery store chain, after Walmart, Kroger, and Albertsons. \nPlans are already in place for 20 new grocery stores in several U.S. test markets by 2018. Ten of these will feature drive-through lanes. Last month Amazon’s name appeared on public permit documents for a Seattle building nearing completion. The building is 9,759 square feet and has eight drive-through lanes. Explore ",

      "text": "Zenith Predicts Global Ad Spend Will Grow; Amazon Unveils A Store Without A Checkout by AdExchanger // \nHere's today's AdExchanger.com news round-up... Want it by email? Sign-up here . \nForecasting The Future \nGlobal ad spend will grow 4.4% in 2017 to reach $566 billion, according to Zenith’s ad spend forecast , released on Monday. Zenith agrees with GroupM and Magna that 2017 is the year digital will surpass TV ad spend globally. Display will grow 13% through 2019, largely thanks to programmatic, but it’s not your mother’s banner ad. As desktop steadily declines, online video and social media will be the sole engines of digital ad spend growth. Rich media formats continue to fuel growth as advertisers shift spend to mobile, which grew 48% this year. \nReady, Set... \nAmazon Go, Amazon’s convenience store in Seattle, has no checkout process. Customers will enter with the Amazon Go app and be tracked via a mix of mobile sensors and cameras. Walk in, walk out, and pay automatically. Mum’s the word from Amazon aside from a video announcing the tech, so guesses about where this service may go next are just that (though it’s rumored to be considering its own brick-and-mortar empire). One foreseeable use case is to license the technology to pre-existing retailers, but would they be willing to expose individual purchase data and in-store margins to a rival? More at The Seattle Times . \nGrowtheries \nAmazon’s incursion on the grocery market comes as CPGs struggle to figure out ecommerce. A holiday website selling Oreo gift tins will mark the first time Mondelez manages all the supply chain and shipping logistics following the sale. General Mills abandoned a subscription snack service last year after working on it for 18 months, and Kellogg partnered with IBM on a site that sells custom granola directly to (dubious?) consumers. “It’s expensive to lure online customers with marketing, and most shoppers don’t want to visit dozens of websites to find the items they buy on Amazon or at a grocery store,” Bloomberg reports. More . \nWatchacallit \nAt the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York on Monday, David Poltrack, chief research officer at CBS, made the case that long-form digital video should be bucketed under TV spend, rather than digital. \"Long-form video is a hybrid media extension that belongs as much in the 'television' sector as it does in the 'digital' sector,\" he said. \"The dynamics of this unique hybrid media form are much further removed from the dynamics of digital search than they are from the dynamics of the CBS Television Network or of Showtime.\" Given that long-form digital video will grow 40% next year while the rest of the digital sector grows 11%, you can see why he’d want to make that argument.

      "text": "Amazon has launched its Launchpad platform in India, that lets startups showcase new products to its customers. Launchpad is a global program, as such, Indian startups listing products on the platform will be able to sell in all international markets Amazon is present in.\nLaunchpad is currently active in 7 markets including India, US, Germany, France, China and the UK. Products made by startups funded through crowdfunding platforms, venture capital firms and startup accelerators that have partnerships with Amazon, can list on the platform. Startups that were funded by other venture capitalists or incubators can still apply, but participation remains at Amazon’s discretion. Existing sellers on Amazon are also eligible to participate in the program, but again, at the company’s discretion.\nEligible startups can register through Amazon’s Seller Central, and after a seller verification, Amazon’s team will work with these startups to help integrate product listings. Once listed, companies need to deliver these products to Amazon’s fulfilment centers from where they can be shipped globally. Sellers joining the Launchpad program are required to pay Rs 5,000 per month as participation fee in addition to the standard referral fees .\nAs of now, the platform lists over 350 products including ones from popular startups like GOQii fitness trackers, SAFER’s smart jewellery, Lechal fitness tracking insoles and buckles, etc. It also lists various novelty tech like a floating bluetooth speaker, chargers for bicycles and health-related items like ‘mooch and beard oil’, noodles etc., presumably also from startups. According to a Livemint report , it currently lists products from 25 Indian startups and an overall 600 startups from the markets Launchpad is present in.\n",

      "text": "Blogs Amazon testing cashier-free retail store \nAmazon has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar outlets but so far has only announced a handful of bookselling outlets (AFP Photo) AFP San Francisco - \nAmazon has unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers. \nCustomers at the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, can fill their shopping carts and walk out -- with the costs automatically tallied up and billed to their accounts with the US online giant. \nAmazon Go, which is being tested with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" its webpage said. \n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\" \nThe 1,800-square-foot (170-square-meter) store is selling a variety of food products, including bread, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which contain ingredients for home-cooked dishes. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers. \nThe online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar stores but so far has only announced a handful of outlets selling books. \nThe Wall Street Journal cited people close to the matter as saying that Amazon Go was one of several store formats the retail giant is considering. \nTwo prototype drive-through locations in Seattle without in-store shopping options are set to open in the coming weeks, the Journal reported. \nDepending on the success of the test locations, Amazon could reportedly open more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores under its brand. \nIf it does push forward with selling fresh food in stores, Amazon could put a lot of pressure on traditional grocers and superstores like Wal-Mart.

Not if you had a pad of paper and an hour to think about it, but if you had to name, like, 20 songs right this second. It’s not something I’ve ever had to think about before. I mean, why would you need to know that by heart? You’re on your deathbed, perhaps, and you realize you forgot to make a playlist for your funeral? Or you’re out walking one night and get abducted by aliens and they’re screaming, just screaming, at you: “Please. We need a reason to save humanity. Just show us some art, for pity’s sake, something beautiful, and we’ll spare you all,” and you think: “God, is it time for some Fleetwood Mac?”\n\nOr maybe — like me — you just got an Amazon Echo.\n\n\"The Echo...\"",

      "text": "{ 0 comments } \nToday is the 3rd day of Amazon’s 12 days of deals and it’s focusing on home and kitchen products. I browsed through some of the offerings to pull out some items that I thought might be interesting to Gadgeteers and this is what I came up with for today: You’ll never have to push a vacuum again with the iRobot Roomba 614 Robotic Vacuum Cleaner which is 34% off today at $249.99. Make sure your holiday ham or turkey is fully cooked with a Harbor Stainless Steel digital cooking thermometer for $9.99. Your favorite shutter bug would love a Mango Spot Best Camera Lens Thermos Stainless Steel Cup/ Mug for $7.99 – $10.99. Keep warm with the Dr Infrared Heater Portable Space Heater for $84.99. I have one of these (different brand) and use it all the time in my chilly basement this time of year. \nThose are just 5 deals that caught my eye. You can shop all of today’s deals at Amazon’s 12 days of deals page. Share this story",

      "text": "Maria Guido Dec 6, 2016 Amazon Go is coming to a city near you \nI need a way to spend more money with Amazon , said no one ever. Whether you want to or not, you will start spending even more of your paycheck on Amazon. \nAmazon, the site that allows us to shop for almost everything we need without putting on pants has thought of another genius way to take all of our money: grocery stores without lines, registers, or cashiers. It’s the grocery store of the future and soon we will all be broke. Seriously, we will. \nHere’s how it works: you get the Amazon Go app. Then you scan your phone and walk into the store. Then you just throw shit in your bag and Amazon somehow knows what you’ve taken, and also knows if you put it back. Then you just walk out of the freaking store like you own the place. Only, you don’t own the place. You are totally paying for all that stuff. You just don’t realize you’re paying for it, because you don’t have to interact with anyone and it’s all so easy. \nThis is just trouble. Think of how much crap you would buy if you didn’t have the ceremony of having to look someone in the eye while you bought it? How many times have you been saved by the mere thought of keeping up the illusion that you were a decent human being who would never buy a wedge of brie, Magnum ice cream bars, Ritz crackers, a bottle of Prosecco, and a jar of Nutella, only? We’re all screwed. I’m just walking right out the door with this sh*t. \nThat’s right, you walk in the store, grab whatever you want, and walk right out. I have an entire cheesecake in this bag. \nThe app automatically charges your Amazon account. I’ll never have to interact with another person, again. \nOkay so the obvious plusses are that you can buy a box of Mallowmars and a Mountain Dew for lunch and no one will ever know. Or is that a minus? The minuses are you aren’t even getting the very minimal interaction we all get with our local shopkeeper. Or is that a plus? We don’t even know. Are the robots taking over? Will swiping our credit cards become as obsolete as writing a check? Will we be able to afford our rent after we’re done willy-nilly gliding in and out of one of these stores? So many questions! \nThe first Amazon Go store will open in Seattle in early 2017, but Amazon also has plans for two other types of stores that are larger than the convenience store model. “In November, Amazon’s technology team approved a proposal to open large, multifunction stores with curbside pickup capability, clearing the way to start hiring and planning, according to one of the people,” reports the Wall Street Journal. “Two drive-through prototype locations, which don’t offer an in-store shopping option, are also slated to open within the next few weeks in Seattle.” \nWill Amazon be as popular if we need to put on a pants to shop there? We shall see.",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. ",

      "text": "Have you ever dreamt of walking into a store, taking all the things you need, and then just walking out without having to do any transactions? Well, you could do that but you’ll probably end up in jail. Amazon will be launching a new retail store and a new program, Amazon Go, that will let you do exactly that, except that of course you will actually pay for the items on your account. The target launch is early 2017, but while we have the basic details, we still don’t have the full picture and process yet.\nBased on the initial video that they have released, Amazon Go should be fairly simple for the users. You walk into their grocery store and you scan your phone upon entry to start the app. It will then create a virtual cart for you and when you pick up items, it will add them to your account. If you change your mind and put it back, it will be deducted of course. You don’t even need to have an actual cart, even your bag will do. When you go out of the store, it will tally all the items you brought with you and charge it to your Amazon Go account.\nWe’re not yet clear as to how the tech will work and if it will be as smooth sailing as they’re pushing it to be. All they said is that they will be utilizing a “just walk out technology” which is made up of “computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning”, which they say is what other companies use for their self-driving tech. We would also want to know what safeguards they will be putting to minimize theft and all that comes with it, because as we know, people will always find ways to cheat.\nBut for now, what we do know is the location of Amazon’s first retail store and it will be at 2131 7th Ave, Seattle, Washington. Amazon employees have already been beta testing the store, which includes not just grocery items but also ready-to-eat meals prepared by in-house chefs. Let’s see if this is an idea that will actually fly.\nVIA: SlashGear",

      "text": "By Sarah Halzack, The Washington Post Posted Dec. 06, 2016, at 8:27 a.m. \nAmazon on Monday revealed that it will open a brick-and-mortar grocery store called Amazon Go, an ambitious bid by the once online-only retailer to gobble up more of Americans’ shopping dollars by taking the fight more directly to traditional supermarkets and big-box stores. \nThe store will be powered by a web of technology that allows customers to fill up their shopping bags and walk out without going through a checkout process, a concept that has long been discussed in the retail industry but that has not been implemented at any major U.S. stores. The idea is that it will shave time off the shopping experience. \nHere’s how Amazon Go will work: Customers download an app and then swipe their smartphones as they walk through the store’s entrance. Then they just start picking up groceries. In a process that the company does not describe except to say that it involves such capabilities as computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence, every item the shoppers tuck into their bags or carts is tracked on the phone. If an item is put back on the shelf, it’s deleted. As the shoppers exit, their total bill is calculated, a digital receipt appears on their phones and their Amazon account is charged. This video produced by the company offers some visuals that might help you imagine what that will look like. Story continues below advertisement. \nThe store is set to open in Seattle, Amazon’s hometown, in early 2017. And its arrival could end up posing some critical questions for the wider retail industry. For starters, Amazon Go will probably need fewer workers than traditional stores that rely on cashiers and clerks. If shoppers respond favorably to this low-touch customer service model, it might end up encouraging other chains to give similar set-ups a try and save labor costs. \nIf Amazon Go is successful and is expanded widely, it could put serious competitive pressure on a wide range of retailers. For starters, at just 1,800 square feet, Amazon Go looks to be targeting so-called fill-in trips, the kind of quick errand a shopper does when she just needs a couple of items. In recent years, drug stores and convenience stores have proved to be potent competitors to supermarkets for these kinds of shopping trips. So, a fast-growing Amazon Go could present competition for chains such as CVS and 7-Eleven. And judging from the look of the store as seen in Amazon’s video, it will have an ambiance and selection that will put it up against Kroger or Whole Foods Market. \nAnd then there’s the fact that the company is promising that it will sell prepared foods made by “on-site chefs,” meaning it will be fighting for the same breakfast, lunch and dinner spending that fast-casual and carryout restaurants currently vie for. Amazon Go also plans to sell pre-packaged meal kits that contain ingredients to make a home-cooked dinner for two. That could produce new competition for the wave of meal kit startups such as Blue Apron, HelloFresh and Purple Carrot. \nAmazon’s decision to sell groceries in physical stores would seem to be an acknowledgment of how hard it has proven to sell these kinds of goods on the Internet. Despite the explosive growth of e-commerce overall, grocery has largely remained an old-school business, with less than 2 percent of sales taking place online. \nAnd Amazon Go will face no shortage of challenges as it aims to transform the model. Filling up one’s refrigerator has long been a convenience-centric errand, one in which the closest store to your house is often the one that gets your money. It will take a long time — and gobs of money — for Amazon to build out that kind of store network. And it’s not a sure thing that what it calls “Just Walk Out technology” will win customers over. What if it turns out to be buggy? What if some shoppers find it off-putting and impersonal? \nMajor grocers were likely not shocked by Amazon’s announcement: Rumors have been circulating for months that the company planned to open brick-and-mortar stores that sold food. And the e-commerce company has already shown interest in physical retailing by opening bookstores. So, in theory, legacy chains have been preparing for Amazon to try to encroach on their turf. \nJeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.",

But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nThe-CNN-Wire ",

      "text": "What would it feel like to live in a world where you could waltz into a shop, pick up whatever you wanted, and bound right out again? No cashiers, no checkouts, no lines.\nIn its latest effort to disrupt the traditional shopping experience, retail giant Amazon intends to give shoppers the opportunity to find out, with its Amazon Go initiative. The first store ushering in this experience is already undergoing testing in its beta phase, open to Amazon employees and located in the company’s hometown of Seattle.\nAmazon Go will focus on groceries, supplementing the online arm of its edible offerings, Amazon Fresh. And while it will not be the first foray into brick-and-mortar stores for the online behemoth, with three bookstores already open, some analysts suggest it represents a tacit acknowledgment that some forms of retail still benefit from a physical presence on Main Street.\nRecommended: The most expensive items on Amazon “Four years ago, we started to wonder, what would shopping look like if you could walk into a store, grab what you want, and just go ?” explains the narrator on a promotional video. “What if we could weave the most advanced machine learning, computer vision, and AI [artificial intelligence] into the very fabric of a store, so you never have to wait in line?”\nThe most expensive items on Amazon Here’s how it works.\nShoppers enter the store and pass through a security barrier where they tap their phones to activate the Amazon Go app. From there, the store tracks everything shoppers pick up, automatically charging them via the app for whatever they take with them when they leave.\n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino, told Reuters. \"Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\"\nAnalysts say that some customers may take a little time to adjust, struggling to shake the feeling that they’re shoplifting. And quite how Amazon intends to stop actual shoplifting has yet to be publicized.\nAmazon’s first physical stores were of the literary variety, with bookstores now open in California, Oregon, and Washington – and two more in the works, in Massachusetts and Illinois. But those premises operate with traditional checkouts.\nThe Amazon Go endeavor begins with its 1,800-square-foot flagship store in Seattle, open to the public in early 2017.\nThis report includes material from the Associated Press and Reuters.",

      "text": "There it goes again. Amazon, the most disruptive retailer since Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward hit the scene is noodling again on something new. It's called Amazon Go , a convenience-store-sized shop staffed by robots and sensors rather than humans.\nAs with much of what Amazon does, this is only a test. Its current Amazon Go store in Seattle is only open to employees for now. But Amazon is like a computer virus: It probes, it examines, it learns. And then it attacks. The company announced Amazon Go with a video , and Fortune 's Andrew Nusca and Robert Hackett also produced a video discussing the move. I'm with Nusca, who argues that Amazon is a master at building on top of its existing infrastructure. Just as Amazon Web Services was able to jumpstart itself by being its own best customer, Amazon's massive distribution network is a natural partner to a chain of convenience stores.\nAmazon doesn't succeed at everything it does. (Think: Fire Phone. ) Nor does it do everything quickly. It has been investigating the grocery business for years without achieving the dominance it has in online commerce. But when Amazon tries something new, it is worth paying attention.\n***\nI once sat next to Bill Gates at a dinner, and I was flabbergasted not only by his raw intelligence but also by the range of topics in his repertoire. He could go from medical science to computer security to political philosophy and back again in the span of five minutes. The reason Gates can hold forth on so many things is that he's a voracious reader. (I always wished I could take \"reading weeks,\" as he did when he was CEO of Microsoft.) Take a moment and look at his recommendations of the best books he's read this year . It is an eclectic bunch, and the list speaks to the philanthropist's fertile mind.\nHave a literate day.\nAdam Lashinsky @adamlashinsky adam_lashinsky@fortune.com BITS AND BYTES GoDaddy just made its biggest acquisition ever . The Internet hosting and cloud services company is paying $2 billion for Host Europe Group, one of the biggest independent firms in that market with almost 1.7 million customers. The move will considerably expand its international presence, especially in the United Kingdom and Germany. ( Reuters , Wall Street Journal )\nWatson, is our network under attack? IBM is preparing to test a new cybersecurity defense service based on its artificial intelligence software. Several dozen organizations have signed up to try it out including Sun Life Financial, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., and Avnet. ( Fortune )\nFacebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Microsoft take on terrorists. The tech giants are teaming up to create a shared database with the unique digital fingerprints--called \"hashes\"--of terrorism images and videos that violate their content policies. ( Fortune )\nWhither wearables? Apple is projecting a record fourth quarter for its smartwatch. The entire category could really use a boost: it shrank 52% in the third quarter, according to researcher International Data Corp. Apple's third-quarter watch shipments contracted 71% to 1.1 million. Fitbit is also feeling the pain, IDC's figures show it's still the wearables leader (including both fitness bands and smartwatches) but its growth has stalled. ( Reuters , Fortune )\nFord is raising $2.8 billion to invest in new tech . The automaker is turning to the long-term debt markets for the first time in almost four years. It wants the money to help fuel software development for autonomous vehicles, mobility services, and electric car technologies. ( Wall Street Journal , Reuters )\nTHE DOWNLOAD Why big phone companies are excited for the Trump presidency . There's a growing sense of almost euphoria in the telecommunications industry as the incoming Donald Trump administration appears likely to be considerably more friendly to mergers and acquisitions.\nThe change comes after eight years of tough regulatory scrutiny of telecom mergers under the Obama administration. AT&T wanted to buy T-Mobile, then Sprint tried. Both were nixed by regulators, which also prevented Comcast from grabbing Time Warner Cable. That hostility towards consolidation appears quite likely to change. \nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT Microsoft Researchers Predict What's Coming in Artificial Intelligence for Next Decade , by Barb Darrow \nIntel Will Act as Tester and Test Subject in 5G Wireless Trial , by Aaron Pressman \nApple's MacBook Pro With TouchBar Could Have Battery Problems , by Don Reisinger \nMicrosoft Debuts Another Wise-Cracking Chatbot , by Jonathan Vanian \nAccompany, a Mobile Chief of Staff Trying to Challenge LinkedIn, Raises More Cash , by Leena Rao \nIBM's Ginni Rometty Is One of Only Two Female CEOs on Trump's Business Advisory Team , by Claire Zillman \nSilicon Valley's Hot New Car Display Is Being Brought to the Masses , by Kirsten Korosec \nONE MORE THING This Google app could give you peace of mind in emergencies . The software, called Trusted Contacts, is similar to Facebook's Safety Check option. It helps people alert friends and family about their safety--and broadcast their location--during natural disasters or other crises.

      "text": "Amazon Announces Amazon Go, A Store Without Registers Trending News: Amazon Go Is Cool, But It Won't Save Shopping Print   Quick Take \nEveryone on the internet today is gushing over Amazon Go , which the tech giant is touting as \"the world's most advanced shopping technology.\" Colloquially referred to as \"Just Walk Out\" technology, Amazon Go's premise is that we should be able to shop without dealing with the hassle of lines and registers -- just grab what you want, Amazon's all-knowing technology catalogs it, and they charge you when you walk out. Here, watch actors pretend to buy expensive groceries for two minutes: \nIgnoring the unsettling Orwellian overtones, there's no denying that, if it works as advertised, Amazon Go's technology is nothing short of amazing. And it's true, waiting in line does suck. I was at the grocery store this weekend, and they literally only had two registers open. Kids were everywhere. People were haggling over the price of apples. I wanted to suplex a bushel full of kittens. \nBut you know what? The line wasn't the worst thing, or at least it wasn't the only terrible thing. You know what else sucked? Fighting traffic to get out to the store. The shitty weather. The throngs of people clogging up the aisles. The indecisive soccer moms hemming and hawing about the nutritional value of competing peanut butters. Not knowing where things are, and then not finding them where they're supposed to be. \nBasically, other people are what makes shopping suck, not just the register lines. And Amazon Go does nothing to solve that. Or rather, Amazon Go does nothing to solve a problem that other retailers (including Amazon themselves) have already solved . \nSee, normally I get my groceries delivered . It makes the shopping experience a billion times better, and it costs all of $5 from either of the chain stores near me. If I'm feeling fancy and want to blow a month's rent at Whole Foods, instacart will deliver my groceries for a higher (but still reasonable) price. This should not come as a surprise to Amazon, who more or less invented ecommerce as we know it today. \nAnd it's not like people haven't tried to make the in-store experience better. Self checkout has been around for a while now, and self checkout sucks. I know Amazon has a lot of resources behind them , but if self checkout technology is still a nightmare, what are the odds Amazon Go's Big Brother software will work perfectly at first, if ever? Zero. And it will have to work perfectly to work at all, and even if it does there will still be limitations -- if you don't want something, you'd better make sure you put it back exactly where you found it, or you're getting charged for those pork rinds, for instance. \nTechnology is cool and fun, and we shouldn't poo-poo something just because it's dumb at the risk of discouraging future innovators. But if Amazon really wants to herald in the future of shopping, they should keep working on their drone technology . Drop This Fact \nAmazon Go's Seattle store is currently only open to Amazon Beta employees, but will open to the public in early 2017.",

      "text": "Amazon Just Took Grocery Shopping To The Next Level Just now Amazon has introduced a new service called Amazon Go to make trips to the grocery store a lot easier. The new “Amazon Go” is a real brick and mortar store that appears to operate like a futuristic version of Whole Foods. Customers enter the store through turnstiles using the Amazon app on your phone and some sort of bar code. Then, you walk through the store, put your items in a bag and leave without having to deal with any cashiers or lines. The store uses computer vision, sensors, and other cutting edge devices that Amazon is calling “Just Walk Out” technology. The store’s system automatically detects when you pick up or put back products and keeps track of it all in a “virtual” cart. Amazon charges your account after you leave the store and sends you a receipt, just like if you were shopping online. The \"Just Walk Out\" technology has applications beyond the Amazon Go stores. Larger stores could replace self-checkouts with the technology to prevent theft. The flagship Amazon Go store is located in Seattle and will open to the public in January 2017. Amazon Go could revolutionize the retail industry—but for now it's just hype https://t.co/8f3iWEFhAy pic.twitter.com/KOeXDKBnzg You can listen to Johnjay and Rich every weekday morning!

I was thrilled when I saw how great these toys were. So much detail and multiples. The price is great for the amount. Since I was so happy with the product, I had to purchase one more! “ \nThe play food set by Mommy Please is currently priced at $22.95, with free shipping for any purchase over $49. \nAbout Mommy Please: “Mommy Please has worked tirelessly to bring children a play set that will never cease to keep their imaginations going.

      "text": "Amazon’s grocery store is so futuristic, it involves basically no humans or check-out lines Remember when self checkout lines were the fancy, new modern way to buy groceries? Well, apparently we’re about to hop into the future, because Amazon has created grocery stores , and they’re going to be *beyond* anything we could’ve imagined. Yep. We already knew that Amazon was adding actual stores to their offerings, but Amazon’s grocery stores, Amazon Go , are taking things to an entirely different level. Like, what will Amazon’s grocery store even be like IRL?!\nSo how does Amazon’s grocery store, called, aptly, Amazon Go, work? According to Business Insider,\n“The idea is that Amazon’s machine-learning technology can automatically identify when a product is added to your cart, so you don’t have to do it yourself. When you leave the store, Amazon automatically charges your Amazon account.” Like, whoa. We seriously can’t even imagine! Talk about futuristic AF, Amazon.\nJust watching the promo vid has us feeling all the feels. After all, we do secretly love grocery shopping, and a new way to shop is something we’re always down to try. We just hope this goes more smoothly than those self checkout lines that always leave us flustered and embarrassed!\nSo when can we expect Amazon’s grocery stores to come to life? Amazon According to Amazon, Amazon employees already have access in their Beta program (oooh, fancy), but the stores will open for the rest of us in early 2017!\nThe post Amazon’s grocery store is so futuristic, it involves basically no humans or check-out lines appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "title": "Why Amazon’s Convenience Store Test Is Worth Notice",
      "text": "There it goes again. Amazon, the most disruptive retailer since Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward hit the scene is noodling again on something new. It's called Amazon Go , a convenience-store-sized shop staffed by robots and sensors rather than humans.\nAs with much of what Amazon does, this is only a test. Its current Amazon Go store in Seattle is only open to employees for now.\nBut Amazon is like a computer virus: It probes, it examines, it learns. And then it attacks. The company announced Amazon Go with a video , and Fortune 's Andrew Nusca and Robert Hackett also produced a video discussing the move.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter, where this essay originated. \nI'm with Nusca, who argues that Amazon @amazon amzn is a master at building on top of its existing infrastructure. Just as Amazon Web Services was able to jumpstart itself by being its own best customer, Amazon's massive distribution network is a natural partner to a chain of convenience stores.\nAmazon doesn't succeed at everything it does. (Think: Fire Phone .) Nor does it do everything quickly. It has been investigating the grocery business for years without achieving the dominance it has in online commerce. But when Amazon tries something new, it is worth paying attention.",

I am shopping for an adopt a family for our church and do not know them at all but do know they are struggling financially. Apparently grandparents are raising the kids and grandfather is very ill. They do have access to a computer and internet. Initially I was also thinking of an ipod for the 13 yo., but saw the tablet and thought it could be educational. Can they get into any trouble on these devices if they are not closely supervised? It has been so long since my kids were that age. FYI, I also will be giving clothing, games, a few legos for the 10yo, food and a walmart gift card. thanks!",

      "text": "Amazon just revealed a new plan for revolutionizing how people buy groceries Anita Balakrishnan, CNBC , WCSH 5:45 PM. EST December 05, 2016 (Photo: Amazon) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \n(CNBC/Anita Balakrishnan) — While Amazon's new shopping experiment is already prompting doomsday headlines for retail workers, human employees are still key to the retail experience, one technology investor told CNBC. \n\"The human beings are really a positive part of the experience,\" Roger McNamee, co-founder of technology investment firm Elevation Partners, said on \"Squawk Alley\" on Monday. \"I don't expect this to take over the world. It just doesn't seem like an earth-shattering thing.\" \nThe new Amazon Go, announced Monday, has no registers. Instead, shoppers (for now, Amazon employees) scan into the store with their free Amazon Go app, shop as normal, and leave the store with snacks and packaged meals billed to their Amazon.com account. \nImmediately after the announcement, reporters at Quartz and The Wall Street Journal cried the experimental store might signal the end of \"millions of cashier jobs.\" But while there would be some employment impact of a widespread application of Amazon Go technology, humans remain a very positive part of retail, McNamee said. \nUnlike other shopping experiences that marry in-store and online shopping, the app doesn't require shoppers to individually scan each item. Rather, the company uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to sense what shoppers are buying. \n\"I think this is part of a continuum that began a number of years ago when folks like Home Depot, and then CVS and Albertsons, Wal-Mart and others have experimented with self-checkout,\" McNamee said. \"And that has been a mixed experience. ... These things have all had rough moments, and the consumer experience has been everywhere from fantastic — for the person who otherwise would have been in line for a long time — to just dreadful. And I don't think it's been as good for the companies as they'd like to think.\" \nIndeed, Home Depot has had one of the most successful implementations of mobile and self-checkout, McNamee said, after introducing features like in-aisle location early on. But the company has also faced challenges, including a data breach on its self-checkout terminals. \nEven Howard Schneider, who invented an early version of the self-checkout machine in the '90s, told NPR's \"Planet Money\" earlier this year that he has been frustrated that the technology has languished since he got of out of the business. \n\"The early result from checkout indicates that, in fact, self-checkout works in a relatively narrow set of circumstances — with today's technology,\" McNamee said. \"Amazon's moving the technology forward.\" \nWhile it may not completely eliminate cashiers, Amazon's model could help eliminate some of the hiccups of the self-checkout model, McNamee said, such as \"shrinkage,\" or inventory loss due to miscounting or theft. It could work better in places like grocery stores, as opposed to an Apple or Tiffany store, where the luxury treatment is central to the brand, he said. \nSixty-five percent of U.S. consumers who have never purchased groceries online said they simply preferred shopping in a store, according to a survey of 2,500 U.S. consumers taken by Cowen analysts. \n\"Amazon's model .... is way more consumer friendly, so I really do hope it works,\" McNamee said. \"I think this is another example of Amazon really pushing the envelope in really interesting ways.\" \nRead the full story at CNBC .com \nCopyright 2016 CNBC ",

      "text": "We've been saying since this summer that Amazon would prove that in-store retail isn't dead. \nYesterday it was announced that Amazon plans to open 2,000 grocery stores. \nWe look at why, despite obvious negative impacts to grocers, this is actually good for the retail sector. By Parke Shall We've been writing about brick-and-mortar retailers for the last year or so now, and we have always made the argument that brick and mortar was not going to completely go away. Many times it's easy to get caught up reading about how retail is this terrible sector, how the machines are taking over and everything will be going through online ordering in the future. People don't even go grocery shopping anymore, they have their groceries delivered to their house once a week. They do the same with their pet food, their Christmas presents, and their wardrobe. This is something we've struggled with over the last year, especially as we have been a large advocate for retailers like Macy's (NYSE: M ) at certain points throughout the year. However, when you go back and read our multiple theses on Macy's, you'd see that we always arrived at the same conclusion. We thought that retail would continue to get smaller, but would not go away completely. We have said on more than one occasion that we think there is a recipe and mix between both online and in store that most retailers will wind up fitting into over the next few years. As a matter fact, to make our case, we actually cited the fact that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) was looking at purchasing department store some months back. Here's what our article looked like this past summer, In it, we wrote , \nOne thing is for sure and that is the death of retail is not as sure of a thing as some financial websites and publications might have you believe. \nAmazon's moving to in-store distribution and book sales tells us that there is a baseline necessary for a brick and mortar presence, even if it is mostly used for distribution purposes and for sales purposes as a supplemental part of the business. Companies like Macy's and Dick's with a strong retail presence is and real estate assets have a firm enough foundation that we believe could be worth a look at. Now, what we have predicted has come to fruition. It was reported yesterday that Amazon is actually looking to open 2000 grocery stores. Reuters reported , \nAmazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains. \nAmazon Go, the online shopping company's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them. \nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service. These will be different than most grocery stores. The shopping experience looks like it will be completely automated. Instead of picking your items and then checking out before you leave, it looks as though everything will be monitored by RFID or some other technology that will allow you to simply stock your items and walk out of the store. Amazon is looking to eliminate the slowest and most inefficient part of going to the store, which is the checkout. On one hand, this is actually fantastic for the industry. Not only is it going to be an evolution for all other stores to follow, but it should improve productivity and efficiency while saving costs at many brick-and-mortar retail locations. While many will argue that this is a negative because it is going to cost people their jobs, we think it actually will be a net positive as it will allow more stores to remain open than normal, had the industry not adopted these tactics. We are still in the early stages, so there is a lot of beta testing that needs to be done with this new concept, but now the sector at least has a roadmap as to what is coming next. This may allow CEOs in the industry to focus on this innovation instead of simply closing down locations. Make no mistake, however, this is a positive for retail. Amazon is basically telling us that they are saturated online and that there is something missing from the customer experience that they are trying to capture with retail stores. We have argued this many times before; there are parts of the retail shopping experience in person that simply can't be duplicated by online transactions. While Amazon getting into grocery may not be a positive for direct competitors like Whole Foods (NASDAQ: WFM ), we believe this should give renewed hope and confidence into those who are on the fence about whether or not to invest in other retail stores at extremely low valuations. Over the last month, retail has really seen its multiple expand and we have seen the entire sector do very well, as you can see from the chart below. Click to enlarge We are not saying you should go out and immediately start buying up retail stocks on this news. What we are saying is that there is another brick in the wall for our case that retail in the future will exist with both brick-and-mortar and online, and certain in store locations. We are anxious to see how Amazon does with their stores, obviously, but we are far more anxious to see the effect that it has on the sector altogether. Amazon is providing a roadmap for the retail sector to move forward and the next time retail stocks present themselves at a steep discount, we think investors should be more inclined to dip their feet in. Don't think of it as more competition, think of it as affirmation that brick-and-mortar will survive, and it'll survive with a new innovation leader in the industry.

      "text": "FutureProof Retail provides an affordable alternative to Amazon Go for grocery retailers looking for line-free checkout solutions.\nNew York, NY - December 6,\nAmazon has announced Go and revealed their plan for outflanking brick and mortar merchants on the high-street.\nMuch was made of Amazon Fresh, the online grocery delivery service that, along with its competitors, was supposed to take a bite out of the supermarket industry. However, after 8 years Amazon Fresh is only in 12 cities and its disappointing growth stands as evidence that most people would rather buy their groceries in person.\nThen in November, leaked internal documents revealed Amazon's next plans: opening 2000 brick & mortar grocery stores in the US. The Amazon Go announcement video shows Amazon's strategy for taking on brick & mortar: As the happy shoppers walk out the final message is \"No lines. No checkout. (No, seriously.)\" Amazon is betting that line-free shopping is the future of grocery, and that they can get there first.\nIt's not surprising that Amazon would focus their innovation on convenience. Their Amazon Prime service is so popular that 40% of US households pay for the privilege.\nAmazon isn't the only one betting that line-free checkout will be a key competitive edge. WalMart's Sam's Club Scan & Go rolled out this year to a great reception, with a similar rollout expected at WalMart proper next year. FutureProof Retail launched the first store in the US to open with line free checkout in November, San Luis Obispo's California Fresh Market. FutureProof's whitelabel technology provides line-free checkout and unlike Amazon's, it's available now and it's an easy upgrade for existing stores.\n\"As Amazon Go stores open across the country we'll be there, giving brick and mortar stores the chance to go line-free first.\" FutureProof CEO William Hogben said, \"We have limited installation dates open this Spring, email us for more information or join us at NRF Booth 3783 for a hands-on demo with our partner Bizerba.\"\nAbout FutureProof Retail\nEstablished and based in New York, NY, FPR is comprised of award-winning software engineers and business developers. FutureProof Retail was founded by a group of impatient shoppers, and brings a unique focus to ease of use in mobile self-scanning systems.

      "text": "About 2 weeks ago, I was reading through Benjamen’s post on how he’s been using a Milwaukee M18 right angle impact driver . \nI was up to the links section, and considered whether to keep his link to Amazon or not. Milwaukee tools are sold on Amazon, but often through 3rd party sellers, some of them authorized dealers, and by resellers. But, since the kit was lower priced on Amazon than elsewhere, I left it in. Advertisement \nFrom there, I saw something odd – a related tool with Prime shipping. Well, that’s possible when a 3rd party seller ships inventory to an Amazon warehouse for Amazon fulfillment. \nAnother click or two later and I came across something really strange – Milwaukee tools being sold directly by Amazon. Milwaukee Tools Sold by Amazon \nI asked Milwaukee if Amazon was once again an authorized dealer, and they said NO, Amazon is not an authorized dealer for Milwaukee . \nThey’re aware of 3rd party listings, but what I’ve been seeing are Ships from and sold by Amazon listings. One item I saw, a newish M18 jobsite radio, was listed as being priced “exclusively for Prime members.” \nIn the past week or so, a lot of the listings have been selling out, or they might have been removed. \nSome of the listings are of newer tools, so it’s not as if it’s “new old stock” from back when Amazon was a Milwaukee dealer. \nIf Milwaukee is not selling these tools to Amazon, where are they getting them from? \nIn most cases, Amazon is selling the tools and accessories at the same price as authorized dealers. So maybe they’re trying to make the case that they can adhere to MAP or MSRP pricing? Several tool brands don’t do business with Amazon anymore due to pricing disagreements. \nI don’t know what to make of this. Is any of this important? I’ve also asked Milwaukee about how this might affect warranty coverage of the tools, if at all. I think that would be my biggest concern. \nSo where do you think Amazon is buying these Milwaukee tools from? Share:",

      "text": "Stuart 4 Comments \nOver at Amazon, they’ve got some kind of “Save Big” promotion on select Wera tool and tool sets. Some of the deals are GREAT! Others, not so much. You can see all of the deals here , but I’ll also describe the better ones below. \nSome of the deals are temporarily out of stock, but you can still order them. Advertisement \nShown above, the Wera kraftform Kompakt 25 multi-bit screwdriver is on sale for around $26. It’s a great on-the-go and EDC screwdriver, and you can use the included long bit holder in your power tools in a pinch. \nA long Rapidaptor bit holder is priced at nearly $22 by itself . The shorter one, which I own and love using, is not any less expensive . \nA button press slides the handle back to reveal 6 standard screwdriver bits. The bit holder can be used in 2 positions. \nThe screwdriver comes with a belt pouch. \nMy own minor grumble is that the handle is a little chunky, but I got used to it quickly. It’s worth it for the unique bit storage solution. \nBuy Now \nI bought this Wera Kraftform 334/6 screwdriver set around 7-1/2 years ago, and it’s still going pretty strong. I remember being a little upset that the drivers didn’t seem to have the golden-colored Lasertip tips that I had seen on other Wera drivers, but they’re still micro-grooved and engage fasteners with very strong and tight grip. \nThese aren’t my everyday drivers anymore, but I can’t bear to get rid of them. I tend to reach for them when working on fasteners that I really don’t want to slip. \nThe set is currently on sale for nearly $24. I paid $24.00 for the set back in mid-2009. If you’ve been looking for a new set of mixed Phillips and slotted drivers, this is a good deal for great screwdrivers. \nBuy Now \nI’ve owned this set of Wera precision screwdrivers also for around 7-1/2 years now. \nAs mentioned in my Best Precision Screwdrivers roundup , these Wera mini drivers are very nice, but the grip zone can be a long reach if you’re palming the swivel end cap. \nWera has expanded their selection of precision screwdrivers in recent years, but Wiha is still king when it comes to breadth of selection. If you just need some mini Phillips and slotted drivers, this is a good set. \nIt’s currently priced at a hair over $20.",

      "text": "DirecTV impostors offer discounts for Amazon gift cards Local couple lose $300 By Mike Holfeld - Investigative Reporter Posted: 6:02 PM, December 05, 2016 Updated: 6:02 PM, December 05, 2016 More Schemes and Ripoffs Headlines Fake movie ticket scam still fooling social media followers OSCEOLA COUNTY, Fla. - When Matt Gokey received a call from someone claiming to be with DirecTV he was sure it was the real deal. The number on his phone screen matched the number he knew in dealing with the satellite TV provider; after all, he was already a customer. His fiancée said it was a well-played con game that cost the couple $300. “They offered him a lower bill and movie channels if we paid five months in advance,” Christina Dolan told News 6. “They knew our personal information including our home address. They instructed him to purchase a $300 Amazon gift card and to call Direct TV back with the promo code they gave him.” Dolan’s gut told her “it sounded too good to be true” but when Gokey called the number back they assured him this was a “legitimate” offer. It wasn’t. The couple handed over $300 only to learn later through DirecTV that the scam has been running for some time. In a statement to WKMG-TV News 6, the company writes: “AT&T-DIRECTV does not solicit its customers for prepayments. If a customer feels a call is not legitimate, we encourage them to hang up and call back using the number on their AT&T DIRECTV bill. We monitor our network for potential fraud activity and provide information about fraud scams on our website.\" Dolan is upset because with a baby on the way, they need the money. “Not only are we out $300 during the holidays with two existing children and a baby due in February,\" she writes, \"there's also a group of people out there targeting other victims and has access to personal information. Very upsetting and scary honestly. Please help spread the word to prevent this from happening to other innocent customers.” For more information on current fraud alerts with ATT-DirecTV go to: www.att.com/att/fraud/en/index.html .

      "text": "The undisputed titan of online retailing thinks shopping for food can be a lot more convenient, and is making moves that may one day upend the rote task of buying groceries.\nAmazon on Dec. 5 announced that in early 2017 it will launch a physical grocery store in Seattle, Washington, where it is headquartered. In doing so, the company is making good on rumors that circulated in October that it was planning a line of small grocery shops to help supply customers who subscribe to its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery program (think miniature warehouses).\nBut internal company documents obtained earlier this year by Business Insider suggest Amazon’s enigmatic CEO Jeff Bezos is looking to pick a more aggressive fight with entrenched grocery companies in a bid to sap up customers and reshape the industry.\nHow? By opening 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores over the next decade, starting with 20 by the end of 2018 in cities such as Las Vegas, Miami, New York, and Seattle, according to Business Insider. It would certainly be a fight. The supermarket business is one of the fiercest in the US, punctuated by markdown wars, and battles over “premiumization” that have pit grocers such as Whole Foods against more traditional brands.\nIf the online retailer does go all in to the brick-and-mortar market, it would certainly get the attention of its largest rival, Walmart, which has more than 4,600 locations in the US. It remains to be seen whether Amazon could disrupt groceries in the same way it did bookstores, but by building physical locations, the company would undercut one of Walmart’s biggest on-the-ground advantages.\nFor more than a year Walmart has used many of its stores as grocery pick-up zones to compete in the online ordering business. It currently offers free, same-day curbside grocery pick-up at around 400 locations in the US. And the company early this year spent more than $11 billion to try and evolve—giving its website a facelift and remodel existing locations, among other things. Keeping up might get tougher if Amazon tries to shoehorn itself into the same space. Already the online retailer is looking to eliminate the need for physical cashiers at checkout lanes, and it remains a domineering force for fast delivery—having brick-and-mortar facilities will only make it better at reaching customers quickly.\nOf course, it is worth noting that many Walmart locations carry more than groceries, making it a one-stop shop for its customers. Amazon may have trouble competing in that arena if it only offers groceries.\nRead full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 9:30 AM Amazon moves to cut checkout line, promoting a grab-and-go experience Amazon has created a small grocery store in Seattle that will allow customers to pluck drinks, prepared meals and other items off shelves and walk out without having to wait in a checkout line. Amazon Provided photo i Order Reprint of this Story SEATTLE \nThere is almost no aspect of retail that Amazon has not upended with online shopping. Now, the company is trying to computerize the experience of buying sandwiches and soda from the corner convenience store. \nIn the latest in its expanding set of experiments involving brick-and-mortar retail stores, Amazon has created a small grocery store in Seattle that will allow customers to pluck drinks, prepared meals and other items off shelves and walk out without having to wait in a checkout line, the company said. \nAmazon said on its website that a smartphone app and various other types of technology in the store had eliminated the usual bottleneck of cashiers and registers that typically stand between shoppers and the store exit. \nFor now, only Amazon employees can shop in the 1,800-square-foot store, which is on the ground floor of one of the company’s new office towers in downtown Seattle. The company said that it planned to open the store to the public early next year and that it would offer chef-made meal kits with ingredients for quickly preparing dinners at home. \n“Four years ago, we started to wonder: What would shopping look like if you could walk into a store, grab what you want and just go?” a narrator says in a video about the store concept, called Amazon Go, which the company posted online on Monday.  ; \nAmazon did not say what its expansion plans were for Amazon Go. If they are anything like the what the company has done with its other brick-and-mortar stores, new locations will open elsewhere slowly over time as Amazon learns how customers use the first one. \nAmazon opened its first physical book store just over a year ago in a Seattle shopping mall. It has added others in the San Diego and Portland, Oregon, areas and has said it will open new book stores in Chicago and Boston. \nIt is also working on an another grocery store concept that would allow customers to order food items online and then pick them up quickly by pulling into parking stalls. Two such stores are under construction in Seattle, according to documents filed with the city’s planning department and people with knowledge of the effort who asked for anonymity because the plans were confidential. \nThe way we think about it is the size of online retail is going to continue to grow dramatically but there will always be an offline option. (Amazon is) trying to streamline and capture a portion of that offline experience. \nGene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray \nPia Arthur, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the grocery pickup locations. \nIn the grand scheme of Amazon’s business, analysts consider the retail stores to be an infinitesimal portion of the more than $135 billion in sales expected from the company this year. \nBut the plans reflect a growing recognition by the company that certain categories of shopping are unlikely to move completely online. In some cases, it is simply more convenient to buy items in a store or more attractive to browse for them on physical shelves. \nAmazon did not say what its expansion plans were for Amazon Go. If they are anything like the what the company has done with its other brick-and-mortar stores, new locations will open elsewhere slowly over time as Amazon learns how customers use the first one. \n“The way we think about it is the size of online retail is going to continue to grow dramatically but there will always be an offline option,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “They’re trying to streamline and capture a portion of that offline experience.” \nAmazon still views technology as being useful in overhauling shopping in traditional retail shops. While the company has not said exactly how the Amazon Go stores will work, visitors will gain entry to them through a smartphone app. The company said the stores relied on a variety of technologies similar to those in self-driving cars, including those defined by buzzwords such as “computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning.” \nUnanswered for now are questions about how the stores would handle shoplifting and whether there would be employees on hand to check identification cards for alcohol purchases.

      "text": "By Narottam Medhora and Jeffrey Dastin (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains.\nAmazon Go, the online shopping company's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what items shoppers have picked off the shelves and sends a bill to their Amazon accounts if they do not replace them.\nThe store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service.\n\"It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh.\n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said.\nThe S&P 1500 food retail index <.SPCOMRETF>, which includes Kroger Co , Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down 0.5 percent at the close. Shares of Amazon closed up about 2.6 percent.\nAmazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said.\nIf tests are successful, Amazon plans to open more than 2,000 grocery stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. The company is considering other store formats, including one that would let drivers pick up goods at the curbside, the report said.\nAmazon declined to comment on the report.\n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labour costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\"\nStill, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said.\nSome people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said.\nApart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said.\nThat would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well.\nAmazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce company to open.\nIt has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.\n(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in New York; Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay and Matthew Lewis)",

      "text": "– A + Amazon could open over 2,000 grocery stores in massive retail push By Roger Fingas \nTuesday, December 06, 2016, 07:21 am PT (10:21 am ET) \nIn a plan that could up-end both conventional grocery chains and app-based services like Instacart, Amazon is hoping to open more than 2,000 self-branded grocery stores, according to a report.\n\n\n\n\nProspects are dependent on the success of test locations , sources informed The Wall Street Journal . On Tuesday Amazon revealed \"Amazon Go,\" its first-ever grocery store, which is currently open only to Amazon workers but will reach the public in early 2017. Shoppers have to check in with a special app, but can then simply pick up whatever they want and leave, with the bill appearing on their Amazon account. Various sensor and AI technologies are used to determine what a customer is taking off of shelves.\n\nStill in the works, the sources said, are two other store formats. Whereas Go is closer to the size of a convenience store, in November Amazon's technology team reportedly approved a proposal to open much larger, multifunction stores with curbside pickup options. With the greenlight, planning and hiring can get underway.\n\nTwo drive-through prototype stores, without any in-person browsing, are meanwhile expected to open in Seattle within the next few weeks.\n\nAmazon is already a dominant force in selling products like books and electronics, but it has made little headway into groceries, which are delivered via AmazonFresh or Prime Now. The extra cost and wait times can make those options impractical even where they're available, but physical outlets might solve both problems.",

      "text": "Buy the cupcake by just picking it up and walking out. Image: Michael Koppel Checkout lines are a pain in the ass and the number one reason I turn on my heel and walk out of Whole Foods when I just want to buy a cookie and an iced tea. Self-checkout machines are only fun if you’re stuck behind someone buying the entire CVS and all you need to do is buy the tampons and get out. The benevolent overlords at Amazon recognize these issues and have presented a solution.\nAmazon is opening a physical store without checkout lanes or cashiers \nHere is Amazon Go, a new retail model that addresses the pesky issues of long lines and dysfunctional self-checkout machines by essentially eliminating them, making it so that if you need to buy a cupcake, a water and a chicken salad sandwich, all you need to do is pick up those items, put them in your bag and walk out.\nhttps://medium.com/media/23e52b8d0f4af59b9ea422f9de4a948a/href The system is being beta-tested in an 1,800-foot convenience store in Seattle now, and will eventually open to the public if all goes well. It’s really as simple as it sounds — you walk into the store, pick something off the shelf, put it in your bag, and leave. Like stealing, but you’re actually paying for it. Here’s a little more information.\nCustomers supply their payment information before they set foot in the store. Then they have a panopticon of cameras and sensors that literally follow the customer’s every step as she walks around the store. If she takes an item off a shelf, Amazon’s software figures out what the item is and immediately adds it to the customer’s bill. If she puts the item back, the Amazon’s software deletes the charge. Before you wring your hands and decry the fall of civilization at the hands of Jeff Bezos and his proprietary technology, I don’t know how much this will actually do to disrupt the retail industry. If this beta test goes well, then yeah, this could spread to other stores and lots of people who do stuff like yell at their manager for the PLU code for Fuji apples will be out of a job. But, as my pals at the Billfold pointed out, there are still employees that work these stores. Someone has to take the payment information and someone has to restock the shelves. Someone, I presume, also has to hang around and make sure that you’re not stealing or taking the toothpaste into the bathroom to brush your teeth and putting it back on the shelf when you’re done.\nWhat happens if you’re one of those people that picks up a box of Oreos, carries it around the store with you while you decide and then dumps them in a panic on top of the gum at the checkout aisle? From what I can tell of this video, in order to “erase” something from your cart, you must return it to from whence it came. But maybe the “panopticon of cameras” following your every move, tracking what you do and how you do it will be smart enough to figure out that you’re the kind of person who panics at the last minute and doesn’t buy the cookies will be smart enough to figure that out.\nMaybe that panopticon of surveillance equipment will also find a way to store your purchasing preferences and use them in even more accurate targeted ads, plopping whatever the equivalent of a panic-purchase cookie box is in front of your eyes every time you go on Facebook to look at your high school rival’s baby pictures.\nOr maybe this is just a nice thing. Convenience! Ease! Buy, buy, buy! The future is here and it is checkout-free!\nDo you trust this? I don’t know if I do!\nAmazon Wants To Make It Way Easier To Buy Things was originally published in The Billfold on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "text": "While the e-commerce world has been waiting to see what unexpected grocery tricks Amazon has up its online sleeve, it pulled a fast one, announcing plans for Amazon Go, a brick-and-mortar supermarket with no lines and no checkout.\nMaking its announcement via a how-it-works video , the company says the first store is slated to open in Seattle this spring. Its “Just walk out” technology, which allows consumers to simply toss items in their bag and then leave, is based on the latest in computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. “Four years ago we asked ourselves, 'What if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?” it says in its announcement.\nThe news surprised industry observers, who have long been watching Amazon’s efforts to take online grocery shopping mainstream, including Amazon Fresh. Back in October, reports circulated that it intended to open 20 pilot grocery stores in the next two years, and that it believes it could open 2,000 over the next decade, but many expected they would function mainly as pickup spots for online orders. \n“It’s a great example of how technology is not just an enabler of online shopping, but a way to change physical shopping too,” says Bill Bishop, chief architect of Brick Meets Click, A Barrington, Ill.-based retail consultancy.\nA big question is what consumers—who have only ever met Amazon online—will expect when walking into a physical store. It’s likely to be very different, he predicts. “Every supermarket you’ve ever been in represents the legacy of the last 75 years of supermarkets,” he tells Marketing Daily . “They’ve gotten bigger and bigger, and variety has been extended.”\nHe expects Amazon Go will be radically smaller. Instead of 30,000 items, he predicts it will have more like 3,500, “like a typical Trader Joe’s.” And instead of 40,000 square feet, it’s more apt to be 16,000 or so. And he bets variety will be limited to a national brand and a private label.\nHe thinks Amazon can even handle the problem of perishable foods with quick replenishment and satisfaction guarantees. “It all comes down to trust,” he says. “If Amazon can tell people that asparagus or seafood is fresh and has a meaningful guarantee in place, people will trust them.”\nWith substantially fewer items, smaller stores, shelf technology to know exactly which items sell fastest and high private label sales, it could potentially have higher sales per square foot and higher profits, in an industry known for its razor-thin margins.\nOf course, it’s also possible Amazon isn’t all that concerned about profits, at least in the early phases. “What Amazon has done well historically is test and optimize and scale in order to reduce customer pain points,” says Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce, based in Rocky Hill, Conn. “It’s gone down some interesting roads before, but the more services it puts out there, they more it pulls you into the Amazon ecosystem. If you’re using Amazon Prime, ordering through Amazon Echo, watching movies, and now using Amazon Go and that app, these are all just multiple ways it can stay connected.”\nFood represents an enormous opportunity: Total supermarket sales hit $649.1 billion in 2015, according to the Food Marketing Institute.\nWhile plenty of observers took to Twitter to hail the news as game changing and genius, others pointed out some downsides. “That’s 3.4 million American jobs lost in a minute,” said one. “Amazon to take the jobs of hard-working self-checkout machine manufacturers,” joked another.\nBut Caporaso expects it to be a hit: “This is really an amazing next step in retail.”",

      "text": "microsoft home hub pc based cortanaface More In 2014, Amazon’s Alexa kicked off the craze of putting stand-alone digital assistants in the home with its Echo device . Google Home followed suit in 2016, offering a similar device that responds to voice commands, but powered by Google Assistant and the company various other digital properties.\nEver since Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant joined Apple’s Siri in providing voice-response intelligence to PCs and has grown in power and popularity, speculation has been running wild about the possibility of Microsoft introducing an Alexa- and Google Home-like intelligent home assistant. Recent information suggests that while Microsoft does indeed have plans for a “Home Hub” product, it might be entirely PC-based, as Windows Central reports .\nMore: Microsoft’s Cortana may get to know you better to make conversation more natural\nWhile the earliest rumors were around Microsoft providing a stand-alone hardware device like Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, those appear to have been premature. Code referring to “Home Hub” components has surfaced in Windows 10 Anniversary, indicating indicate Microsoft is looking to incorporate family-friendly features into Windows 10 that will make PCs — and not a stand-alone, voice-only device — serve as the center of users’ homes.\nRather than being a piece of hardware, then, Home Hub looks to actually be a set of software services running in Windows 10. The core services will expand Cortana to pull in and share family information to provide shared services for all of a family’s members. Shared calendars, task lists, notifications, and more will extend beyond the individual and allow Microsoft’s digital assistant to work with entire families as well.\nThe Windows 10 lock screen will service as a central display for Home Hub information. Rather than simply showing an individual’s various information, such as calendar notifications, the Home Hub “Welcome Screen” will provide a shared environment for families to reference and interact. Presumably, this functionality will run on a shared PC located in a home’s common area.\nFinally, Home Hub will also include the intelligence to connect to smart home components. So far, it looks like Home Hub will integrate with Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) and Open Translators to Things (OpenT2T) systems, meaning that a number of today’s smart home devices will work with Home Hub immediately.\nMore: Windows Insider members get a sneak peek of Creators Update with Office Hub\nWhile Microsoft is concentrating on providing the Home Hub software within Windows 10, that doesn’t mean its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners couldn’t come up with their own Home Hub-specific hardware devices. While Home Hub isn’t “headless” like Amazon Alexa and Google Home, that is, it doesn’t run without a display, there’s nothing stopping a Dell or an HP from making a Home Hub device that uses Windows 10 and family oriented Cortana to compete more directly with Alexa and Home.\nIf you’re looking to jump onto the home assistant bandwagon with Microsoft’s Home Hub, it appears that you’ll have to wait awhile. Home Hub may make its debut in the upcoming Creators Update due in Sprint 2017, most of it will have to wait for the Redstone 3 update coming in late 2017 and possibly even Redstone 4, estimated for 2018. In other words, it will be some time before Microsoft’s Home Hub initiative can hope to replace Amazon Alexa and Google Home in letting you control your home and interact with your family with a Cortana-driven home assistant.\nGreat Deals: Smart devices that automate, control, and protect your home What smart home devices will work with Google Home when it debuts November 4?",

      "text": "Amazon opens a grocery store with no checkout line Sells 'grocery essentials,' pre-made meals \nBy Seth Fiegerman \nUpdated 12/06 2016 04:37AM © Distributed by LAKANA. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. \nAmazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Print Save Photo: USDA via Flickr \nAmazon's been hinting at entering the physical retail market for quite a while now, discussing plans to open as many as 2,000 stores over the next 10 years. Early next year , the first one, an 1,800-square-foot convenience shop called Amazon Go, will open its doors in Seattle with shelves lined with meal kits , sweets, wraps and other staples. But one major element of a typical supermarket will be missing: checkout lines. Amazon is calling its store’s approach \"Just Walk Out technology.\" \nHere's how it works: You open the Amazon app on your phone and swipe it at a turnstile on the way in. Using artificial intelligence, the app keeps track of everything you take off the shelf and put in your bag. If you decide you don't want that extra quart of milk and put it back in the refrigerator case, the app will automatically deduct it from your virtual shopping cart. \nAmazon is also working on other supermarket models, including one called \"click and collect,\" which allows shoppers to place orders on their phones and drive to a depot to pick up their already-packed groceries. One of these stores could open as soon as the next few weeks , the Wall Street Journal reports. Finally, a concept that allows customers to shop in a 30,000-40,000-square-foot supermarket but also places orders for certain items for delivery later is also in the works. \nWithout checkout lines, you'll just have to find another time to catch up on celebrity gossip.
