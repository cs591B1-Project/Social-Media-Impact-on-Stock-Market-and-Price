      "text": "This article originally appeared on Real Money on Nov. 15, 2016.\nIf Amazon ( AMZN ) is known for anything in the business world, it's for prioritizing growth above everything else. The company's often-aggressive pricing, manic build-out of new warehouses and data centers, big content investments and the steady launching of new perks for Prime subscribers all fit with this theme.\nBut this week, Jeff Bezos' company made a move that could ding near-term sales -- even if few consumers or pundits are likely to object much to it.\nFollowing a slew of reports highlighting the growing availability of counterfeit goods from third-party Amazon sellers, Amazon has filed its first lawsuits against sellers alleged to have trafficked in fake merchandise. They're aimed at knockoff fitness and lifting equipment products carrying the TRX and Forearm Forklift brand names. TRX brand owner Fitness Anywhere joined Amazon as a plaintiff in one of the suits.\nAmazon had already begun requiring more fees and paperwork from sellers looking to sell goods from major brands such as Nike ( NKE ) and Hasbro ( HAS ) , and claims it spends tens of millions annually to combat fake-goods sales.\nBut that wasn't enough for some brands: Shoe vendor Birkenstock announced in July it's pulling its products from Amazon due to the presence of counterfeits, and some merchants have sued the e-commerce giant in the past for its role in allegedly enabling counterfeit sales.\nBut suing alleged fake-goods sellers represents a clear escalation of Amazon's efforts.",

The addition of a family plan, which is priced the same as many others , competitively increases its appeal in the crowded streaming scene.",

      "text": " 10 pm \n# Amazon has just mentioned that it will offer its Prime subscription for just $79 this Friday to celebrate the premiere of its new show “The Grand Tour”. This consists of the critically acclaimed cast from the BBC show Top Gear, so there’s certainly going to be some buzz around it. \nThere is a caveat, however. Amazon has mentioned that this reduced cost for the Prime subscription will only be valid from 12AM ET until 11:59 PT the same day. So you basically have about 24 hours to catch hold of this deal. Amazon Prime subscriptions usually cost $99 per year, so getting it at the reduced cost is surely going to appeal to a lot of people. \nIf you’re still not sold on the idea of Prime, you should know that it comes with free expedited shipping, access to Kindle books for free, ad-free music, as well as unlimited photo storage. There’s also access to Amazon’s original TV shows. So you’re getting a whole bunch of services for a paltry cost of $79 here. \nMake sure you set a reminder to get the Prime subscription on Friday.",

      "text": "Amazon's Music Unlimited upgrades with monthly & annual Family plans By Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 12:11 pm PT (03:11 pm ET) Amazon on Wednesday launched two Family plans for subscribers to Music Unlimited, its recently-launched competitor to on-demand services like Spotify and Apple Music. The standard Family plan costs $14.99 per month for both Prime and non-Prime customers, and lets up to six people share the service, each with their own separate recommendations. Prime members alone have access to an annual option costing $149, a little over $30 cheaper than subscribing per month. When Music Unlimited first launched in October , the service only had its four individual plans: $9.99 per month for the general public, $7.99 per month/$79 per year for Prime customers, or just $3.99 per month for owners of an Echo, Tap, or Echo Dot, though in that case the service will only work on one speaker. All of Amazon's plans come with a free 30-day trial period. Apple by contrast offers a 90-day window, while Spotify is completely free to use, though people have to upgrade to Premium to remove ads and get other features like offline caching. Amazon's monthly Family plan is essentially identical to those from Apple and Spotify. The main draw may therefore be with Prime customers, or people who want to take advantage of integration with the Alexa voice assistant on Echo and Fire devices. Alexa can, however, play music from services like Spotify, Pandora, and TuneIn. Topics: ",

      "text": "* Microsoft, Amazon, Apple boost S&P, Nasdaq\n* U.S. airlines rise after Buffett's Berkshire buys stake\n* Oil prices jump 3 pct\n* October U.S. retail sales rise more than expected\n* Dow down 0.29 pct, S&P up 0.11 pct, Nasdaq up 0.46 pct (Updates to open)\nBy Tanya Agrawal and Anya George Tharakan\nNov 15 The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened higher on Tuesday, helped by a recovery in tech stocks, while the Dow Jones Industrial average fell after rising for six straight days.\nThe S&P technology sector, which had fallen about 3 percent since the election, rose 1.07 percent.\nMicrosoft's 1.31 percent rise gave the biggest boost to the S&P and the Dow, followed by Amazon and Apple.\nBoth indexes had rallied in the past week since the shock victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. election on expectations of higher fiscal spending and lower regulations.\nHowever, investors remain uncertain about Trump's policies and are also keeping an eye on key appointments in his administration.\nExpectations Trump's administration will cut taxes, increase spending and accelerate inflation have boosted the dollar and driven bond yields higher.\nThe dollar slipped from an 11-month high, pausing for breath after rallying almost 3 percent since Trump's win.\n\"We're sort of poised for a little bit of a pullback here as people reassess what the new administration is likely to accomplish,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\"The uncertainty is going to hang over the markets for a while. So we may see a lot of this back and forth.\"\nAt 9:47 a.m. ET (1447 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 55.16 points, or 0.29 percent, at 18,813.53, the S&P 500 was up 2.46 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,166.66 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 24.08 points, or 0.46 percent, at 5,242.48.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index's 1.65 percent rise leading the advancers.\nThe financial index, which rose more than 10 percent since the election, fell 1.42 percent as traders cashed in profits.\nOil prices jumped more than 3 percent, bouncing back from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production to reduce a supply glut.\nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists.\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday only \"significant negative news\" could derail the Fed's high expectations for raising U.S. interest rates next month.\nThe central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. Traders have priced in an 86 percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nHome Depot fell 2.1 percent to $125.13 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported third-quarter results.\nAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Continental Holdings were up between 0.4 percent and 5.5 percent, a day after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it had bought shares in the airlines.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,630 to 1,158. On the Nasdaq, 1,337 issues fell and 1,055 advanced.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 14 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and nine new lows.

She also counted on women to be offended by Trump’s misogyny.\" \"But it turns out 'woman' isn’t much of an identity – or even basis for solidarity – in itself,\" writes Aditya Chakrabortty in The Guardian . [N]ot only did Trump carry white women, so did Romney in 2012, McCain in 2008 and Bush in 2004. Presumably, many white women have conservative views, whether on taxes or abortion, and neither Trump’s misogyny nor Clinton’s anatomy could override those commitments.Trump also appealed to many women who feared downward mobility and poverty, winning a majority of women without college degrees, as well as rural women. He denounced the trade deals that they felt had wrecked their economies, and vowed to create jobs by rebuilding America’s decaying infrastructure. Meanwhile, Clinton partied with her funders in the Hamptons. She represented an out-of-touch elite, and many women felt that deeply and resented her – or simply didn’t care about her campaign....Feminism has to mature beyond childish appeals to female unity, and recognize our many differences. It’s not the first time we’ve had to learn this lesson, but perhaps the trauma of Trump’s election will finally make it stick. Posted by Ann Althouse at 1:00 PM",

A roast is an event in which a specific individual, a guest of honor , is subjected to good-natured jokes at their expense intended to amuse the event's wider audience.... The implication is that the roastee is able to take the jokes in good humor and not as serious criticism or insult, and it is seen by some as a great honor to be roasted. The individual is surrounded by friends, fans, and well-wishers.... A group of strangers yelling \"Fuck your father!\" is not good-natured or any kind of honor. There's nothing the slightest bit friendly about it. We're told there were \"about eight\" of these teenagers, accosting Eric (and his wife) as they crossed a street in NYC. This is ugly and should be condemned, but New York Magazine asks us to take a break from our own suffering (over the outcome of the election) and appreciate it. Vile.

      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal November 16, 2016 At the top of the NYT this morning: Fanciful maps depicting 2 Americas — a GOP-majority America as a landmass with lakes and seas in places that voted majority Democratic... ... and a Democratic-majority America that is a collection of big and small islands in the waters of GOP-voting places with names like Old Glacier Gulf, High Plains Sea, and Great American Ocean. On the first map, I'm in Madison Lake, and in the second, I'm on an island they didn't bother to label with a name. Madison Island, I presume. The text around these elaborate maps begins: \"For many Americans, it feels as if the 2016 election split the country in two. To visualize this, we took the election results and created two new imaginary nations by slicing the country along the sharp divide between Republican and Democratic Americas.\" Well, that's not how it feels in Madison. The 2016 election didn't do that to us. We've been proudly envisioning Madison as its own special island since at least 1978, when the Republican Lee S. Dreyfus , running for governor, called Madison \"30 square miles surrounded by reality.” Dreyfus, who won, didn't mean it as a compliment, but Madsonians loved the phrase, and in 2013, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin proposed it as the city's official motto — with a slight update — \"77 Square Miles Surrounded by Reality.\" “It’s a statement about who we are,” he said. The decision will probably take a series of meetings, Soglin said, seemingly half joking and half serious.“This is Madison.” It almost became the official motto, failing in the City Council by a vote of 10-9 . Some people thought it might be perceived as an insult, but Soglin and many others thought it was quite positive in a self-deprecating, hip way. In January 2015, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker used the familiar Wisconsin phrase in a jab at Washington DC : \"For a lot of folks here in our nation's capital in Washington it's kind of a dome.... In fact, I like to call it 68 square miles surrounded by reality.... What I see in the states and from people in this country outside of Washington is a craving for something new, something fresh, something dynamic, instead of the top-down, government-knows-best approach that we’ve seen in Washington.\" I don't think Walker was imagining Trump as the way the people would satisfy that craving for \"something fresh, something dynamic,\" but you can see in Walker's words a description of \"this country\" that corresponds to the NYT's first map, the one with 80% of the landmass. We here in Madison had long taken ourselves out of that mass. We were happy and willing to locate ourselves outside of reality. The NYT can portray us as a big lake, but that would never be our self-image, because we are a city of full of lakes. We saw ourselves as not even here at all, unreal. That's what I've lived around for the last 3 decades. But, you know, there were still 23% of us in this county (Dane County) who voted for Donald Trump. And I bet there are few counties that were more skewed than that. So lefties and righties do live together. You have to choose to want to think of America as 2 countries. You can choose unreal if it suits your post-election freakout needs. It's a free country. A country called the United States. Posted by Ann Althouse at 7:23 AM",

As you move a group’s slider in either direction, you will see each party’s share of the electorate change. Winning coalitions are fragile—internal squabbles among groups are almost inevitable. That gives the opposing party an opportunity to woo disaffected voters. But bear in mind that, in order to achieve gains with a group, you may have to take positions that will alienate others.

To put it another way, time travel is two years older than Dracula, and eight years younger than Sherlock Holmes. The very term 'time travel' is a back-formation from the unnamed principal character of the story, whom Wells calls 'the Time Traveller.' The new idea caught on so quickly that it was appearing in the Oxford English Dictionary by 1914. Wells is described by Gleick as 'a thoroughly modern man, a believer in socialism, free love, and bicycles.' He was a serious thinker in his own way, forceful and coarse-grained, but the invention of the time machine wasn’t one of his deep philosophical conceptions. It was instead a narrative device for a story with two cruxes, one of them political-philosophical and the other imaginative. Its main argumentative point comes when Wells travels to the far future and finds that humanity has evolved into two different species, the brutish, underground-dwelling Morlocks and the etiolated, effete, surface-living Eloi. This, Wells implies, is what could happen if current trends toward inequality continue unchecked....\" From \"Can We Escape from Time?\" by John Lanchester in The New York Review of Books. The book reviewed is \"Time Travel: A History,\" by James Gleick. (Gleick wrote \"Chaos: Making a New Science.\" Maybe you read that.) Posted by Ann Althouse at 7:22 PM",

Amazon was No. 4 on the list followed by Oracle in the No. 5 spot and Accenture at No. 6. \nPerhaps a bit of a surprise was that a number of other big tech names — like Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft were not on the list. \nThe most popular companies with recent graduates were: Deloitte",

      "text": "Amazon Prime is dropping its price for one day only in honor of the release of 'The Grand Tour'. (Photo : Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Amazon) Advertisement \nAmazon Prime is slashing its yearly price by $20, but for one day only. \nThe $99 price tag for one year of Amazon Prime can be a daunting one for some, but you can purchase a subscription for $79 on Friday . Benefits of being a Prime member include access to thousands of hours of content, including top movies, original series like Transparent, The Man in the High Castle and Bosch , streaming through Amazon Music and free two-day shipping. \nGo to this link on Friday to purchase the $79 plan for Amazon Prime. \nAmazon is reducing the price in conjunction with the release of its new original series, The Grand Tour . The series centers on original Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May as they travel the world. \n\"A show about adventure, excitement and friendship... as long as you accept that the people you call friends are also the ones you find extremely annoying. Sometimes it's even a show about cars. Follow them on their global adventure,\" says the Amazon plot description. \nThe tour includes stops on Los Angeles, Nashville, South Africa, England, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Scotland and the United Arab Emirates. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos said that the deal for the series with the three Top Gear presenters was \"very, very, very expensive,\" for the company. \"They're worth a lot and they know it. ... I think we're in a golden age of television, so if you go back in time even just five years, you couldn't get A-list talent to do TV serials, or, if you could, it was a rare thing. But that's flipped completely.\" \nThe Grand Tour premieres Friday on Amazon Video in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Japan. Episodes will drop on a weekly basis from there. Other countries will receive the series in December.  ",

      "text": "  \nAmazon introduced a crazy new feature on Wednesday that’ll let you take a peak at what’s inside your boxes. It’s going to be particularly useful as we approach the holidays, especially if you’re trying to hide gifts from the kiddies. Just leave them inside the Amazon box, knowing full well what’s inside, and your kids will never find Santa’s secret stash of gifts. \n“Package X Ray” is a new function inside of the Amazon Shopping iPhone application. All you need to do is launch the application, tap the camera icon, scan the barcode that’s on the Amazon box, and the app will show you exactly what’s inside each box. You can tap on each individual item and learn more about it, like how much you paid and when it was ordered. Package X Ray may still spoil the surprise \nAmazon doesn’t mention this, but you should still be really careful with the boxes. Presumably, anyone on the same Amazon Prime account could see what’s inside the box, potentially spoiling the surprise of any gifts you had planned. That means kids with access to the shared family Prime account might still be able to peak inside, assuming they somehow learn about this feature and have access to an iPhone. \nBy all means, this is a really smart system, and one that probably helps Amazon with inventory management, too. Crazy world we live in. Topics # Amazon # Amazon # iOS Todd Haselton \nTodd Haselton has been writing professionally since 2006 during his undergraduate days at Lehigh University.

      "text": "25 Fun Facts About Your Favorite Nintendo NES Games Mental Floss 4 days ago mentalfloss.com\n© Amazon 25 Fun Facts About Your Favorite Nintendo NES Games If you managed to get your hands on the new Nintendo NES Classic today, consider yourself lucky. Like a scene out of the mid-1980s, the miniature game system—which comes pre-loaded with 30 classic video games—is flying off store shelves before it even touches them. While we can’t promise you’ll find one in your stocking this holiday season, we can share these fun facts about your favorite NES games.\n1. THE KONAMI CODE’S ORIGINS ARE IN GRADIUS. Way back in 1985, Kazuhisa Hashimoto was working on the arcade game Gradius . Because he didn’t want to actually play the whole game during the testing process, he developed a little shortcut that gave him a full set of power-ups, letting him live long enough to easily get to where he needed to without dying. When the game went live in 1986, the code was still there. To get full power-ups, all a player had to do was enter the code up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A.\nThe trick caught on, and soon, the so-called “ Konami Code ” could be found in a number of arcade and video games. Most notably, it gave you 30 extra lives in Contra . This super-secret (…or not) code has a special place in the hearts of geeks who have since grown up and used the insider code in websites, in movies, and on TV shows.\n2. SUPER C USED A DIFFERENT CODE. The original Contra was famous for featuring the Konami Code (Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start) to score a player 30 lives. For whatever reason, Super C , the Contra sequel, instead used the code Right, Left, Down, Up, A, B, Start, which only gave a player 10 lives.\n3. BALLOON FIGHT WAS ONE OF SATORU IWATA’S FIRST PROJECTS. Balloon Fight was one of the first games the late Satoru Iwata worked on as he began his career at Nintendo. He later went on to become Nintendo's president and CEO, presiding over the launches of the Nintendo DS and Wii.\n4. BUBBLE BOBBLE IS GOOD FOR YOUR BRAIN. Bubble Bobble may seem rudimentary by today’s video game standards, but it proved that video games can be good for the brain. Educators praised the game’s ability to help kids overcome developmental challenges with its focus on problem-solving, strategy, and motor skills.\n5. PIZZA INSPIRED PAC-MAN .\n© YouTube It’s not easy to create a game based solely on the concept of eating. But Namco employee Toru Iwatani did just that in 1980 by taking the idea of a pizza with a slice missing, and then having it eat a bunch of dots while being chased by ghosts in a maze. (Iwatani has also said that the shape is a rounded version of the square Japanese character for “mouth.\") The name of the game, Pakkuman , was inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeia, “paku-paku,\" which describes the sound of eating, similar to the English word “chomp.\" As the game was brought to market, the title morphed into Puck Man .\nBut when Puck Man made his way to North America there was concern that the arcade cabinets would be vandalized by making the P into an F to spell something entirely different. A compromise was reached and the game became known as Pac-Man instead. Thanks to the American marketing machine, the name Pac-Man was eventually adopted for the game all over the world.\n6. AN ORIGINAL COPY OF CASTLEVANIA IS WORTH SOME SERIOUS CASH. The Dracula-based video game Castlevania is particularly valuable these days. Sealed versions of the game sell for upwards of $900, depending on the condition. Original Nintendo NES editions of Castlevania and Castlevania 2 have sold for more than $950.\n7. ICE CLIMBER GAVE BIRTH TO SUPER MARIO BROS. Ice Climber was the first game that Kazuaki Morita worked on. He would go on to refine the game's formula for his next title at Nintendo: Super Mario Bros. , where the action moved horizontally instead of vertically.\n8. THE REAL MARIO WAS A LANDLORD, NOT A PLUMBER. © YouTube During the development of Donkey Kong, Jr. , a Nintendo employee reportedly pointed out that the character looked a lot like Mario Segale , the Italian landlord of Nintendo’s U.S. office. Thus, Mario was born. The original “Lady” character became “Pauline” at the same time in honor of one team member’s wife, Polly.\n9. THE GAME VERSION OF MARIO WAS ORIGINALLY A CARPENTER. In Mario's first appearance in Donkey Kong , he was portrayed as a carpenter . But after a colleague remarked that his overalls made him look more like a plumber, legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto changed the character's occupation. This alteration also led to the game being set underground in the pipe-populated sewers of New York City.\n10. THE NEW YORK TIMES THOUGHT MARIO AND LUIGI WERE JANITORS. When longtime Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi passed away in 2013, The New York Times ran an obituary that Quote: d one of its own articles from 1988, in which Mario and Luigi were incorrectly described as janitors. On September 27, 2013—25 years after the article in question ran—the paper ran a correction :\n“An obituary on Sept. 20 about Hiroshi Yamauchi, the longtime president of Nintendo, included a quotation from a 1988 New York Times article that inaccurately described the Nintendo video game Super Mario Bros. 2. The brothers Mario and Luigi, who appear in this and other Nintendo games, are plumbers, not janitors.”\n11. THERE’S AN EXCITEBIKE ARENA IN MARIO KART 8 . In 2014's Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U, an Excitebike arena became available as downloadable content (DLC), allowing the original game's 8-bit track to be played in a 3D environment.\n12. FINAL FANTASY GOT ITS NAME FROM ITS CREATOR’S DESIRE TO RETIRE. One of the most popular role-playing game franchises of all time got its name from almost becoming the last project its creator ever worked on. According to Hironobu Sakaguchi , he named the game he'd been working on Final Fantasy because he planned to quit the video-game industry if it didn't sell well. Despite the small staff of developers he was afforded for the game, it managed to sell—to the tune of 400,000 copies initially and a long list of sequels, spin-offs, and remastered releases in the years to come. Sakaguchi went on to serve for several years as President of Square USA, the company that first took a chance on Final Fantasy .\n13. A U.S. COURT RULED THAT DONKEY KONG AND KING KONG ARE TWO DIFFERENT APES. Filed in 1982, argued in a federal court in May of 1984, and concluded that October, Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd . represented Universal’s demand for a piece of Nintendo’s Donkey Kong action. The game had pulled in $180 million in sales from around 60,000 arcade machines by 1982, and the studio alleged copyright infringement due to the titular villain’s resemblance to King Kong.\nAttorney John Kirby, Jr., who represented Nintendo (and for whom it's believed the company’s puffiest character was named, in thanks), pointed out that Universal itself had proved in the case of Universal City Studios, Inc. v. RKO General, Inc. that the plot and characters of King Kong were in the public domain. In the Nintendo case, the court ruled that Universal had acted in bad faith with the suit, had no right to the characters, and that, in any case, the studio had failed to prove that “there was any likelihood that an appreciable number of prudent purchasers [were] likely to be misled or confused as to the source of Donkey Kong ” based on the ape’s and the game’s attributes.\n14. YES, METROID AND KID ICARUS ARE RELATED. If you think Metroid and Kid Icarus are similar, there's a reason for that: They were both developed by the same team , including director Satoru Okada, co-director/artist Yoshio Sakamoto, and composer Hip Tanaka.\n15. METROID LOOKED TO ALIEN FOR INSPIRATION.\n© YouTube A fantastic game on its own, 1986's Metroid became the stuff of legends when it saved its biggest surprise for the final moments . After a player completed the game, a short scene revealed that the space-suited, missile-blasting hero was in fact (* gasp *) a woman! This shocking revelation wasn't something that had been planned from the start, and was instead the result of a programmer asking, “Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?” midway through the game's development. The Metroid team already counted Ridley Scott's female-led, sci-fi horror movie Alien as one of the game's chief inspirations, so they decided to run with that innocent suggestion—and the rest is gaming history.\n© Jessica Rinaldi/Reuters A sign taped next to an old Nintendo system reads, 'Please Do Not Blow Into The Cartridges' at the PAX East gaming conference in Boston, Massachusetts April 7, 2012. REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi (UNITED STATES - Tags: SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY) - RTR30HBE 16. WE MAY NEVER KNOW WHO JUSTIN BAILEY WAS. Justin Bailey was a programmer. Justin Bailey was an inside joke. Justin Bailey was referencing British slang for \"bathing suit.\"\nIf you played Metroid in the 1980s, chances are you’ve heard one of these explanations for the game’s most infamous password. Entering \" Justin Bailey \" and keying in an additional 12 blank spaces allowed players to begin the game with heroine Samus Aran appearing in a leotard instead of her armor while being supplied with a full arsenal of missiles. Where did he come from? Was he man or myth? Or was it all just one very weird fluke?\nTurns out, he could very well have just been a bored player who accidentally became the most famous (and hypothetical) NES gamer of all time. (Click here for a much more detailed explanation.)\n17. THE ARCADE VERSION ENDING OF DOUBLE DRAGON II: THE REVENGE IS DIFFERENT FROM NINTENDO’S. The end of Double Dragon II: The Revenge differs on both the NES and arcade. On the NES, damsel-in-distress Marian is brought back to life after being killed early in the story; the arcade version ends on a much more dour note, leaving her dead. You can compare both versions below:\n18. A SEQUEL TO MEGA MAN 2 WAS ANNOUNCED, BUT NEVER MATERIALIZED. In 2010, Capcom announced that it would release Mega Man Universe for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade the following year. The company promised that the new video game would have similar gameplay to Mega Man 2 and would give the player the ability to customize their own levels and stages. But a few months later, Capcom canceled the game and apologized to Mega Man fans who were anticipating the new release.\nCapcom didn’t disclose a specific reason why they canceled Mega Man Universe , instead citing “various circumstances,” which might have included the exit of the designer of Mega Man Universe , Keiji Inafune.\nIf Mega Man Universe had actually been released, it would have been the first time the character would have been called “Mega Man” in his native Japan. Historically, the character was called “Rock Man,\" but was changed when the video game was imported to the United States.\n19. NINJA GAIDEN REVOLUTIONIZED THE CONCEPT OF CUTSCENES. Ninja Gaiden 's director, Hideo Yoshizawa (credited as Sakurazaki), wanted the NES version of the game to have a much deeper story than the arcade version, so he implemented 20 minutes of cinematic cutscenes . Though standard now, a story told through cutscenes was revolutionary at the time.\n20. BEFORE PUNCH-OUT! ’S OFFICIAL RELEASE, 10,000 JAPANESE FANS GOT A GOLD VERSION. © YouTube Nintendoficionados who submitted high scores from 1987’s Golf U.S. Course Famicom Tournament received gold-colored Famicom (the Japanese equivalent of the NES) cartridges containing Punch-Out! ’s near-identical precursor, with Super Macho Man as its final foe.\n21. TO ADVANCE IN STARTROPICS , YOU NEEDED TO HAVE THE BOX. In StarTropics , to advance the story, players were required to input a code that was attached to a letter . However, the letter didn’t exist in the game; it was physically included in the box the game came in. This obviously caused problems as players could easily lose it (or wind up with a rental copy lacking the letter at all) and be stuck forever, so Nintendo had to reprint the code in Nintendo Power magazine to try and help confused gamers.\n22. THE LEGEND OF ZELDA ’S “ZELDA” IS NAMED AFTER ZELDA FITZGERALD. © YouTube Despite being conceived in Japan, The Legend of Zelda ’s titular princess was named after a native Alabaman. Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that Zelda Fitzgerald—novelist, feminist, and wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald—was the inspiration for his Hyrulian heroine’s handle.\n23. THERE IS SIGNIFICANCE TO LINK’S NAME, TOO. Originally, The Legend of Zelda was meant to be a game that spanned in-universe time periods, beginning in the canonical “past” and ending up in the “future,” with the Triforce acting as a mode of transport between them. The series hero’s unusual moniker was meant to symbolize his role as a link between the eras. But Nintendo’s current position is that he is a “link” between the player and the game.\n24. SHIGERU MIYAMOTO WAS DISAPPOINTED BY ZELDA II . When gaming site Kotaku asked Miyamoto if he’s ever made a bad game, the designer responded that Zelda II: The Adventure of Link didn’t live up to his expectations. “We could have done more with [ Link ],” he said. “It would have been nice to have had bigger enemies in the game, but the [NES] hardware wasn't capable of doing that.”\n25. GHOSTS 'N GOBLINS IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE TOUGHEST VIDEO GAMES OF ALL TIME. © YouTube Not only is Ghosts 'n Goblins known as one of the hardest games of all time , you actually have to beat it twice to actually complete it (it turns out the first play-through is all just a dream for the player).\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "The Great Plains lost 3,686,960 acres that year; in contrast, the Brazilian Amazon lost 1.4 million, as the World Wildlife Fund points out .\nThe WWF calculates that an area the size of Kansas has been converted to row crops since 2009. That puts monarch butterflies — along with many other species of birds, plants, and insects — at risk.\n“America’s Great Plains are being plowed under at an alarming rate,” said WWF’s Martha Kauffman in a statement. “Centuries old, critical prairie habitat that’s home to amazing wildlife and strong ranching and tribal communities is rapidly being converted to cropland and most people don’t even realize it.”\nUltimately, there are just two ways to stop conversion of land to agriculture: Reduce demand (i.e. eat less meat , use less biofuel), or grow more food in less space. More here .\nThis story was originally published by Grist with the headline We plowed up more wild habitat in the Great Plains than in the Brazilian Amazon in 2014. on Nov 16, 2016.",

      "text": "November 16, 2016 Filed Under: Amazon , Roundups by Lil' Luna 0 This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclosure policy here . I know many of you guys like to cook and bake, and that is why you come to the site often. It’s obvious that I love to cook and bake, and I’ve realized over the years just how much joy it brings me to get in the kitchen and to make something delicious. In fact, I think it’s pretty safe to say that some of my best memories include me being in the kitchen with my mom and sisters or with my kids. 😉 Over the years as I’ve gotten better with my kitchen skills, I’ve obtained a ton more kitchen gadgets and appliances to help me in my efforts to be a better cook and baker. With the blog and with all the recipes I post, I’m constantly asked about my favorite kitchen products, and with Christmas just around the corner, I thought it was the perfect time to share with you some of the BEST Kitchen Gadgets I use. These are great gifts ideas for yourself or for anyone who loves to be in the kitchen (or for those who want to have better kitchen skills). Some of the items in this round-up are inexpensive and some are more expensive like the Kitchen-Aid Mxer, but it’s also one of my favorite items since I use it weekly! As I continue to use more and more products, I am planning on adding to this list so that it becomes a reference for you and myself. Hope this helps out as you collect your favorite kitchen tools or try to get some new items for the favorite cook/baker in your life. 😉",

      "title": "Barnes And Noble Unveils $50 Nook Tablet To Extinguish Amazon’s Fire",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Wednesday, November 16, 2016 Barnes And Noble Unveils $50 NOOK Tablet 7 To Extinguish Amazon’s Fire In late October, we got our fist peek at a new tablet from Barnes & Noble that is destined to take on the budget Amazon Fire . The tablet broke cover via an FCC filing , but now it has been officially unveiled.\nThe device, called the NOOK Tablet 7, features — you guessed it — a 7-inch IPS display with a resolution of 1024x600 (171 ppi). 8GB of storage is onboard, although a microSD slot can accommodate another 128GB for your media needs. Other hardware features include dual-band 802.11a/b/g/n wireless, micro USB 2.0 connectivity, 3.5mm headphone jack, 5MP rear camera and a 2MP front-facing camera. \nBarnes & Noble hasn’t officially outed the processor that is running the show, but there’s reportedly a MediaTek MT8163 SoC paired with a Mali-T720 GPU under the hood. The onboard 3,000 mAh battery is good enough for 7 hours of battery life. The NOOK Tablet 7 runs Android and thankfully includes full access to the Google Play Store (something that the Amazon Fire can’t claim with FireOS , a forked version of Android). \nBarnes & Noble is taking pre-orders for the NOOK 7 Tablet right now for $49.99, and the device will actually be available on November 25 th . Given that its specs match up pretty favorably to the 7-inch Amazon Fire , which is also priced at $49.99, we could see both tablets vying for the attention of bargain shoppers this holiday season. \nAmazon definitely has name recognition with its Fire, but you can’t easily dismiss the appeal of the NOOK Tablet 7 having full access to the Google Play Store.",

      "title": "Amazon will offer more than a month of Black Friday deals",
      "text": "November 16, 2016, 2:52 PM Amazon will offer more than a month of Black Friday deals By Matt Lindner Associate Editor Macy’s, Sears, Toys R Us and other retailers also expand Black Friday promotions beyond one day. \nAmazon.com Inc. is turning Black Friday into more than a month-long event. \nAmerica’s largest e-retailer, as ranked by the Internet   , today began 35 straight days of Black Friday deals, offering discounts on a number of Amazon devices as well as consumer electronics, toys, home items and other products. Much like it did last year, Amazon is taking a rapid-fire approach, offering a new promotion up to every five minutes. Last year, Amazon began offering Black Friday deals a week before the Friday after Thanksgiving. \nBut just because Amazon is spreading out its Black Friday deals doesn’t mean it won’t be making an extra push on Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon says shoppers can expect to see some of the best deals of the season from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, calling that five-day stretch the “Turkey 5.” Related Articles Amazon drives the bulk of holiday sales for many e-retailers \n“Customers want to shop anywhere, any time, and any way, especially during the five super popular days for online shopping running from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday,” Amazon vice president Steve Shure says in an announcement about the deals.Amazon also announced today it is offering Amazon Prime memberships for $79 all day on Friday, $20 off the usual cost of an annual membership. The promotion is being offered to celebrate the launch of its latest original series on Amazon Video, The Grand Tour . Prime members enjoy perks such as free two-day shipping, streaming video, and other benefits. \nMacy’s Inc. (No. 6) also is stretching out its Black Friday deals, but not as far as Amazon. \nThe department store chain announced today that shoppers will be able to take advantage of deals on a limited number of items online this week, from Thursday through Saturday. All of its Black Friday deals will go live on Thanksgiving, with deals on items ranging from apparel to kitchen items available through the following Thursday. \n“In addition to all the great Black Friday discounts in store and online, this year we’ll offer even more opportunities to save through Cyber Week— with five full days of online specials, so they will have the freedom to shop all week long at their leisure, scoring big on hundreds of deals,” chief merchandising officer Tim Baxter says. \nSears Holdings Corp. (No. 14) is hoping the lure of free shipping on all web orders with no minimum purchase lures holiday shoppers to its site in the week leading up to Thanksgiving. The retailer is offering the promotion from Wednesday night through Thanksgiving. \nTarget Corp. (No. 22) announced today that shoppers who want to pick up their online orders in stores can do so starting at 6 p.m. local time on Thanksgiving Day. Stores are going to be a critical part of Target’s strategy when it comes to fulfilling online orders during the holiday season. In 325 of its stores, the retail chain will have in-store employees dedicated to fulfilling online orders. Shoppers will be able to determine who those employees are because they will wear white shirts that say “order pickup” on them to differentiate themselves from other Target workers, who generally wear red shirts and khaki pants. \n“More than 90% of our Order Pickups will be ready in an hour, up from 85% last year, thanks to the efforts of our team and enhancements to processes and technologies such as RFID,” Target writes. RFID is short for radio frequency identification technology, which helps retailers track merchandise. “Say our team members are having difficulty locating an Order Pickup item in the store—that’s going to slow down the process and delay your pickup time. With RFID technology, our team members can quickly and accurately find what they’re looking for so we can complete your order and deliver everything you’re looking for without having to make you wait an extra minute.” \nTarget also has remodeled 80 of its stores to add a designated online order pickup section to make it easier for online shoppers to pick up their purchases at the store. \nOther retailers that have rolled out Black Friday deals recently include: Groupon Goods (No. 26) began offering a Black Friday sneak peek sale on Tuesday with up to 80% off select products. Toys R Us Inc. (No. 35) will offer early online access to its Black Friday deals via its Rewards R Us program starting on Sunday. All online shoppers will have access to Black Friday deals at 9 p.m. Eastern on Nov. 23, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Topics",

November 16, 2016 by Deals We Like Leave A Comment \nThis post may contain affiliate links from our advertising partners, such as American Express. Read my Advertiser Disclosure policy here. \nA lucrative promotion just caught my eye where targeted members are receiving an opportunity to receive a $25 statement credit with a $25 purchase on Amazon.ca – ultimately giving you $25 for free! \nThis promotion is only available to Canadian Basic American Express Consumer and Small Business Cardmembers and limited to the first 25,000 cardmembers that register. Emails were sent out for those eligible, but you might as well try registering even if you did not receive the email just to check. \nIf you are eligible, you must make a single transaction of $25 CAD or more with your registered American Express credit card at Amazon.ca . The charge must hit your card between November 14 and December 31, 2016. Typically, with these types of promotions ANY charge made on Amazon qualify, including gift cards. \nSince I do not have a Canadian Amex I am not eligible, but for those readers up north that can take advantage, enjoy! \nThanks to Canadian Kilometers for sharing this promotion!

Since I was traveling all the time I decided that I was really going to take advantage of the points and miles game...

      "text": "Share This Tweet This A poster on a sales floor of a mass home electronics retailer in Osaka on Nov. 10, 2016, shows the Nintendo Classic Mini Family Computer is sold out. Nintendo Co. the same day launched the smaller, palm-sized version of its 33-year-old popular Famicom gam(Photo : Photo by Kyodo News via Getty Images)) Share This Tweet This \nThe NES Classic is one of the most demanded items this year will be finally available for purchase on November 11, Friday. Amazon will start to sell this product from Friday afternoon at 5 pm. \nConsumers have reported that the NES Classic has been relatively difficult to secure days before its launch. A few retailers held brief pre-order periods. But anyone who didn't order in on those is left hoping but there will be ample supply at the time of release on Friday, November11. \nAmazon sent an email to its interested customers confirmed that the NES Classic will be available for purchase starting on Friday at 5 pm ET. Amazon says supply will have \"very limited quantities\" so purchases will be limited each product to one person. Advertisement \nIn the e-mail, Amazon says to customers that ,\" At 2 pm on Friday for your best chance at buying an NES classic\", Amazon email warns, \"Demand is expected to be very high and there is no guarantee that it will remain in stock for long\" \nIn NES Classic review unit, the game looks gorgeous on the console's \"Pixel Perfect\" setting that rounds off pixel edges for a smoother image. And the additional advantage of this save states makes it easy to hang onto your progress in 30-year-old-game, reported by Circuit Breaker. \nReally, the only downside to this package is the controller. The gamepad is a fine recreation of the original but the cord that connects it to the mini-console is just only two feet long .So that makes problem in larger living rooms. \nAccording to Mashable , the NES Classic also supports the Wii Classic and Wii U Pro controllers. But really it would have been nice to see Nintendo simply makes cord a little longer. Advertisement \nSo get ready to form a digital line on Friday afternoon. \n",

      "text": "TWEET Amazon is taking a different approach to Black Friday this year. Instead of rolling out a traditional shopping ad, the e-retailer giant has launched a special Black Friday Deals store that will offer up a combination of daily deals, flash sales with new discounts — as often as every five minutes — and a holiday guide designed to help consumers find everything they need with no muss or fuss. Amazon Prime members will also have access to extra deals (free two-day shipping included), discounts on new video games and the ability to use A lexa Voice for shopping as long as they have a smart device, like the Echo Dot. \nSince the company's holiday deals page is set to change every day, it would be in every shoppers' best interest to grab whatever they want as soon as possible while supplies last. Below you'll find some of today's best Amazon deals. Make sure to check back every day for new items. D aily deals for Nov. 15: ",

      "text": "By Carla Mozee, MarketWatch\nMorrison's signs delivery deal with Amazon\nEuropean stocks were clinging to a small gain Wednesday, with some help from the telecom sector, but losses within the chemical and energy sectors kept overall gains for the market in check.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index was up 0.1% at 339.358, as technology, telecom and utility shares advanced. But basic materials, consumer goods and industrial shares struggled. The benchmark on Tuesday rose 0.3%, aided by gains for oil and gas stocks.\nOil and gas shares on Wednesday started to sag as oil prices pushed lower.\nMovers and shakers: The basic materials sector was lower, with shares of Bayer AG (BAYN.XE) down 5% after the German pharmaceutical and chemicals heavyweight placed 4 billion euros (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bayer-shares-skid-after-monsanto-deal-move-2016-11-16) ($4.28 billion) in convertible bonds as a way to pay for its purchase of Monsanto Co. (MON) .\nIn the telecoms group, shares of Bouygues SA (EN.FR) tacked on 3.6% after the French conglomerate posted better-than-expected net profit (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bouygues-profit-beats-views-on-telecom-unit-boost-2016-11-16) for the first nine months of the year, lifted by the telecom unit it tried to sell earlier in 2016.\nIliad SA (ILD.FR) shares rose 2.2% after the French telecommunications company posted a 6.5% rise in third-quarter revenue. The company has signed up hundreds of thousands of new mobile service subscribers (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/iliad-revenue-rises-on-increase-in-subscribers-2016-11-16) as it carries out an aggressive price war with rivals.\nFrom the retail front, shares of Ocado PLC (OCDO.LN) dropped 5%. On Wednesday, Wm. Morrison Supermarkets PLC (MRW.LN) said it has formed a rpartnership with Amazon.com Inc (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/morrisons-taps-amazon-for-1-hour-deliveries-2016-11-16). (AMZN) to offer one-hour deliveries from its stores in London and Hertfordshire, U.K. Morrison shares, however, were up 0.5%.\nABN Amro Group NV (ABN.AE) shares fell 2.4% after the Dutch bank said it's shedding another 1,500 jobs (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/abn-amro-to-cut-1500-more-jobs-net-profit-rises-2016-11-16) in the coming years as it accelerates its restructuring efforts.\nIndexes: In Frankfurt, the DAX 30 fell 0.3% to 10,702.72. France's CAC 40 index lost 0.3% to 4,523.52.\nItaly's FTSE MIB picked up 0.3% at 16,739.54. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index gave up 0.2% at 6,777.35.\nThe euro was trading at $1.0723 compared with $1.0731 late Tuesday.\n 16, 2016 05:07 ET (10:07 ",

      "text": "Wasn’t Amazon’s arrival supposed to be Armageddon to Black Friday? And yet, lines are still long. Parking feels like a treasure hunt. And gift-wrappers are still ornery by 5.\nIf all that makes it harder to get into the spirit of Christmas shopping, then maybe some spirits will ease the stress. Need a bar stool while your significant other shops? Or maybe a nosh to replenish you on this marathon shopping spree? We’ve got you covered. Below are bars to hit in downtown Seattle and Bellevue, all open on Black Friday.\nBest place to people-watch: The view from Oliver’s Lounge’s window is Hallmark-esque — the 12-story Christmas tree across the street and the passers-by holding Macy’s shopping bags and strolling by the wreaths and Christmas lights. When it snows, there’s no better Christmas view than from this historic hotel bar.\nMayflower Park Hotel, 405 Olive Way, Seattle (206-623-8700 or mayflowerpark.com/olivers-lounge ) \nMost Read Stories ‘Deadliest Catch’ cast member Jake Harris hospitalized; police investigating attack Should California, Oregon and Washington join Canada? #Calexit talk envelops West Coast The reason the Seahawks released RB Christine Michael: trust and consistency Earl Thomas, Rob Gronkowski have cool Twitter exchange about hard hit in Sunday's game Trump voters hiding in plain sight in King County | Danny Westneat Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Best mall bar in downtown Seattle: Located on the third floor of Pacific Place, the Sixth Avenue Wine Seller has a 30-seat back bar that’s always quiet amid all the chaos at the mall.\n600 Pine St., Seattle (206-621-2669 or on Facebook ) \nBest mall bar in Bellevue: Nordstrom in Bellevue Square has a cocktail bar with mescal and everything. The Habitant sits on the second floor in the women’s department, though you’re just as likely to find guys nursing beers to kill time while their partners shop.\n100 Bellevue Square, Bellevue (425-455-5800 or shop.nordstrom.com/st/nordstrom-bellevue-square ) \nBest bar to get away from the mayhem in Bellevue: Many bar restaurants in downtown Bellevue will be standing-room only. Walk a few blocks or drive to Lot. No. 3. (Find free parking at the Bellevue Tower parking garage for customers.) This forgotten gem boasts one of the best craft-cocktail and whiskey selections on the Eastside.\n460 106th Ave. N.E., Bellevue (425-440-0025 or lotno3.com ) \nBest kept secret: Bernard’s on Seneca is old-school Seattle, a dive that’s an anachronism among all the sleek high-rises and techie haunts. It’s where the lifers hang out. Look for the oak door that leads to this medieval-like subterranean space with a Bayeux-esque tapestry.\n315 Seneca St., Seattle (206-623-5110 or bernardsonseneca.com ) \nSwanky hangout: Fairmont Olympic Hotel and the Four Seasons Hotel are obvious. Be more original. Take your in-laws or turn your shopping excursion into date night at The Polar Bar , lesser known but as grand as the other two hotel bars. Located inside the Arctic Club Hotel on the second-floor lobby, it’s an homage to the old Gentlemen’s club. (Note: Don’t confuse this with the Juno bar and restaurant on the bottom floor.)\n700 Third Ave., Seattle ( thearcticclubseattle.com ) \nLocal hangout: Downtown apartment dwellers and office workers hole up at The Diller Room , which has a stellar whiskey list. Try the Japanese whiskey that the bartender aged himself in a sherry cask. Booze is priced a few bucks cheaper than what other downtown restaurants charge.\n1224 First Ave., Seattle (206-467-4042 or dillerroom.com ) \nBest bar food: RN74 will likely be everyone’s first choice. You’ll figure that out as soon as you walk into this standing-room-only bar. If you don’t want to deal with the mayhem, walk south to the Bookstore Bar & Cafe, where chef Eric Rivera , the former culinary director at Chicago’s acclaimed Alinea, heads the kitchen and offers bar bites such as the Japanese pancake with salmon roe and its signature cheeseburger. Or hit Miller’s Guild for its carnivorous happy hour.\nRN74, 1433 Fourth Ave., Seattle (206-456-7474 or michaelmina.net ) \nBookstore Bar & Cafe, 1007 First Ave., Seattle (206-624-3646 or bookstorebar.com ) \nMiller’s Guild, 612 Stewart St., Seattle (206-443-3663 or millersguild.com ) \nTan Vinh: 206-515-5656 or tvinh@seattletimes.com .

      "text": "Amazon’s ‘The Grand Tour’ Will Be Available Globally This December  18 PST \nLike tech videos? Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube \nIf you’re something of a car enthusiast, there’s a good chance you might have seen the BBC’s Top Gear series. You might also recall that its trio of presenters – Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May – left the series and went on to work with Amazon on a new series called The Grand Tour . \nThis is great news for those who enjoyed their dynamic friendship on the screen, but the bad news is that it was only available to Amazon Prime subscribers. Or at least that was the case until now where in the video above, Clarkson, May, and Hammond revealed that The Grand Tour would be released globally in December and will be available in 200 countries. \nGiven that Amazon Prime’s availability is rather limited at the moment, it makes sense that Amazon would want to make the show more available to non-Prime subscribers. Given that the show also costs a reported £160 million, making it available globally will definitely help the company recoup their investment a lot quicker. \nThe show’s first episode is expected to debut on the 18th of November, which is this Friday, and that is when Prime members get access to it first. Note that Amazon has also announced that they will be discounting Prime membership for a da y from $99 to $79, so if you’d rather not wait for its global availability, then you might want to take advantage of this offer. \nFiled in General .

      "title": "Amazon To Discount Prime Membership To $79 On The 18th Of November",
      "text": "Amazon To Discount Prime Membership To $79 On The 18th Of November  17 PST \nAmazon’s Prime membership costs $99 a year, which we guess can be thought of as pricey for some users. However there are numerous benefits to subscribing to Prime, such as faster/free shipping, access to other services like Prime Video, Prime Music, Photos, and so on, so in reality it’s like a bundled service that costs $99 a year. \nHowever if you can’t bring yourself to spend $99, not to worry because for one day only , Amazon will be discounting its Prime membership by $20 , bringing it down to a slightly more affordable $79 a year. This is a one-day-only offer that will kick off at 12AM on the 18th of November, which is this Friday, and will run until 11:59PM PT. \nNote that the discount only applies to the first year of your Prime subscription, meaning that when it renews the next year, it will go back to $79. We can only assume that Amazon is hoping by then you’d have realized all the benefits of having a Prime subscription and will keep your subscription. However if you’d rather not pay $99, then you’ll have to remember to cancel your subscription before it renews itself. \nAlso this seems to be applicable to new subscribers, so if you’re already subscribed you will continue to pay $99 and will not be getting the discount. That being said, with Amazon’s Black Friday deals expected to run an entire month , perhaps it’s not such a bad idea to subscribe to it. \nFiled in General . Read more about Amazon .

We've been covering all of the latest deals and sales that have been popping up, and one company that continues to offer awesome savings year after year is none other than Amazon. However, in addition to the tremendous savings that they're already offering, the company has just updated their iOS app with a new feature should come in handy for ordering gifts this holiday season. The new feature is called \"Package X Ray\", and it's actually pretty darn cool. Package X Ray allows you to use your iPhone to scan your packages when they arrive to see what's inside of them without having to open them, and Amazon couldn't have picked a better time to introduce a feature like this. To use Package X Ray, simply open the Amazon app on your iPhone, touch the camera icon, then the Package X Ray option, and use the viewfinder to scan the barcode that's present on your Amazon package. Once the barcode is scanned, you'll get a pop-up on your phone showing you everything that the package contains. Multiple items in one box? No problem. The app allows you to select specific items inside of the package and then see full information on it, such as how much you paid, when you placed your order, and more. Privacy certainly is an issue with something along these lines, and in their YouTube video that they posted to announce the new feature, Amazon says that, \"No, you won't be able to peek inside the boxes that aren't for you.\" We don't know if this means that only the buyer will be able to see the contents or if anyone that's connected to that Prime account will be able to, but rest assured that strangers won't be able to come up and scan your packages to see what's in them. The update's already hit my iPhone, and it should be arriving to yours soon if it hasn't already.",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Rather than offer only a few days of steep discounts, Amazon announced it’s extending Black Friday prices past the end of this month. The online giant on Wednesday said it will offer deals on products, from electronics to toys, until Dec. 22, a few days before Christmas Day.\nAccording to Amazon, customers will be able to find new deals as often as every five minutes on the company’s website. You can already score some really great Amazon swag at discounted prices , and more deals are expected over the coming weeks. The Echo Dot, for example, is currently just $39, down from $49.\nWhile Amazon is already offering some great deals, the company said the best ones are expected from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday. So, if you’re looking to score a cheap TV, new toys, or even discounts on clothes, Amazon is your one-stop-shop.\nShopping goes mobile For what it’s worth, Amazon said more than 70 percent of Amazon customers shopped using the mobile app last holiday season. So, you know, shopping for stuff on Amazon while you’re at a department store isn’t all that uncommon.\nSome good products are already up for grabs at discounted prices, which you can see below. It’s hard to ignore the Fire tablet at $33.33, even if it is low specced.\nAmazon Black Friday Deals: Starting November 20 , Kindle Paperwhite will be $20 off – just $99.99 Starting November 24 , Amazon Echo will be $40 off – just $139.99 Starting November 24 , Echo Dot will be $10 off – just $39.99 Starting November 24 , Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote will be $10 off – just $29.99 Starting November 24 , Fire HD 8 will be $30 off – only $59.99 Starting November 24 , Fire tablet will only be only $33.33 ",

Share story Mike Rosenberg Seattle Times business reporter \nA global real estate investor has spent nearly $300 million to gobble up several buildings in Microsoft’s Redmond headquarters campus and an Amazon-occupied office in downtown Seattle. \nNew York-based Blackstone Real Estate Partners, which bills itself as the largest real estate private equity firm in the world, bought the buildings from Houston-based Hines, county sales records released Wednesday show. \nThe sale includes two purchases of low-rise complexes in Microsoft’s Redmond campus: $110 million for the Laguna property along 15011 NE 36th Street and 14980 NE 31st Way, and $94 million for the Daytona property on 14999 NE 31st Way. The properties include nine office buildings totaling 712,000 square feet, and also includes an office outpost for Honeywell, an industrial products company. \nHines, which i s selling off all its real estate investments, bought the properties in 2007 and is selling them for nearly double the $112 million combined assessed value.

      "text": " American Cancer Society\nProceeds from each iTunes, Google Play, and Amazon song download will benefit the fight against cancer\nATLANTA , Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Cancer Society has teamed up with solo artist and Black Eyed Peas member, Taboo, for an opportunity that uses the power of music in the fight against cancer. This morning, Taboo released a new track called The Fight on iTunes and other online music stores and performed it on the Emmy® Award-winning syndicated series, The Doctors . The song is an anthem of survivorship that was inspired by Taboo's personal experience facing testicular cancer, which he announced publicly for the first time today on The Doctors. To help create a world free from the pain and suffering caused by cancer, Taboo will donate proceeds from each download to the American Cancer Society. These funds will be used to support cancer research, prevention and early detection efforts, and patient service programs.\nTaboo was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2014. After experiencing debilitating pain throughout his body following a performance, he checked into an emergency room. It was there that he ultimately received a stage 2 cancer diagnosis. Taboo underwent surgery and a rigorous regimen of chemotherapy five days a week for 12 weeks. In 2015 he was declared in remission. Since then he has recommitted to healthy living and fitness, including working out daily, dancing, and playing sports with his kids.\n\"To the millions of survivors and caregivers out there who are either facing this disease or adjusting to life after cancer, I want you to know: I'm in the trenches with you. And the American Cancer Society is too,\" says Taboo. \"I'm so proud to release The Fight because it's truly an anthem of survivorship. I want to use this song and my story to inspire and motivate people all over the world to live their best, healthiest lives possible.\"\n\"And I want the world to know that it's possible to face cancer and emerge stronger on the other side,\" Taboo adds. \"Just look at me.\"\nIn May, 2016 Taboo became a global ambassador for the ACS, using his voice to inspire a movement to live healthy and to raise funds to fight cancer. Once making the decision to partner with the ACS, Taboo embarked on a summer-long journey to better understand the depth and breadth of the organization's work. He toured the National Cancer Information Center in Austin, TX , where Trained Cancer Information Specialists are on-hand to provide free information 24 hours a day seven days a week, and visited patients at the American Cancer Society Hope Lodge Atlanta, a free lodging facility for cancer patients who must travel far from home for treatment. Taboo also performed at several Relay For Life events, the largest community fundraising event on the planet. He credits these experiences with helping him make the decision to go public with his personal cancer journey.\n\"It's always valuable to have a talent like Taboo team up with an organization like ours,\" says Sharon Byers , chief development and marketing officer of the American Cancer Society. \"Taboo is part of our family at the American Cancer Society. He is someone who is selfless and has offered his talents to help us raise dollars to save lives. This partnership is so special, because Taboo has a deeply personal connection to the mission of the American Cancer Society. He understands the value and the urgency of the work that we do. And in addition to helping us raise critical funds, he is also inspiring cancer survivors all across the country and teaching the importance of a healthy lifestyle. We are honored to tell his story and grateful for his dedicated support.\"\nTo download The Fight visit cancer.org/Taboo.\nAbout the American Cancer Society:\nThe American Cancer Society is a global grassroots force of 2 million volunteers saving lives in every community. As the largest voluntary health organization, the Society's efforts have contributed to a 23 percent decline in cancer death rates in the U.S. since 1991, and a 50 percent drop in smoking rates. We're finding cures as the nation's largest private, not-for-profit investor in cancer research, ensuring people facing cancer have the help they need and continuing the fight for access to quality health care, lifesaving screenings and more.

      "text": "0 \nAmazon is making a big push for affordable tablets, having launched an Android-powered Fire tablet for $49.99 . Now Barnes & Noble is placing a focus on that market, too. \nBarnes & Noble today announced the Nook Tablet 7-inch , an Android-based tablet that costs $49.99. The Nook Tablet 7-inch runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow and includes support for the Google Play Store, giving you access to the same apps that other Android devices can get. \nAs you might expect from a device that costs $49.99, the Nook Tablet 7-inch’s specs are fairly entry-level. It’s got a 7-inch 1024x600 display, 5-megapixel rear and 2-megapixel front cameras, and 8GB of built-in storage. There’s also a microSD slot for adding up to 128GB of extra storage, as well as a battery that B&N says will last for up to seven hours of general use. \nOf course, the specs of B&N’s Nook Tablet 7-inch aren’t the draw, the price is. The new Nook tablet looks like an interesting option for anyone in the market for an ultra-affordable tablet, especially since it offers access to the Play Store and all of the Android apps within, whereas owners of Amazon’s $50 Fire tablet use Amazon’s own Appstore. \nThe Nook Tablet 7-inch is now available for pre-order and will launch on November 25.

That includes access to the entire Amazon Music Unlimited catalog that’s tens of millions deep and personalized recommendations. \nIn addition to this family subscription, Amazon Music Unlimited offers single user subscriptions at a price of $7.99 per month or $79 per year for Prime subscribers. Non-Prime users will pay $9.99 per month. \nMost other major music streaming services have family plans, including the likes of Apple Music and Spotify, and so it’s important for Amazon Music Unlimited to have a family plan if it wants to compete. Now it does, and you can even score a discount if you’re a Prime member and you sign up for a full year of service. \nAmazon Music Unlimited does offer a 30-day free trial if you’re interested in taking the service for a spin before paying.

      "text": "\n* Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet boost S&P, Nasdaq \n* Home Depot falls after standing pat on full-year forecast \n* October U.S. retail sales rise more than expected \n* Oil prices jump as much as 5 pct \n* Dow down 0.11 pct, S&P up 0.31 pct, Nasdaq up 0.72 pct (Updates to early afternoon) \nBy Tanya Agrawal and Anya George Tharakan \nNov 15 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were higher in early afternoon trading on Tuesday as tech stocks were back in demand after a post-election drubbing, while the Dow took a breather following a six-day rally. \nThe S&P technology sector, which had fallen about 3 percent since Donald Trump's shock victory, rose 1.19 percent. \nTech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet provided the biggest boost to the S&P and the Dow. \n\"The underlying fundamentals of the economy hasn't really changed and if the economy is strong that will lead to more capital spending which should benefit tech stocks,\" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank in Park City, Utah. \nBoth the S&P and the Dow rallied in the past week since Trump's victory on expectations of higher fiscal spending and lower regulations in the financial and environmental sectors. \nHowever, investors remain uncertain about the details of Trump's policies and are also keeping an eye on key appointments in his administration. \n\"Last week's rally was basically a digestion of Trump's win and now that we're past the digestion phase, the market is taking a bit of a breather and is waiting to see what lies ahead under a Republican government,\" said Watkins. \nAt 12:41 p.m. ET (1741 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 20.82 points, or 0.11 percent, at 18,847.87, the S&P 500 was up 6.67 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,170.87 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 37.71 points, or 0.72 percent, at 5,256.11. \nSeven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index's 2.11 percent rise leading the advancers. \nHigh dividend paying sectors such as utilities and telecommunications also rose following a steep selloff in the past few days. \nThe financial index, which rose more than 10 percent since the election, fell 1 percent as traders cashed in on profits. \nOil prices jumped as much as 5 percent, bouncing back from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production to reduce a supply glut. \nOil majors Exxon and Chevron were up about 1.8 percent, providing the biggest boost to the Dow. \nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists. \nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday only \"significant negative news\" could derail the Fed's high expectations for raising U.S. interest rates next month. \nThe central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. Traders have priced in a 91 percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. \nHome Depot fell 2.7 percent to $124.18 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported strong third-quarter results but stood pat on its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,903 to 1,059. On the Nasdaq, 1,401 issues fell and 1,389 advanced. \nThe S&P 500 index showed 20 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 110 new highs and 19 new lows.

      "text": "Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article \nAmazon Web Services is looking to make software developed by its technology partners more accessible by allowing customers to pay those third-party vendors through AWS' consolidated public cloud bills. \nOn Wednesday, the industry's leading cloud provider launched SaaS Subscriptions, an offering on the AWS Marketplace that handles metering and billing for software that AWS customers purchase from vendors hosting their products on AWS infrastructure. \nAWS introduced several different plans for metering the software spend, all based on consumption instead of subscription costs. \"For example, you can buy security services on a per-host basis, log processing on a per-GB-ingested basis, geocoding on a per-request basis, or caching on a per-GB-cached basis,\" wrote Jeff Barr, chief evangelist for AWS, in a blog post. \"Usage charge for the services that you consume will appear on your AWS bill.\" \n[Related: AWS Doesn't Disappoint In Amazon's Q3 Earnings ] \nMore than 20 application developers offering a range of products – from application development and monitoring, to security, databases, storage, and tax solutions – have signed up to participate in SaaS Subscriptions, Barr said. \nCustomers of those ISVs can manage procuring and paying for software on the AWS Marketplace, consolidating bills to Amazon and its third-party technology partners. \nThe new billing option will prove beneficial for both customers and partners, said Jeff Aden, executive vice president of marketing and strategic development at 2 nd Watch, an AWS partner based in Seattle. \n\"It follows a model that we offer for managed cloud services where customers only pay for what is being managed, versus a percentage of AWS spend,\" Aden told CRN. \"It should lead to lower prices and increased adoption.\" \nJonno Wells, vice president of sales and marketing at Sturdy Networks, an AWS partner based in Irvine, Calif., told CRN that AWS customers will likely find the option attractive since it allows them to pay only for what they use, and to turn tools on or off at any time. \nThose characteristics allows customers, especially small businesses, to try new software without making big upfront commitments, he said. \nWhile SaaS Subscriptions works through a self-service marketplace, there's still a challenge in integrating all the individually priced components. As the offering encourages customers to deploy solutions built from more complex combinations of third-party tools, it will push more customers to the channel, he said. \n\"For those paid to help integrate and manage solutions for customers, it should offer more opportunity to create unique solutions, allow their customers to quickly try new things at lower risk. Enable new service offerings and add-ons, like helping manage cost of the overall components over time,\" Wells said. \nThe initial ISV partners participating in the program include: Alert Logic, Aspera, Avalara, Bitium, Cloudinary, Cloudyn, Datadog, Datapath, Dome9 Security, Druva, HERE, NetApp, New Relic, Pitney Bowes, Qubole, Dynatrace, Signiant, Solano Labs, Solodev, Sumo Logic, and Trend Micro. \nMore ISV partners are on their way, Barr said in his blog. \nFor more coverage of this topic, attend NexGen Cloud Conference & Expo .

      "text": "British supermarket Morrison s has launched a new service offering Amazon customers same-day deliveries of goods from its stores, deepening the relationship between the two firms but hitting shares in online grocer Ocado.\nOcado has its own distribution agreement with Morrison s and its shares fell 5 percent on concerns the extension of the Amazon partnership will mean it faces more competition.\nThe new “ Morrison s at Amazon” service, launched on Wednesday, will allow Amazon Prime customers in and around London to order the full range of Morrison s’ products online via the Prime Now app.\nIt builds on a deal Morrison s struck with Amazon in February that saw it begin wholesale supply to the Internet firm from June. Morrison s said that arrangement had started well and been extended to thousands of products.\nThe new service, which remains part of the wholesale agreement, will see orders from Amazon Prime subscribers picked by shop staff at a local Morrison s store and delivered the same day by Amazon either within one hour for 6.99 pounds or within a two-hour slot for free.\nAs with the existing wholesale deal, Amazon is able to charge its own prices. The new service will launch in selected districts in London and Hertfordshire, north of the capital.\nIt will run alongside the supermarket chain’s existing online retail operation. Products ordered on the Morrison s.com website have been distributed by Ocado from its fulfillment centers around the country since 2014.\nOcado Responds\nOcado said it was looking into the implications of the latest Morrison s-Amazon agreement.\n“Although we are not aware of the details, we have been assured by Morrison s that they acknowledge and respect the exclusivity provisions in our agreement, which oblige Morrison s to operate their online grocery business only through the Ocado arrangements,” said a spokeswoman for Ocado.\nAmazon is promoting its Prime service heavily ahead of the launch on Nov.18 of motoring show “The Grand Tour” presented by former Top Gear front man Jeremy Clarkson.\nShares in Morrison s, up 50 percent this year as a turnaround under new boss David Potts gains pace, were little changed.\nMorrison s is the smallest of Britain’s “big four” supermarkets which have come under pressure from the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nHowever, the online food market is expanding quickly and is expected to grow by 68 percent to 17.9 billion pounds in the five years to 2021, according to industry research group IGD.\nMorrison s said its partnership with Amazon will contribute to a 50-100 million pounds profit boost it has previously targeted.\n“For Morrison s this broadens the offer and gives them more ways to reach customers online where they are still in the early stages of development. For Amazon this is one of a vast number of things they are trialing,” said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who has a “market perform” rating on Morrison s.\nMorrison s renegotiated its deal with Ocado in August to extend home delivery to its customers across the country using its own stores to provide products. Morrison s has said it will commence that service next year. ($1 = 0.8010 pounds)",

      "text": "Twitter's live video app comes to Android TV Android joins Apple TV, Amazon's Fire TV and the Xbox One. Share Save \nTwitter TV events have included Thursday NFL games and the presidential election, but until now they've only been available on TV through Apple TV, Fire TV and Xbox One . Now, Android TV is joining that list, and from the appearance, the app is the same as on every other platform. There's a listing for whatever featured broadcast is going on at the top, plus popular tweets and videos from the service, and some live Periscope streams. Twitter is pushing this ahead of tomorrow's Saints/Panthers game, but it should probably add some updated screenshots to the Google Play Store first -- currently they only show the phone version of the app. Twitter for Android TV is available in the @GooglePlay store! Watch #TNF streaming LIVE on Twitter tomorrow night. https://t.co/5Dsxcuh4fU pic.twitter.com/Z6TewE5dkp ",

      "text": "Cyclical Consumer Goods | Wed Nov 16, 2016 | 2:28am EST Britain's Morrisons launches store pick grocery service with Amazon \nLONDON Nov 16 British supermarket Morrisons has further developed its wholesale relationship with Amazon, launching a store pick service for the online retailer's customers, it said on Wednesday. \nIn February Morrisons sealed a deal with Amazon that saw it begin wholesale supply to the Internet firm in June. It said that service had started well and been extended to thousands of Morrisons' products. \nThe British supermarket operator said the new \"Morrisons at Amazon\" service will allow Amazon Prime customers in selected areas to order from Morrisons on Amazon's app. \nOrders will be picked at a local Morrisons store and delivered the same day by Amazon either within one hour for 6.99 pounds ($8.72) or within a two-hour slot for free. \nThe service will launch in selected postcodes in London and Hertfordshire, north of the capital. ($1 = 0.8012 pounds) (Reporting by James Davey; Editing by Susan Fenton) Next In Cyclical Consumer Goods UPDATE 1-Trump cyber security team, policy slow to take shape - officials \nWASHINGTON, Nov 16 President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has not announced a point person dedicated to cyber security policy or staffing in his administration, an omission that could make the United States more vulnerable to threats and worsen a government cyber talent shortfall, current and former national security officials said. REUTERS SUMMIT-Icahn lauds 'consensus builder' Trump, says rally may be overdone \nNEW YORK, Nov 16 Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said the strong rally in U.S. stocks since Donald Trump captured the White House last week might be overdone, but that investors can expect the president-elect to be a consensus builder who can help fix Washington and improve the economy. \nCHICAGO, Nov 16 Target Corp on Wednesday reported a much higher-than-expected quarterly profit after benefiting from a strong back-to-school shopping season and increased online sales, and it gave an optimistic outlook for the all-important holiday period.
