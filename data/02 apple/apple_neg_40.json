The Sharp-produced handsets come in, of course, both a Dark and Light Side Edition that allow consumers to choose a deep maroon red or a clear white version. Both come packed with a Snapdragon 820 processor with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, microSD slot, a 3,000mAh battery pack, 22.6MP camera and TV Tuner as standard. Alongside the hardware, the Android-platform OS is fully redone in Star Wars wares, from wallpapers and skins to specific apps and even it’s own set of emoji. More so, the phones come packaged in a special deluxe box to commemorate the opening of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story . \nLook for these to hit the Japan market on December 2nd.

      "text": "– A + Feature Apple Cyber Monday Roundup: Find the best deals & lowest prices on iPhone, MacBook, iPad, iMac and Apple Watch By Christine McKee \nSunday, November 27, 2016, 11:06 pm PT (02:06 am ET) \nBlack Friday may have come and gone, but the deals are still going strong this Cyber Monday. From instant cash discounts to exclusive coupon savings, shoppers can save hundreds of dollars on new Apple hardware. Plus, many retailers do not collect sales tax in most states with free shipping to boot.\n\n\n\n\nCyber Monday 2016 is here and AppleInsider is searching high and low for the best deals on Apple MacBooks, iPads, iPhones, cameras, software and more. Be sure to check back as this page will be updated as more deals become available. \n\nAll of the following top offers have been carefully curated from our live Apple Price Guides . This roundup also assumes you live outside NY State. If you live inside NY State, tax incentives are nonexistent so you should compare prices directly in our Price Guide. \n\nA Note About Tax \n\nAnother benefit of purchasing from a value-added reseller is that some only collect sales tax on orders shipped to a handful of states. Keep the following in mind when comparing prices:\n\nB&H Photo only collects sales tax on orders shipped to NY.\nAdorama only collects sales tax on orders shipped to NY & NJ.\nAmazon collects sales tax on orders shipped to AL, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, FL, GA, IL, IN, KS, KY, MD, MA, MI, MN, NV, NJ, NY, NC, ND, OH, PA, SC, TN, TX, VA, WA, WV and WI.\nMacMall collects sales tax on all orders.\nBest Buy , Apple , Staples , Walmart and other big box retailers collect sales tax on all orders . \n\nJump to the Mac deals of your choice: \nMacBooks \niMacs \niPads \niPhones \nMac minis \nMac Pros \nApple

Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings. \nNot So Fast: The Path to Faster Growth Won't Be Easy \nOriginally published Nov. 21 at 7:40 a.m. EDT \" Dougie, there is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.\" --Grandma Koufax \nA surprising amount of spontaneous optimism has spread over the markets following the Trump election victory. \nSpecifically, interest rates have climbed swiftly and economic and profit forecasts have been lifted based on the expectation of successful pro-growth policies to be implemented by the Trump administration. \nHowever, one of the most pressing headwinds as described in Friday's opening missive will be those higher interest rates. It is a headwind that will be compounded by the size of the federal government's debt, which will be close to $20 trillion in January 2017. And that does not include another $3.5 trillion of local and state debt. \nThe Debt and Deficits Are Now Out of Control \n\"Deficits don't matter.\" --Vice President Dick Cheney \nBack in the Reagan administration, tax cuts increased the deficit, but when combined with the Clinton/Gingrich budget controls, debt was falling and economic growth accelerated. Debt as a percentage of GDP fell. But the abandonment of budgetary controls (tax cuts rose at the same time spending programs grew) in the Bush administration put us back into deficits The Great Recession led to an explosion in the deficit, growing by nearly $10 trillion in eight years.

      "text": "Chance Chan | Reuters YunOS, the mobile operating system developed by Alibaba Group, is on track to corner a 14 per cent share of smartphone shipments in mainland China by the end of this year, pulling ahead of Apple's iOS to become the second-largest operating system for that device in the market, according to analysts. \nThe forecasts would confirm Alibaba 's claim earlier this year that YunOS had initially passed iOS on the mainland in the three months ended March 31. \nDespite the strong strides made by the Alibaba platform, Bernstein senior analyst Mark Li told the South China Morning Post that growth prospects for YunOS outside of its home market would likely be limited to \"cheap or subsidized smartphones\". \nAccording to research firm Strategy Analytics, Alibaba-backed Meizu, XiaoLaJiao and Doov are the top YunOS smartphone suppliers. \nIt estimated the total shipments of YunOS-powered smartphones this year will top 100 million units, echoing the earlier projection made by e-commerce giant Alibaba.\nshow chapters Is China's fintech boom sustainable?      Tuesday, 15 Nov 2016 | 12:16 AM ET | 01:53 New York-listed Alibaba, which owns the Post , has also adapted YunOS to work as an operating system for television set-top boxes, smart home appliances, tablets, internet-connected smart TVs, smart cars and even SoftBank Group 's humanoid robot called \"Pepper\". \nAt Alibaba's cloud computing conference last month in Hangzhou, YunOS product director Aiden Yong said: \"We want YunOS to be the 'go-to' operating system for China's smart industry.\" \nTsinghua Unigroup semiconductor affiliates Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronic last month jointly launched with Alibaba's YunOS business unit a new chip platform for hardware manufacturers to create innovative products for the so-called Internet of Things market of smart, connected devices. \nIn a report on Friday, Bernstein pointed out that the key motivation for hardware manufacturers to adopt YunOS are the subsidies from Alibaba. \nSet-top box makers on the mainland, for example, reportedly receive from 20 to 60 yuan per box as a subsidy to encourage the adoption of YunOS. \n\nMore from the South China Morning Post : \n\nHow Modi's currency ban is helping Chinese fintech investors in India \nAlibaba Health to expand its pharma e-commerce business \nSCMP appoints technology leader Liu to spearhead 113-year-old publication's digital evolution \nLi said that figure may sound insignificant, but it is meaningful when put in the context of \"the razor-thin margins of these hardware vendors\", especially the smaller manufacturers. \nThe low price afforded by YunOS smartphones has made these devices gain most of their users across the mainland's lower tier cities. \nData from Sino Market Research and Bernstein showed that 54 per cent of YunOS adoption last year was found in tier-4 or smaller cities in the country, compared with 9 per cent in the tier-1 cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.\nshow chapters Singles day total: 120.7 billion yuan      Friday, 11 Nov 2016 | 11:06 AM ET | 01:33 The smartphones and other devices that run YunOS serve as the conduit through which Alibaba reaches users, as well as learn more about their preferences and behaviour, according to Li. \nHe said that deeper understanding enables Alibaba to better provide the various online services, content and advertising under its vast ecosystem. \nYunOS, an operating system built from the free Linux software, made its debut on July 2011 with the Tianyu K-Touch W700 smartphone, but struggled to find strong handset partners due to the popularity of Android devices. That prompted Alibaba to acquire a US$590 million minority stake in Meizu last year to help ramp up YunOS adoption. \n\"For China, YunOS addresses the concern that the majority of smartphones in the nation run on an operating system that is ultimately led by a foreign company, Google,\" Li said. \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

Loading video... Top 5 Apple MacBook Pro alternatives: CNET Top 5 About Video CNET Top 5: Top 5 Apple MacBook Pro alternatives 2:08 / November 28, 2016 \nIf Apple's latest laptops seem to be lacking in power, here are five machines that won't let you down. Share (0) linkedin Transcript These are the top five MacBook Pro alternatives. When Apple unveiled its newest laptops, the Pro part was seemingly de-emphasized. Let's see what else is out there. At #5, the Lenovo ThinkPad T 460. 32 gigabytes of RAM, that's something no new MacBook Pro can do. This 14 inch Thinkpad had that option, and it comes with a touch screen, plus a fingerprint sensor. Lenovo claims up to 18 hours of battery life, which is pretty dang sizeable. And number four, the Razer Blade Pro. Razer's last Laptops are positions to be gaming laptops, so you know they pack a punch. The Razer Blade Pro is a 17 inch beast, with a 4K touch screen, and up to 2 terabytes of storage. This laptop is also pretty thin, under an inch thick All of that is going to cost you. The Razor Blade Pro starts at around $3700. And number three, the Microsoft Surfacebook. Microsoft upped the ante with its newest Surfacebook with an Intel i7 processor, and a new GPU that is twice as fast as the previous version of the Surfacebook. Unlike the Mac Book Pro, the Surface Book has plenty of ports and it can operate as a tablet. At number two the Alienware 13 R3. This is a 13 inch laptop that is powerful enough to handle VR for the [UNKNOWN] and the HTC Vibe. You can also get the Alienware 13 with an OLED touch screen but that puts the starting price at around $2,100. One of the downsides to this laptop is it has just two regular USB ports, but that's two more than on the MacBook Pro. It also weighs a hefty five pounds, but you want power, right? And at #1 is a Dell XPS XPS 4K Touch. We're spotlighting the XPS 15 version here. It starts at 999, but that model gets you no touchscreen and that resolution is only HD. Adding in a 4K touchscreen, an Intel i7 processor And an [UNKNOWN] 960 graphics card brings the price up to around $2100. The 15 inch version of the Mac Book Pro starts at $2,250 so the XPS could be a better deal. There's a good chance that you aren't watching this part but if you are I want you to know that you're my favorite. I always liked you. I'm Iyaz [UNKNOWN] and I'll see you online. [MUSIC]",

      "text": "Apple can't launch high-end MacBook Pros without issues Apple's new $4099 laptop has major issues, oh wait - nearly all models are experiencing issues \nApple had quite the unveiling a few weeks ago with its refreshed MacBook Pro family, featuring a high-end $4000+ model that featured AMD's new Polaris-based Radeon Pro 460 graphics. \nThen less than 24 hours ago we reported on the issue, with waves of people complaining about their new MacBook Pros experiencing video-related issues. There were issues with the new 15-inch MBP that sports AMD's new Radeon Pro 400 series graphics , with people taking to the MacRumor forums to complain about their problems. But there are a lot of people with 13-inch MacBook Pros that are experiencing issues, and there is no AMD hardware inside of those models - that's all an all-Intel MacBook Pro, with the same issues the model with the Radeon Pro 400 series graphics has. \nThe issue here is that Apple, a company that prides itself on being courageous for removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and is meant to be the top of the pyramid when it comes to their quality products. So much so, that Apple even has a $300 book on its amazing designs, yet its new $4000+ laptop was shipped with major issues resulting in thousands of people complaining about issues on their new laptops.

      "text": "7 News WHDH \nNEW YORK (AP) — Thanksgiving weekend shoppers picked up hot toys, TVs and new Apple products, buying both online and in stores, but spent less per person because of rampant discounting that they’ve come to demand. \nOnce all the receipts are in, customers look to have spent an average of $289.19 over the four-day weekend, down nearly 3.5 percent from a year ago, based on a survey by the National Retail Federation. The pressure on prices was especially strong on products like TVs. \nMore than 154 million customers said they had shopped or planned to this Thanksgiving weekend, up from 151 million a year ago, according to the survey conducted Friday and Saturday by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics. And more were doing it online, as about 99.1 million went to the stores and 108.5 million shopped online. \nCarmen Cunnyngham of Kansas City, Kansas, was in Denver on Sunday and decided to stop at the mall to pick up a new pair of Ugg boots for her daughter. They were discounted at Nordstrom, which is one of her favorite places to shop. She said she got a bit of a late start this year because of the presidential election, so she’s been looking online for deals and jumping when she sees them. \n“I’m trying to make sure I get the wish lists in and look at those and shop and do what I can before Christmas gets here,” she said. \nThe drop in spending underscores how even with an improving economy, many shoppers are still focused on habit developed during the Great Recession. They’re fixated on deals and more readily using technology to find them whenever they want to buy. More than a third of customers surveyed by the NRF said that all of their purchases were on sale, up 11 percent from a year ago. \nThe Thanksgiving weekend kicks off the holiday shopping season but stores have increasingly started their sales earlier. Stores had been wary about being left with a lot of inventory they would have to discount to get off the shelves, and so started the season with less on hand. That will help preserve profit margins, but they’ve still planned aggressive promotions to grab shoppers. \n“People are much more deliberate about the purchases they make,” NRF CEO Matthew Shay said Sunday. “In a perfect world, everyone would sell at full price, but as consumers and as buyers all of us would like to get a deal on things we buy. The era of promotional sales is with us to stay.” \nEven though shoppers are spending less per person, more shoppers could still translate into more spending. MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks spending on all kinds of payments, estimated that spending over the four-day weekend will be up 3.8 percent, with online sales up by double-digit percentages and in-store sales up in the single digits. But MasterCard Advisors’ Sarah Quinlan also cited a slight decline in the average sale because of promotions. \nStores trying to snag customers first and compete with Amazon are shifting to a steady stream of online discounts and alerts instead of focusing on doorbuster sales on a few products. That meant that online shopping stole thunder away from sales at stores. And while areas like electronics and toys remained strong for the weekend, clothing, particularly basic sweaters, were still a tough sell. \nShoppers are visiting fewer stores and the rate at which browsers converted into buyers was slightly lower than last year, said William Taubman, chief operating officer at Taubman Centers, which operates 24 malls around the country. Still, after a contentious presidential election, he believes people are ready to buy. \n“Resolution is a good thing,” he said. “That makes people feel somewhat more comfortable.” And for wealthier customers, he said, the prospects of tax cuts will help. \nJanice Allsop, 66, a retired secretary who worked in the trucking industry, said she’ll likely spend more this year because of the election. \n“The stock markets have gone up. I’m just delighted with President Trump,” said Allsop, who was shopping at Water Tower Place mall in Chicago on Saturday. “I’m not afraid (to spend more). If Hillary Clinton would have gotten in, I would have been very scared, very reluctant.” \nBut shoppers may still be split. Joyce Hill, a 67-year-old retired auto worker from Inkster, Michigan, who was also shopping in Chicago. Hill said she will stay on the low end of her usual spending this year because she’s worried that Trump will start to cut back on Social Security. \n“I’ll spend less because you don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t think he’ll (Trump) support us but I don’t know if he’s gonna let things stay status quo,” said Hill. \nEven though the weekend bring many out shopping, Black Friday usually vies with the Saturday before Christmas as the busiest sales day. But this year, that falls on Christmas Eve, so Saturday, Dec. 17 is the big contender, says Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. The retail trade group’s survey found that fewer shoppers had finished their holiday buying and more hadn’t even started compared to a year ago. \n“We’ve seen in recent years that most places will have good sales after Black Friday comes and goes, so we don’t have to do everything this weekend,” said William Junkin, who was at the Best Buy store in Howell Township, New Jersey, on Thursday night. “We’ll see how it all plays out.” \n(Copyright (c) 2016 The Associated Press.

First you’ll need to create an album of images you want to display: \nUsing Photos: Select an image or several images using command+click then hit the plus “+” button at the top of the screen and choose Album . Select New Album and give it a name, then hit OK . Add more photos using the same method, but choose the album you created rather than “New Album” in step two. \nUse View > Show Sidebar to view all of your album on the left-side of the screen, which allows you to click and drag photos straight into albums for quickness. \nUsing iPhoto: Select an image or several images using command+click then hit the Add To button at the bottom of the screen and choose Album. Click New Album and give it a name, it will appear in the sidebar on the left-hand side of the page. Add more photos using the Add To button, selecting the album you just created. You can also click and drag photos directly into the album in the sidebar. \nView the Slideshow: \nOnce you’ve created an album of images, it’s time to enable AirPlay mirroring and output your Mac’s display to your Apple TV. Find the AirPlay icon at the top of the screen in your menu bar (see the image below). Select AirPlay to: Apple TV or whatever you’ve named your receiver. \nFinally, play the slideshow. In Photos simply select the album you just made and click on the “play” button at the top of the screen. In iPhoto select the album you made and click on Slideshow at the bottom-center of the screen. Both apps will allow you to choose a theme and background music before starting the slideshow. \nWhat you see and hear on your Mac display will be mirrored to your Apple TV. Use Albums & Home Sharing \nIt’s also possible to use an iTunes feature called Home Sharing to share all sorts of content with your Apple TV, wirelessly. It’ll work provided you’re using the same Wi-Fi network as the Apple TV, and you’ve authorized both devices using the same Apple ID. First you’ll need to create an album as described under AirPlay Mirroring above. \nLaunch iTunes and enable Home Sharing under File > Home Sharing > Turn On Home Sharing . If it’s off you’ll need to enter your Apple ID password. Once enabled you can specify which photos to share with your Apple TV by heading to File > Home Sharing > Choose Photos to Share With Apple TV . \nIn the window that appears, check the box to enable sharing and choose between the Photos library or the older iPhoto library. You can also choose to share only specific albums, or share everything, and include videos too. Hit Done then Apply to action your settings. \nTo see your albums on your Apple TV, enable Home Sharing under Settings > Account > Home Sharing and sign in with your Apple ID. \nView the Slideshow: \nYou can now view all of your Photos or iPhoto albums on your Apple TV by choosing Computers from the main menu. You’ll see a list of shared libraries appear, so choose Photos . You can now pick the album you made earlier (or any album you want to make in future) and use the Play Slideshow option at the top of the screen to view your images. You can also choose options like shuffle, repeat, the time per slide, and which theme you want to use. Problem Seeing Your Shared Photo Library? \nWhile testing this feature out for the article, I noticed that the Photos library sometimes disappears and doesn’t seem to show up again. A variety of the following have helped me solve this issue: Launch iTunes , head to File > Home Sharing > Choose Photos to Share With Apple TV and make a change (e.g. disable Include Videos ) and hit Done then Apply . If it worked you can change the option back straight away without any issues. Try signing in and out on your affected devices. I found that re-authorizing Home Sharing on my Apple TV after enabling two-factor authentication on my Apple ID helped clear up some issues. Restart the Apple TV via Settings > System > Restart . Export A Slideshow to Your Apple TV \nIt’s also possible to export an actual video slideshow to your Apple TV, generated by Photos or iPhoto. This seems like an unnecessary step for displaying photos on an Apple TV, and it’s more suited to uploading your video elsewhere (Facebook or YouTube, for example). But if you want a slideshow you can just set and forget, it might work for you. \nIn order to make the most of the feature you’ll need to set up Home Sharing as described under Use Albums & Home Sharing above. Once you’ve done that, you can make a slideshow from a specific album or group of photos: \nUsing Photos : Select the album from which you want to make a slideshow, or simply select a group of photos using command+click . Click the plus “+” button at the top of the screen and select Slideshow . Select New Slideshow in the drop down box, give it a name and hit OK . Continue to add photos to the slideshow using the same method (replacing “New Slideshow” with the one you created) or by clicking and dragging photos using the sidebar. When you’re done, select your slideshow from the sidebar ( View > Show Slidebar if it’s not visible) and click Export at the top of the screen. Give the file a name, select a location, and choose from 480p, 720p, or full HD 1080p output quality; and ensure that Automatically Send to iTunes is enabled . \nUsing iPhoto: Select the album you want to create a slideshow from, or select a group of photos using command+click . Use the Add To box at the bottom of the screen and select Slideshow . Choose New Slideshow and give it name. Add more images using the same method by selecting the slideshow you just created, or click and drag to the sidebar. When you’re done click on your slideshow and choose Export at the bottom of the screen. Choose from 480, 720p, or full HD 1080p video quality and make sure that Automatically Send to iTunes is enabled . Hit Export and choose an output location for the resulting file. \nView the Slideshow: \nLaunch iTunes on your Mac and make sure that Include Videos is enabled under File > Home Sharing > Choose Photos to Share With Apple TV . Now on your Apple TV choose Computers from the main menu, select your Mac’s library, and you’ll find your slideshow video under Home Videos . macOS Photos & iOS Devices \niPhoto is old and no longer supported, so the new Photos app is better suited for the job A Cleaner, Faster iPhoto: Upgrade to Photos for OS X Yosemite A Cleaner, Faster iPhoto: Upgrade to Photos for OS X Yosemite Photos for OS X has finally arrived, replacing iPhoto with an image management application that Mac users will actually want to use — but is there enough here to satisfy Aperture refugees?

Ideally you should only use iPhoto if you’re on an older version of OS X and you absolutely have to. \nYou can also use your iPhone or iPad to display slideshows via AirPlay. Launch Photos on iOS and swipe up to reveal Control Center , swipe left to show the media controls and choose your Apple TV from the AirPlay option at the bottom. Now any photos you view will be displayed on the Apple TV, including slideshows you initiate. You can even stream your own background music via Apple Music or Spotify. \nWhich method best suits you for sharing images using your Apple TV?

      "text": "In a telephone talk, Donald Trump, the president of the United States requested Apple CEO Tim Cook to officially bring back the production of Apple products to the United States. \nIn all Western countries, including the United States, in recent decades, millions of jobs were lost as companies have moved their production to low-wage countries such as China . This led the United States to massive unemployment in certain regions. One of the priorities in the election campaign of Donald Trump was also recovering jobs to the United States, something Trump now directly wants to work on as he has been elected the new president of the United States.\nReports hint Trump has already had telephone contact with Tim Cook. Trump officially requested Cook to build manufacturing facilities in the United States and produce Apple products again in the United States instead of China.\nLESS REGULATIONS As production in the US is considerably more expensive than in China, Trump is planning to reduce the tax burden for firms that are still producing in the United States. Trump also has plans to reduce regulations for those companies that now chase to low-wage countries.\nEarlier this month, it appeared this spring that Apple investigated the possibilities to recover the production of its goods to the United States. Despite the tax advantages that Trump wants to give, it seems that the relocation of the production of Apple products will still be considerably more expensive if they are going to be produced entirely in the United States.\nDonald Trump asks Apple to officially move its production to the US was originally published in The TechNews on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "text": "Apple leads the premium smartphone segment with 66 percent share Samsung has 23 percent of the segment's share Pixel smartphones were launched in India last month \nLast month, Google launched its first fully self-branded Pixel smartphones worldwide as well as in India. The unique and the distinguishing factor about these smartphones from the earlier Nexus series is that these smartphones are premium in terms of features as well as the price tag. Pixel phones have been pitched by the search giant as direct competitors to Apple's iPhone and if latest report by research firm Counterpoint is anything to go by, Google might have a strong case in its favour. \nAs per the latest report by Counterpoint Research, Google's Pixel smartphones have already captured 10 percent share of the Premium Smartphone segment in the month of October in India, since their launch the same month . However, the report says that Apple still maintains a clear lead in this segment, with around 66 percent of the overall market share, followed by Samsung with around 23 percent share. \"Google is aggressively trying to take advantage of the lack of competition in this segment and does not want to miss-out on the opportunities. The company is leaving no stones unturned with heavy spend on marketing, there are exchange and cashback offers also available for the new entrant. A refreshing and feature packed Pixel is making for a good proposition against the incumbents Apple's new iPhone and Samsung's [Galaxy] S7 smartphones,\" Counterpoint Research said in an emailed statement.\nConsidering the advertisement spend by the company for its smartphones, Pixel will be able to maintain its market share if not extend it in future, the research firm said. \nIt is hard to judge whether the Pixel smartphones would have performed similarly if Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 debacle would not have taken place. However, it is safe to say that Google's smartphones definitely got a performance boost due to the premium Android smartphone's failure.",

      "title": "Donald Trump asks Apple to officially move its production to the US",
      "text": "16 mins ago Donald Trump asks Apple to officially move its production to the US In a telephone talk, Donald Trump, the president of the United States requested Apple CEO Tim Cook to officially bring back the production of Apple products to the United States. In all Western countries, including the United States, in recent decades, millions of jobs were lost as companies have moved their production to low-wage countries such as China . This led the United States to massive unemployment in certain regions. One of the priorities in the election campaign of Donald Trump was also recovering jobs to the United States, something Trump now directly wants to work on as he has been elected the new president of the United States. Reports hint Trump has already had telephone contact with Tim Cook. Trump officially requested Cook to build manufacturing facilities in the United States and produce Apple products again in the United States instead of China. LESS REGULATIONS As production in the US is considerably more expensive than in China, Trump is planning to reduce the tax burden for firms that are still producing in the United States. Trump also has plans to reduce regulations for those companies that now chase to low-wage countries. Earlier this month, it appeared this spring that Apple investigated the possibilities to recover the production of its goods to the United States. Despite the tax advantages that Trump wants to give, it seems that the relocation of the production of Apple products will still be considerably more expensive if they are going to be produced entirely in the United States.",

      "text": "Technology News | Mon Nov 28, 2016 | 7:09am EST Israel's Cellcom launches app for Apple TV service \nTEL AVIV Cellcom, Israel's biggest mobile phone operator, said on Monday it will offer Apple TV as it launched its new Cellcom TV app. \nCellcom said it will be the first in Israel to offer its multi-channel television, including broadcast channels and video on demand content, on Apple TV's streaming service at no extra charge. \nCellcom is a newcomer to the Israeli television market. Seeking new streams of revenue, it launched a low price, Internet-based service last year that competes with cable company HOT and satellite TV firm YES, a subsidiary of Bezeq. \nCellcom has now surpassed 100,000 subscribers, still well below YES and HOT. But Cellcom added 12,000 subscribers in the last quarter while the other two services lost clients. \n\"We had a mission to change the TV market,\" Cellcom Chief Executive Nir Sztern told a news conference. \"This move enables clients to disconnect from the set-top box. We need to bring broadcast over IP (Internet protocol).\" \nIn the United States, Time Warner offers some customers the option to swap their cable box for a Roku streaming player. \n(Reporting by Tova Cohen) Next In Technology News Meitu's Hong Kong IPO to value China photo app maker at up to $4.5 billion: IFR \nHONG KONG Chinese photo app and mobile phone maker Meitu Inc is set to launch an up to $735 million IPO in Hong Kong that would value it at as much as $4.5 billion, IFR reported, making it among the 10 largest tech companies listed in the city.",

      "text": "Reddit \nWith the asian market a large and growing one for Apple, the company appears to be focusing on expanding its R&D efforts in the region. Following the announcement of multiple development centers in India and China, Indonesian site Tempo reports that Apple is to setup an R&D center in Jakarta sometime next year … Giant tech company Apple Inc will set up R&D centers in early 2017. Communication and Information Minister Rudiantara said that the preparation of the project development has progressed to the final stage. \nRudiantara said that Apple would confirm the location next month, with construction and recruitment in 2017. The Indonesian government said that Apple had revealed to it the value of the investment, but it could not reveal the figure. \nWhile Apple focuses most of its R&D work in Cupertino, it does have a number of satellite offices around the country. These are established for a variety of reasons, sometimes practical – such as tapping into local expertise – and other times political, helping to ensure good relations with countries that need to approve the import or sale of Apple products. \nMakeMac has suggested that the establishment of the center was a quid pro quo for a licence allowing the company to sell LTE products in Indonesia. Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous country after China, India and the USA, with a total population of more than 260M people. \nPhoto of Jakarta: Teledirect",

The sheer power of Apple’s brand has always been one of the strengths of AAPL stock. \nOn Saturday, Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) released its 2016 online shopping data for Black Friday and Thanksgiving Day. More than $5.0 billion was spent online by the end of Black Friday, a 17.7% increase year-over-year. Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to drive over $1.0 billion in mobile revenue at $1.2 billion, a 33.0% growth year-over-year. (Source: “ Media Alert: Adobe Data Shows Black Friday Breaks Online Sales Record With $3.34 Billion ,” Adobe Systems Incorporated, November 26, 2016.) \nBut the important data mentioned in the report was that the “five top selling electronic products on Black Friday were Apple iPads, Samsung 4k TVs, Apple MacBook Air, LG TVs and Microsoft Xbox.” This is a good indicator that even old Apple models do not lose their charm among consumers. (Source: Ibid.) \nAAPL stock has already recovered from its lows hit post-Trump victory on November 8, and closed at $111.79 in the last trading session. Apple Cyber Monday Deals \nAfter the weekend shopping extravaganza, now comes Cyber Monday. According to the forecasts by the National Retail Federation, some 122 million Americans are expected to look for bargains on their mobile devices, up by one million from a year ago. Generally, consumers reserve a portion of their budgets exclusively for Cyber Monday as attractive digital deals are offered, said the CEO of the federation, Matthew Shay. (Source: “ Cyber Monday becomes next big target for shoppers ,” USA Today , November 28, 2016.) \nRetailers offer promotions exclusively online on Cyber Monday. The best Apple Cyber Monday Deals from Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) have been posted on the retailers’ websites. Attractive discounts are available on select “iPad,”“iPhone,”“MacBook” and “Apple Watch” products. Best Buy has offered savings of up to $400.00 on the original Apple Watch, which looks like a great Apple Cyber Monday deal. \nConsumers appear to be excited by the old models at great prices and this boosts expectations for high Apple sales. Although the current sentiment is not very upbeat about Apple stock, good numbers from the holiday shopping season are likely to turn things around for AAPL stock. Apple Inc. Dominates Smartphone Market \nThere was another positive report that came in last week, which stated that Apple took a record majority of world-wide smartphone profit share in the third quarter. According to the research by Strategy Analytics , third-quarter smartphone operating profits reached $9.0 billion globally, of which Apple took 91% of the share. This amounts to $8.19 billion for the U.S. technology giant. (Source: “ Apple captures record 91 percent of global smartphone profits: Research ,” CNBC , November 23, 2016.) \nThis is because Apple Inc. enjoys the highest profit margins in the smartphone industry as the company has the ability to price its iPhones at a premium. Consumers know that bargain deals on Apple devices come rarely, and that is why Apple Cyber Monday deals hold so much importance. \nEven the data from Alibaba’s Singles Day event proved how popular the Apple brand is and how it provides a strong support for Apple stock. \nConsumers are looking forward to Apple Cyber Monday deals and investors are focused on Apple sales in the holiday season. Although Apple stock has returned over eight percent in the year-to-date as compared to over 10% gains recorded by the S&P 500, the demand for the latest Apple models is likely to provide support to AAPL stock.",

Apple's manufacturing partners still haven't even come close to building enough iPhone 7 Plus supply to meet demand, and the smaller iPhone 7 is thought to be selling quite quickly as well. Strong iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales are even more impressive when you consider the fact that Apple reused the same hardware design for a third consecutive year in 2016 — people still want to upgrade to these powerful new iPhones even though they look almost identical to iPhones released all the way back in 2014.\nNow, imagine what demand will be like if Apple releases a completely redesigned iPhone 8 with a new curved OLED display.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nBest Buy Cyber Monday 2016 deals: Huge savings on TVs, computers and more Walmart’s Cyber Monday sale kicks off right now – here are Sunday’s best deals Two of eBay’s most popular Black Friday 2016 deals are still available today ",

      "title": "21 best iPhone 7 Plus cases to protect your Apple phone",
      "text": "Learn More \nNo one likes a bruised apple, and if you drop your new iPhone 7 Plus it could end up scraped, scarred, or worse. The smart play is to invest in some protection. There are lots of different cases out there; some safeguard against drops, some are all about the style, and some add extra functionality. We’ve been checking out your options and these are some of the best iPhone 7 Plus cases you can buy right now. Snakehive Vintage Leather Wallet ($24) \nMade from European cowhide nubuck leather, the Snakehive Leather Wallet is one you’ll just want to hold in your hand, it feels so good. It’s all thanks to a wonderfully soft texture on the outside, which has been smoothed out for extra protection on the inside. The iPhone is held in a slim, clear plastic case, with wide cutouts for the volume and power buttons, along with the speakers and charging port too. Opposite are three card slots and a pocket for cash, plus a magnetic clasp that keeps the case closed. The folio case can fold out into a stand for your iPhone 7 Plus, for watching video. Don’t miss this super stylish, real leather folio available in the burgundy seen here, or in chestnut brown and navy colors, at an excellent price. Buy one now from: Sena Lugano Wallet ($54+) \nSena’s Lugano Wallet case covers all the key bases for your iPhone. It protects the body with hard wearing leather and reinforced plastic, along with softer silicone surrounds for the buttons and speakers, plus there’s a herringbone design lining to keep the phone free from scratches when it’s inside the case. The edge is raised to keep the screen away from the surface if placed face down, and the case provides rugged shock absorption. There are also three credit card slots built into the case. Available in cognac, black, and denim colors for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for $60. Buy one now from: Sena Wallet Book ($80) \nThis case gives you all the protection offered by Sena’s Lugano Wallet case, but with a folio design that doubles as a hands-free stand for your phone. The folio cover keeps the screen safe from harm and contains space for two credit cards, cash, and an identification card. The herringbone design lining and Heritage leather ensures your iPhone is protected from all angles and sides. It’s also pleasingly easy to fit and remove the phone, however, the case does add considerable size and bulk. It comes in cognac, black, denim, and praline colors for $80. Buy one now from: VRS Design Duo Guard ($30) \nIt’s called Duo Guard because the case is made from both polycarbonate and TPU plastic, providing MIL-810G standard protection against drops. It looks classier than the usual military-standard protective case, due to a brushed metal effect rear cover, and a metal kickstand built into the case itself. It’s spring-loaded and held closed by a magnetic catch. We like the raised edge to protect the screen, and the grippy sides, which make this a comfortable and secure case to hold. It comes in a range of colors, including the cool silver seen here, for $30. Buy one now from: Pad & Quill Bella Fino Case ($80) \nMade from a single piece of leather and embossed with the Pad & Quill name and logo, this is a folio case for the iPhone 7 Plus, that instead of clipping your phone into a built-in case, has a sticky pad to keep it in place. The pad is made by 3M, and leaves no residue if you decide to remove it in the future. The folio case has four credit card holders, an ID window, and space for some cash. The leather feels superb, and the stitching adds character, while the whole case stays relatively slim and lightweight. It’s quite stiff to start with, and needs a few days in a pocket before it softens up and closes properly. There are three colors available and the case costs $80. Buy one now from: VRS Design Crystal Mixx ($25) \nTransparent cases are going to be huge this year, thanks to the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus and the need for people to show off the flashy new finish. VRS Design’s Crystal Mixx case is made from see-through polycarbonate and has a raised lip to keep the screen away from any surface contact, plus a kickstand on the rear to prop the phone up for watching video. The flexible sides make fitting the case really easy too. We prefer the clear version, but there is a rose gold colored version too. Buy one now from:",

      "text": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Cellcom, Israel's biggest mobile phone operator, said on Monday it will offer Apple TV as it launched its new Cellcom TV app.\nCellcom said it will be the first in Israel to offer its multi-channel television, including broadcast channels and video on demand content, on Apple TV's streaming service at no extra charge.\nCellcom is a newcomer to the Israeli television market. Seeking new streams of revenue, it launched a low price, Internet-based service last year that competes with cable company HOT and satellite TV firm YES, a subsidiary of Bezeq.\nCellcom has now surpassed 100,000 subscribers, still well below YES and HOT. But Cellcom added 12,000 subscribers in the last quarter while the other two services lost clients.\n\"We had a mission to change the TV market,\" Cellcom Chief Executive Nir Sztern told a news conference. \"This move enables clients to disconnect from the set-top box. We need to bring broadcast over IP (Internet protocol).\"\nIn the United States, Time Warner offers some customers the option to swap their cable box for a Roku streaming player. \n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Tova Cohen)",

      "text": "Share \nThis rustic casserole is inspired by an omelet that was my go-to brunch for years at the small cafe in my old New York City neighborhood. It's filled with thick chunks of breakfast sausage, sweet apples, and smoky cheddar, making it appropriate for holiday get-togethers and those evenings when you want a cozy breakfast for dinner. \nI love this casserole for many reasons, but for me it elicits strong feelings of warmth, comfort, and happiness in that special way only food can manage. Add Apples to Your Casserole — You'll Love it \nAdding sausage to your egg casserole is a no-brainer; it helps to make the dish even more satisfying. The smoked cheddar is a delight in this recipe as well, lending its smoky creaminess to every bite. But apples? Those are the total wild card. Here, they act as a foil to the richness of the casserole, serving up bright, crunchy bites with every forkful. \nBecause they are cooked in the casserole — although we like to scatter a few fresh slices on top before serving — you need to go with crisp, firm varieties that can hold up to the 45-minute cook time. Look to the apples you add to apple pie as a good place to start.",

      "text": "Curved screens could be coming to the iPhone in 2017 OLED displays will give Apple the opportunity to bring to market an iPhone with a curved display. | Topic: iPhone \nLike the iPhone but wish it had a curved display like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge? 2017 could be the year your wish becomes a reality. See also: Could Trump be the catalyst for an all-American iPhone? \nAccording to a report in the Wall Street Journal , Apple has instructed its suppliers to \"increase output of thinner organic light emitting displays [OLED] and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung to differentiate its models.\" \n2017 will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and with slowing smartphone sales, Apple is under pressure to deliver something really special, and the display is one area that the company is experimenting with. \nBut the article does urge restraint as \"Apple may decide not to release the model because it is one of more than 10 prototypes being considered.\" PREV \nIt makes sense for Apple to focus on the display. It is, after all, the part of the iPhone that people interact with the most, and while bumping processor speeds and capacities are important, these changes are not something that is immediately obvious to the end user. \nBut the problem is that the only manufacturer that can currently mass-produce OLED displays is Samsung, and has invested some $10 billion in the technology over the past year. Other players in the display market - specifically LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp - are lagging behind in OLED technology. \nApple going mass-market with an OLED-equipped iPhone could put pressure on the OLED supply chain, and could mean that supplies of any iPhone using an OLED display could be constrained. \nAnother factor that Apple will no doubt be paying close attention to is how OLED will affect its bottom line. Not only are OLED displays thinner and lighter than LCD displays, but they are more expensive, and could add around $50 to the iPhone's bill or materials. \nSee also :",

      "title": "Apple iPhone With Curved Screen Could Come as Soon as Next Year",
      "text": "An iPhone with a curved screen could be on store shelves as soon as next year.\nApple Inc.'s suppliers say they have been asked to increase output of thinner organic light emitting displays and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung to differentiate its models.\nThe Cupertino, Calf., company has been battling slowing smartphone sales and is under pressure to deliver a hit phone when the iPhone marks its 10th anniversary next year. An iPhone with an OLED screen could be introduced as one of several models to be unveiled, people familiar with the matter said, but would come with a higher price tag because OLED displays are more expensive to produce.\nApple may decide not to release the model because it is one of more than 10 prototypes being considered, said the people.\nApple declined to comment.\nRival smartphone makers from Samsung Electronics Co. to Xiaomi Corp. and Google Inc. have already shifted from using conventional liquid crystal displays to OLED screens because they are thinner, lighter, and allow for flexible designs. OLED screens don't require a backlight component to illuminate the screen. But they could be up to $50 more expensive to produce, according to analysts' estimates.\nLong-term supply contracts with Apple could add billions of dollars to display makers' sales at a time when many are mired in losses. Research firm IHS Markit forecasts revenue in the OLED market for smartphones to surpass the LCD market in 2018 to reach $18.6 billion. Last year, revenue in the smartphone LCD market reached $20.8 billion compared with $10.6 billion for the OLED market.\nSamsung Display Co., a unit of Samsung Electronics, currently dominates the market for smartphone OLED screens and is one of a few companies that can mass produce the displays. Samsung has long been a supplier of memory chips and other components to Apple but as the two companies compete in the global smartphone market, Apple has diversified its screen suppliers over the years. For that reason, Apple has been relying on LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp for supply of its retina displays, which use LCD technology.\nBut LG Display, Japan Display, and Sharp are behind Samsung when it comes to OLED investment. Samsung has spent close to $10 billion this year alone to expand its OLED production and research and development, while LG Display plans to invest close to $3 billion by 2018 to expand its production of smartphone OLED screens.\nBoth Japan Display and Sharp have faced financial difficulties, making it difficult for them to ramp up production. Japan Display is in talks with the Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a government-backed fund, for a fresh bailout package. Sharp, mired in debt, sold itself to Foxconn Technology Group, the Taiwan-based iPhone assembler, for ¥ 388.8 billion ($3.5 billion) earlier this year. Since the acquisition of Sharp, Foxconn executives have also turned skeptical about OLED technology due to the steep manufacturing cost.\nPeople familiar with the matter said Apple will likely rely on Samsung for most of its initial OLED needs but it wants LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp to ramp up production to have supplies ready for 2018.\nOne of the people said Sharp would need to spend more than $5 billion to supply enough OLED panels to Apple.\n\"We will make sample OLED screens, but I can't see them having the potential to become a big market,\" said Tai Jeng-wu, formerly a senior executive of Foxconn and now chief executive of Sharp, last month.\nInvesting in OLED technology comes with risks. It remains uncertain whether the technology will become mainstream. When it comes to image quality, there aren't clear advantages. Display makers haven't yet perfected flexible screens and it could take several more years before consumers can get their hands on a bendable phone, analysts say.\n\"Several players in the display industry already have the technology to make OLEDs foldable and rollable,\" said Jerry Kang, a display analyst at IHS Markit, though he was cautious about forecasting when they could be commercialized.\nComponents inside the panels such as the touch sensor and lens cover would restrict their flexibility, said Mr. Kang.\nTo hedge its bets, Japan Display has been marketing next-generation LCD panels it calls \"Full Active\" to Chinese handset makers. JDI says its new LCD panels, which use film rather than glass as the base material, would be similar to OLED when it comes to flexibility, picture quality and shelf life.\n\"We will invest in developing OLED mass-production lines because that is what our clients want, but the foundation of our business will remain LCD,\" said Japan Display Chief Executive Mitsuru Homma earlier this month.\nWrite to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com and Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.com\n 28, 2016 05:15 ET (10:15 ",

      "text": "print A drawing. Not what the iPhone 8 will look like. Yasser Farahi/Oval Picture \nApple is testing more than 10 prototypes for new iPhones that could go on sale next year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. \nCiting sources, some of those prototypes may have a new design centered around a curved screen. \nThe technology that would enable that curved screen is called OLED, which is a newer kind of display that has deeper blacks and lower power consumption. \nThe fact that Apple will need tens of millions of these OLED screens for next year is setting off a race among screen makers, including Samsung, LG Display, Foxconn-owned Sharp, and Japan Display. \nThe WSJ says that Samsung will supply \"most\" of Apple's initial OLED needs, confirming what Bloomberg reported earlier . \nBut Apple is pushing the other three to gear up to supply OLED iPhone screens as soon as 2018. That would require significant investment — the Journal says that Sharp would need to spend more than $5 billion to develop the technology and capacity to supply OLED screens to Apple. \n\"We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity,\" Sharp chief executive Tai Jeng-wu said last month. A clear picture \nThe information in Monday's Journal story lines up with other reports from Nikkei , as well as analyst reports from Barclays and KGI Securities . \nAs iPhone sales decline, pressure is mounting on Apple to deliver a very desirable new iPhone model in 2017 to return the line to growth. \nThis model is widely expected to feature glass casing, wireless charging, and a new edge-to-edge screen design, in addition to the latest chips and technologies. \n\"iPhone 8 design didn't sound 100% locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope,\" Barclays analysts wrote in November. \nKGI Securities pointed to three iPhone models in 2017, with only one sporting the new kind of OLED screen. \"We predict three new iPhone models will be launched in 2017: 5.1-5.2” OLED, 4.7” TFT-LCD, and 5.5” TFT-LCD,\" the KGI Securities analyst wrote. \nThe Journal warns that the OLED iPhone could be scrapped before its expected launch next fall. After all, Apple is testing 10 prototypes and reportedly killed an iPhone model months before launch in 2016. It sounds like what Apple ends up launching will depend on whether Apple's Asian suppliers can provide enough next-generation screens.",

      "title": "Living with an iPhone 7 Plus",
      "text": "Living with an iPhone 7 Plus   noon Despite a few quibbles, Apple's latest large smartphone is the best I've ever used. \nFor the past several weeks, I've been using an iPhone 7 Plus, and have found it to be a wonderful smartphone. Compared to the iPhone 6s Plus , the biggest changes are the improved camera, a changed home button, and of course, the lack of a traditional analog headphone jack . I got used to the home button and the headphone changes fairly easily, and find that my day-to-day experience really hasn't changed much—it's a fast, powerful, phone that is arguably the best on the market today. \nFrom a design perspective, the 7 Plus really doesn't look all that different from the 6s Plus, or for that matter, the 6 Plus. Visually, the big difference is a wider opening for the rear cameras and no phone jack. From a distance, you can't really tell them apart. \nIt still measures the same 6.23 by 3.07 by 0.29 inches—quite reasonable for a phone with a 5.5-inch display—though Apple has shaved a bit off the weight. Unlike some of my colleagues, I like the big size —I find it fits in my pocket (just barely—6-inch phones typically don't) and I find the bigger screen is simply better for reading or Web browsing. But I know that's a personal preference. \nThe 5.5-inch IPS display continues to have a 1920-by-1080 resolution (401 pixels per inch), which I find to be terrific, though not quite top of the market. In other ways, the screen is better, with greater brightness giving it a higher contrast ratio and a wide color gamut providing the most accurate color of any display on the market. ( DisplayMate has more details on this ) All I can tell you is, it looks great. \nThe processor has improved, with Apple talking about how its A10 Fusion chip now has two high-power cores and two high-efficiency/low-power cores (two fast and two slow), similar to lots of the processors on Android phones. It also includes a six-core GPU, which Apple says is 50 percent faster than last year's A9. Benchmark results look very good, and it did feel a bit faster in actual use than the previous model, but not enough so that I'd call it a significant change. \nIt weighs 6.63 ounces, a slight improvement from the 6.77 ounces of the previous model, though you won't notice the difference. It has a 2900 mAh battery, and Apple claims it lasts up to an hour longer than the previous model. PCMag's tests also show a significant improvement in battery life, but in the real world, I can't say I noticed it. It still gets me through a full day of normal use without a problem, but I have to charge it every night. \nOne relatively minor change in this year's model is that Apple chose to go with a home button that uses \"taptic\" feedback (effectively vibrations) rather than a button that physically depresses. Even though I've used virtual similar buttons extensively on Android phones, it took a bit of getting used to on an iPhone. It doesn't feel the same, but once you become accustomed to the new home button, it works great. I find Apple's fingerprint recognition to be a bit better than on any other phone I've used. \nPerhaps the thing that has gotten the most attention on the iPhone 7 is how Apple removed the analog headphone jack. That has taken a bit of getting used to. The phones come with earbuds that connection to the Lightning port, and also with a cable to connect the lightning port to a traditional headphone jack so you can use your existing wired headphones. Those both work fine. Still, it's a pain to carry around another dongle; and you can't use it when you're using the Lightning port to charge the phone. Apple's own AirPods wireless earbuds haven't shipped yet , but there are many alternatives on the market. I was happy with the Plantronics BackBeat Go 3 earphones, which sounded quite good (though of course, wireless headphones are another thing that needs to be charged). One tradeoff for the lack of an analog port is the addition of stereo speakers, which sounded pretty good. \nThe biggest change on the 7 Plus—and indeed, other than the size, the one thing that really makes it different from the smaller iPhone 7—is the additional of a second rear-facing camera. The phone uses two 12-megapixel cameras with an aperture of f/1.8, with one normal camera and one described as a 2x optical \"telephoto\" lens. Compared with the previous generation, which had an aperture of f/2.2, the new lens lets in more light, which generally makes for better photos, particularly in low light. The second lens may not technically be a telephoto but it does have let you focus closer on items though with a smaller field of view. \nYou get to the second lens by pinch-and-zooming on the screen or hitting the zoom circle in the camera app, and in general, it worked pretty well, letting me getting somewhat closer pictures. But it's still only a 2x lens so it hasn't replaced my need for a Superzoom digital camera, where you can use a 10 to 30x telephoto lens. It also offers 4k video recording at 30 frames per second or 1080p capture at 60 frames per second, and optical image stabilization for video capture; as well as a 7-megapixel front-facing camera. \nOverall, the pictures looked great. I thought daylight photos were the clearest I've seen yet, with the best color. Low-light pictures also are definitely improved over the iPhone 6s Plus, though a bit noisier than the low-light photos I got using the Google Pixel . \nOne interesting new feature, still officially in \"beta\" but on the phone with the recent versions of iOS is called \"portrait mode\" which uses the two rear-facing cameras together to create the blurred background or depth effect (known as \" bokeh \") you see with many DSLRs. I've seen other phones try similar features with mixed results, but I thought it worked pretty well, if not quite up to the standards of top-end cameras. \nAnother new feature for this year's model is water resistance, to the IP67 standard, which is certainly appreciated. In some ways, it's lacking a few of the features that I've appreciated on Android phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 , such as an always-on display, wireless charging, and of course, a micro-SD slot for additional storage. \nOn the software side, I've found iOS 10.1.1 to have its pros and cons. Force touch worked well on the device, and I appreciated the new options in the camera app. On the other hand, I'm not thrilled with threading in the mail app, and have had a number of friends ask me how to turn it off (which isn't hard). I've noticed a few more crashes with iOS 10 than I had with iOS 9. \nSiri is getting better over time, but it's still inconsistent. Sometimes it gives great answers, but I still find it often sends me to Web pages instead of just answering my questions. Apple Maps has improved and usually works quite well. But recently while heading from New York to New Jersey, it told me to make a U-turn in the middle of the George Washington Bridge. I still prefer Google Maps or Waze; of course, you can run these as well, though they aren't integrated with Siri. \nIn general, I find Apple's software to be somewhat better integrated than Android, but the differences have become slimmer over time. Of course, iOS works pretty much the same, no matter which recent iPhone you're running, assuming you upgraded to the new version. One big difference is that Apple charges more for cloud backups, which is particularly an issue for storing photographs, and I generally find iCloud to be better integrated, but less featured than Google's equivalents. The iPhone 7 Plus is available in jet black (which remains effectively unavailable), matte black, silver, gold, and rose gold, and in 32, 128, and 256 GB of memory. \nOverall, I have a few quibbles, such as the lack of the analog port, and a few crashes. But in general, I've found it to be a great phone with a very fast processor, wonderful display, and a terrific camera—in many ways, it's the best smartphone I've yet used.",

      "text": "– A + Apple asks OLED suppliers to increase output in anticipation of curved 'iPhone 8' in 2017 By Neil Hughes \nMonday, November 28, 2016, 06:14 am PT (09:14 am ET) \nApple is said to be exploring more than 10 potential prototype models in anticipation of next year's 10th anniversary of the iPhone, with the company eyeing an OLED-display curved \"iPhone 8\" for launch in 2017.\n\n\n\"iPhone 8\" concept by Veniamin Geskin. \n\nCiting people familiar with the company's plans, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Apple has asked its suppliers to increase their output of organic light emitting displays, in anticipation of an OLED-equipped iPhone next year. In addition, Apple is also said to have asked suppliers to offer up screens with higher resolutions than Samsung handsets.\n\nIn all more than 10 prototypes are being considered for next year's launch, the report said. \n\nRecent rumors have suggested Apple plans to release three new iPhone models in 2017, including a new high-end flagship OLED model with a screen sized between 5.1 and 5.2 inches. The remaining two models are believed to feature legacy LCD panels sized at 4.7 and 5.5 inches, the same as the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.\n\n\nConcept rendering of next-gen iPhone with edge-to-edge display. \n\nAll three models are said to feature wireless charging for the first time, along with glass-backed cases.\n\nAs for who will supply OLED panels to Apple, Monday's report suggested it's likely that Samsung will be the chief partner, as other display makers simply cannot provide the amount of inventory needed for a new iPhone launch. Apple is said to be hoping that Sharp, LG Display and Japan Display will be able to ramp up production to take over some of Samsung's share by 2018.\n\nApple already uses OLED technology in two key products: The Apple Watch, as well as the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar (though not its primary display).\n\nGlobal OLED availability is limited, which has led to rumors that Apple could struggle to meet demand for an all-new iPhone next year. It's believed that the switch to OLED will allow Apple to embed key components— including the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and FaceTime camera —beneath the screen, allowing a true edge-to-edge seamless front panel.",

      "text": "Apple’s next iPhone could have come with curved screen  43   An iPhone with a curved screen could be on store shelves as soon as next year, The Wall Street Journal reports. \nApple’s suppliers say they have been asked to increase output of thinner organic light emitting displays and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung to differentiate its models. \nThe Cupertino company has been battling slowing smartphone sales and is under pressure to deliver a hit phone when the iPhone marks its 10th anniversary next year. An iPhone with an OLED screen could be introduced as one of several models to be unveiled, people familiar with the matter said, but would come with a higher price tag because OLED displays are more expensive to produce. \nApple may decide not to release the model because it is one of more than 10 prototypes being considered, said the people. \nApple declined to comment. \nRival smartphone makers from Samsung Electronics Co. to Xiaomi Corp. and Google Inc. have already shifted from using conventional liquid crystal displays to OLED screens because they are thinner, lighter, and allow for flexible designs. OLED screens don’t require a backlight component to illuminate the screen. But they could be up to $50 more expensive to produce, according to analysts’ estimates. \nLong-term supply contracts with Apple could add billions of dollars to display makers’ sales at a time when many are mired in losses. Research firm IHS Markit forecasts revenue in the OLED market for smartphones to surpass the LCD market in 2018 to reach $18.6 billion. Last year, revenue in the smartphone LCD market reached $20.8 billion compared with $10.6 billion for the OLED market. Related links:",

      "title": "Apple prototyping hi-res curved-screen model as possible top-tier iPhone 8 – WSJ",
      "text": "Reddit \nA report in the WSJ backs an earlier suggestion that Apple may be planning a hi-res curved-screen iPhone next year, possibly as a new top tier handset known as an iPhone Pro. The company is said to have gotten as far as prototyping the new device. \nWe’ve been hearing rumors for some time now of a third iPhone tier next year. The majority of these reports suggest that the top-tier model will be distinguished by an OLED screen while the two other models remain for now on IPS LCD – but we have heard one previous credible report of a curved-screen model … \nThe Nikkei Asian Review made the same suggestion in August, stating then that the display would curve in at the edges. There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides. \nThe WSJ report contains no new details on the curved screen, saying only that Apple has not yet finalised its plans. An iPhone with a curved screen could be on store shelves as soon as next year [but] Apple may decide not to release the model because it is one of more than 10 prototypes being considered. \nThe piece does, however, suggest that the company may be considering a considerable bump in resolution alongside the curve. \nApple’s suppliers say they have been asked to increase output of thinner organic light emitting displays and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung to differentiate its models. \nAnalysts estimate that the additional manufacturing cost of an OLED iPhone could be up to $50, a level that would likely lead to Apple seeking to recoup the cost through a higher retail price for that model. \nOne additional reason Apple may plan to restrict OLED to a relatively small proportion of iPhones is because it is hoping to use non-Samsung suppliers for the display panels. Samsung leads the way in OLED technology at present, reportedly making the Touch Bar panels for the new MacBook Pro. Apple has been relying on LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp for supply of its retina displays, which use LCD technology. But LG Display, Japan Display, and Sharp are behind Samsung when it comes to OLED investment. \nThe latter three companies are not expected to be producing OLED screens at high volumes until 2018.",

      "text": "By Takashi Mochizuki and Eun-Young Jeong\nApple's Asia suppliers have been asked to increase output of thinner organic light emitting diode displays\nAn iPhone with a curved screen could be on store shelves as soon as next year.\nApple Inc.'s (AAPL) suppliers say they have been asked to increase output of thinner organic light emitting displays and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung (005930.SE) to differentiate its models.\nThe Cupertino, Calf., company has been battling slowing smartphone sales and is under pressure to deliver a hit phone when the iPhone marks its 10th anniversary next year. An iPhone with an OLED screen could be introduced as one of several models to be unveiled, people familiar with the matter said, but would come with a higher price tag because OLED displays are more expensive to produce.\nApple may decide not to release the model because it is one of more than 10 prototypes being considered, said the people.\nApple declined to comment.\nRival smartphone makers from Samsung Electronics Co. to Xiaomi Corp. and Google Inc. (GOOGL) have already shifted from using conventional liquid crystal displays to OLED screens because they are thinner, lighter, and allow for flexible designs. OLED screens don't require a backlight component to illuminate the screen. But they could be up to $50 more expensive to produce, according to analysts' estimates.\nAn expanded version of this article appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-iphone-with-curved-screen-could-come-as-soon-as-next-year-1480326466).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nTug of war delays some of Donald Trump's key hires (http://www.wsj.com/articles/tug-of-war-delays-some-of-donald-trumps-key-hires-1480291957?mod=trending_now_1)\n(http://www.wsj.com/articles/tug-of-war-delays-some-of-donald-trumps-key-hires-1480291957?mod=trending_now_1)Oil industry anticipates day of reckoning (http://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-industry-anticipates-day-of-reckoning-1480248012?mod=trending_now_2)\n-Takashi Mochizuki; 0746ET\n ",

The news comes from Indonesian Communication and Information Minister Rudiantara, who mentioned that the project's preparation has now progressed to \"the final stage\" (via Tempo ). Additionally, the Minister added that Apple plans to find the location for the R&D center by the end of 2016, putting the company on the path of completing construction and hiring employees by the end of 2017. \"Several options\" for the focus of the Jakarta-based R&D center have been proposed, but none are yet finalized. Image via Indonesia.travel \"Just wait. [The preparation of the project development] is in the final stage. The Industry Ministry and the Communication and Informatics Ministry are finalizing the plan,\" [Rudiantara] said. \"It's more important. By late December, they will commence the execution for the location. So, in 2017, they will start building structures and recruiting employees,\" he added. Rudiantara said that he knows the monetary value of Apple's investment in the Jakarta R&D center, but did not divulge the number to the press. In addition to the proposed site in Jakarta, Apple has set up similar R&D centers in China , Japan , Israel , and the UK , and is said to be planning similar facilities in Canada, India, and Vietnam to take advantage of local resources.",

      "title": "iOS 10.1.1 update is causing iPhone battery issues",
      "text": "Apple's latest iOS update, 10.1.1 promises, among other things, \"stability improvements and bug fixes.\" But some believe it's also carrying a new battery bug.\nSEE ALSO: Apple’s new TV app is Apple's idea of TV\nAccording to a report by PCMag.com the update is unexpectedly draining iPhone batteries. There's also an active discussion on Apple's own support site where customers are reporting iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S devices unable to last a full day without charging. Others report iPhones dying with \"30 to 50% charge left.\"\nMight want to wait on this one.\nImage: Apple\nThe report comes just a week after Apple agreed to replace the batteries on a small number of iPhone 6s devices that were prematurely losing steam.\nSome users who have opted into Apple's open beta program report that version 10.1.1 (14B150) solves the problem (others, said it didn't help), but most iPhone users are not running beta software on their phones. The beta program is now offering version 10.2. Some in the forum have opted to roll back to a previous iOS version. One user on the Apple support forum reported that a rollback didn't help, either. Said JimS-in-Seattle:\nDon't waste your time on rolling back to 10.1. I unfortunately confirmed faysal22's comment that 10.1 does not work. My phone is lasting about 3 hours now. Instead of the battery shutting down at 70% it is now shutting down at 85%. I cannot tell you how many calls I have been bumped from. BTW, when it happens my phone is essentially dead for about 10 minutes before I can use it again.\nIn addition to early shutdowns and rapid battery drain, others in a Hacker News forum reported that the Battery Consumption numbers given in Apple's Battery Percentage Table seemed way off. \"Varying apps are listed as huge battery sucks even when I don't think they are (Calculator anybody?!?),\" noted one frustrated user.\nThere are many reasons batteries in iPhones can appear to malfunction. Over-heating can impact battery life and performance. Background activity like mailbox synchronization can drain batteries, as can active social apps like Snapchat and Twitter. Repeated drops can impact the connection to the battery so that it never fully charges. There's also the fairly common issue of the lightning port becoming clogged with lint, making it impossible for the lighting plug to fully seat in the port (clean it out with a pin or toothpick). It's always worth checking all these things before assuming that an iOS update is responsible.\nI've seen my iPhone 6 unexpectedly drop from 60% charge to 0%, even on iOS 10. After plugging it back into the charger, it almost immediately jumped back up to 60%. These glitches are, apparently, sometimes caused by an errant app or some sort of crossed signal inside the phone.\nOn the other hand, Apple has been known to release a buggy iOS update or two. Usually it recognizes the issue quickly and delivers a patch. On Nov. 10, an Apple Support Forum rep responded to users' concerns by pointing them to articles on Maximizing Battery Life and Lifespan. One user complained the answer was \"nonsense.\" Mashable has contacted Apple for comment and will update this post with its response.",

According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple asked its partners to boost production of thin OLED displays, and send \"prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung.\" The better resolution part can definitely raise some eyebrows. Samsung's curved displays - as seen on the Galaxy S7 edge, for example - have Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixel) resolutions. Is Apple getting ready to make iPhones with even higher screen resolutions? We can't really tell for now, but that would be pretty crazy. At least some of the curved OLED panels might be supplied by Samsung Display. But that's no surprise, as Samsung (via various subsidiaries) is one of Apple's important component suppliers. For example, the RAM inside the iPhone 7 is made by Samsung. Reportedly, Will Apple go beyond Quad HD with the iPhone 8? Apple is currently playing with more than 10 next generation iPhone prototypes, and the curved screen model is just one of them. Ultimately, Apple could decide not to commercialize the curved screen handset next year. But we honestly hope that this model will arrive in 2017, because iPhones, despite being excellent devices, have been needing a big change for years now. If the curved screen iPhone 8 is released in 2017, it will likely be a bit more expensive than the regular versions, since curved OLED panels are not as cheap as flat IPS LCD ones. Right now, we don't know if the curved screen iPhone is supposed to be a small one (of around 4.7 inches), or a large one (of around 5.5 inches), but the latter variant would make more sense.While WSJ does not mention the name of the next iPhone, with all the big changes that the new model is bound to bring, we seriously can't imagine it being called iPhone 7s. Thus, it will likely be called iPhone 8 . Time will tell if we're wrong on this one.",

      "text": "Owners of the early batches of Apple's MacBook Pro 2016 are reporting GPU-related glitches through various channels. Issues include freezing laptops, flashing displays, colored bars filling up the screen, and unrecoverable crashes. ( Apple ) Advertisement \nOwners of the early batches of Apple's MacBook Pro 2016 are reporting a wide variety of what seem like GPU-related glitches on the new laptops. \nThe glitches are sometimes so severe that the display of the MacBook Pro becomes completely unusable, leaving owners unable to use the newly released computer. MacBook Pro 2016 GPU Glitch Reports \nReports on the glitches have been coming in through various channels, including on the official Apple forums for MacBooks. \nOne user claimed that his max-specification MacBook Pro 2016 suddenly had its display go crazy while updating an app through the App Store. The computer then froze, and after being rebooted, its screen was flashing. The laptop was left on and the display issue cleared up after 30 minutes, but the user is understandably worried that such a glitch would happen again. \nAnother user claimed that the MacBook Pro 2016 does not play well with Adobe's creative tools, with the laptop slowing down and at times becoming unusable while Lightroom is being used. \nJordan Kahn of 9to5Mac reported similar graphics issues with the MacBook Pro 2016 wherein the desktop background shows through the open windows of apps. Other reports revealed several other problems such as red and black bars filling up the screen and unrecoverable crashes. What's Causing The MacBook Pro 2016 Graphics Issues? \nWhile there are already several reports of such graphics problems on the MacBook Pro 2016, it might be too early to determine the definite cause of the problem. It could be the usual number of defective products among a high number of units for an electronic device, or it could be driver issues. \nThere are some things that are standing out to be common among the reports though. One of these things is the usage of Adobe software, including the aforementioned Lightroom and the Adobe Media Encoder. The problem also looks like it is only affecting the 15-inch model of the MacBook Pro 2016, so there is the possibility that the 13-inch model of the computer is not affected by the glitches. \nIt has not yet been confirmed whether the problem is due to corrupt firmware on the MacBook Pro 2016 or a hardware problem with the GPU onboard the laptops. \nUntil Apple releases an official statement regarding the issue, MacBook Pro 2016 owners could do nothing but wait on how to fix the seemingly widespread problem. One More MacBook Pro 2016 Issue \nAnother recently reported MacBook Pro 2016 issue is that some 15-inch units of the computer are wrongly indicated to have Iris Pro 580 integrated graphics despite being identified as featuring the Intel HD Graphics 530.

      "text": "share It’s been rumored fairly regularly in recent months that Apple wants to remove the iPhone’s iconic home button and integrate its functionality into one seamless front display. But it turns out the iPad might be the first iOS device to undergo this significant change. 9to5Mac spotted a new Makotakara report that claims Apple’s upcoming 10.9-inch iPad won’t feature any physical home button at all — a design decision that will allow a larger screen to fit into the same-sized footprint as today’s 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Instead, the company could put the home button’s functions (including Touch ID) underneath the display glass like some smartphone makers are already doing. The next iPad will also include thinner bezels, according to the report, which notes that these outward upgrades will come with one tradeoff: increased thickness. The 10.9-inch iPad will measure 7.5 millimeters thick, Makotakara claims, which is about the same as Apple’s original iPad Air from 2013. The uptick in product depth is likely necessary to make room for the iPad’s battery and the display technology that supports Apple Pencil. The one tradeoff: it’s getting thicker again Previous reports, including one from the reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo , have suggested that this larger iPad would have a 10.5-inch screen. But Makotakara also has a strong track record when it comes to Apple hardware rumors, and they’re saying it’ll be 10.9 inches. This time, anyway. Back in October, the Japanese site guessed that it’d be a 10.1-inch display , so who knows! Gotta love gadget rumors. The home button’s removal is the bigger aspect of this story — assuming that part proves accurate. With Apple expected to launch this iPad in the first half of 2017, it could help ease consumers through the transition months before the next iPhone . The iPhone 7 introduced a capacitive home button that doesn’t actually move when pressed, but it sounds like the iPad might skip that approach altogether.",

      "text": "It’s been rumored fairly regularly in recent months that Apple wants to remove the iPhone’s iconic home button and integrate its functionality into one seamless front display. But it turns out the iPad might be the first iOS device to undergo this significant change. 9to5Mac spotted a new Makotakara report that claims Apple’s upcoming 10.9-inch iPad won’t feature any physical home button at all — a design decision that will allow a larger screen to fit into the same-sized footprint as today’s 9.7-inch iPad Pro.

The National Retail Federation says shoppers spent $289.19 over the four-day Black Friday weekend — down 3.5% from the prior-year period, with a 4.2% increase in the number of online consumers, versus a 3.7% drop in bricks-and-mortar shoppers. Neil Doshi with Mizuho put out at note to clients arguing that Amazon ( AMZN ), eBay ( EBAY ), and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google \" should benefit from the strong start in eCommerce sales from Thanksgiving,” given that \"Thanksgiving and Black Friday eCommerce sales appear flat-to-up YoY.\"\"We were expecting some deceleration so this was a positive surprise to us.” Amazon shares are down $12.72, or 1.6%, at $767.65.",

      "title": "Apple iPhone With Curved Screen Could Come as Soon as Next Year",
      "text": "An iPhone with a curved screen could be on store shelves as soon as next year.\nApple Inc.'s suppliers say they have been asked to increase output of thinner organic light emitting displays and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung to differentiate its models.\nThe Cupertino, Calf., company has been battling slowing smartphone sales and is under pressure to deliver a hit phone when the iPhone marks its 10th anniversary next year. An iPhone with an OLED screen could be introduced as one of several models to be unveiled, people familiar with the matter said, but would come with a higher price tag because OLED displays are more expensive to produce.\nApple may decide not to release the model because it is one of more than 10 prototypes being considered, said the people.\nApple declined to comment.\nRival smartphone makers from Samsung Electronics Co. to Xiaomi Corp. and Google Inc. have already shifted from using conventional liquid crystal displays to OLED screens because they are thinner, lighter, and allow for flexible designs. OLED screens don't require a backlight component to illuminate the screen. But they could be up to $50 more expensive to produce, according to analysts' estimates.\nLong-term supply contracts with Apple could add billions of dollars to display makers' sales at a time when many are mired in losses. Research firm IHS Markit forecasts revenue in the OLED market for smartphones to surpass the LCD market in 2018 to reach $18.6 billion. Last year, revenue in the smartphone LCD market reached $20.8 billion compared with $10.6 billion for the OLED market.\nSamsung Display Co., a unit of Samsung Electronics, currently dominates the market for smartphone OLED screens and is one of a few companies that can mass produce the displays. Samsung has long been a supplier of memory chips and other components to Apple but as the two companies compete in the global smartphone market, Apple has diversified its screen suppliers over the years. For that reason, Apple has been relying on LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp for supply of its retina displays, which use LCD technology.\nBut LG Display, Japan Display, and Sharp are behind Samsung when it comes to OLED investment. Samsung has spent close to $10 billion this year alone to expand its OLED production and research and development, while LG Display plans to invest close to $3 billion by 2018 to expand its production of smartphone OLED screens.\nBoth Japan Display and Sharp have faced financial difficulties, making it difficult for them to ramp up production. Japan Display is in talks with the Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a government-backed fund, for a fresh bailout package. Sharp, mired in debt, sold itself to Foxconn Technology Group, the Taiwan-based iPhone assembler, for ¥ 388.8 billion ($3.5 billion) earlier this year. Since the acquisition of Sharp, Foxconn executives have also turned skeptical about OLED technology due to the steep manufacturing cost.\nPeople familiar with the matter said Apple will likely rely on Samsung for most of its initial OLED needs but it wants LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp to ramp up production to have supplies ready for 2018.\nOne of the people said Sharp would need to spend more than $5 billion to supply enough OLED panels to Apple.\n\"We will make sample OLED screens, but I can't see them having the potential to become a big market,\" said Tai Jeng-wu, formerly a senior executive of Foxconn and now chief executive of Sharp, last month.\nInvesting in OLED technology comes with risks. It remains uncertain whether the technology will become mainstream. When it comes to image quality, there aren't clear advantages. Display makers haven't yet perfected flexible screens and it could take several more years before consumers can get their hands on a bendable phone, analysts say.\n\"Several players in the display industry already have the technology to make OLEDs foldable and rollable,\" said Jerry Kang, a display analyst at IHS Markit, though he was cautious about forecasting when they could be commercialized.\nComponents inside the panels such as the touch sensor and lens cover would restrict their flexibility, said Mr. Kang.\nTo hedge its bets, Japan Display has been marketing next-generation LCD panels it calls \"Full Active\" to Chinese handset makers. JDI says its new LCD panels, which use film rather than glass as the base material, would be similar to OLED when it comes to flexibility, picture quality and shelf life.\n\"We will invest in developing OLED mass-production lines because that is what our clients want, but the foundation of our business will remain LCD,\" said Japan Display Chief Executive Mitsuru Homma earlier this month.\nWrite to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com and Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.com\n 05:15 ET (10:15 ",

      "text": "Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo \nIt’s hard to say with any certainty what Apple is planning for its next iPhone, but we can start to get a better understanding of what might be on the way as rumors start to swirl. The Wall Street Journal on Monday said that Apple is currently testing several prototype iPhones, as many as 10 separate devices, and that it’s possible a model with a curved OLED display will be in consumers hands as early as next year. \nThis isn’t the first time we’ve heard about a curved iPhone 8, or an OLED panel for that matter. In fact, a report in September suggested Apple is looking to Samsung and Sharp as potential OLED display providers . However, The Wall Street Journal suggests that Apple may want something to distinguish its panels from Samsung’s, suggesting that the Cupertino-based company is asking suppliers to deliver panels “with better resolution than ones from Samsung to differentiate its models.” \nSamsung, as you likely know, outfits its smartphones with some of the best displays on the planet, using curved Quad HD OLED displays. Apple hasn’t yet adopted Quad HD, and The Wall Street Journal’s report suggests it may skip it entirely, perhaps for a 4K panel. A curved screen could help Apple eliminate the bezels around the edges of the phone, adopting a design not unlike the Galaxy S7 Edge or Galaxy Note 7. iPhone 8 curved screen may be scrapped \nThe Wall Street Journal warned that Apple may bail on a curved screen entirely, citing Sharp as one potential supplier that isn’t convinced it should spend $5 billion investing in OLED technology to build the panels for Apple. Sharp’s CEO recently said he doesn’t see OLED panels “having the potential to become a big market,” even though they’re currently used in everything from smartwatches to televisions and, of course, smartphones. Sharp’s IGZO displays have been used by Apple in the past; rumors once suggested Sharp was going to provide Apple with a 4K panel for the iPhone 7. That never came to fruition, of course. \nIn any case, it seems Apple is far from settled on a final design for the iPhone 8. If it does end up adopting a curved OLED panel, the iPhone 8 will end up costing consumers about $50 more than standard models, The Wall Street Journal said. iPhone 8 models without the OLED panel will continue to use LCD , according to earlier reports. All models are expected to support wireless charging , too. The new iPhone 8 is expected in September.

      "text": "Piper Analyst: Don't Read Too Much Into Apple's Black Friday Deals Apple's iPhone is still a highly sought-after item, Piper Jaffray senior research analyst Gene Munster said. Giovanni Bruno Nov28,20169:58AMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- After sitting on the sidelines for Black Friday 2015, Apple ( AAPL ) got back into the game this year, albeit with uninspiring offers. The tech titan gave a gift card only promotion worth up to $150 with the purchase of select items. \n\"I would not read too much into it,\" Piper Jaffray senior research analyst Gene Munster said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday morning. \"What ends up happening is people have to go and spend more money at Apple. They weren't really discounting the products per say.\" \nRegarding the potential boost this promotion could have on Apple's first quarter financial results, Munster is not expecting much. \"It's so small it probably is not going to be measurable,\" he noted. \n\"I think what is important is that our retail team has done a survey of 1,000 people in the U.S. in the last month, and the number one requested gift was the iPhone,\" Munster explained. \nThose results demonstrate that consumers covet the iPhone, and that will prove to be the \"bigger story,\" Munster said. Shares of Apple are flat Monday. \n(Apple is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS. See all of his holding with a free trial here. ) \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates the stock as a \"buy\" with a ratings score of B+. \nApple's strengths such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, expanding profit margins and notable return on equity outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.

(Photo: Richard Vogel, AP) \nNext year will likely be a big one for the iPhone. It's the 10th anniversary of the smartphone introducing the touchscreen era, so Apple should have surprises in store. \nOne of those could be a curved touchscreen. According to The Wall Street Journal , the curved screen is among several prototypes Apple requested from suppliers for the next iPhone. Apple could unveil an iPhone with curved screen as soon as next year. \nThe report says Apple could ditch the curved screen because it's among several prototypes being considered for the next iPhone. \nThe curved smartphone screen is nothing new. Samsung added the feature through the Galaxy S7 Edge, where a portion of the screen bends over the side of the device. Other smartphone makers including LG also boast devices with a curved display. \nLast quarter, Apple reported its first annual decline in sales in more than a decade as shipments of its flagship product continued to fall. In September, Apple launched the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The company said it would not release opening weekend numbers for the device's launch, unlike previous years. \nAccording to 9to5Mac , KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this month shipments of the iPhone had peaked for the year and suppliers will see a drop in orders. \nEnter next year's iPhone, which could help Apple spark a rebound because of the 10th anniversary. Last month, Nikkei Asian Review reported Apple will launch three iPhone models next year, all with glass backs instead of aluminum. \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 . 7 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

CREDIT: via youtube.com/SextonVideography Advertisement \nA new drone footage is giving the world an update on Apple's new $5 billion headquarters under construction in Cupertino, California. \nFootage of the campus appeared on videographer David Sexton's YouTube page on Friday. Designed by architectural firm Foster + Partners, the Apple Campus 2 includes a main circular building featuring a glass atrium, topped with solar panels. Its courtyard could feature several outdoor cafes, according to Sexton. A tunnel leads to a parking structure that fits 20,000 cars, and the campus also includes a 100,000-square foot fitness center and an underground auditorium. \nApple Campus 2 is expected to be completed by the end 2016, with a move-in date sometime during the first quarter of 2017, according to CEO Tim Cook. Although landscaping has begun around campus, beautification, and grounds projects will continue through mid-year. Published on: Nov 28, 2016 Advertisement",

      "title": "Apple iPhone With Curved Screen Could Come as Soon as Next Year",
      "text": "An iPhone with a curved screen could be on store shelves as soon as next year.\nApple Inc.'s suppliers say they have been asked to increase output of thinner organic light emitting displays and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung to differentiate its models.\nThe Cupertino, Calf., company has been battling slowing smartphone sales and is under pressure to deliver a hit phone when the iPhone marks its 10th anniversary next year. An iPhone with an OLED screen could be introduced as one of several models to be unveiled, people familiar with the matter said, but would come with a higher price tag because OLED displays are more expensive to produce.\nApple may decide not to release the model because it is one of more than 10 prototypes being considered, said the people.\nApple declined to comment.\nRival smartphone makers from Samsung Electronics Co. to Xiaomi Corp. and Google Inc. have already shifted from using conventional liquid crystal displays to OLED screens because they are thinner, lighter, and allow for flexible designs. OLED screens don't require a backlight component to illuminate the screen. But they could be up to $50 more expensive to produce, according to analysts' estimates.\nLong-term supply contracts with Apple could add billions of dollars to display makers' sales at a time when many are mired in losses. Research firm IHS Markit forecasts revenue in the OLED market for smartphones to surpass the LCD market in 2018 to reach $18.6 billion. Last year, revenue in the smartphone LCD market reached $20.8 billion compared with $10.6 billion for the OLED market.\nSamsung Display Co., a unit of Samsung Electronics, currently dominates the market for smartphone OLED screens and is one of a few companies that can mass produce the displays. Samsung has long been a supplier of memory chips and other components to Apple but as the two companies compete in the global smartphone market, Apple has diversified its screen suppliers over the years. For that reason, Apple has been relying on LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp for supply of its retina displays, which use LCD technology.\nBut LG Display, Japan Display, and Sharp are behind Samsung when it comes to OLED investment. Samsung has spent close to $10 billion this year alone to expand its OLED production and research and development, while LG Display plans to invest close to $3 billion by 2018 to expand its production of smartphone OLED screens.\nBoth Japan Display and Sharp have faced financial difficulties, making it difficult for them to ramp up production. Japan Display is in talks with the Innovation Network Corp. of Japan, a government-backed fund, for a fresh bailout package. Sharp, mired in debt, sold itself to Foxconn Technology Group, the Taiwan-based iPhone assembler, for ¥ 388.8 billion ($3.5 billion) earlier this year. Since the acquisition of Sharp, Foxconn executives have also turned skeptical about OLED technology due to the steep manufacturing cost.\nPeople familiar with the matter said Apple will likely rely on Samsung for most of its initial OLED needs but it wants LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp to ramp up production to have supplies ready for 2018.\nOne of the people said Sharp would need to spend more than $5 billion to supply enough OLED panels to Apple.\n\"We will make sample OLED screens, but I can't see them having the potential to become a big market,\" said Tai Jeng-wu, formerly a senior executive of Foxconn and now chief executive of Sharp, last month.\nInvesting in OLED technology comes with risks. It remains uncertain whether the technology will become mainstream. When it comes to image quality, there aren't clear advantages. Display makers haven't yet perfected flexible screens and it could take several more years before consumers can get their hands on a bendable phone, analysts say.\n\"Several players in the display industry already have the technology to make OLEDs foldable and rollable,\" said Jerry Kang, a display analyst at IHS Markit, though he was cautious about forecasting when they could be commercialized.\nComponents inside the panels such as the touch sensor and lens cover would restrict their flexibility, said Mr. Kang.\nTo hedge its bets, Japan Display has been marketing next-generation LCD panels it calls \"Full Active\" to Chinese handset makers. JDI says its new LCD panels, which use film rather than glass as the base material, would be similar to OLED when it comes to flexibility, picture quality and shelf life.\n\"We will invest in developing OLED mass-production lines because that is what our clients want, but the foundation of our business will remain LCD,\" said Japan Display Chief Executive Mitsuru Homma earlier this month.\nWrite to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com and Eun-Young Jeong at Eun-Young.Jeong@wsj.com\n 28, 2016 05:15 ET (10:15 ",

      "text": "  @10:20AM from the shady-app-store dept. Over the years, Apple may have improved security, filters, and screening process of apps for its Mac's App Store, but even today things the quality of fraudulent apps continue to not only seep through its gatekeepers, but often times outnumber the good apps. How To Geek did some investigation over this and published the findings yesterday in a story titled, \" Don't Be Fooled: The Mac App Store Is Full of Scams \". It didn't take long for the publication to find scam apps on Apple's marquee app store for Mac computers. A search for \"Microsoft Excel\", for instance, returns \"Office Bundle\" made by a third-party. The app offers templates -- and just that -- for $30. Same is the case with any Office suite application. This might not seem as a real problem to many, but as How to Geek points out, there is one more problem: almost all these apps have icons and title names that are similar to those of Microsoft's, and Apple has had no issues with that. From the article: Let's be blunt: these customers were ripped off, and Apple pocketed $10 each (Editor's note: Apple charges 30 percent on all transactions on App Store(. And you'll only see these comments if you scroll past the two five star reviews that mention the word \"app\" numerous times. All of these fakes use Microsoft brands like Office, Word, and Excel in the product names. The logos aren't one-to-one copies of Microsoft's official logos, but they're almost always the correct color and letter (blue \"W\" for Word, green \"E\" for Excel, etcetera).",

      "text": " 25 a.m. ET Share \nNBA players spend more money at Express than Apple, Wal-Mart and Best Buy combined Jamie Sabau/Getty Images LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Toronto Raptors on May 19, 2016. It’s unclear if he wears Express off the court. \nBy Steven Kutz Deputy Personal Finance Editor \nA look at what NBA players do with their money shows they spend a lot on Apple AAPL, -0.01% products, and at the stores Whole Foods WFM, -0.73% , Target TGT, -0.80% and Neiman Marcus, among others. No surprises there. But they spend by far the most of their money at the clothing store Express EXPR, +0.00% Yes, Express. A store that until 2000 only sold women’s clothing. \nThe NBA Players Association teamed up with the personal finance app Personal Capital last fall to help players keep track of their spending, benefits and net worth. \nAlso see: This NFL player slept in a utility closet in college to save money \nSo far, 50 of the league’s roughly 440 players are using the app regularly, according to Mark Goines, Personal Capital’s chief marketing officer. \nOne possible explanation for all the spending at Express is that the league’s current Most Valuable Player, Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, was a brand ambassador for the chain from December 2014 to December 2015. \nExpress President and chief executive David Kornberg said he was “thrilled” to hear that players were shopping so much at his stores. \n“Express is all about offering our customers...fashion in a way that fits their individual lifestyles. While our partnership with Stephen Curry has ended, we continue to partner with professional athletes, including our current men’s brand ambassador, Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs,” he told MarketWatch. \nPersonal Capital compiled data from December 2015 to March 2016 and shared with MarketWatch what it has learned about the players’ finances. For example, the average 401(k) balance of the 50 players, who are a mix of both veterans and guys who are new to the league, is $338,951. \nAlso see: What it’s like to take a finance class with a lot of NFL players \nThe average NBA salary for the 2013-2014 season was roughly $5 million . Rookies make a predetermined salary based on where they are drafted. For the 2015-2016 season, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft made $4.7 million, and the No. 30 pick made $940,000. \nWhen it comes to spending, the players average an outlay of $42,498 a month . One player spent a noteworthy $501,000 between December and March. Where’s all that money going? Here’s a breakdown: Also see",

      "text": "print \nApple \nA new report from Japanese Apple blog MacOtakara adds two new claims about Apple's next iPad, which is said to be getting a total redesign in 2017. \nOne of those claims suggests the next iPad won't have a home button, which lines up nicely with rumors that the next iPhone won't have a home button , either. \nIt's unclear how Apple would implement the home button's features, like Touch ID or even simply returning to the home screen from within apps, without a home button. It's pure speculation at this point, but Apple could place the home button on the back of the next iPhone, like we've seen on several recent Android devices, or simply embed it (or hide it) in the display. \nPrevious rumors also claim the next iPad will also have a borderless design , where the front surface would consist mostly of the display. Yet, MacOtakara's report claims it'll have at least one relatively large bezel at the top of the device where the FaceTime camera is usually found, suggesting that it won't have a fully borderless design. \nIf accurate, the latest claims help paint a picture of the next iPad and iPhone that's awfully similar to the new Mi Mix smartphone from China-based Xiaomi. \nMKBHD/YouTube \nThe Mi Mix has a near-borderless design — there's a single border at the bottom of the phone where the front-facing camera is found. Its home button is also on the back of the phone, making for a perfectly flat and smooth front surface. \nEither way, nothing is certain until Apple reveals it on stage. Barclays analysts claim we can expect the next iPad in March 2017 . As for the iPhone, we expect Apple will do what it's done in past years and reveal the phone in September. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT:",

The $30 purchase price is split between the publisher (2/3) and Apple (1/3). ' \nIt turns out that the App Store is filled with scam apps like this. \nFrom How-To Geek : \nLet’s be blunt: these customers were ripped off, and Apple pocketed $10 each. And you’ll only see these comments if you scroll past the two five star reviews that mention the word “app” numerous times. Both of those reviews, by the way, were left by accounts that haven’t reviewed any other apps in the Store. \nSearch for other Office applications and you’ll find more template bundles, disguised as official applications to varying degrees. \nThere are also several $20+ applications that put Microsoft’s free online version of Office into a dedicated browser. Then there are the actual “apps” capable of opening and editing Office files, many of which use terms like “Microsoft Word” in their names. They appear to be slightly modified versions of open source applications, but we’re not about to buy them to find out. ",

      "title": "IDG Contributor Network: Why has Apple marginalized the Mac?",
      "text": "| Follow About | \nEye On Apple covers the latest hot news stories, rumors and illuminating discussions about Apple and its products. Product coverage includes Apple Watch, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Pay, Apple TV. Opinion Why has Apple marginalized the Mac? Many Mac users are not happy with Apple’s recent attitude toward the Mac. What is Cupertino thinking by marginalizing the Mac? CIO | Nov 28, 2016 8:53 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry \nThis is a time of great unease for many Mac users. Apple has been communicating, whether it intended to or not, that the Mac is not at the top of its priority list. \nLet’s review some recent Mac-related stuff: \n1. No new Mac Pro computer since 2013. \n2. No mention of the Mac Pro, iMac or Mac mini at the company’s recent event that unveiled the new MacBook Pro laptops. \n3. The elimination of the Product Manager of Automation Technologies job. \n4. Apple has gotten out of the monitor business by ending its Thunderbolt line of monitors, and the company has also recently disbanded its AirPort group. \nAll of these things taken together have many Mac users wondering what the heck is going on at Cupertino these days. Are the Mac's days numbered? Or is Apple just in a Mac-related lull while the company works quietly in the background on newer products? \nRight now there's no way to know what's happening inside of Apple but it doesn't take a genius (no pun intended) to figure out that iOS is probably the reason why Apple seems to be less enthusiastic about the Mac these days. iOS: The apple of Apple's eye \nAdam C. Engst at TidBits recently explored the role of iOS in the marginalization of the Mac: \nSo what could explain Apple’s increasing marginalization of the Mac, particularly in the pro market? The culprit is clearly the iOS platform, and the iPhone in particular. But the reason why it’s happening has more to do with a structural fact about the company that Apple will have to change if the Mac is to get the attention it needs to thrive. \nFor better and worse, Steve Jobs burned focus into Apple’s DNA. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1996, he focused the entire company on the Mac, slashing projects like the Newton and eliminating the Mac clone licensing program. Famously, he limited the Mac line to just four core models: the iBook and iMac for consumers, and the PowerBook and Power Mac for professionals. That product matrix was simple, clean, and understandable, and it was probably the only reason that Apple survived that era. Focusing on one platform was essential. \nHere’s the problem: Despite the fact that it now employs 115,000 people and is the most valuable company in the world, Apple still thinks like a one-platform company. Now it’s all about iOS, and everything Apple does is designed to serve the single goal of selling more iPhones and iPads. Sure, the Apple Watch and Apple TV might seem separate, but they’re not. The Apple Watch is an iPhone accessory that makes the iPhone more attractive, and Apple TV apps generally have iOS counterparts. Heck, both watchOS and tvOS are basically custom versions of iOS. Apple’s online services, from iCloud to the App Store to the iTunes Store, all support the shared ecosystem, which encourages platform lock-in. \nHow does the Mac fit into this new world order? It plays well with iCloud and the iTunes Store, and it increasingly taps iCloud for added functionality. It’s another link in the chain that keeps users buying iPhones and iPads because it’s easier to have a computer that talks to your smartphone and tablet seamlessly. The Mac also remains essential to iOS as a development platform, and (through macOS Server) as an organization-wide caching server for iOS and app updates. \nIn essence, the Mac is an accessory to the iOS platform. \nMore at TidBits \nI think Adam has hit the nail on the head with his take on this. iOS really has come to dominate Apple’s thinking and development efforts, and we can all see that the end result of this is a dismissive attitude toward the Mac. The Mac seems to have become a second rate, also-ran product inside of Apple, while iOS and the devices that run it get the lion's share of developer and executive attention. Ignoring or eliminating the Mac is a big mistake \nI think it would be a gigantic mistake for Apple to write off the Mac completely or to continue to fail to update the Mac regularly. One of Apple’s biggest selling points was its overall ecosystem of products that all worked together, and that includes the Mac. \nOne of the reasons why people have moved to the Mac platform is the convenience of having their desktop computers work well with the cloud and with their tablets, phones and even routers like the AirPort devices. Apple was able to offer every device needed by a user, and that gave the company momentum as people were sucked into its ecosystem orbit and then stayed there for years and years. \nBut that powerful ecosystem looks like it is beginning to fray as the Mac recedes in importance, and as the company eliminates Mac-related peripherals. Apple’s ecosystem is becoming less unified and appealing, and that is not a good thing for the company over the long haul. \nThe web that wove the company's products together may not be sticky enough to keep customers from straying to competitive products. The Mac Pro is a good example of this since the lack of an update for three years has already driven some users to buy faster, more powerful but cheaper Windows computers. iOS is great but I still need a Mac \nI own an iPad Pro, and an iPhone 6s Plus. I love both of my iOS devices, they are fantastic for certain things but they are not a replacement for my Mac. Not at all, and believe me I’ve experimented with using my iPad Pro for work and it just doesn’t cut it. Yes, I can use it but doing so means that it takes me a lot longer to get things done than using my Mac. \nIt’s not just iOS itself that's the problem, it's the size of the hardware that it runs on. Even the iPad Pro, with its 12.9-inch screen, pales in comparison to my 27-inch 5K iMac. I can just get more done much faster on the iMac than I can on the iPad Pro simply by having more screen space along with a Magic Trackpad and Logitech bluetooth keyboard. \nI don’t think I’m alone when it comes to needing a Mac. There are millions of people out there who feel like I do that iOS as a platform (both hardware and software) just cannot compete with a Mac when it comes to productivity. The shape and size of iOS devices, and the software that runs on them doesn’t meet our needs. \nThis doesn’t mean that we don’t like our iOS devices, or that we don’t use them regularly. But it does mean that we still need Apple to continue improving and releasing updated Macs regularly. And not just MacBook laptops, we need desktops and some of us even need really powerful desktops like the Mac Pro. \nMaybe someday iOS and the devices it runs on will improve and change to the point where the Mac is no longer needed, but that time is not yet here and probably won’t be for a very long while. \nSo Apple needs to rethink its marginalization of the Mac, or it runs the risk of having some Mac users move to Windows or Linux. If that starts to happen then the company might also see some of them dump their iOS devices for Android as well. The \"halo effect\" can also work in reverse, to Apple's big disadvantage. \nThe Mac is still incredibly important and it still matters to millions of us. \nAre you listening, Apple? \nDid you miss a post?

      "text": "Shutterstock\nThe iPhone is no stranger to battery problems , but it looks like Apple has hit an especially large battery-killing bump with the latest update to iOS 10 (10.1.1) which is quickly collecting reports of wrecking battery life and making its users miserable.\nA thread on YCombinator is rapidly collecting stories of the iPhone, especially the iPhone 6 and 6S, experiencing severe battery issues when the new update is installed. While the details vary, the broad strokes are fairly clear: The battery drains fast, the phone runs hot, and battery life is as short as three to four hours, with phones shutting down while showing 30% to 50% power left. The iPhone’s battery management app is offering nothing in the way of guidance as to what’s happening, and users are reporting it’s way off, possibly simply tracking how long apps are being used instead of their power drain.\nShort battery life has been an issue before, but the new update is apparently aggravating the problem. And it’s not clear exactly what’s causing the battery to run out so quickly. Some are reporting a hardware switch fixed the issue, others claim that it eventually resolved itself, and still others have no relief in sight just yet. Anybody experiencing the problem should contact Apple about the issue, and keep a charger handy.\nThe same thread reports that 10.2 solves the issue. We’ll likely see whether that’s true sooner rather than later, as Apple is reportedly working on a fix .\n(Via PC Mag )\n",

      "text": "Add cameras to Apple Watch with CMRA Submitted by Frank Macey on November 28, 2016 - 12:05pm \nDespite rumors to the contrary, Apple has yet to add a camera to Apple Watch. While some watch owners might see this possibility as a distraction, others are chomping at the bit to FaceTime and snap photos directly from their wrists. CMRA makes this possible in a stylish, self-contained rechargeable band. In fact, CMRA adds two cameras to Apple Watch, a forward-facing camera to snap photos AND a FaceTime camera for live video calling. \nCMRA integrates seamlessly with Apple Watch and iPhone, and can even snap photos after the Apple Watch battery is dead. A dual-charging dock powers up both the CMRA band and watch together, holding enough juice in an on-board battery for two complete charges away from a power outlet. \nThe forward-facing camera with Sony image sensor captures at 8MP, while the FaceTime camera clocks 2MP. The device also records HD video, with up to 30 minutes of video capture per charge. Other photography-friendly features include tilt balancing, lens correction, noise reduction and pixel optimization. 8GB of storage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and a microphone are built into the splash resistant band that connects directly to Apple Watch. \nContent captured on CMRA is synced automatically to the paired iPhone when connected. The band includes an LED status light and operates with a single button. CMRA pre-orders run $249, however there is a limited time discount in place for $124 at the moment. CMRA is in development and scheduled to ship in Spring 2017. \nPre-order the CMRA band for Apple Watch (38mm or 42mm sizes) directly from CMRA . CMRA requires an Apple Watch with watchOS 3 installed, and iPhone 5 or later with iOS 10. tags:",

      "text": "on Monday November 28, 2016 @12:20PM from the next-iPhone dept. Apple's 2017 iPhone lineup might include a model with a curved screen similar to Samsung's Edge devices, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke with the Wall Street Journal (paywalled). Apple's suppliers told the paper that they were asked to \"increase output of thinner organic light emitting displays and submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung .\" From a report on The Verge (since WSJ is paywalled): But with that in mind, the company is also reportedly considering more than 10 prototypes, so a curved display might not make it to market. We've heard this rumor before when it was coupled with the idea that at least one of Apple's new phones would include an OLED display.",

      "title": "You have to check out Canopy, Studio Neat's new keyboard case and stand!",
      "text": "\nCanopy is a good-lookin', minimalist case for Apple's Magic Keyboard that doubles as as stand for your iPad and iPhone.\nIf you're looking for a stylish (and we mean stylish ) stand for your iOS devices and love typing on the full-size Apple Magic Keyboard, then you've got to check out Canopy from Studio Neat . Studio Neat is the neat-o company that makes the Glif smartphone mount , the Cosmonaut smartphone stylus , and the Apple Watch Material Dock (among several other things).\n\nI was able to get an early look at this beautifully made case and stand, and let me tell you, folks, I felt so damn snazzy unfolding this case and using it in public.\n\nCanopy is made of a dark gray canvas material, a super-soft microfiber lining, a leather loop, and a stainless steel clasp. I can't get over how well the leather perfectly stands out against the dark gray canvas.\nSo how does it work? \nYou take your Apple Magic Keyboard and stick it to the bottom portion of the case … Hold on, hold on — before you start worrying about sticky residue left behind on your pristine Apple Keyboard, you should know the keyboard fastens to the Canopy with micro-suction pads. The spongy material uses suction to fasten itself without the need for sticky adhesives.\n(Quick aside: MICRO-SUCTION PADS ARE SO FRIGGIN' COOL!)\nOnce you've fastened your Magic Keyboard, you can fold the case up 'folio-style and use the clasp and loop to keep everything locked up tight. When you're ready to do some work, you undo the clasp, flip back the upper two portions of the Canopy and fasten the clasp so it forms a stand for your iPad, iPhone, etc.\n\nWhere do I get one? If you'd like to snag a Canopy for yourself or for a loved one, you can head on over to Studio Neat's site to pre-order the case for $40.\nThe fine folks at Studio Neat are trying their darnedest to get pre-orders out by Christmas, but they're unable to guarantee that ship date.\n\nSee at Studio Neat \n",

      "text": "There are plenty of rumors regarding the changes planned for the next-year iPhone, and a new report that was published today comes to more or less confirm something that we’ve heard before about this new model. The WSJ reports via sources with knowledge of the matter that Apple is internally evaluating no less than 10 prototypes of the iPhone 8, one of which comes with a curved screen. While this isn’t the first time we hear about a curved screen iPhone, the new report aligns with the previous speculation on the next-generation model, and Apple seems to be more inclined onto building an iPhone that comes with such a display. The company has reportedly asked suppliers to increase the output of OLED displays, as at least one of the iPhones to see daylight next year are likely to adopt this technology. Apple is currently using LCD screens on its phones...",

      "text": "Apple Internally Testing Curved Screen iPhone 8 Prototype GO A total of 10 prototypes are under consideration right now Nov 28, 2016 18:23 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: There are plenty of rumors regarding the changes planned for the next-year iPhone, and a new report that was published today comes to more or less confirm something that we’ve heard before about this new model. The WSJ reports via sources with knowledge of the matter that Apple is internally evaluating no less than 10 prototypes of the iPhone 8, one of which comes with a curved screen. While this isn’t the first time we hear about a curved screen iPhone, the new report aligns with the previous speculation on the next-generation model, and Apple seems to be more inclined onto building an iPhone that comes with such a display. The company has reportedly asked suppliers to increase the output of OLED displays, as at least one of the iPhones to see daylight next year are likely to adopt this technology. Apple is currently using LCD screens on its phones, but the company is exploring ways to introduce OLED on one of the 2017 iPhones. Just one iPhone getting OLED It’s believed, however, that Apple wants to make the OLED screen available on just one iPhone exclusively because the firm wants to avoid using Samsung suppliers for this model. Samsung is currently the leading OLED screen manufacturer, and it’s believed that the other companies, including LG and Japan Display, cannot align production of OLED panels with estimated demand for all iPhones, and this is one of the reasons the Cupertino firm plans to offer this tech on just one model. “We will invest in developing OLED mass-production lines because that is what our clients want, but the foundation of our business will remain LCD,” Japan Display Chief Executive Mitsuru Homma was quoted as saying. What’s also very interesting is that Apple is pressing its suppliers to build OLED screens that feature a bigger resolution than the ones that Samsung is currently using on its smartphones. Apple clearly wants the next-generation iPhone to offer better display quality than Samsung’s models, but the South Koreans will also introduce the new S8 flagship early next year, thus making it even more difficult for Cupertino to achieve its goal. Rumor has it that Apple plans to launch three iPhone models next year, namely the two typical 4.7- and 5.5-inch versions, as well as a new 5.5-inch or larger device that could feature the OLED screen and be sold as the top of the range.",

      "text": "Stocks Drift Lower As Crude Oil Jumps; Apple Shows Resilience In Dow Stocks were under mild selling pressure Monday afternoon ahead of a busy week of economic data. (AP) \nMajor stock indexes were mildly lower in afternoon trading Monday, but selling was fairly intense in so-called Trump-trade stocks that had been rallying on expectations of stronger demand as a result of Donald Trump's presidential win. \nAmong aggregate makers, Vulcan Materials ( VMC ) slumped 5%, while Martin Marietta ( MLM ) gave back 3.5%. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were down around 0.2% to 0.3%. Small caps took a hit with the Russell 2000 down 0.9%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking about 30% higher than Friday's half-session levels. \nNike ( NKE ), Caterpillar ( CAT ) and American Express ( AXP ) lagged in the Dow, with losses of around 1%. Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) were mostly unchanged. \nA busy week of economic data kicks off Tuesday with the release of the second estimate to Q3 gross domestic product. Personal income and spending data are due Wednesday, the ISM manufacturing index is due Thursday, and the November employment report is due Friday. \nBenchmark Nymex crude oil rallied 2% to $47.15 a barrel ahead of Wednesday's OPEC meeting. Concerns are growing that an output cut might not be a slam dunk, after all. \nIn the stock market today , fast-growing oil and gas producer Callon Petroleum ( CPE ) reversed lower despite a buy rating from Deutsche Bank and a 19 price target. Shares fell 2.5% to 15.89 after hitting an intraday high of 17.05. \nInside the IBD 50 , Sucampo Pharmaceuticals ( SCMP ) was a big gainer, up nearly 7%. The biotech was featured over the weekend in the Inside The 50 column. \nIBD 50 component Align Technology ( ALGN ) reversed lower even after Stifel reiterated a buy rating and raised its price target to 110 from 95. \nRELATED : ",

      "title": "WSJ: iPhone 8 with curved OLED display may launch next year",
      "text": "Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the best-selling smartphones in the world by a significant margin, regardless of whether or not sales are measuring up to analysts’ guesstimates. Apple’s manufacturing partners still haven’t even come close to building enough iPhone 7 Plus supply to meet demand, and the smaller iPhone 7 is thought to be selling quite quickly as well. Strong iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales are even more impressive when you consider the fact that Apple reused the same hardware design for a third consecutive year in 2016 — people still want to upgrade to these powerful new iPhones even though they look almost identical to iPhones released all the way back in 2014. Now, imagine what demand will be like if Apple releases a completely redesigned iPhone 8 with a new curved OLED display.\nDEAL ALERT: The best Cyber Monday sale of the season is happening right now! \nThe Wall Street Journal published a lengthy report on Monday morning suggesting that Apple might launch a new iPhone in 2017 with a curved OLED display. Unfortunately, there aren’t many firm details in the report, despite its length.\nA few claims stand out. First, WSJ says that Apple is currently testing more than 10 different prototypes for next year’s new iPhone 8, and it has not yet decided which new design will be featured on the final version of the phone. According to the paper’s sources, at least one of the 10+ prototypes in testing features a curved OLED display, but it’s not clear if that is the version of the iPhone 8 that will debut next year.\nApple has supposedly asked its suppliers to increase OLED output, and it has also requested prototypes of OLED screens that feature “better resolution than ones from Samsung,” in an effort to “differentiate its models.” This claim sounds dubious at best.\nSamsung’s current OLED panels feature 2K resolution. It’s entirely possible that Apple is testing higher-resolution screens for its next iPhones, but there is no chance that the motivation behind upping the resolution of its displays has anything to do with Samsung or its phones. Apple has stayed with comparatively low-resolution displays on its recent iPhones — 720p on the iPhone 7, 1080p on the iPhone 7 Plus — because on displays of this size, pixel count doesn’t have a huge impact on image quality once you hit a certain threshold. If Apple is toying with 4K displays, interest surrounding virtual reality applications would be a far more likely explanation.\nWSJ  also reiterated an earlier report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, suggesting that the OLED iPhone 8 will be just one of several new iPhone models that will be released in 2017. Other models will probably still utilize LCD displays, and the OLED iPhone will likely carry a higher price tag.\nTrending right now: \nBest Buy Cyber Monday 2016 deals: Huge savings on TVs, computers and more Walmart’s Cyber Monday sale kicks off right now – here are Sunday’s best deals Two of eBay’s most popular Black Friday 2016 deals are still available today See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Download Gain full access to information stored in iOS, Apple iCloud, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 devices! Elcomsoft Phone Breaker can recover passwords to encrypted iOS backups, download device backups from Apple iCloud and Microsoft OneDrive, and retrieve decryption keys to BlackBerry 10 backups directly from BlackBerry servers. GPU-accelerated recovery helps break into encrypted backups faster. The ability to retrieve attack Mac OS X account passwords allows to decrypt and mount FileVault 2 volumes. Extract information in real time from Apple iCloud! Elcomsoft Phone Breaker is the only forensic tool to acquire data stored in iCloud and iCloud Drive with or without Apple ID and password. No lengthy attacks and no physical access to an iPhone device are required! The tool supports two-step verification and two-factor authentication (providing that the second authentication factor is accessible at the time of acquisition). In addition, the tool can retrieve pictures that were deleted from iCloud Photo Library more than 30 days ago. iCloud authentication is possible with or without the Apple ID password. Binary authentication tokens obtained from the users computer allow logging into Apple iCloud without a password, downloading iCloud photos, files and backups. GPU-accelerated acquisition extracts information from password-protected backups and recovers the original passwords. By obtaining FileVault 2 recovery keys from the users Apple account, Elcomsoft Phone Breaker can instantly unlock and mount encrypted FileVault 2 volumes. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker is the first GPU-accelerated tool to recover plain-text iOS backup passwords, and remains the only tool to decrypt the keychain. ElcomSoft's patented GPU acceleration helps unlock password-protected backups 50 to 200 times faster compared to using a CPU alone. The GPU acceleration technology supports unlimited numbers of AMD and NVIDIA boards. Price",
