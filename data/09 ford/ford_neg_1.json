      "text": "Krukow 'stunned, overwhelmed' as Ford C. Frick Award finalist Krukow 'stunned, overwhelmed' as Ford C. Frick Award finalist By CSN Bay Area staff November 07, 2016 7:22 PM \nGiants color commentator Mike Krukow was named one of eight finalists for the 2017 Ford C. Frick Award on Monday. \nThe Baseball Hall of Fame recognizes the award as someone who symbolizes \"commitment to excellence, quality of broadcasting abilities, reverence within the game, popularity with fans, and recognition by peers.\" Krukow was in awe Monday of the honor as he paid homage to his Giants partners. \n\"I’m kind of stunned,” Krukow told the San Francisco Chronicle . “I’m the fourth-best guy on our broadcast team and here I am getting nominated for the Hall of Fame. It’s kind of unbelievable, honestly.” \nThis is not Krukow's first year on the ballot. He was nominated for the award in 2013, along with television partner Duane Kuiper. Neither had seen their names on the list since, until Krukow on Monday. \n“I’m overwhelmed,” Krukow said. “I thought when Kuip was nominated the last time, I thought it would be a progression and he would be nominated again and again.\" \nAnother one of Krukow's partners, Jon Miller, won the award in 2010. Giants broadcasters Russ Hodges (1980) and Lon Simmons (2004) were also honored with the award. \nThe 64-year-old Krukow has spent 26 years as a Giants broadcaster. His 14-year career as a major league pitcher ended with the Giants after the 1989 season. Krukow spent seven seasons with the Giants, and was named and All-Star with the team in 1986. \nThe other seven finalists for the award are Gary Cohen, Jacques Doucet, Ken Harrelson, Pat Hughes, Ned Martin and Dewayne Staats. The winner will be crowned on Dec. 7 during the Baseball Winter Meetings. 10 players receive $17.2M qualifying offer 10 players receive $17.2M qualifying offer By Associated Press November 07, 2016 5:26 PM \nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Toronto sluggers Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion, and New York Mets outfielder Yoenis Cespedes and second baseman Neil Walker were among 10 players to receive $17.2 million qualifying offers from their teams Monday as general managers gathered for their annual meeting. \nChicago Cubs outfielder Dexter Fowler and Los Angeles Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen and third baseman Justin Turner also received the offers, as did major league home run leader Mark Trumbo of Baltimore. Texas outfielder Ian Desmond and Philadelphia pitcher Jeremy Hellickson got offers, too. \nPlayers have until Nov. 14 to accept. For players who don't and sign elsewhere, their new team loses a high selection in next June's amateur draft and their old club gets an extra pick after the first round. \nTwenty players received qualifying offers last year, when the amount was $15.8 million. Baltimore catcher Matt Wieters, Houston outfielder Colby Rasmus and Colorado right-hander Chad Qualls were the only ones to accept. Dodgers finalize trade with Mariners, get lefty pitcher for Ruiz Dodgers finalize trade with Mariners, get lefty pitcher for Ruiz By Associated Press November 07, 2016 4:01 PM \nSEATTLE -- The Seattle Mariners have picked up needed depth at catcher after acquiring Carlos Ruiz from the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for left-handed pitcher Vidal Nuno on Monday at the start of the general manager meetings. \n\"First and foremost, Carlos brings us a veteran presence with outstanding leadership qualities and a winning pedigree,\" Seattle general manager Jerry Dipoto said in a statement. \"His combination of strong on-base skills, situational awareness and game-calling ability are a welcome addition to the Mariners.\" \nAs part of the trade, the Mariners exercised the option on Ruiz for the 2017 season worth $4.5 million. \nThe acquisition of Ruiz fills an immediate need for Seattle after the Mariners declined the option on Chris Iannetta for 2017. Ruiz, who will turn 38 before the start of next season, hit .264 with three home runs and 15 RBIs in 62 games last season with the Phillies and Dodgers. Ruiz was traded from Philadelphia to Los Angeles in August. \nRuiz also gives Seattle three options behind the plate heading into spring training along with Mike Zunino and Jesus Sucre . Zunino started last season at Triple-A but became Seattle's primary catcher for the second half of the season, appearing in 53 of the final 67 games of the season. Zunino hit .207 with 12 home runs and 31 RBIs. \nNuno appeared in a career-high 55 games last season for Seattle, with one start, and was 1-1 with a 3.53 ERA. Nuno has been used as both a starter and reliever in his time with the Mariners. Nuno was acquired from Arizona during the 2015 season and has appeared in 126 career games with 42 starts.",

      "text": "* Centre to develop new products and provide business services * To hire 3,000 people to fully staff 12,000-employee facility (Adds details of plan, background) By Abhirup Roy MUMBAI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is investing 13 billion rupees ($195 million) over the next five years in a technology and business centre in the Indian city of Chennai to develop new products, design mobility solutions and provide business services. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, which has already invested over $2 billion in India till date, will hire 3,000 people and bring in 9,000 from other centres in the southern Indian city to staff the facility which will be operational by early 2019, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Ford is focusing on emerging markets like India where small, inexpensive yet powerful cars are popular and which is dominated by brands from Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co. The centre will be the car maker's second-largest technology setup outside its global headquarters, and will include laboratories and testing facilities for vehicles and components, to enable Ford to test future products in India. With India expected to become the world's third-largest market by 2020, according to IHS Automotive, global car makers want a bigger share of the pie. \"India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,\" Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford, said in the statement. The new centre will also include teams working on advanced financial analysis and future data analytics, the company said.

We are announcing new investments today. This will serve as a hub and the new campus will be environment friendly,\" he said. \n\"This new centre will help us attract the best and brightest and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world,\" Ford said. \nThe first phase of the new campus is likely to be completed by March 2019, he said. \nThe Global Technology and BusinessCenter in Chennai will become Ford's third global product development in Asia Pacific and will be part of Ford's global product development network. \nAs well as housing engineering talent, the campus will be home to employees from IT, finance, accounting, data analytics and manufacturing sector. \nThe centre will employ Indian engineers, scientists and skilled workers and feature a range of laboratories and testing facilities. \nFord India witnessed a 25 per cent growth in the domestic market and 40 per cent on the overseas market, Ford Asia Pacific President David Schoch said. \n\"We want to express our deepest gratitude to the Tamil Nadu government and Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa for working with Ford over many years to make this vision a reality\", he said. \nImage: A Ford assembly line at its Chennai plant.

Usually, large departments in cities won't allow it but in small towns where there are like 3-5 cops, can individual cops buy marked police cars with their own money and register them under their names if chief says ok or can the chief do it with his other cops?

      "text": "[ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Allison Martell \nTORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian workers at Ford Motor Co voted to approve a new four-year contract with the automaker, the Unifor union said on Sunday, wrapping up months of contract talks. \nThe union said in a release that 58 percent voted to approve the deal, but Oakville local president Dave Thomas said only 45 percent of members at his unit supported the agreement. \n\"Bargaining is always tough, but reaching this contract was no small feat,\" said Chris Taylor, who chaired the union's Ford bargaining committee, in a release. \nTalks kicked off in August between Unifor and General Motors Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ford. Workers approved contracts at GM and Fiat Chrysler in September and October. \nThe labor agreements each promise hundreds of millions in new investment in the automakers' Canadian operations, in some cases contingent on government support. \nThe Ford contract closely resembles the GM and Fiat Chrysler agreements, and covers workers at Ford's Windsor, Ontario, engine plants and some office and warehouse employees in Windsor and Edmonton, Alberta, as well as the Oakville assembly. \nWorkers will get $12,000 in bonus payments over four years, and 2 percent raises in the first and fourth years of the agreement. \nFord has promised to invest C$713 million ($533 million) in its Canadian operations, including C$613 million in Windsor, the union said in a pamphlet distributed ahead of the vote. The investment will update production of a V8 engine and add assembly of a new fuel-efficient motor for large pickup trucks, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Continued... ",

      "text": "[ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Allison Martell \nTORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian workers at Ford Motor Co voted to approve a new four-year contract with the automaker, the Unifor union said on Sunday, wrapping up months of contract talks. \nThe union said in a release that 58 percent voted to approve the deal, but Oakville local president Dave Thomas said only 45 percent of members at his unit supported the agreement. \n\"Bargaining is always tough, but reaching this contract was no small feat,\" said Chris Taylor, who chaired the union's Ford bargaining committee, in a release. \nTalks kicked off in August between Unifor and General Motors Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ford. Workers approved contracts at GM and Fiat Chrysler in September and October. \nThe labor agreements each promise hundreds of millions in new investment in the automakers' Canadian operations, in some cases contingent on government support. \nThe Ford contract closely resembles the GM and Fiat Chrysler agreements, and covers workers at Ford's Windsor, Ontario, engine plants and some office and warehouse employees in Windsor and Edmonton, Alberta, as well as the Oakville assembly. \nWorkers will get $12,000 in bonus payments over four years, and 2 percent raises in the first and fourth years of the agreement. \nFord has promised to invest C$713 million ($533 million) in its Canadian operations, including C$613 million in Windsor, the union said in a pamphlet distributed ahead of the vote.

      "text": "Pinterest Email \nThe latest version of Ford's popular dune-jumping off-roader, the 2017 F-150 Raptor , is about ready to hit the street. Ahead of its actual release, Ford threw a configurator on its website to help you see your dream Raptor before you lay down the cash. Or, if you’re like us, you’ll just spend hours building about every Raptor possible and argue about options with your friends. \nWhile we’ll happily tack on every option to see how expensive we can make Ford’s off-road beast, our ideal Raptor is closer to stock. We’ll forgo the color-accented leather seats if that means a few thousand bucks back for trail fees. We would tack on the optional loading ramps, mostly because we've used them on an F-150 before and found the price is worth the extra convenience. \nAs for total option packages, the 800A pack seems to be perfect for us: 3.5-liter Ecoboost V6, Fox Racing shocks and the hopefully-easy-to-wash cloth seats. Bumping up to the more expensive 801A pack nets you leather seats, some extra USB ports and Sync 3 to the tune of $3,158. Going even further to the $9,345 802A option loads your Raptor up with all the amenities and accouterment of a luxe pickup, which might be worth it if your Raptor does more than weekend toy duty. The optional bead lock wheels look cool, but so do the stock Raptor wheels. The graphic packages and carbon fiber packages might be cool to some, but they won’t grace our truck.",

      "text": "Ford Expects Brazilian Economic Reform to Boost Vehicle Sales November 08, 2016, 08:55:  By Rogerio Jelmayer \nSAO PAULO--U.S.-based auto maker Ford Motor Co. expects upcoming economic reform in Brazil to improve vehicle sales in Latin America's largest economy, the company's South America President Lyle Watters said on Tuesday. \nCar sales in general are down as the country goes through its worst recession on record. But signs of a slow recovery are giving hopes the 2017 could be better for car sales, Mr. Watters said. \nIn the first ten months of this year, Ford sold 133,909 passenger cars in Brazil, down 34% from the year-ago period, according to Brazilian car makers association Anfavea. The company has four factories and 11,500 employees in Brazil. \nA combination of recession, unemployment and high borrowing costs is depressing car sales. Brazil's economy contracted 3.8% last year and is forecast by economists to shrink around 3.2% this year, while unemployment is at 11%, up from 4.8% in 2014. The average interest rate in an auto loan is 26%, according to the central bank. \nBrazil's auto industry sold 1.67 million cars, light vehicles, trucks and buses this year through October, a 22% drop from the same period in 2015, according to Anfavea. \nThe government is pushing for legislation that would cap public spending as a way to plug a widening budget deficit, on hopes this could improve business confidence and jumpstart the economy. Other measures, including an overhaul in social-security and labor laws are also in the pipeline. \n\"I expect certain reforms taking place in Brazil in 2017 to pave the way for growth in the future,\" Mr. Watters said. \nWrite to Rogerio Jelmayer at rogerio.jelmayer@wsj.com  160855ET  ",

      "text": "Bengt Halvorson Deputy Editor \nLike Dodge Durango itself, its closest competitors, Ford's Explorer, the Toyota 4Runner and Nissan's Pathfinder, have all gone to a crossover setup. Shoppers might also compare the Durango to the GMC Acadia and Jeep Grand Cherokee. \nThose with towing and hauling needs, however, will be hard-pressed to find an alternative to Durango's rear-wheel-drive in this class. Bonus? There's an optional 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. \nThe Durango is a mid- to large-size SUV with seating for seven across three rows. In 2011, the Durango ditched its truck-derived architecture for unibody crossover underpinnings related to the Jeep Grand Cherokee, and to a lesser extent, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class SUV—one of the last ties to the old Daimler-Chrysler \"merger.\" \nMORE: Read our 2017 Dodge Durango review \nThe Durango was originally introduced in 1998. Those first-generation models were relatively simple, truck-based SUVs with underpinnings and styling borrowed directly from the Dakota pickup, and they didn’t make much effort to hide their truck roots. Models with V-8s under the hood—either the 5.2-liter or 5.9-liter—were more popular than those with the wheezy, slow-revving base engine, a 3.9-liter V-6. A 4.7-liter V-8 later joined the lineup and offered somewhat better gas mileage. \nOverall, these first-generation versions of the Durango could be quite luxuriously equipped—and they offered a pretty pleasant ride considering their truck underpinnings—but these models had somewhat clumsy handling and roadholding. In an early drive of this Durango we noted that Dodge had promoted the model as “Not too big, not too little, but just right,” and we pronounced that “despite the same story line, the 1998 Durango is no fairy tale.” \nIn 2004, Dodge delivered what the market might have been hungrier for had it come out in 1998: a true full-size SUV. Arriving at a time when Americans were just starting to fizzle out on the most monstrous of SUVs, this Durango’s timing was unfortunate. The 2004 Durango, as the new Dakota that came out around that time, had much more in common with the larger Ram and rode on a new coil-spring rear suspension with a Watts linkage—which greatly improved handling over rough surfaces, even though it was larger and heavier than its predecessor. \nWhen introduced, this generation of Durangos was offered with a 210-hp, 3.7-liter V-6 or a choice of V-8s: a 4.7-liter worth 230 hp and a 5.7-liter HEMI that made 330 hp; six-cylinder models used a four-speed automatic transmission, while the V-8 models received a five-speed. There was also a choice of rear-drive, four-wheel drive with a low-range, and an automatic all-wheel-drive system. \nFor 2007, the Durango got a slight refresh, then for 2008, both V-8 engines in the Durango got more power—303 hp for the 4.7-liter and 376 hp for the 5.7-liter. And that was much-welcomed; for all of these second-generation model years, we found the 5,000-plus-pound Durango to feel heavy and a bit sluggish—even with its V-8 engines. But tow ratings we impressive (up to 8,500 pounds), and toward the end of its run (around 2008) Dodge introduced more tech and entertainment features—such as the MyGig infotainment system, which was pretty advanced for its time. \nEPA ratings for some of these models landed in the low teens, and we saw single-digit mpg figures in a couple of drives of the earlier HEMI versions. A few 2009 Dodge Durango Hybrid models are out there—reviews noted reasonably improved performance and much-improved fuel economy—but the model was costly and a hard sell, and eventually fell victim to Chrysler's bankruptcy. \nThe new Dodge Durango \nAfter a one-year hiatus for the badge, the current-generation version of the Durango was introduced for 2011. Even though it’s not all that much smaller than the version it replaces, it’s worlds apart. With a newfound focus toward on-the-road performance—as well as fantastic refinement and a warm, top-notch interior including conveniences like adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors, push-button start, a heated steering wheel, and Sirius Backseat TV—the 2011 Durango took after German luxury SUVs without completely turning its back on ruggedness and towing. Powertrains include a V-6 that shoppers no longer need shy away from—a 290-hp version of Chrysler’s 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6—along with a snarly 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. \nSharing its underpinnings with the Jeep Grand Cherokee and owing some of its engineering influence to former Chrysler owner Daimler (you can see it in some of the details and interior packaging), the latest Durango shares its mechanicals with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, but is longer to allow a third row of seating. The current Mercedes M- and GL-Class SUVs are built on the same architecture as the Grand Cherokee and Durango. \nDodge made just a few but significant changes to the Durango lineup for 2013. Second-row captain's chair availability was opened up to all models and leather upholstery became standard across the board as well. A new Rallye appearance package borrowed the R/T's looks for V-6 models. Safety tech got a boost with the addition of a blind-spot monitoring system and cross-path detection that gets activated when the vehicle is reversing—great for parking lots. \nFor the 2014 model year , the Durango adopted a version of the new ZF eight-speed automatic now found in the Ram 1500 and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. On the outside, the Durango got projector-beam headlamps plus hockey-stick-shaped LED running lamps on all but the base SXT. Top R/T and Citadel models got HID headlamps, while projector fog lamps and the slimmer new textured crosshair grille, in combination with a sculpted hood and lower front fascia, made the Durango look brawnier. New wheel designs, including a Hyper Black finish, helped punctuate the look, but it's in back where the Durango's look changed most. LED racetrack lighting, as seen on the Dodge Dart, formed a ribbon of light across the tail, with 192 individual lamps in all. \nInside, the instrument panel was reshaped and redesigned, so as to fit right in alongside the recently refreshed Dodge Charger, and new five-inch or 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreens are housed in the center stack; the Durango also got a new SD card slot, USB outlet, and aux input, with a redesigned media storage bin. As in the Dodge Dart, the Durango added a seven-inch configurable digital gauge to customize info displays. \nFor 2015, the Durango got wider availability of the Rally and Blacktop appearance packages, newly available red Nappa leather seating, and a Beats by Dre sound system as a new option. \nFor 2017, the Durango comes in SXT, GT, R/T, and Citadel trims. The GT takes the place of the former Limited. Otherwise, a new Citadel trim package gets Nappa leather an a wrapped instrument panel; there's a trailer view for the rearview camera; and standard 5-passenger seating on the Durango SXT, with an option for a third-row seat.",

      "text": "Ford Motor Co., as it seeks to expand mobility offerings, said Tuesday it will invest $195 million into a new global technology and business center in Chennai, India. (Photo: Chris O'Meara / Associated Press) \nFord Motor Co., as it seeks to expand mobility offerings, said Tuesday it will invest $195 million into a new global technology and business center in Chennai, India.\nThe Dearborn-based automaker said the center will serve as a base for product development, mobility offerings and services for India and other global markets. The move comes as the India car market is expected to grow to become the third largest by 2020.\nThe carmaker will add 3,000 employees in Chennai over the next five years to staff the facility that ultimately will house 12,000 people, its second highest employment center behind Dearborn. Ford plans to move 9,000 employees from six facilities in Chennai onto the 28-acre campus, expected to open in early 2019.\n“India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,” Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford, who was in India for the announcement, said in a statement. “This new center will help us attract the best and brightest, and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world.”\nThe environmentally friendly designed center will become Ford’s third global product development center in the Asia Pacific region. The campus also will house employees working in information technology, accounting, data and manufacturing. It will include labs to test future vehicles in India.\nFord said the India center will be the second-largest information technology group outside its headquarters and employees there will “drive innovative ideas for Ford’s emerging business models in mobility, analytics and connected vehicles.”\nFord has spent more than $2 billion since its entry into the Indian market in 1995 to expand manufacturing and sales and service. The company also has used India as a center to make small cars and engines and exports them to other global countries.\nmburden@detroitnews.com \n(313) 222-2319",

      "text": "Tweet \nSome California tuners are in hot water with Ford after bringing a custom Mustang to SEMA that intentionally looks like the blue oval’s flagship supercar. \nThat, Michigan’s historic Willow Run factory may be paving the way for the automotive future, Volkswagen is being sued by yet another state, and VW’s chairman is getting back up on the hook as German prosecutors place him back under the microscope… after the break! \nCalifornia tuners may face legal action from Ford \nCalifornia’s Zero to 60 Design couldn’t have made their Mustang GTT’s flagrant emulation of the Ford GT’s styling cues more apparent if they tried. It’s also one letter away from being named the “Mustang GT-GT.” It’s possible that Zero to 60 had that name on its “maybe” list, but decided on GTT to avoid litigation. \nWell, they might be getting sued anyway. \n“We’re aware of the Zero to 60 Designs Mustang ‘GTT,'” a Ford spokesman told Carscoops . “Mustang and GT feature important design elements that uniquely and individually identify both as Ford Performance vehicles. Ford’s legal counsel is investigating how best to address the matter.” \nWhen asked to clarify whether Ford had taken legal actions against Zero to 60 Design, the spokesperson said, “All I know is that Ford’s legal team are aware and investigating”. \nWhile not identical, the Mustang GTT mimics the supercar about as well as bodywork alone can manage. The massive lipped grille and twin hood openings are particularly similar to the GT. Round taillights have also been added, along with a large rear diffuser, center mounted exhaust ports, and other familiar bits and bobs. The concept GTT’s logo on the company’s own website is even identical to the typeface Ford uses. \nZero to 60 Designs may consider the car a nod to Ford’s GT, but it’s not a subtle one. \nMichigan’s historic Willow Run sold for driverless testing \nSince 2010, Willow Run has been 335 acres of classic Michigan industrial abandonment. Now, the historic site that produced Ford-made heavy bombers and decades of transmissions from General Motors may start paving the way for the future. \nThe Detroit News is reporting that the old powertrain factory has finally been purchased by developers of the proposed American Center for Mobility, at a cost of $1.2 million. \nThe center hopes to start construction later this year and anticipates opening for business in December 2017. Based on earlier reports, the site should offer complexity surpassing the University of Michigan’s autonomous testing course — Mcity. \n“The American Center for Mobility will be the most advanced connected and automated vehicle proving ground in the world,” said John Maddox, president and CEO. \nThe initial proposals for the course included a high-speed loop and complex track sections that included tunnels, bridges, traffic stops, multi-block city streets, and suburban cul-de-sacs. The site would be made for use by private industry in addition to government and academic outlets. Maddox also wants Willow Run to serve as a technology hub, permitting companies to rent offices and garage space. \nWhile the Michigan Strategic Fund has already spent $20 million for the proposed overhaul of the site, the project needs to secure additional funding to meet its estimated $80 million goal. \nAnother state sues Volkswagen \nIllinois is the next state to sue Volkswagen over the environmental impact of the ongoing emissions cheating scandal, according to the Chicago Tribune . \nThe lawsuit, filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, alleges “unauthorized impairment of vehicle air pollution control systems.” \n“By installing defeat devices in the unlawful vehicles, VW rendered inoperative those vehicles’ air pollution control systems,” the lawsuit states, adding that the process violates Illinois Pollution Control Board regulations. The lawsuit was provided by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s office. \nThe Chicago Tribune writes: \nThe lawsuit said there are more (than) 19,000 affected vehicles in Illinois. \nMadigan is asking the court to, among other things, assess a penalty of up to $50,000 for each violation of a regulation deeming it unlawful for any person to cause an air-pollution control system to be inoperative, and an additional penalty of up to $10,000 for each day of each violation. \nVolkswagen has already agreed to spend roughly $10 billion on consumer restitution and vehicle buybacks, $2.7 billion to help offset the impact of the excess emissions, and $2 billion more to promote clean cars. A VW spokesperson said the company “will review Illinois’ complaint and respond appropriately.” \nVW’s chairman Pötsch is now under scrutiny for market manipulation \nBloomberg is reporting that Volkswagen Group Chairman Hans Dieter Pötsch has become directly involved in the diesel-emissions scandal investigations. \nBloomberg writes: \nGerman prosecutors said they had enough evidence to name (Pötsch) as the third suspect in a probe into whether Volkswagen was too slow to inform the market about the cheating. The automaker stood by the executive, who was CFO when the crisis unfolded, saying that management complied with German law and that (Pötsch) will continue to cooperate with the investigation, while the families controlling VW said they continue to back him. \nPötsch came to chair Volkswagen before the emissions cheating scandal became public knowledge. Initially able to avoid coming under scrutiny, things gradually changed for the long-time VW executive: \nJust two days before the annual shareholder gathering that confirmed Poetsch in the chairman post, prosecutors opened their initial market-manipulation probe. At the time, they named Winterkorn and VW brand chief Herbert Diess and made a point of saying Pötsch was not one of the executives under investigation. \nBrunswick prosecutors since then have interviewed more witnesses and analyzed additional information to conclude that the probe could be extended to Pötsch , Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the prosecutors, said on Monday. \n[Images: Zero to 60 Designs, Volkswagen Group]",

      "text": "1 min ago by Mark Kane 0 Comments \nFord presents three finalists of its Last Mile Mobility Challenge , which attracted 633 proposals from Ford employees around the world. \nThe top three proposals (all with electric drive) are: Ford Carr-E Ford TriCiti Ford eChair \nThe common denominator of projects is an innovative personal transportation system designed to fit neatly into the trunk. Carr-E \n“Carr-E – created by Kilian Vas, a Ford systems engineer based in Cologne, Germany – is among 633 proposals for personal mobility solutions submitted by Ford employees as part of the company’s Last Mile Mobility Challenge. The competition challenges employees to develop electric personal assistant devices to make transportation better in areas where vehicles are not permitted or practical – helping commuters reach their destination. \nCarr-E can transport people or objects up to 260 pounds, has a range of 14 miles and a top speed of 11 mph .” \n“The four-wheeled device is designed to complement the use of a vehicle and support commuters along the final part of their journey. \nIt can also be used to transport heavy objects. Users simply place an object on Carr-E and it will follow an electronic transmitter they keep in their possession.” \nKilian Vas said: \n“We really need to reinvent the wheel, to find new approaches to mobility. When developing Carr-E, I was inspired by Ford’s expansion into both an auto and a mobility company, but I’m also aware of how rapidly cities are growing and how getting around urban areas will become more complicated. I really wanted to create a device that makes commuting easier and more fun.” Ford Carr-E TriCiti – a folding electric tricycle that can be easily adapted into a shopping cart, dolly or golf cart Ford TriCiti \n“TriCiti, developed by James Neugebauer, Torsten Gerhardt and Robert Spahl – all working in vehicle architecture for Ford of Europe – is designed to be both a rideable device and all-purpose carrying assistant. \nThe foldable machine can be adapted to carry shopping items and even golf bags, and can easily be taken onto public transportation or stored in a vehicle. \nTriCiti has a range of 19 miles and a top speed of 12 mph.” Ford TriCiti eChair – n electric wheelchair that can autonomously load itself into a vehicle \n“Gunther Cuypers, Robin Celis and David Longin – engineers at Ford’s Lommel proving grounds in Belgium – developed eChair, a lightweight electric wheelchair with a self-loading solution designed to offer greater independence to people with reduced mobility.” Ford eChair \nWalter Pijls, supervisor, innovation management for mobility, Ford of Europe said: \n“Innovation and disruption is as much at the heart of how our engineers think now as it was when Henry Ford first set about transforming the way we move. Personal assistant devices can help people cover the final mile of their journey quickly and easily, as well as transport heavy objects they might not be able to carry.”",

      "text": "Pinterest Email \nIt looks like there's a new contender for the worst idea for a limo. People are apparently stretching the completely useful Ford F-150 pickup and turning it into the ultimate anti-utility vehicle. This limo appears to be even less common than the Dodge Challenger limousine we saw yesterday , and we're still unsure who does the conversion. \nDiving deeper into the trucks-as-limos world unearthed the most confusing waste of a pick–up: People are turning the first generation of Ford’s dune jumping F-150 Raptor into a stretched party wagon . While we’re all for modifying cars and trucks, turning a Raptor into a limo essentially removes everything that makes the Raptor fun. \nCompared to the Raptor Limo, this standard F-150 limo isn’t that bad. The pickup bed would make for an incredibly convenient hot tub, which could be hiding under that tonneau cover. It doesn’t totally make up for the fact that it should be used for actually hauling things, but it does help it make sense.",

      "text": "Share \nMost of the time, we are firm believers in the idea that classics are classics for a reason and they do not need to be redone. And a part of that is because there is too much risk involved in a redux of something that was, for all intents and purposes, perfect the first time. That being said, sometimes people take those extremely big risks and manage to produce something that pays homage to the original, but still manages to improve upon it. Case in point: the Vicious ’65 Ford Mustang built by Timeless Kustoms . \nConstructed to be the “ultimate road race Mustang,” this badass street vehicle features a coupe-turned-fastback rebuilt shell aboard a racing chassis, together encompassing some truly breathtaking machinery. The V8 engine was taken from a new GT350 and is fitted with twin turbochargers as well as a single supercharger, resulting in an output of 1,000 horsepower. It also features carbon-ceramic disc brakes, independent front and rear suspension, and a paddle-shift system. This one-of-a-kind dream machine was unveiled in Las Vegas at this year’s SEMA show.

      "title": "Place Your Order for the 2017 F-150 Raptor!",
      "text": "Place Your Order for the 2017 F-150 Raptor! 30 SHARES \nThe original Ford F-150 Raptor was (and still is) an absolute beast. Debuting in 2009, the Raptor began life with a standard 5.4-liter, 310 horsepower V-8 while the 6.2-liter, 411 hp engine was a hefty $3000 option. Obviously it wasn’t just the engine power that drew the awe of truck fans, it was the baja-like capability which came in part from the 11” and 12” suspension travel (front and rear respectively). This was a street legal truck that could go almost anywhere and to this day it still has no worthy showroom competitors. For 2017, Ford has upgraded nearly every component and since Friday November 4 the order banks have officially opened. \nThe 2017 F-150 Raptor maintains its king-of-the-hill status by outdoing itself in nearly every category. Was a foot of suspension travel not enough? How about 13” in the front and 14” in the rear? Did you want more driver friendly adjustments so your significant other doesn’t feel jostled when taking it to pick up groceries? Well, Ford added the Terrain Management System with six drive modes including “Baja” for “high-speed desert running” according to the Ford website. Was the poor gas mileage too much to bear even though you were somehow able to shell out 50k for a truck? The twin-turbo V-6 mated to the 10-speed automatic increases power from 411hp/434lb-ft to 450hp/510lb-ft while decreasing consumption from a paltry 11/16mpg (city/hwy) to 15/18mpg. \nSo you have seen the specs and have been following the launch of the truck since day one and now you want to buy it. Well you are definitely not alone as Ford states the Raptor online configurator has seen over 90,000 hits in its first 10 days of operation. And while the MSRP is ONLY $49,520, 91% of configurators add the SuperCrew, 90% opt for the luxury group, and 77% add the technology package. Those options will easily put the consumer near or above the $60,000 mark. \nNow let’s say you have the money and you want to be one of the first in your neighborhood to have a 2017 F-150 Raptor. Well, good luck getting your hands on one. According to the press release , the owner of Team Ford in Las Vegas already has over 300 people on a waiting list. Of course, that is just one dealership but you can bet it will be hard to find across the country. My guess is even if someone can locate a Raptor to buy, it definitely won’t be at MSRP as most dealers love when new vehicles have more demand than initial inventory and gladly them up accordingly. \nAll in all, the 2017 F-150 Raptor is another insane, off-road behemoth Ford has somehow managed to vastly improve on. While it is in high demand, I can see why. Heck, if I could afford it I would love to have one myself! That being said, getting your hands on one now is likely going to be very tough. Trying to find a dealer who will build it to your specs instead of ordering it to price gouge on the showroom floor is going to be even harder. I hope to see some on the road soon, and with that hope is that the owners will take them off-roading to test their capabilities instead of using it to just haul groceries.

      "text": "  1:06 pm Ford has outlined plans to build a new technology center in Chennai, India.The company expects to invest $195 million USD in the facility, which will eventually host 12,000 workers. The campus will serve as a global hub for vehicle development, mobility products and business services.The Blue Oval last year vowed to triple exports from India , investing $1 billion USD in a new manufacturing facility in Gujarat. The plant complements an existing production facility near Chennai. Together, the factories are expected to be capable of producing nearly a half million vehicles annually.Ford suggests the Chennai tech campus will become the company's second largest employment center behind Dearborn.\"India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,\" said Ford executive chairman Bill Ford. \"This new center will help us attract the best and brightest, and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world.\"The company will consolidate 9,000 existing workers in Chennai and hire an additional 3,000 employees over the next five years. The new 28-acre campus is expected to be operational by early 2019. \n ",

Photo: Ethan Miller/Getty Images/AFP \nFord South Africa is preparing to launch the new SYNC 3 infotainment system for several of its models, including the Kuga, Ranger, Everest and Mustang. \nSYNC 3 is of course the upgraded successor to SYNC 2 which already plays a big part in these vehicles. \nIt will start rolling out in selected models from 2017 during a staggered launch approach. \n“SYNC3 brings to life even more innovative new ways of staying connected on the move,” says Tracey Delate, General Manager, Marketing – Ford Motor Company Sub-Saharan Africa Region. \n“Designed to complement modern smartphones, with an intuitive touch screen and an exciting array of new features, SYNC 3 understands even more conversational speech commands, is significantly faster and offers a higher resolution interface that is simpler, and easier to read and use than the outgoing SYNC 2 system.” \nAnchored by a new 20.3cm touch screen, SYNC 3 comes with, among others, features like smart integration that in itself can be synced to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. \nThe Apple system is compatible with Siri Eyes Free, while Android Auto includes Google Search, Google Maps and Google Play Music. \nA cool feature is the pinch-to-zoom and swipe gesture ability that lets you do just that, in the same way as you would on your smart phone. Interestingly Ford says there are three South African official languages that are compatible with SYNC 3, namely Afrikaans, English and isiZulu. IN4RIDE",

Ford opened a technology and research lab in Palo Alto, Calif., in January 2015 with just 15 employees. The lab now employs more than 130 people. That number will double by the end of next year, Ford CEO Mark Fields told Fortune in August.\nWith India expected to become the world’s third-largest market by 2020, according to IHS Automotive, global car makers want a bigger share of the pie.\n“India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,” Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford, said in the statement.\nThe new centre will also include teams working on advanced financial analysis and future data analytics, the company said.",

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday said that it will invest $195 million (Rs1,300 crore) in Chennai to build a global technology and business centre that will serve as a hub for product development, mobility solutions and business services for India and other markets around the world. \nThe centre will also house the company’s largest information technology organization outside of the company’s global headquarters. Mint had in October 2015 first reported about Ford’s plans to set up a global technology and business centre in India.\n“India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,” executive chairman Bill Ford said in a statement. “This new center will help us attract the best and brightest, and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world.” \nOnce it gets completed in 2019, the centre will become Ford’s third global product development centre in Asia Pacific and part of Ford’s global product development network.\n“It also will feature a wide range of laboratories and testing facilities for both full vehicles and components, enabling Ford to conduct extensive testing of future vehicles in India,” the company said in a statement. \nHowever, Tuesday’s announcement is unlikely to help Ford’s India operations immediately and the focus will be more on feeding into the Detroit-based company’s global operations.\nFord in India continues to struggle even after being present in the country for more than 20 years, in which the Indian market has changed drastically.\nIn the six years between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the American car maker’s annual sales in India have grown only twice. \nSales reached the highest at 98,537 units in 2010-11 because of the success of the Figo but they declined to 92,665 units and 77,225 units in 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively. \nSales grew in 2013-14 and fell in 2014-15 only to rise again in 2015-16, albeit on a smaller base. \nDuring the same period, the Indian passenger vehicle market expanded from 2.52 million units to 2.78 million.\nIn recent times, the company’s second generation Figo failed to receive the kind of response that the previous one did. Ford did create a new compact SUV segment with the EcoSport, but it failed to capitalize on the first-mover advantage. The segment is now dominated by market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd. \nFord, along with Volkswagen India Pvt. Ltd, was the last one to enter the sub-four-metre sedan category but demand in the segment has waned, which meant lukewarm response for the American car maker’s Figo Aspire.\nIn pursuit of making its business sustainable, the company has changed tack and shifted focus to exports, which grew 41.37% to 55,821 units between April and September.\nIndia’s overall car exports grew 3.89% to 319,579 units.\nIn the new centre in Chennai, the company will hire 3,000 skilled workers over the next five years. \n“Ford also will consolidate 9,000 employees from six existing facilities in Chennai on the 28-acre campus,” the company said in a statement.\nFord has invested over $2 billion in India to set up two plants, one each in Chennai and Sanand in Gujarat. Together, these plants have the capacity to make 610,000 engines and 440,000 passenger vehicles a year.",

      "text": "8k-Mile 2012 Ford Mustang Boss 302 Bidding Open Ends In: Checking for last second bids ... Advertise on BaT \nThis 2012 Mustang Boss 302 has just 8k miles from new and is powered by the Road Runner variant of the 5.0L Coyote V8 paired to a 6-speed manual gearbox. This example is offered by its original owner and is optioned with Recaro seats and Torsen limited slip differential with a 3.73 final drive. The car is finished in Competition Orange with black C-stripes, and is number 694 of 3,250 standard Boss 302s produced in 2012. It suffered some rear-end damage in 2013, but was repaired to factory specifications by a reputable body shop. The car is located in Waterford VA and is offered with its original window sticker and a Virginia title. \nWhen the car was just over two years old, it was rear ended in rush hour traffic. Damage was sustained to the rear bumper, bumper mounts, exhaust, fuel cassette, and spare wheel well. These items were either replaced or repaired by D&V Autobody in Dulles, Virginia. The car was measured on their laser alignment rack before and after the work was performed, and all repairs were done to Ford specifications, according to the seller. Over the course of its life, the seller claims that car has only seen rain a few times and has never been driven in winter or on roads with salt residue. \nThe 19×9″ and 19×9.5″ spoked wheels are wrapped with Pirelli P-Zero rubber, while braking is handled by Brembo calipers. Compared to the GT, the Boss features 5-way adjustable shocks, stiffer springs, increased diameter sway bars, and revised bushings. Tire wear is indicated in the gallery below. \nThe owner notes that the Recaro seating surfaces and contact points show little use, in line with a garaged vehicle of this mileage. Traction control and steering assist are adjustable via dash switches. Included with the sale is a Ford Track-key, which when used engages a number of track specific features and alters various engine parameters, including but not limited to, cam timing, fuel and ignition maps, engine braking and throttle response. \nThe Road Runner variation of the Coyote 5.0L DOHC V8 features a few performance oriented modifications and produced 32 horsepower more the standard engine found in the GT. Ford claims that this was achieved with a different intake manifold, CNC ported cylinder heads, higher lift cam, and larger valves. Oil starvation in heavy cornering is kept at bay with a baffled 8.5″ quart oil pan. The owner has personally handled all oil services annually, always using Motorcraft or Mobil 1 oil. The car is currently on its sixth oil change. \nThe solid axle came optioned with a Torsen limited slip differential and 3.73 gearing. \nThe Boss has been to the dealer three times, once for the Track-key update, another time for an emissions inspection, and most recently for the airbag recall. Included with the sale is the original window sticker, invoices, a certificate of authenticity, and a Ford Welcome Kit. The seller notes that transmission, differential, and brake fluids will be changed for the new owner. \nThe included Carfax shows one owner, the dealer visits, the airbag recall, and the 2013 accident.

      "text": "Mark Cuban revokes credentials from two ESPN reporters for no good reason The Baseball Hall of Fame has announced the MLB announcers who are the finalists for the Ford C. Frick Award. The award is given for excellence in baseball announcing and this year, the finalists include Gary Cohen, the beloved television voice of the New York Mets, Mike Krukow, TV voice of the San Francisco Giants, Pat Hughes, radio voice of the Chicago Cubs, DeWayne Staats of the Tampa Bay Rays, and Hawk Harrelson, the long-time voice of the Chicago White Sox.\nOther finalists include Jacques Doucet who called the Montreal Expos in French, the late Bill King, the long-time voice of the Oakland A’s and the late Ned Martin, the Boston Red Sox announcer on both TV and radio from 1961-92. \nThere are many good choices and for fans of the Cubs, Giants, Mets and Rays, they have to come to know their voices quite well, having either watched or listened to the games they’ve called. \nBut the most intriguing case is Hawk Harrelson. While he first began his career with the Boston Red Sox in 1975, he’s best known for calling White Sox games for 26 years. There’s no doubt that he wears the White Sox on his sleeve and his calls have reflected that whether it’s documenting a blown lead , going crazy over a walk-off home run, or making sense of a bench-clearing brawl. \nSome announcing purists who want their announcers totally objective could have an argument about Hawk’s inclusion here, but if you listen to Gary Cohen’s calls for the Mets and Hughes on the Cubs Radio Network, they’ll be fair, but also be happier when the team wins rather than not. \nHawk Talk has been a staple on the White Sox broadcasts for many years and while he’s cut back on his schedule to only call road games on Comcast SportsNet Chicago or WGN, having Harrelson not in the booth would be like not having sand at the beach. \nIt would be rather interesting to see Harrelson accepting the Frick Award at Cooperstown next summer. \n[ MLB.com ] About Ken Fang Ken has been covering the sports media in earnest at his own site, Fang's Bites since May 2007 and at Awful Announcing since March 2013. He provides a unique perspective having been an award-winning radio news reporter in Providence and having worked in local television. Fang celebrates the three Boston Red Sox World Championships in the 21st Century, but continues to be a long-suffering Cleveland Browns fan.",

      "text": "Ford's super athleticism on full display with Baldwin football team Baldwin's Glenn Ford. Photo by prints charming photography | for the tribune-review   4:27 p.m. Top high school sports \nSign up for one of our email newsletters. Updated 44 minutes ago Glenn Ford, the renowned actor from Hollywood's Golden Era, had a role in the 1978 movie “Superman.” Glenn Ford, a senior at Baldwin, served as “Superman” on the Fighting Highlanders' football team this season. Ford manned five different positions, including wide receiver, quarterback and defensive back. He also was a kickoff and punt returner. He led the team in rushing, with 399 yards and seven touchdowns on a team-high 103 carries; and defensively, with 44 tackles (31 unassisted), seven interceptions and four pass breakups. His seven interceptions ranked at the top of the WPIAL leader board. “I like playing strong safety because I can hit people and help other players (on defense),” Ford said. “But I also like quarterback because I'm athletic, so I can throw, run and score.” Ford ended up second on the squad in passing, completing 29 of 85 tosses for 436 yards and two scores; and third in receiving, with 13 catches for 208 yards and one score. He averaged 23.1 yards per catch. “I started (the season) as a wideout/slot and got moved to quarterback due to an injury,” Ford said, “and I feel like it helped the team build some confidence.” Ford finished atop the team's all-purpose yardage list with an average of 93.9 yards per game, and led the team in scoring with eight touchdowns, good for 48 points. “We faced a high number of challenges with injuries and lack of depth,” Pete Wagner, Baldwin's coach, said. “This is the second year in a row that we lost our quarterback for an extensive period of time. Once an injury of that magnitude occurs, some players get shuffled around and you do your best as a staff and a team to overcome those obstacles. “Glenn is one of the players that moved around and was asked to do more. We tried to utilize his athleticism to create some opportunities.” Ford, who transferred from Carrick prior to his junior season, finished with 21 receptions for 291 yards and two scores in his two years at Baldwin. Ford has a 3.5 grade-point average, and said he hopes to continue his football career at the next level. “I have a lot of good memories in high school and especially my senior year,” he said. “but one from this year would be our seven-on-seven tournament in the preseason at Cal U. Our team began building chemistry and interacted with each other to make us closer.” Baldwin ended up 1-7 in the Allegheny Nine Conference and 2-7 overall. “Our program works very hard, but we still need to find a way to get it done regardless of the circumstances at hand,” Wagner said. “Our senior group worked their tails off the past four years, and our program is appreciative of their efforts.” Senior David Johnston led the squad in receiving with 20 catches for 281 yards and two touchdowns. He was followed in the receiving department by sophomore Andrejs Howell, with 17 catches for 340 yards and one touchdown. Howell averaged 20 yards per catch. Other pass-catches on the team included Delaun Samuels, Aaron Novak, Brody McLean, Josh Denardo, Amir Muhammad, Eli Currie and Jake Kemerer. Junior QB Jeremy Jenkins played in four games, completing 34 of 71 passes for 449 yards and four touchdowns. Jake Monroe, a senior kicking specialist, booted four field goals and split the uprights on 15 of 17 PAT kicks. Defensively, the Fighting Highlanders were led in tackles by Ford, Denardo, McLean, Noah Bartic and Elyon Phiri. They were complemented by Tyler Morgele, Currie, Howell, Eli Geary, Johnston, Novak, Samuels, Anthony Reid, Muhammad, Artie Priore, Harrison Merlo and Kemerer.

      "text": "The Escape is a cash calf for Ford as its biggest seller next to the F-Series pickup trucks, its cash cow.\nSo it's no wonder why Ford keeps its compact-class Escape updated and with access to a range of advanced safety and driver-aid technologies. It brought out a freshened 2017 Escape with some customer-derived tweaks and improvements and another layer of technologies.\nThe redesigned hood and raised grille set a wider stance and were intended to give a more confident and rugged stance. Inside, the gear shifter was moved rearward for an easier reach to climate-control buttons. And a charging bin was added in front of the shifter, with a USB port and 12-volt plug. The cup holders were repositioned, and there is a longer driver's armrest, along with a push-button parking brake.\n\"Virtually every surface a customer will touch is new, in design or material,\" said Chris Mazur, Escape program manager. \"In some cases, it's the minor changes that have the greatest impact on driver or passenger comfort.\"\nThe Escape is sold in four trim levels. It comes with front- or four-wheel drive, a choice of three four-cylinder engines and a six-speed automatic transmission. Starting prices range from $24,495 to $29,995 for the top-line Titanium 4WD; pricing includes the freight charge from Louisville, Kentucky. There's also a $1,750 customer incentive for some models if bought before Jan. 3.\nToday's tester is a midrange front-wheel-drive SE Sport. The Sport package ($1,295) adds black painted wheels, black exterior trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, and leather and fabric seat upholstery. The tech package ($1,395) adds blind-spot detection, a reverse sensing system, Sync 3 connect and black roof rails. With the power liftgate ($495), panoramic vista roof ($1,495) and voice-activated navigation touch screen, the sticker is $31,470 (not including the incentive).\nThe base engine is a 165-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder with fuel economy ratings of 21 mpg city, 29 highway and 24 mpg combined. The step-up engine is a turbocharged and direct-injection 179-horsepower 1.5-liter that gets 23/30/26 mpg on 87 octane. To stretch fuel economy, this engine integrates active grille shutters (to maximize aerodynamics) and automatic stop-start during idling. I was averaging just 23.5 mpg over more than 200 miles.\nThe power is adequate and focused on fuel efficiency, but I switched frequently to \"sport\" mode to sharpen acceleration and help hold my line in the commute. For my driving style, I'd most likely prefer the 245-horsepower twin-scroll turbocharged and direct-injected 2-liter. Its mileage ratings drop 1 mpg from the 1.5, but the engine might not work so hard to get the mass moving, even if it does require premium fuel.\nThe six-speed is a good match for the power and gives steady performance with the turbocharged engine. (It's a much more responsive powertrain than the turbocharged 1.6-liter and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in the Hyundai Tucson, a direct competitor.)\nThe ride quality can be trucky (stiff), with wobbly head-toss when turning into angled driveways. There is some tire noise at highway speeds, as well as road harshness transmitted through the floor. All models have four-wheel disc brakes, but the 2-liter and 1.5-liter all-wheel-drive models get the larger 12.6-inch vented front discs, compared with 11.8 inches for front-wheel-drive models. Rear discs are 12.4 inches. The tester's braking seemed adequate and not over-engineered.\nThe Escape interior is roomy, with tall headroom of almost 40 inches without the vista roof and long legroom at 43.1 inches.\nSightlines over the hood feel somewhat cloistered by a large upper dashboard and windshield pillars that arc inward at the base. And the rising exterior beltline constricts over-the-shoulder views. But the large rearview camera mitigates backing issues, and correct placement of side and rearview mirrors solves lane-change concerns. The turning circle of 38.8 feet is on the wide side.\nThe driver's area is smartly organized and ergonomic to help keep eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. Seat support is quite good, with side bolsters that actually enhance comfort but do not interfere with entry or exit. The SE has a 10-way power driver's seat, but the front passenger gets no height adjustment.\nConnectivity is quick and painless with Ford's Sync 3 infotainment system, which is now integrated with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\nFour large front vents (air conditioning/heat) have triple flow adjusters and broad coverage that manages to avoid freezing the fingers on the steering wheel. Broad sliding visors have good coverage, with lighted and covered mirrors.\nThere are plenty of useful storage areas and a couple of clever features. The glove compartment door, for one, is angled to allow an easy reach for the driver -- and the space is large. And something I've not seen before is a side pocket on the upper left side of the front passenger seat. It is innovative -- but I'm not sure how I'd use it.\nBack seat space is more compact than in the front. The seat bottoms are short, and the seatbacks are fairly erect without recline. The floor is flat with a very low center exhaust-transmission hump, which boosts center footroom. Back seat extras include a fold-down armrest, seatback pockets, reading lights, grab handles and bottle holders in the doors.\nThe cargo area is wide and square, with a flat floor when the 60/40 seatback is folded and some basement compartments for storage. There is good bike and board room, with 40 inches of width, about 64 inches of length and 31 1/2 inches of height at the opening.\nThe basic elements of the hardware are well-engineered, but the \"software\" of plastics and other materials has a budget feel and appearance when compared with some of the competitors. The tester, for example, which had been driven 5,629 miles, had frayed edges at the edge of the headliner where it meets the windshield (but it is the same way in my 2008 Ford Escape). Also, the seat fabric was beginning to rumple, and the single-needle stitching looked vulnerable to wear and tear.\nThe tester's options created a well-connected and contemporary car. It's not always elegant or graceful, but it is always eager to please and is tough as nails.\n2017 Ford Escape SE FWD\n--Body style: compact five-seat SUV in front- or all-wheel drive.\n--Engine: 179-horsepower, turbocharged and direct-injection 1.5-liter four-cylinder with auto stop-start at idle; 177 foot-pounds of torque at 2,500 rpm.\n--Transmission: six-speed automatic.\n--Fuel economy: 23 mpg city, 30 highway, 26 mpg combined with 87 octane.\nSPECIFICATIONS\n--Fuel tank: 15.7 gallons.\n--Cargo space: 34-68 cubic feet.\n--Front head/leg/shoulder room: 39.9 (without panoramic roof)/43.1/55.9 inches.\n--Rear head/leg/shoulder room: 39/37.3/55.2 inches.\n--Length/wheelbase: 178.1/105.9 inches.\n--Curb weight: 3,526 pounds.\n--Turning circle: 38.8 feet.\n--Tow capacity: 2,000 pounds.\nFEATURES\n--Standard equipment includes remote locking and SecuriCode keyless access pad on door, electric parking brake, rearview camera, chrome-tip dual exhaust, fog lights, halogen headlights, LED taillights, tinted rear glass, dual (lighted) vanity mirrors, floor mats (both rows), ice-blue ambient interior lighting, 10-way power driver's seat and two USB charging ports.\n--Safety features include seven air bags, roll stability control and curve control.\nPRICING\n--Base price: $25,995, including $895 freight charge.

Superbowl MVP Von Miller commissioned the truck and it was featured on the Velocity Channel's \"The Lifted Life\". \nTruck fans have the chance to bid on a one-of-a-kind supercharged 2013 Ford Raptor SVT. Von Miller, the MVP of the Super Bowl commissioned the truck and it was featured on the television show called “The Lifted Life” on the Velocity Channel. \nMiller worked with Five R Truck, out of Golden, Colorado, on the redesign that was featured on the October 8th edition of The Lifted Life. The truck features a Roush Performance 590- horsepower supercharger, a Magnaflow exhaust and R1 Concepts custom brake rotors. It also features Miller’s number 58, and his autograph on the hood, rims and dashboard. The paint boldly proclaims the truck as the MVP Edition. \nAs of this afternoon, there has been one bid. Bidding started at $50,000 on Ebay. Bidding closes on Friday morning, November 11, 2016. In addition, the top bidder will also receive a meet and greet for two, including airfare and travel, that will take place at Miller’s 2017 Celebrity Go-Kart Grand Prix in Denver. VIP access for the event will also be included. \nThe money raised in the auction will benefit Miller’s charity called Von’s Vision. The charity helps provide needy children in Denver with glasses. Miller, an outside linebacker with the Denver Broncos is known for his glasses and he has said that he feels it is important that he help other children with vision problems. \nThe Denver Broncos released information today about Miller’s annual fundraiser last night. According to the Bronco’s Miller announced that Von’s Vision will be available to help Denver public school students next year. Miller is quoted as saying, “Any child that has any problem with their eye sight, they can just go to their school nurse and receive glasses. It's pretty incredible.” \nMiller was selected as MVP of Superbowl 50 after the Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers. \nThe Ebay auction of the 2013 Ford Raptor SVT continues until Friday, November 11, 2016. More information is available on VonMiller.org.",

      "title": "Zero to 60 Designs launches new logo for GTT to avoid Ford confusion",
      "text": "By : Jake Holmes , Senior Editor Though it’s based on a Ford Mustang, Zero to 60 Designs doesn’t want that name associated with its GTT tuner car. \nCalifornia tuning company Zero to 60 Designs received lots of attention at last week’s SEMA show with its GTT concept car , but some of that attention was unwanted. Ford’s legal team got in touch with the company over the car – though merely questioning the name used, rather than with a cease-and-desist letter. To counter any potential naming confusion, Zero to 60 Designs has revised the car’s logo and reiterated that the car is called the Zero to 60 Designs GTT, not the Ford Mustang GTT. \nThe new GTT logo, seen above, has a plainer, simpler font for its three letters, as opposed to the original logo that used an inset blue line and more closely resembled the logo used by the production Mustang GT sports car . Zero to 60 Designs also hopes to clarify that it has never referred to the car as a “Ford Mustang GTT,” but says confusion came about because many publications – including Motor1 – did use that terminology. \n“With our message of paying homage to both the Ford Mustang GT and the Ford GT, the last thing we at Zero to 60 want to do is get into a confrontation with Ford. It’s rather the opposite,” the company said in a statement. “We picked two of the most inspirational vehicles in the industry and provided our interpretation of it. This new logo rendering represents our Zero to 60 Designs GTT. We learned over the past week that a few of the stories also mislabeled the car as the Mustang GTT and not the Zero to 60 Designs GTT. Those names are entirely different.” \nThe company’s skittishness to avoid a legal scuffle isn’t without precedent. Porsche, for instance, pursued legal action against Californian company Singer Vehicle Design to ensure it was made clear that its modified cars weren’t produced by Singer. The preferred terminology is usually “Porsche 911 reimagined by Singer Vehicle Design.” Zero to 60 Designs is clearly taking pains to ensure it doesn’t enter into a similar legal dispute with Ford. \nSource: Zero to 60 Designs Be part of something big Ford Mustang GTT SEMA Live Hide press release Show press release \nFollowing an incredible 2016 SEMA Show with the launch of the all-new Zero to 60 Designs GTT, with resounding success, this car was one of the most talked about cars in the industry. With this attention, came some questions about the styling of the logo and the resemblance to Ford Motor Company’s current Mustang GT logo. With our message of paying homage to both the Ford Mustang GT and the Ford GT, the last thing we at Zero to 60 want to do is get in to a confrontation with Ford. It’s rather the opposite. We picked two of the most inspirational vehicles in the industry and provided our interpretation of it. This new logo rendering represents our Zero to 60 Designs GTT. We learned over the past week that a few of the stories also mislabeled the car as the Mustang GTT and not the Zero to 60 Designs GTT. Those names are entirely different. About this article",

      "text": "London (AFP) - England fly-half George Ford says there is no chance of him joining father Mike at French big-spenders Toulon.\nMike Ford was appointed head coach of the Top 14 side in place of former Italy international Diego Dominguez in October, after initially joining Toulon as backs coach.\nHe moved to France after being sacked as coach of English Premiership side Bath -- the club George still plays for -- following a poor league season that saw the west country team finish ninth in the 12-strong table.\nHis appointment as head coach of Toulon sparked speculation that father and son could be re-united in France.\nBut that would mean George having to effectively give up his international career because England do not select overseas-based players for Test duty, except in \"exceptional circumstances\".\nIt is a policy that pre-dates Eddie Jones's reign as England coach but one the Australian is determined to uphold.\n\"I don’t know what was going on there last week to be honest,\" Ford, speaking at England's training base on Tuesday, said of the speculation.\n\"It was news to me, anyway,\" added the 23-year-old ahead of England's opening end-of-year international against South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday.\n\"Obviously my dad’s there but I want to play for England so I want to play in England,\" insisted Ford, who has appeared in 26 Tests.\n\"After it all came out I had a quick chat with Eddie and said, 'I don’t know where all that’s come from'.\"\nFord did not rule out playing overseas at a much later stage in his career, saying: \"I think it would be a great life experience playing somewhere like France.\n\"It is a different way of playing and living –- you'd probably see the sun and the beach a lot more... I'll see where I am in a few years’ time.\"\nBut right now Ford's focus in on helping England make it 10 wins out of 10 under Jones when they face the Springboks -- a team they have not beaten since 2006.\nThis weekend's clash is set to see Ford and childhood friend Owen Farrell continue their twin playmaker partnership at fly-half and inside centre respectively.\nA niggling injury that meant Farrell could not kick sidelined him for six weeks at the start of the season.\nBut his return saw the goal-kicker produce a man-of-the-match display as reigning English and European champions Saracens beat Toulon 33-21 on October 15.\n\"I wasn't surprised by Owen's form,\" said Ford. \"He would have been on top of things constantly even if he was not training to his full capacity. He is obsessed with the game.\"\nFarrell is one of three England players on a six-strong shortlist for World Rugby's player of the year award, together with Billy Vunipola and Maro Itoje -- also two of his team-mates at London club Saracens.\nThe winner will be announced on Sunday and Ford said: \"There have been some outstanding performers in the team and those three especially.\n\"Other players could have made it as well.\"",

      "text": "  Derek Markham   Derek Markham In this edition of the clean transport and energy news roundup, we’ve got a few stories about Nissan, an update on the Elon Musk impersonation attempt, electric motorcycles, a hydrogen fuel-cell ferry boat, BYD’s electric vehicles, Ford’s latest ‘last-mile’ clean mobility concept, solar in Hawai’i, solar for mobile and manufactured homes, and more. [ CleanTechnica isn’t the only Important Media site to cover clean energy & transport news, and if you’re looking for more stories on electric mobility, bicycles, solar and wind energy, and other related issues, we’ve got them at sites such as Solar Love , CleanTechies , Planetsave , Bikocity , Gas2 , and EV Obsession . We also host a large cleantech group on LinkedIn , called CleanTechies Around The World .] After years of simply buying hybrid tech from Toyota, Nissan is finally launching its own compact hybrid: Meet the 2017 Nissan Versa Note hybrid e-POWER. Using a 1.2 liter gasoline three-cylinder as a generator for its electric battery, the new Versa Note series hybrid is good for 87.4 MPG . EPA finds Nissan is the most fuel efficient full line auto manufacturer. Former Oil Exec Todd Katz Asks For “Goofy” Elon Musk Impersonation Lawsuit To Be Thrown Out: Katz is now trying to use the amateurish quality of the attempt as his defense, claiming that the lawsuit should be tossed as the email was too “goofy” to be seen as credible . Italy’s EICMA 2016 will feature electric motorcycle reveals: The US has SEMA, where automakers and aftermarket suppliers gather to show off their wildest, craziest new, new things. Italy has EICMA, the Esposizione Internazionale Ciclo Motociclo Accessori, an annual show where motorcycle manufacturers bring their latest creations to present them to the public for the first time. The theme of this year’s EICMA show is “Bikes Never Seen Before.” One of those will be a new electric motorcycle from Energica . Elon Musk tweets that “the new 5 allows the entire back to fold flat. A small family could camp there! ” Ford’s Roomba-like Carr-E concept is “an innovative “Last Mile” concept”: Kilian Vas, a Ford systems engineer in Cologne, Germany was one of 633 people who submitted proposals for personal mobility solutions as part of the company’s Last Mile Mobility Challenge. His proposal is called the Carr-E . It looks like a cross between a skate board, a Roomba autonomous vacuum cleaner, and a Segway. San Francisco Bay hydrogen fuel-cell ferry “feasible, but expensive”: The study — conducted by Sandia National Laboratories, and which examined the technical, regulatory, and economic aspects of the construction and operation of a 150 passenger, high-speed, zero-emissions, hydrogen-powered ferry in the San Francisco Bay area — found that such a deployment had definite benefits, but that it would come at a cost premium as compared to a conventional diesel-powered ferry. BYD is now the third largest electric car manufacturer: In global sales, BYD is now third in total sales of electric cars (including plug-in hybrids). Nissan-Renault leads with 369,000 (the Renault Zoe is very popular in France and the rest of Europe). Tesla is in second place with 164,000 cars sold and BYD is just a tick behind with 161,000 sales. Those numbers were as of the end of September. When the final numbers are in at the end of this year, BYD may have vaulted into sole possession of second place. There is a myth in existence today that says the utility grid can only handle a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources: Now some people think if more than 10% to 15% of all electrical power comes from renewable sources, the grid will become unstable and any number of calamities will befall mankind as a result. Hawai’i is a solar postcard from the future: Solar makes sense for Hawai’i . With its uniform day lengths, small seasonal variations in incoming solar radiation, and consistent temperatures, Hawai’i on level ground receives at least 67% as much solar energy between sunrise and sunset on a clear winter day as it does on a clear summer day. Arcadia Power launches solar for renters program: Using Arcadia encourages utilities to identify and make use of renewable energy. It also provides a guaranteed market for renewable energy which can help stimulate more investment in renewables. And it allows individuals to participate in the green power revolution conveniently. It’s the proverbial win-win situation . Solar power for mobile & manufactured homes: We recently received an e-mail from a reader asking about solar power for mobile and manufactured homes . That sent us scurrying through all the closest here at SolarLove looking for information we could share with our readers, but we found all the cupboards were bare. So we turned to Google for help and came up with some ideas. Rocky Mountain Power’s solar subscriber program is 95% sold out .  ",

      "title": "'Westworld': What Ford's Secret Suggests About the Show's Most Mysterious Character",
      "text": "[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the first six episodes of HBO's Westworld.]\n\"If you could see your son again, wouldn't you want to?\"\nIt's a compelling question that Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins) poses to Bernard Lowe (Jeffrey Wright) during \" The Adversary ,\" the sixth hour of Westworld. The two brilliant scientists mull over this idea in the presence of five blissfully unaware hosts: robotic recreations of Ford's father, mother, brother, family dog and even himself, the same young boy who has helped out both Ford and the Man in Black (Ed Harris) on different occasions.\nAs it turns out, these replicas of Ford's family were designed by Arnold , the park's mysterious co-founder who died under equally mysterious circumstances more than 30 years earlier. Ford doesn't have many fond memories of his youth (\"I'm not the sentimental type,\" he told Theresa back in episode four), save for one vacation he took as a child. His host family echoes that countryside getaway, from the cabin they live in to their attire and attitudes. Indeed, Ford, who has personally maintained these hosts over the years, even adjusted the hosts' personalities so they better resemble his family. Yes, that includes his father's drinking problem.\nRead more: 'Westworld': 10 Key Moments From \"The Adversary\"\nBernard, like the show's viewers, feels \"troubled\" at the sight of Ford'sfamily. He has every reason to feel pangs of dread, because the reveal confirms what many Westworld fans already suspected: the park's hosts can be, and in some cases are modeled after actual human beings. This must be not just a troubling prospect for Bernard, but a tempting one as well, given how much he's haunted by the death of his son Charlie. Will Bernard chase those demons off a cliff, to borrow a phrase from earlier in the series? Perhaps, but there are more pressing concerns around the reveal.\nRobert credits Arnold with building theFord family. If Arnold created host replicas of Ford's family, there's every reason to suggest that he might have created replicas of his own loved ones. Now that it's established that hosts can be modeled after actual people - not just in terms of physical likeness, but actual personality attributes - it's reasonable to assume that some of the hosts from the park's earliest days were based on people in Arnold's life, and likely Ford's as well.\nFollow that rabbit further down the hole, back to \" Contrapasso ,\" the fifth episode of the series. There's a scene between Ford and Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood), the oldest host in Westworld. When Dolores asks Ford if they're \"very old friends,\" a grimacing Ford replies, \"I wouldn't say that at all.\" Are they enemies, then? Perhaps they are - but in light of the idea that hosts can be modeled after actual people, it's a strong possibility that the very first host ever built in Westworld is a monument to someone. But who? Could it be someone of great significance to both Ford and Arnold? A romantic partner? A business partner? A daughter? A sibling? Who knows, but the idea that Ford sees another entity entirely when he looks upon Dolores only adds to a character that's already brimming with possibility.\nStill, the most chilling prospect about Ford's host family centers on the family's creator. According to Ford, Arnold died in the park, his death ruled an accident, though Ford implies it might have been a suicide. Viewers also know that of the two Westworld founders, Arnold was the one who advocated for consciousness in the hosts. Over the course of \"The Adversary,\" two different people speak to Arnold's continued existence, including Elsie (Shannon Woodward). As far as she can tell, Arnold's been meddling with older host models, breaking their loops and changing their programming. As she puts it: \"He's a prolific programmer for a dead guy.\"\nRead more: 'Westworld': Decoding Thandie Newton and Anthony Hopkins' Journeys (So Far)\n\"The shadow and specter of that character and who he was for Ford, and the fact that we've never seen him and we don't know who he is, makes you question, in a way, the reality that's being presented, and who he really is, and who Ford really is,\" director Fred Toye told THR when asked about Arnold's role on the show. \"That's what's most interesting. The component of Arnold and Ford together and what their relationship was and what they created, and what each of their priorities were, is fundamental in the undercurrent of the story.\"\nRead More It's the undercurrent of the story for now, but how long before the thing bubbling beneath the surface comes up for air? At the very least, Westworld has strongly implied that Arnold still exists as a ghost in the machine. And what's more, the idea that Arnold designed hosts based on actual human beings gives credence to the theory that there's a walking, talking, flesh-and-blood Arnold currently in play - quite likely in a host's body, and quite possibly in the body of a host viewers already know.\n\"They're ghosts,\" Ford tells Bernard about his fake family. \"Survivors of the wreck of time.\" The idea that Arnold himself is a fellow ghost evading time's almighty reach is a haunting one indeed.\nFollow THR's Westworld coverage for more interviews, news and theories.",

Wanting to see how much more our ’11 Ford F-250 6.7L Power Stroke engine could make with a few simple upgrades—and knowing we wanted bolt-on parts that wouldn’t alter the emissions equipment—we reached out to our friends at AFE Power to see what they had to offer that could give us that extra oomph when we hit the skinny pedal. After going through the catalog, we decide to install a quartet of AFE power-adders: a Momentum HD cold air intake, a set of BladeRunner Intercooler Tubes (hot and cold side), a DPF-back exhaust, and a potent Scorcher HD module. With the parts picked out and the truck ready to go, we headed to AFE’s impressive facility in Corona, California, to install the power-increasing goodies on our Ford.   26 Photos Photo 2/26 | 2011 Ford F 250 AFE Install On Dyno 1. Before installing any parts, we strapped the Ford to the Dynojet dyno to get some real-world baseline figures on the factory-rated 400hp/800–lb-ft. truck. The stock 6.7L Power Stroke engine made an impressive 355 hp and 718 lb-ft of torque at the wheels.   26 Photos Photo 4/26 | 2011 Ford F 250 AFE Install Remove Stock Intake 2. With the truck off the dyno and cooled down, the first step is to remove the stock intake. After unbolting a few pieces and unclipping a few clips, the factory intake comes out without a fight.   26 Photos Photo 5/26 | 2011 Ford F 250 AFE Install Airflow Sensor 3. Only a couple of pieces carry over from the stock intake to the AFE Momentum. The most important of these pieces is the mass airflow sensor, which easily comes off and slips right into the AFE unit.   26 Photos Photo 7/26 | 2011 Ford F 250 AFE Install Intake Tube 4. The AFE intake drops in uneventfully and lines up perfectly with the air inlet. The intake tube even has a cutout for the factory EGR cooler line to snap into, cleaning up the engine bay and keeping unnecessary rattles to a minimum.   26 Photos Photo 8/26 | 2011 Ford F 250 AFE Install Plug 5. With the intake secured under the hood, we turn our attention to installing the plug-and-play Scorcher module. With simple connections that tap into the MAP sensor and fuel sensor, the Scorcher installs in a jiffy.   26 Photos Photo 9/26 | 2011 Ford F 250 AFE Install Firewall 6. We mount the Scorcher next to the firewall and run the simple two-wire hookup to the required sensors.   26 Photos Photo 10/26 | 2011 Ford F 250 AFE Install Fuel Sending Unit 7. The most important and troublesome connector is the fuel-sending unit (arrow). Make sure this plug is properly seated to avoid any potential trouble codes.   26 Photos Photo 11/26 | 2011 Ford F 250 AFE Install Scorcher Led 8. The Scorcher is controlled by a single button switch with color-coded LEDs to let you know which mode it’s in. The green LED is the Stock setting, the yellow LED is Sport mode, the orange LED is Sport+, and the red LED is Race mode. We mount the switch to the dash for easy access and where the LEDs wouldn’t be bothersome at night.   26 Photos Photo 12/26 | 2011 Ford F 250 AFE Install Intercooler 9. With the Scorcher install wrapped up, we turn our attention to smoothing out the airflow into the turbocharger from the intercooler with a set of BladeRunner Intercooler Tubes. The kit includes new tubes for the hot and cold side of the intercooler and all the necessary hardware to install them.",

      "title": "Zero To 60 Designs Responds To Ford's GTT Complaints",
      "text": "Zero To 60 Designs Responds To Ford's GTT Complaints | By Share Zero to 60 Designs, the company behind the GTT from the SEMA show, has issued a statement after it emerged that Ford's lawyers were investigating the vehicle's design elements. Although the tuner failed to say if it has been approached by the Blue Oval regarding the GTT, Zero to 60 Designs unveiled a new logo for the car, one which doesn't bare quite the same resemblance to the logo used by the Mustang GT, as shown on the initial display car. The company also clarified that despite widespread reporting, the model isn't dubbed the Mustang GTT and is instead known as the Zero to 60 Designs GTT . Here is the statement in full: “Following an incredible 2016 SEMA Show with the launch of the all-new Zero to 60 Designs GTT, with resounding success, this car was one of the most talked about cars in the industry. With this attention, came some questions about the styling of the logo and the resemblance to Ford Motor Company’s current Mustang GT logo. With our message of paying homage to both the Ford Mustang GT and the Ford GT, the last thing we at Zero to 60 want to do is get in to a confrontation with Ford. It’s rather the opposite. We picked two of the most inspirational vehicles in the industry and provided our interpretation of it. This new logo rendering represents our Zero to 60 Designs GTT. We learned over the past week that a few of the stories also mislabeled the car as the Mustang GTT and not the Zero to 60 Designs GTT. Those names are entirely different.” In creating the GTT, the company wanted to combine the styling of the Mustang and GT supercar into a single package. It did just that, prompting Ford to consider legal action against the tuner. Ford has yet to say if it will proceed any further with the matter but if it does, it could put the brakes on the project.

Chennai: US car major Ford Motor plans to invest Rs 1,300 crore in a new global technology and business centre in the city which would serve as a hub for product development, mobility solutions and business services for India and the world.\nThe automaker will invest USD 195 million (about Rs 1,300 crore) and would employ 3,000 workers over the next five years, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said here today.\nFord will also consolidate 9,000 employees from six existing facilities on the 28-acre campus at Old Mahabalipuram Road, Thoraipakkam.

      "text": "Toyota Fortuner VS Ford Endeavour – Engine, Interior and Price Toyota Fortuner VS Ford Endeavour – Engine, Interior and Price With the recent price-cut on the Ford Endeavour and its sales performance in the past few months, it is the main competitor, the new Fortuner will have to go against. By: FE Online | Updated: November 8, 2016 5:37 PM Toyota Fortuner is based on the IMP Platform, the Ford Endeavour underpins T6 platform \nToyota Kirloskar Motors has launched the all-new Fortuner in India at Rs 25.92 lakh, ex-showroom, Delhi. The new Toyota Fortuner features two engine options, with a choice of a 6-speed manual or an automatic gearbox. The SUV is based on the IMV platform, which also underpins the Toyota Innova Crysta and features multiple lightweighting methods to keep the vehicle weight in check. The new Toyota Fortuner competes with the likes of Ford Endeavour, Chevrolet Trailblazer and Hyundai Santa FE. However, with the recent price-cut on the Ford Endeavour and its sales performance in the past few months, it is the main competitor, the new Fortuner will have to go against. \nPowertrain Toyota Fortuner is powered by two engine options, with a choice of a 6-speed manual or an automatic gearbox. \nThe Toyota Fortuner is powered by a 2,694cc turbocharged petrol engine, that generates 164hp of power at 5,200 rpm and 245Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. The 2,755 cc diesel unit, on the other hand, produces 174hp at 3,400 rpm and 420 Nm of torque, when paired to a manual transmission. In case of an automatic transmission, this number goes up slightly to 450 Nm between 1,200 rpm and 3,400 rpm. Both engines are mated to a 6-speed manual and automatic gearbox. \nThe Ford Endeavour is built on a newly developed platform and gets a few best-in-segment features and technologies. The Endeavour too offers two diesel engines, a 2.2 litre and 3.2-litre TDCi unit. The smaller unit produces 158hp of power at 3,200 rpm and 385 Nm of torque between 1600-2500rpm. The bigger 3.2 litre unit develops 197hp at 3,000 rpm and 470 Nm of torque between 1750-2500rpm. The 2.2 litre engine offers a choice between a 6-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the larger 3.2 litre engine is only offered with a 6-speed automatic gearbox. \nStyling Ford Endeavour features Ford's signature trapezoidal grille, sweptback headlamps with LED daytime running lamps. \nThe newly launched Fortuner looks radically different compared to the previous model as the new one trades in the old model's butch looks for a sleek and sophisticated design. The SUV gets sleek swept back Bi-Beam headlamps with LED DRL (daytime running lights). There is also a new fog lamp housing on the front body-coloured bumper. Just like the front, the rear of the SUV has also got a makeover. A horizontal chrome stripe is flanked by sleek LED tail lamps on either side. The tail gate too features some sharp creases and a top spoiler. \nThe Endeavour is a more contemporary looking SUV with a boxy and robust design, which worked wonders for the older Fortuner as well. Those looking for a macho SUV will favour the Endeavour over the Fortuner, which looks more up scale but softer at the same time. The car features Ford's signature trapezoidal grille, sweptback headlamps with LED daytime running lamps. The exterior of the Endeavour also gets new bumper and fog lamps, while the side features double-spoke alloy wheels and a roofline that tapers slightly at the rear. \nCabin Ford Endeavour has a first-in-segment Active Noise Cancellation technology. \nThe Fortuner features a new and plusher cabin, equipped with dual tone interiors. The seat upholstery of the SUV uses a soft leather dark brown material, while the centre console is wrapped in soft leather and metallic accents. The 8-way adjustable driver seats look sporty and are adequately sized to seat people with large frames. The multi-functional steering wheel gets voice recognition, audio and telephone switches. The car is also equipped with other convenient features such as cruise control, automatic climate control and touch screen audio and capacitive switches. For the safety of all occupants, Toyota has equipped the SUV with safety technologies like ABS with EBD, BA (Brake Assist), park assist, downhill assist control, hill assist control, 7 airbags and traction control. \nThe Endeavour, on the other hand, is equipped with features like electrically-foldable third-row seats and 8-way power adjustable driver seat for more comfort. The instrument cluster gets anti-glare coloured LCD display that displays all the information like performance, navigation and entertainment. Ford has also equipped the car with an electrically operated panoramic sunroof, rear parking sensors with parking camera along with safety features like seven airbags, semi-auto parallel park assist, hill launch control and hill descent control. A first-in-segment feature in the Endeavour is its Active Noise Cancellation technology, which consists of speakers that emit counter waves to eliminate sound waves entering the cabin. As a result, the Endeavour possibly has the quietest cabin in its segment. \nOff-road capability The Ford Endeavour is equipped with a Terrain Management System and various modes including Normal, Snow/Mud/Grass, Sand and Rock. \nOff-roading capabilities are the core characteristics for any accomplished SUV and that necessitates a four-wheel drive system, which is available with both the vehicles in the discussion. The new Toyota Fortuner comes with a full-time 4 wheel drive system and two driving modes – ECO and Power. In the ECO mode, the SUV delivers good fuel efficiency and is best suited for city and highway driving. The Power mode is good for off-roading and driving in different road conditions like hills, gravel, etc. \nThe Ford Endeavour comes with a 4WD system in the 3.2 litre variant and a rear-wheel drive system with the 2.2 litre engine. The system offers a low-ratio gearbox along with the capability of a fully-locking rear differential. The Endeavour is equipped with a Terrain Management System, allowing the driver to choose from various modes including Normal, Snow/Mud/Grass, Sand and Rock. These modes alter the way the engine, transmission and brakes work, resulting in better control on tricky surfaces. \nPrices \nToyota Fortuner 2.7 4X2 MT: Rs 25.92 \nToyota Fortuner 2.7 4X2 AT: Rs 27.61 \nToyota Fortuner 2.8 4X2 MT: Rs 27.52 \nToyota Fortuner 2.8 4X2 AT: Rs 29.14 \nToyota Fortuner 2.8 4X4 MT: Rs 30.05 \nToyota Fortuner 2.8 4X4 AT: 31.12 \nFord Endeavour price: \nFord Endeavour 2.2 4X2 AT Trend: Rs 23.78 \nFord Endeavour 2.2 4X4 MT Trend: Rs 23.78 \nFord Endeavour 2.2 4X2 AT Titanium: 27.50 \nFord Endeavour 3.2 4X4 AT Trend: Rs 25.93 \nFord Endeavour 3.2 4X4 AT Titanium: Rs 29.76 \nAll the prices are ex-showroom, Delhi By: FE Online Nov 08, 2016 5:37 PM RELATED VIDEOS ",

      "text": "Chennai | Published:November 9, 2016 1:12 am \nUS auto major Ford Motor Co on Tuesday announced setting up of a global technology and business centre (GBC) in Chennai with an estimated investment of Rs 1,300 crore ($195 million) to design, develop and collaborate with global operations for auto components and allied services. \nThe centre, the third one in the Asia Pacific region, will serve as a hub for product development, mobility solutions and business services, said Ford executive chairman Bill Ford in Chennai. \nThe centre, spread across 28 acres, will help consolidate 9,000 employees in all its R&D operations in India, across six facilities, under one roof. Post-consolidation, the campus will employ 12,000 people over a period of five years with fresh hiring of 3,000 engineers, scientists and accounting professionals, among others, said Ford. The Chennai facility will be the second largest centre of employment globally after Dearborn in the US, he added. \nAddressing mediapersons, he said: “We are bullish about the Indian market. After a lull, we see Ford India is ticking up, thanks to the five new products launched in 2015, including the iconic Mustang. The Indian operations saw a 25 per cent growth in domestic sales and 40 per cent growth in exports so far this year.” \n“India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility solutions, it is also rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,” Ford said, adding, “This new tech centre will help us attract intellectuals to be part of a true innovation hub for our future products development.” FE Best of Express ",

      "text": "- www.allsports.com.gh \nEngland fly-half George Ford says there is no chance of him joining father Mike at French big-spenders Toulon. \nMike Ford was appointed head coach of the Top 14 side in place of former Italy international Diego Dominguez in October, after initially joining Toulon as backs coach. \nHe moved to France after being sacked as coach of English Premiership side Bath -- the club George still plays for -- following a poor league season that saw the west country team finish ninth in the 12-strong table. \nHis appointment as head coach of Toulon sparked speculation that father and son could be re-united in France. \nBut that would mean George having to effectively give up his international career because England do not select overseas-based players for Test duty, except in \"exceptional circumstances\". \nIt is a policy that pre-dates Eddie Jones's reign as England coach but one the Australian is determined to uphold. \n\"I don?t know what was going on there last week to be honest,\" Ford, speaking at England's training base on Tuesday, said of the speculation. \n\"It was news to me, anyway,\" added the 23-year-old ahead of England's opening end-of-year international against South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday. \n\"Obviously my dad?s there but I want to play for England so I want to play in England,\" insisted Ford, who has appeared in 26 Tests. \n\"After it all came out I had a quick chat with Eddie and said, 'I don?t know where all that?s come from'.\" \nFord did not rule out playing overseas at a much later stage in his career, saying: \"I think it would be a great life experience playing somewhere like France. \n\"It is a different way of playing and living ?- you'd probably see the sun and the beach a lot more... I'll see where I am in a few years? time.\" \nBut right now Ford's focus in on helping England make it 10 wins out of 10 under Jones when they face the Springboks -- a team they have not beaten since 2006. \nThis weekend's clash is set to see Ford and childhood friend Owen Farrell continue their twin playmaker partnership at fly-half and inside centre respectively. \nA niggling injury that meant Farrell could not kick sidelined him for six weeks at the start of the season. \nBut his return saw the goal-kicker produce a man-of-the-match display as reigning English and European champions Saracens beat Toulon 33-21 on October 15. \n\"I wasn't surprised by Owen's form,\" said Ford. \"He would have been on top of things constantly even if he was not training to his full capacity. He is obsessed with the game.\" \nFarrell is one of three England players on a six-strong shortlist for World Rugby's player of the year award, together with Billy Vunipola and Maro Itoje -- also two of his team-mates at London club Saracens. \nThe winner will be announced on Sunday and Ford said: \"There have been some outstanding performers in the team and those three especially. \n\"Other players could have made it as well.\" \nFor more sports news visit allSports.com.gh",

      "title": "What Killed the Sportsroof?",
      "text": "Email Why did Ford kill one of its best-looking models of the 1970s—the Ford Torino Sportsroof Fastback—after only two years? It’s amazing to envision all of the tooling and manufacturing complexity, the logistics of selling and marketing a special car, and then see it last only 24 months. With all of that effort comes an expectation for great rewards and a long shelf life. What forces dashed those plans? I have no inside info on why, but for the Torino Sportsroof, the era in which it was manufactured and the numbers suggest a pretty simple answer. First, though, the 1972 Ford Torinos were all new and inclusive, with a variety of handsome body styles that included two-door and four-door hardtops, and the fastback Sportsroof we are focusing on here, plus station wagons, and venerable Ranchero trucks. Total sales for its first year were more than 500,000. Wow! Of those, more than one-tenth were Sportsroofs. Federal bumper regulations went into effect in 1973 for front ends, necessitating a restyle to accommodate the ugly locomotive bumpers we like to tuck and trim today. Sportsroofs dipped to 50,000 units that year in spite of the attractive facelift, with total 1973 Torino production dipping slightly to 481,442. With federal rear-bumper standards mandated for 1974, my guess is that 1) integrating an attractive 5-mph bumper for the rear of the Sportsroof was impossible, and 2) with the hardtop selling so well and Sportsroof sales slowing, Ford planners decided not to complicate production and marketing—and the extra parts needed at the dealer level—for a body style that would maybe see an additional 30 to 40,000 units. As with most everything, it all comes down to the numbers. Today 1972 and 1973 Sportsroof prices tend to run on the high side for cars of that era for the obvious reasons that they have weathered the years well and are a surprisingly rare sight these days. While most Ford-natics gravitate to the Mustang, these lesser-seen Fords are every bit as cool and collectible—when you can find one. They also ran in NASCAR Grand National racing, with Bobby Isaac’s 351 Cleveland-powered Sportsroof the example seen here. And don’t forget Mercury had its own Montego Sportsroof models, which also raced the Grand National circuit, to make this pursuit even more interesting if you find yourself drawn to one of the better-looking Fomoco muscle cars of the era.",

      "text": "  12:10pm GMT Automakers, dependent on Mexico, face a rougher road with Trump The Ford logo is seen at their plant in Cuatitlan Izcalli, Mexico October 18, 2016. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso By Paul Lienert and Meredith Davis \nThe election of Donald Trump as U.S. president puts new pressure on automakers and other manufacturers that have become dependent on open trade with Mexico, and raises the risk they will face higher costs. \nAutomakers could also take a hit if instability in financial markets undercuts the confidence of consumers in the United States and other major markets at a time when growth in U.S. auto sales has stalled. \nInvestors sold off U.S. stocks and the dollar in reaction to Trump’s unexpected win. Shares in Japanese automakers, which also rely on Mexico as a production hub for the U.S. market, slid as well, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei index, which fell 5 percent. \nIn afternoon Tokyo trade, shares in Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) were down 6.5 percent, Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ) was down 6.0 percent, while Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) fell 7.8 percent. All three companies declined to comment. \nTrump’s promise to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement and reject or renegotiate other trade opening deals resonated with voters in industrial states, even though many experts raised doubts that the 1994 NAFTA would be repealed. \nTrump made an attack on the outsourcing of American auto jobs to Mexico a recurrent theme in his campaign, a message that rallied blue-collar workers while threatening to upend the business assumptions behind billions of dollars in planned investment by the auto industry. \nIn announcing his campaign in June 2015, Trump vowed to block Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) from opening a new plant in Mexico and threatened to impose tariffs on cars it shipped back across the border. \nBut implementing Trump’s agenda would force U.S. consumers to pay higher prices for vehicles, said Charles Chesbrough, senior economist and executive director of strategy and research at the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, a Detroit-based trade group representing auto suppliers. \n\"His trade policies could add $5,000 or more to the price of a small car from Mexico,\" he said. \nU.S. manufacturers such Ford, General Motors Co ( GM.N ), heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) and many of their suppliers have based billions of dollars of investment on the assumption of relatively open trade with Mexico, China and other countries. \nFord in April announced plans to invest $1.6 billion to expand production of small cars in Mexico, drawing fire from Trump. Trump also took aim at GM for its plans to invest $5 billion in Mexico. \nIn September, Ford said its small-car production would be leaving U.S. plants and heading to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from Trump. \n\"We shouldn't allow it to happen,\" Trump said. \nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford last month said he met with Trump to discuss criticism from the candidate, which Ford said he found \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating.\" Ford said his company employs more people at its U.S. plants than any other automaker. The company also said its decision to build new vehicles in Mexico would not cost U.S. jobs. \nBetween 1994 and 2013, U.S. auto factory jobs dropped by a third while jobs in Mexico rose almost five-fold over the same period as lower-wage production boomed. \nMexico now accounts for 20 percent of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research. \nBased on current investment plans, Mexico’s auto production capacity will grow by another 50 percent over the next five years, the centre, which draws funding from the auto industry, estimates. \n\"Dismantling NAFTA at this point would be pretty hard to do,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labour and economics at the centre. Recent pledges by GM and Ford to build new models at U.S. factories are likely to generate a limited new jobs, far short of the industry revival Trump promised on the stump. \n\"After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant, and we will do it and we will do lot of expansion,\" Trump said in Michigan on Tuesday in his last speech of the campaign. \n(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit and Meredith Davis in Chicago; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Naomi Tajitsu in Washington; Writing by Joe White; Editing by Kevin Krolicki)  ",

      "text": "Other Inventory About This 2016 Ford Mustang GT 2016 Mustang Premium Street Fighter GT \"Drag Pack\" - 5.0 L - Roush Supercharged 780 HP V8 Coyote. 6 Speed automatic transmission. In same as new condition with just 400 miles. Race red exterior with black leather interior. We took this brand new Mustang GT Premium and gave it the full Modern Muscle Cars treatment, and then we went a bit further. Our phase 3 package that we call the \"Street Fighter GT DRAG PACK.\" Our Street Fighter package consists of a Roush Supercharger, 20\" custom KMC rims and Nitto Nt 555 tires all the way around for that extra traction needed with this kind of horsepower. We also added our patented axle back exhaust so that it sounds as bad as it is! Then we added the custom striping down the center line. We put the big boy tune on this which comes in at 612HP to the rear wheels. (See the dyno sheets.) That calculates to 780 HP at the crank. Now, for the automatic to handle the extra horsepower we added a one piece aluminum driveshaft. The end result? The Modern Muscle Cars \"Street Fighter GT DRAG PACK.\" What we have created is the fastest Mustang on the streets. Faster than the GT350, faster than the Shelby GT500. It's even faster than our HellCat. This GT Street Fighter Drag Pack is expected to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3 seconds, and go through the quarter mile in the high 10's.

      "text": "About This 2016 Ford F-150 Roush Supercharged 600HP Introducing The VENGEANCE SC-600 We took this brand new 2016 Ford F150 XLT straight from the Ford dealers lot and gave it the full Modern Muscle Cars treatment. We started by adding a Roush Supercharger to the already peppy 5.0 Coyote engine. This resulted in a truck that puts out 600 Horsepower at the crankshaft. We added a custom Katzkin leather interior front and back with color matched stitching. We replaced the stock F150 hood with a sportier and lighter fiberglass/gel coat hood with tunnel scoop. We lifted this beast 4\" and added the 35\" Toyo tires and 18\" Fuel rims. With the 4\" lift we felt the need to add AMP fold down power running boards for easy entry and exit. These are super nice! Next we added our patented cat back dual exhaust system to give it that old school sound of big muscle. The exhaust note on these trucks is the best sound of anything we build. Its just awesome! We added a bed rug bed liner and Backflip G2 tri-fold tonneau cover. Stripes down the center line, as well as supercharged badging that lets the world know that you're not driving just any other F150. Build Sheet - 2016 F-150 Vengeance SC650 •Stage II - ROUSH R2300 TVS Supercharger •600 H.P. 585 FT LB Torque •18\"x9\" Fuel Wheels •35/12.5/18 Toyo Open Country A/T II •4\" Zone Off Road Lift Kit •Front End Alignment (twice)",

      "title": "Automakers, dependent on Mexico, face a rougher road with Trump",
      "text": "Tweet Share The logo of Ford is pictured near a sales store of the automaker in Mexico City, Mexico, April 5, 2016. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo More By Paul Lienert and Meredith Davis (Reuters) - The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president puts new pressure on automakers and other manufacturers that have become dependent on open trade with Mexico, and raises the risk they will face higher costs. Automakers could also take a hit if instability in financial markets undercuts the confidence of consumers in the United States and other major markets at a time when growth in U.S. auto sales has stalled. Investors sold off U.S. stocks and the dollar in reaction to Trump’s unexpected win. Shares in Japanese automakers, which also rely on Mexico as a production hub for the U.S. market, slid as well, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei index, which fell 5 percent. In afternoon Tokyo trade, shares in Toyota Motor Corp were down 6.5 pct, Nissan Motor Co Ltd was down 6.0 pct, while Honda Motor Co fell 7.8 pct. All three companies declined to comment. Trump’s promise to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement and reject or renegotiate other trade opening deals resonated with voters in industrial states, even though many experts raised doubts that the 1994 NAFTA would be repealed. Trump made an attack on the outsourcing of American auto jobs to Mexico a recurrent theme in his campaign, a message that rallied blue-collar workers while threatening to upend the business assumptions behind billions of dollars in planned investment by the auto industry. In announcing his campaign in June 2015, Trump vowed to block Ford Motor Co from opening a new plant in Mexico and threatened to impose tariffs on cars it shipped back across the border. But implementing Trump’s agenda would force U.S. consumers to pay higher prices for vehicles, said Charles Chesbrough, senior economist and executive director of strategy and research at the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, a Detroit-based trade group representing auto suppliers. \"His trade policies could add $5,000 or more to the price of a small car from Mexico,\" he said. U.S. manufacturers such Ford, General Motors Co, heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc and many of their suppliers have based billions of dollars of investment on the assumption of relatively open trade with Mexico, China and other countries. Ford in April announced plans to invest $1.6 billion to expand production of small cars in Mexico, drawing fire from Trump. Trump also took aim at GM for its plans to invest $5 billion in Mexico. In September, Ford said its small-car production would be leaving U.S. plants and heading to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from Trump. \"We shouldn't allow it to happen,\" Trump said. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford last month said he met with Trump to discuss criticism from the candidate, which Ford said he found \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating.\" Ford said his company employs more people at its U.S. plants than any other automaker. The company also said its decision to build new vehicles in Mexico would not cost U.S. jobs. Between 1994 and 2013, U.S. auto factory jobs dropped by a third while jobs in Mexico rose almost five-fold over the same period as lower-wage production boomed. Mexico now accounts for 20 percent of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research. Based on current investment plans, Mexico’s auto production capacity will grow by another 50 percent over the next five years, the center, which draws funding from the auto industry, estimates. \"Dismantling NAFTA at this point would be pretty hard to do,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the center. Recent pledges by GM and Ford to build new models at U.S. factories are likely to generate a limited new jobs, far short of the industry revival Trump promised on the stump. \"After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant, and we will do it and we will do lot of expansion,\" Trump said in Michigan on Tuesday in his last speech of the campaign.

      "text": "by Sydney Gore Photo courtesy of Ford \nWhen you wish upon a star, do you see a shiny car? Apparently, you do if you're Sailor Moon. In a series of bizarre and timely events, Ford is here to provide your daily dose of nostalgia by recruiting our favorite anime superheroine from the '90s for a short commercial. \nIn the video, Usagi (aka Sailor Moon) and Luna are seen stargazing from a window in her bedroom. Usagi squeals as she gushes about the constellation of the Ford Fusion model and how it's the most stylish car she's ever seen. Of course, Luna is there to explain all of the new and improved driver-assist features that make for a better driving experience. \nBefore Usagi gets too caught up imagining which color of the model works best with her wardrobe, Luna reminds her that she's not even of age to drive. (But she's a cat—what does she know?!) The whole thing ends too soon, and we're left wondering what is next for the legacy of Sailor Moon. \nWe're not saying that this commercial makes us want to buy a Ford Fusion, but this is definitely an association we won't forget anytime soon. Watch the cute short, below. NYLON Video",

      "text": "We take a look at how the new Fortuner's pricing fares against the Ford Endeavour - Variant-By-Variant\n\nToyota has launched the all-new Fortuner and now cold comparisons with its arch rival, the Ford Endeavour can be made. Right off the bat, the option of two diesel engines and keen pricing makes the Ford look quite attractive as compared to the Toyota. Ford’s rejigged line up of the Endeavour has made it quiet feisty that deserves to be closely examined by potential Fortuner customers. So, which of these two SUVs offers the most value? Read on to find out.\n\n\nThe Endeavour’s line up starts with the 2.2 litre engine, and the Trend variant is Rs 2.14 lakh cheaper than the most affordable Fortuner, which happens to be a petrol. The Endeavour also offers you the choice of an automatic transmission or four-wheel drive hardware at this Rs 23.78 lakh price point. The price for the petrol automatic variant of the Fortuner goes up to Rs 27.61 lakh. At this price you could opt for the top end Titanium variant of the 2.2L AT equipped Endeavour. The Toyota Fortuner’s two-wheel drive diesel automatic is priced at Rs 29.14 lakh and is almost in the territory of the top-end 3.2L 4x4 AT equipped Endeavour. \n\n\nThe Endeavour 3.2, in both its guises, significantly undercuts the diesel 4WD variants of the Fortuner, too, and is priced a full Rs 4.12 lakh (Trend vs 4WD MT) and Rs 1.35 lakh (Titanium vs 4WD AT) cheaper.\n\nIn spite of being cheaper, the Endeavour packs in a bigger, more powerful motor (200PS/470Nm vs 177PS/450Nm) and also gets an advanced Terrain Management system. It gets a whole lot of additional goodies, too, that include a sunroof, AndroidAuto and Apple CarPlay courtesy the SYNC3 infotainment system, active noise cancellation and a powered folding third row as well.\n\n\nFord has played the price game very well, and a look at the Endeavour's line-up will also tell you that the variants are well thought out. The smaller 2.2-litre variant plays in Ford's favour, giving it a lower sticker price. At Rs 23.78 lakh, one can opt for either a 4x4 manual or a 4x2 automatic variant, which lets the casual premium car buyer or the weekend off-roader take his pick.\n\n\nSmart move there, Ford. That said, Toyota has the edge when it comes to comfort and space in all three row and makes for a better seven-seater. We will have a detailed comparison of theses SUVs soon. For now, going by the specs and the prices, the Ford Endeavour looks like it has the value for money quotient covered!\n(all prices are ex-showroom Delhi) \nRead More on: Toyota Fortuner price \nRead full article on cardekho.com",

      "text": "Business Automakers, dependent on Mexico, face a rougher road with Trump The logo of Ford is pictured near a sales store of the automaker in Mexico City, Mexico. Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 8:30 PM, November 9, 2016 \nThe election of Donald Trump as U.S. president puts new pressure on automakers and other manufacturers that have become dependent on open trade with Mexico, and raises the risk they will face higher costs. \nAutomakers could also take a hit if instability in financial markets undercuts the confidence of consumers in the United States and other major markets at a time when growth in U.S. auto sales has stalled. \nInvestors sold off U.S. stocks and the dollar in reaction to Trump’s unexpected win. Shares in Japanese automakers, which also rely on Mexico as a production hub for the U.S. market, slid as well, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei index, which fell 5 percent. \nIn afternoon Tokyo trade, shares in Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> were down 6.5 pct, Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T> was down 6.0 pct, while Honda Motor Co <7267.T> fell 7.8 pct. All three companies declined to comment. \nTrump’s promise to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement and reject or renegotiate other trade opening deals resonated with voters in industrial states, even though many experts raised doubts that the 1994 NAFTA would be repealed. \nTrump made an attack on the outsourcing of American auto jobs to Mexico a recurrent theme in his campaign, a message that rallied blue-collar workers while threatening to upend the business assumptions behind billions of dollars in planned investment by the auto industry. \nIn announcing his campaign in June 2015, Trump vowed to block Ford Motor Co <F.N> from opening a new plant in Mexico and threatened to impose tariffs on cars it shipped back across the border. \nBut implementing Trump’s agenda would force U.S. consumers to pay higher prices for vehicles, said Charles Chesbrough, senior economist and executive director of strategy and research at the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, a Detroit-based trade group representing auto suppliers. \n\"His trade policies could add $5,000 or more to the price of a small car from Mexico,\" he said. \nU.S. manufacturers such Ford, General Motors Co <GM.N>, heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc <CAT.N> and many of their suppliers have based billions of dollars of investment on the assumption of relatively open trade with Mexico, China and other countries. \nFord in April announced plans to invest $1.6 billion to expand production of small cars in Mexico, drawing fire from Trump. Trump also took aim at GM for its plans to invest $5 billion in Mexico. \nIn September, Ford said its small-car production would be leaving U.S. plants and heading to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from Trump. \n\"We shouldn't allow it to happen,\" Trump said. \nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford last month said he met with Trump to discuss criticism from the candidate, which Ford said he found \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating.\" Ford said his company employs more people at its U.S. plants than any other automaker. The company also said its decision to build new vehicles in Mexico would not cost U.S. jobs. \nBetween 1994 and 2013, U.S. auto factory jobs dropped by a third while jobs in Mexico rose almost five-fold over the same period as lower-wage production boomed. \nMexico now accounts for 20 percent of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research. \nBased on current investment plans, Mexico’s auto production capacity will grow by another 50 percent over the next five years, the center, which draws funding from the auto industry, estimates. \n\"Dismantling NAFTA at this point would be pretty hard to do,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the center. \nRecent pledges by GM and Ford to build new models at U.S. factories are likely to generate a limited new jobs, far short of the industry revival Trump promised on the stump. \n\"After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant, and we will do it and we will do lot of expansion,\" Trump said in Michigan on Tuesday in his last speech of the campaign.

      "text": "2008 Ford Escape Hybrid Photo Gallery \nExpedition \nThe Big Kahuna. Expedition stands as the largest SUV in Ford's current lineup ever since the demise of the even larger Ford Excursion (1999 – 2005). With styling that emphasizes its connection to the highly successful Ford truck line, Expedition is in no way subtle or understated. Yet there are times when the only tool for the job is the great big one, and that's when Expedition shines. There’s even a long-wheelbase (EL) model. Powered by a 3.5-liter turbocharged V6 EcoBoost that cranks out 365 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque, Expedition rolls with a six-speed automatic transmission and either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. Fuel consumption is estimated at 16 city/22 highway/18 combined (short wheelbase/RWD); 15/20/16 for short wheelbase/4WD; 15/21/17 for long wheelbase/RWD; and 14/20/16 for long wheelbase/4WD. Prices start at $45,435 and go up to $62,985 plus options for the full zoot Platinum EL edition. \n2007 Ford Expedition Photo Gallery \nExplorer \nFor many years, Explorer was the best-selling SUV in America; with the gas crunch, that position has been usurped by the Honda CR-V. Explorer has seen its ups and downs, from the rollover crisis of the late 1990s to vilification in the early 2000s as a gas hog. Explorer got a major makeover for 2011, moving from a body-on-frame SUV to a three-row unibody crossover platform shared with the Flex. Three engine choices are offered: a 3.5-liter naturally-aspirated (non-turbo) V6 that delivers 290 hp and 255 lb-ft of torque; a 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder EcoBoost that pumps out 280 hp and 310 lb-ft of torque; or a 3.5-liter turbocharged EcoBoost V6 that makes 365 hp and 350 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard, with front-wheel drive standard on the base V6 and 2.3-liter EcoBoost. Four-wheel drive is optional on the base V6 and 2.3-liter EcoBoost and standard on the 3.5-liter EcoBoost. Fuel economy estimates are 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway/20 combined for the base V6 FWD; 16/23/19 for the base V6 4WD; 19/28/22 for the 2.3 FWD; 18/26/21 for the 2.3 4WD; and 16/22/18 for the 3.5-liter EcoBoost 4WD. Prices start at $31,060 and go up to $52,970 plus options.",

      "title": "Westworld Theories: Ford’s Father, The Maze, Elsie, Antartica, Sub Level C and More",
      "text": "\nWe are six episodes into Westworld , and today I bring you the sixth edition of our popular Westworld theories round-up.\nThis week we take a look at Doctor Ford’s father and his relationship with Arnold, what might be at the center of the maze, a comparison to Dante’s Inferno, Elsie’s fate, Westworld’s secret location, what might be in sub level C, what the Chinese DELOS bird member said, and new evidence to support the multiple timeline theory. All this and more, after the jump.\n\n\nIs Arnold Ford’s Father? In “The Adversary,” Bernard ( Jeffrey Wright ) uncovers a secret hidden house in the park grounds housing a recreation of Robert Ford’s ( Anthony Hopkins ) family: his mother, father, brother, and greyhound dog. Bernard is told by Ford that Arnold created these hosts as a gift to him, and we see that they are of the mechanical variety and not the flesh and bone 3D printed models that currently populate the park. The big reveal here that you may not have noticed is that Ford’s father is the person who appeared in the photo that Ford presented Bernard with when first telling him about the park’s late co-founder Arnold, who had been removed from all the history books.\nSo does this confirm that Arnold was Ford’s father?\nOr…\n\nBernard Is Arnold and Couldn’t See Himself in the Photo We’ve discussed the possibility in the past that Bernard might be a host, and that he may even be a host recreation of Doctor Robert Ford’s former partner Arnold . This could mean that some of the scenes we’ve seen with Bernard talking to Dolores might actually be Arnold talking to Dolores before his death. This week’s episode, “The Adversary,” seems to further this theory by introducing us to a host version of Ford’s father.\nWhat if when Bernard was shown the photo of Arnold, he like other hosts, couldn’t see the piece of the picture that breaks his reality? We’ve seen this in the past with hosts being presented with the photo of a modern day Times Square portrait, with them admitting that it looks like nothing to them. So they’ve already established that when a guest says something that breaks the reality of the world or they see something that breaks their reality, which it goes by unnoticed.\nSo what if Arnold was in that photo, to the right of Ford and the host version of Ford’s father? Notice in the picture there seems to be a lot of empty space to the right, and the framing appears to be oddly off-center. Maybe there is a figure there that Bernard can’t see because of his host programming.\n\nFord Is a Host and the Center of the Maze Since the first episode of Westworld , fans have theorized about which behind-the-scenes DELOS employees might secretly be hosts . The most popular theory now is that Bernard is a host, with some people suggesting that he might have the consciousness of Arnold inside him .\nBut episode five of the series saw a confrontation between Ed Harris’ Man in Black and Anthony Hopkins’ Doctor Robert Ford which ended with the black-hat park guest making an accusation that Ford might have something under his skin other than flesh and bones. So it’s not a jump in logic that Ford might be a host created by Arnold, although with the showrunners having the question asked onscreen, I somehow doubt the obvious will be true. Nolan is great a misdirection, and I believe this comment was a brilliant example of that. But what if Ford is a host?\nReddit user _cianuro_ explains how Ford might be not only a host, but the center of the maze:\nI’ve been entertaining the idea that Ford is the host (that has figured out the maze, built himself a home, and made himself the master). While Arnold is the creator who fell at the hand of his creation — Ford. It would certainly explain why he has a backstory (the house and family) built.\nTeddy Flood has already explained that “the Maze is an old Native myth:”\nThe Maze itself is the sum of a man’s life. The choices he makes, the dreams he hangs onto. And there at the center there’s a legendary man who had been killed over and over again countless times. But always clawed his way back to life. The man returned for a last time to vanquish all his oppressors in a tireless fury. Built a house and around that house he built a maze so complicated only he could navigate through it. I reckon he’s seen enough fighting.\nThat explanation seems to support this theory. Metaphorically, Ford is the center of the park. He has a house that is hidden within the park and is the only character who can control all aspects of the park. Ford is like a God, able to control entire populations of hosts with a raise of a single finger. If he is a host, maybe he is communicating with the hosts over a wireless frequency.\nBut for this theory to work, it would mean that Ford would have had to replace himself as the head of the park with no one being able to tell, or perhaps, DELOS being in cooperation with the host version of Ford. Seems rather unlikely.\n\nDELOS Is Dante’s Inferno Someone on Reddit noticed that the map of DELOS Westworld behind the scene building bears a certain resemblance to the levels of Dante’s Inferno. VisceralMonkey theorizes that Mesa is purgatory and the further you go in, the worse the punishments with “each guest choosing their own punishment based on their behavior.”\nPeople die and they arrive in the park on a train with no memory of their deaths.\nAnd Ford is the devil and Arnold is the God who left him there, another biblical metaphor to add to the growing list. Most likely just a coincidence, or possibly a visual reference at best, but I thought the visual comparison was worth sharing.\nContinue Reading Westworld Theories >> The post Westworld Theories: Ford’s Father, The Maze, Elsie, Antartica, Sub Level C and More appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   11:00 AM \nDo you want to know what happens when you give a group of dummies a Ford Raptor and a motocross jump? Watch this video. I’m not sure whose idea it was to try a monster of a pickup truck on a dirt jump, but I don’t think anyone planned for this driver to hit the ramp going 50+ mph. What’s that bang you hear as the truck lands? Oh that’s just the sound of the suspension being destroyed as every one of those shocks explodes. I guess these springs weren’t made with the idea in mind that this truck might need to be jumped over 90 feet. \"Yeah, that was definitely too fast.\" \nNow despite all of that sarcastic criticism of this driver’s sheer stupidity, I’ve got to give credit where credit is due. He did survive and walk away from this jump with just a limp. And if I’m going to be honest, that Raptor is in much better shape than I expected. I know it didn’t end the way he expected , but the fact the cab was in good enough shape for his friends to easily drag him out shocked me. I guess all you can do is be thankful another dummy survived his own stupidity, and hope that like all of our other dummies, he hesitates to reproduce. \nCheck out more of our viral videos here .

      "text": "Technology News | Wed Nov 9, 2016 | 11:23am EST Ford vows to work with Trump after criticism of Mexico investments The Ford logo is seen at their plant in Cuatitlan Izcalli, Mexico October 18, 2016. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), which has endured scathing criticism from Donald Trump over its Mexican investments, on Wednesday congratulated him on his election victory and vowed to work with the president-elect. \n\"We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country, and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,\" Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said. \nTrump repeatedly said during the campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on Ford vehicles. \nFord shares dropped 2.6 percent to $11.18 on Wednesday. \nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs. \nAt his campaign kickoff speech in June 2015, Trump said he would call Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields to explain the \"bad news.\" \n\"Let me give you the bad news: Every car, every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax,\" Trump said then. \nEarlier this year, Ford said it will invest $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. In September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico. \nIn his final speech of the campaign early on Election Day in western Michigan, Trump returned to the theme. \"After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant ... We're not going to lose your jobs anymore,\" Trump said. \"We are going to bring back the automobile industry to Michigan, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\" \nLast month, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive criticism of the automaker's investments in Mexico. Ford noted the automaker has hired 26,000 and invested $12 billion in the United States since 2011. \nBill Ford was in India on Wednesday after the company announced it will invest 13 billion rupees ($195 million) over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said it will hire 3,000 people to staff the facility, which will be operational by early 2019. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "Need to catch up? Check out last week’s Westworld recap here.\nAs it turns out, Westworld ‘s Dr. Robert Ford is a real family man.\nOne caveat: The reclusive scientist’s “family” is a bunch of offline hosts based on his deceased relatives (and, as we guessed earlier, himself), living in a far-off sector of the park, who ignore all voice commands except for his. He calls them “ghosts,” and the eccentric designer prides himself on the fact that he added a bit of jerkiness/menace to his father-figure ‘bot (which was designed by his old partner, Arnold) in order to make him more lifelike.\nRELATED TVLine Items: Defenders Cast Teaser, Westworld Meets This Is Us and More\nCan’t wait for the Ford family Christmas card!\nThat’s only one of the WTF?! moments from this week’s episode, titled “The Adversary,” which also finds:\n* Maeve getting wise (and then getting really wise)\n* Teddy revealing potentially scary hidden depths\n* Ford making a jarring discovery\nRELATED Any Given Wednesday Cancelled: HBO Quickly Axes Bill Simmons Talk Show\n* Theresa taking swift and definite action in several sectors of her life (she dumps Bernard, but that’s not even the half of it)\n* The complete absence of William and Dolores (not to mention El Lazo)\n* One character waxing poetic about the mysterious maze and what it means\n* Many characters wondering about Arnold’s presence in the contemporary park\n* Lee getting into a literal pissing match with the park\nClick through the photo gallery above on the right to learn more about these — and more — puzzle pieces from the episode, then hit the comments with your theories on how they all fit together!\nLaunch Gallery: <I>Westworld</I> Episode 6's WTF?!

      "text": "Why Mission and Vision Statements Seldom Drive Discussion -- and Why That Should Change Corona Crosshairs \nAmong the most vulnerable companies under the incoming Trump administration is Constellation, which derives about 70% of its profit is from importing Corona and Modelo beer into the U.S. That could get more expensive if Trump imposes tariffs or alters trade agreements with Mexico, according to Susquehanna. \nLess than two weeks ago, Constellation announced the $600 million purchase of a brewery in Mexico. On Monday, when it looked more likely that Hillary Clinton would win, Constellation shares had their biggest rally since April. The company has an investor day on Wednesday. \nWhen Trump launched his campaign in 2015, he referred to Mexicans who had crossed the U.S. border as drug dealers and rapists. Companies such as Macy’s Inc. and NBCUniversal reacted by severing ties with the real estate developer for fear of offending the U.S. Latino community. For those companies, it was an easy choice because Latinos are a growing, upwardly mobile group that brands are increasingly targeting. Fluctuating Peso \nBecause Trump has assailed Mexico, its currency has fluctuated along with his chances of victory. As polls showed him gaining ground on Clinton in the final weeks of the campaign, the peso weakened. A central banker there has said a Trump presidency would be a “hurricane” for Mexico’s economy. After Trump’s victory, the peso tumbled more than 9%. \nA faltering peso would hurt the results of foreign companies operating in Mexico by making sales there less valuable. The NAFTA railway is integral to trade, especially for automakers who have expanded manufacturing capacity in Mexico over the past few years because of cheaper labor. Many ship parts to Mexico and send back assembled cars to the U.S. for sale. \nThe impact could be felt as far away as in Japan. Nissan Motor Co. is the top-selling auto brand in Mexico, with a market share of 26% last year. Other top vehicle producers there include General Motors Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Volkswagen AG and Ford. Mazda Motor Corp. builds small cars in the country for its own brand and for Toyota Motor Corp., which plans to open a Corolla plant in 2019. \nOther companies that would be closely watching the peso’s fluctuations include Spanish lender Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, which makes two-fifths of its profit in Mexico. Dutch brewer Heineken NV counts Mexico among its top three markets. Engineering firm Obrascon Huarte Lain SA, gaming company Codere SA and Stabilus SA, a German maker of gas springs, all generate at least 20% of their revenue from the country. \nKansas City Southern Chief Financial Officer Michael Upchurch was asked about the risk of a Trump presidency last week. He said legal counsel has told the company that a president can exit a trade deal but that changing the tariff rates would require an act of Congress. \n“This trade agreement has been good for a lot of companies doing business not only in Mexico, but in the U.S.,” Upchurch said during an investor presentation. “There are a lot of products that we move south into Mexico. Mexico is the largest buyer of U.S. corn.” Ford Threatened \nTrump has also threatened to slap a 35% tariff on any cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. The automaker in September said it was moving small-car production from a factory in Michigan to Mexico, a move Trump attacked in the first answer of the first debate. The auto industry presumes that any tariff imposed on Ford will apply to all carmakers. \nWhile permanent tariffs require congressional approval, a president can impose them unilaterally to protect domestic industries from unfair behavior by a foreign country, according to Donald Grimes, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor, Employment and the Economy at the University of Michigan. President George W. Bush took such action on imported steel. \n“Trump could impose a large tariff on vehicles and parts coming in from Mexico,” Grimes said before the election. “This would clearly hurt the profitability of the auto industry in the short run. The companies would respond to those tariffs by moving the location of plants that mostly export to the U.S. to other countries, such as Vietnam and China. The plants would not return to the U.S. There are just too many other low-labor cost countries around the world.” Cuba Too \nPresident-elect Trump may also have a profound effect on another Latin American country. He’s criticized President Barack Obama’s easing of trade relations with Cuba, which has enabled airlines like Southwest Airlines Co. and JetBlue Airways Corp. to enter new markets there. \n“If the government regulations are that we cannot fly to Cuba, we will not fly to Cuba,” Andrew Watterson, Southwest’s senior vice president network and revenue, said in an interview before the election. “It’s that simple. It’s not material to our business. We think it’s a very exciting opportunity, so certainly as long as its allowed, we’ll continue to prosecute it and offer that to our customers.” \nAnother side effect of Trump making good on deporting millions of illegal immigrants is that they make up big portions of the workforce in U.S. industries like construction and agriculture. U.S. homebuilders such as D.R. Horton and PulteGroup Inc. are already suffering from a labor shortage that’s increased costs and slowed construction. Conservative estimates put the proportion of construction jobs now held by undocumented workers at 14%. \nMass deportations would translate into “fewer homes built in an industry already short in terms of housing supply,” Mark Boud, chief economist at the Washington-based research company Hanley Wood, said earlier this year. \nFor the construction industry, he said, it “would be devastating.”",

      "text": "(Adds comment from Ford, updates stock prices)\nNov 9 (Reuters) - The election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president puts new pressure on automakers and other manufacturers that have come to depend on open trade with Mexico and now face the risk of higher costs.\nAutomakers could also take a hit if instability in financial markets undercuts consumer confidence in the United States and other major markets at a time when their U.S. sales growth has stalled.\nU.S. stocks were up in late morning trade after Trump's unexpected win. But shares of major U.S. automakers and suppliers fell, with declines of 4.0 percent for General Motors Co, 1.4 percent for Ford Motor Co and 3.5 percent for Tesla Motors Inc.\nShares of Japanese automakers, which also rely on Mexico as a production hub for the U.S. market, slid more sharply than the benchmark Nikkei index. Toyota Motor Corp closed down 6.5 percent; Nissan Motor Co Ltd, down 6.0 percent and Honda Motor Co, down 7.8 percent. All three companies declined to comment.\nShares of Canada's Magna International Inc, whose Mexican operations account for about 14 percent of sales, fell 6 percent.\nU.S. manufacturing groups and companies on Wednesday said they wanted to work with the new administration.\n\"This election makes clear that Americans agree that manufacturing is the nation's priority,\" said the National Association of Manufacturers, a Washington trade group representing about 1,100 companies. \"It will be up to us to channel that enthusiasm towards the right policies.\"\nThe group has criticized President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on issues such as labor regulation and healthcare.\nTrump's promise to reject or renegotiate trade deals resonated with voters in industrial states, even though many experts raised doubts that the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement would be repealed.\nTrump made an attack on the outsourcing of American auto jobs to Mexico a recurrent theme in his campaign, a message that rallied blue-collar workers while threatening to upend the business assumptions behind billions of dollars in planned investment by the auto industry.\nTENSION OVER FORD PLANTS\nIn announcing his campaign in June 2015, Trump vowed to block Ford from opening a new plant in Mexico and threatened to impose tariffs on cars it shipped back across the border.\nBut those moves would force U.S. consumers to pay higher prices for vehicles, said Charles Chesbrough, senior economist at the Detroit-based Original Equipment Suppliers Association trade group.\n\"(Trump's) trade policies could add $5,000 or more to the price of a small car from Mexico,\" Chesbrough said.\nU.S. vehicle manufacturers and many of their suppliers have based billions of dollars of investment on relatively open trade with Mexico, China and other countries.\nFord in April announced plans to invest $1.6 billion to expand production of small cars in Mexico. Trump took aim at that move as well as GM's plans to invest $5 billion there.\nGM said in a statement on Wednesday that it \"looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and the new Congress on policies that support a strong and competitive U.S. manufacturing base.\"\nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said: \"We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country - and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs.\"\nIn September, Ford said it would shift small-car production from U.S. plants to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from Trump.\n\"We shouldn't allow it to happen,\" Trump said.\nThe company said its decision to build new vehicles in Mexico would not cost U.S. jobs.\nFord Executive Chairman Bill Ford last month said he met with Trump to discuss criticism from the candidate but called the discussion \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating.\" Ford said his company employed more people at its U.S. plants than any other automaker.\nBetween 1994 and 2013, the number of auto factory jobs dropped by a third in the United States and rose almost fivefold in Mexico as lower-wage production boomed.\nMexico now accounts for 20 percent of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in investment from the industry since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.\nBased on current investment plans, Mexico's auto production capacity will grow by another 50 percent over the next five years, said the center, which draws funding from the industry.\n\"Dismantling NAFTA at this point would be pretty hard to do,\" said Kristin Dziczek, the center's director of industry, labor and economics.\n(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit and Meredith Davis in Chicago; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Naomi Tajitsu in Tokyo; Writing by Joe White; Editing by Kevin Krolicki and Lisa Von Ahn)",

      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 12 images from this gallery. \nDuring SEMA 2016, California outfit Timeless Kustoms unveiled their new 1965 Ford Mustang custom. Aptly dubbed “Vicious,” the 1,000-horsepower rebuild is in turn just that.\nFirst off, the original roof from the Mustang was removed, while the body was notably revised, and then a custom Art Morrison chassis with Ridetech Triple Adjustable coilovers, taken from a Corvette, was implemented.\nUnder the hood, you will now find a twin-charged Ford Performance 5.1-liter Aluminator engine built by Modular Motorsports. That, powered with twin-turbochargers from Precision Turbo and a Magnuson MP2300 TVS Supercharger, equates to the aforementioned 1,000 horsepower.\nAdditional details include a high-flow exhaust system, Brembo 15.5-inch carbon ceramic rotors, six-piston front calipers and four-piston rear calipers, and EMCO Gears CG46 sequential six-speed transmission.\nLastly, “Vicious” is highlighted by 19-inch GT3C wheels from Forgeline and large Kumho V720 tires.\nFor more slick custom rides, take a look at Singer’s two new ’70s-inspired Porsche 911s. \n",

      "title": "Ford Fiesta",
      "text": "John Voelcker Senior Editor \nThe Ford Fiesta is a 4-door hatchback or 5-door sedan, the smallest car Ford currently offers in the U.S. \nBrand-new in the 2011 model year, Fiesta still scores with endearing road manners and good features. \nThe Fiesta can be configured in many ways; there's a 4-cylinder, a stronger and more fuel-efficient   model, and the high-performance Fiesta ST. \nWith the Fiesta, Ford competes with the likes of the Toyota Yaris, Kia Rio, Honda Fit, Mazda 2, Hyundai Accent, and in some versions even the Mini Cooper or Fiat 500. \nFor 2017, the Fiesta Titanium gets a new standard dual-clutch transmission and new colors. \nMORE: Read our 2016 Ford Fiesta review The Fiesta badge was first used in the U.S. on a subcompact three-door hatchback sold from 1978 to 1980. Ford followed that car with the Mazda-designed Festiva 3-door (1986-1993) and then replaced it with the related Aspire three-door (1994-1997), which was built by Kia. Today's Fiesta, which debuted for the 2011 model year, is Ford's first new subcompact entry since the Aspire. It was adapted for U.S. sales from a model already sold in Europe. Ford was right to change the name of its subcompact again, as it offers better performance and more standard equipment—not to mention a greater number of safety features—than any of its American predecessors ever did. The revived Fiesta is wholly different from the typical economy car. Today's Fiesta is fully modern, with the features, handling, powertrains, and looks to make it a real competitor. The interior's interesting (if not universally loved) styling also helps set it apart from its price-minded roots. The Fiesta's narrow body and tight backseat keep it from being as useful as some other vehicles in this class, especially compared to the cavernous interior of the Versa sedan or the flexible Fit. In reviews of the Fiesta, though, we noted that it steers and handles far better than most of the numb, soft appliance-like vehicles in the class. The two Fiestas on opposite ends of the spectrum are both available only with a manual transmission. On the efficient end, the 1.0-liter, 3-cylinder model makes 123 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. It achieves a 42-mpg EPA highway rating and is more fun than the standard engine to boot. On the serious performance end, there's the Fiesta ST, which packs a 1.6-liter turbo-4 making 197 hp and 214 lb-ft of torque. It also has a near-perfect, stiffer suspension setup, grippy tires, and an all-around fun demeanor. A 120-hp, 1.6-liter base continues to power most Fiesta models. A 5-speed manual gearbox is standard, but the automatic option is an unusual and technically advanced 6-speed “PowerShift” dual-clutch gearbox. We have experienced a few drivability issues with the PowerShift transmission, which isn't as smooth as we'd hoped. Engine noise in the earlier cars was also an issue, but the later models are a bit better. A mild refresh for the 2014 model year gave the Fiesta revised front-end styling that takes the look from cute to a little more serious. It also added the 1.0-liter 3-cylinder EcoBoost model, expanding the list of available powertrains. The 2014 model year also brought the outstanding Fiesta ST model, with its peppy turbo 1.6-liter and dialed-in chassis. Ford introduced a softer look inside, complemented by a stripped-down version of MyFord Touch, based on the SYNC Bluetooth-driven infotainment controller. Unfortunately not all versions dropped the confusing, slanted-button array of the base audio setup. Sync 3 replaced the controversial MyFord Touch for 2016. It comes with a 6.5-inch touchscreen and promises to be more intuitive and less buggy than MyFord Touch. Other 2016 changes consisted of a new SE Black Package and a few new color choices. The model lineup continues as it has since 2013, with S, SE, and Titanium trims, with the addition of the sporty ST. Features are a strength of the Fiesta. Even the base model includes air conditioning and an aux-in port; while at the SE level you get upgraded trim and lighting, as well as cruise control and power windows. The Titanium model gets leather heated seats, automatic climate control, heated side mirrors, the new Sync 3 infotainment system, Sony premium audio, and other extras that make it feel far better equipped than you might expect in a low-cost small car. Options include a power moonroof and Ford Racing wheels. Among other novel features, the Fiesta driver can choose from several different colors of LED “mood lighting” to illuminate the cupholders, footwells, and other interior bits. The Fiesta is now one of the older entries in its segment. The Chevrolet Sonic, Honda Fit, Nissan Versa, and Toyota Yaris have all are debuted or been redesigned since the Fiesta was new. Pricing for the Fiesta starts around $15,000, but a fully decked-out standard model can approach $24,000, and an ST can add another $2,000.",

Puskar, File) Bayer \nWerner Baumann, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Management of Bayer AG Business reacts to Trump victory, vows to work with president-elect From news services ( … ) +1 \nThis file photo taken on Feb. 14, 2013 shows the Ford logo. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)   \nUpdated at 11:15 a.m. \nA number of major corporations reacted Wednesday to Donald   election victory. \n• Ford Motor Co, the second largest U.S. automaker that has endured scathing criticism from Donald Trump over its Mexican investments, on Wednesday vowed to work with the new president-elect. \n\"We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country — and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,\" Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said. Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on Ford vehicles. \n• General Motors said it looks forward to working with president-elect Donald Trump, new Congress on \"policies that support a strong and competitive U.S. manufacturing base.\" \nIn a statement, the company said: \"GM congratulates both candidates and parties on their hard-fought campaigns. GM looks forward to working with President-elect Donald J. Trump and the new Congress on policies that support a strong and competitive U.S. manufacturing base. GM will continue to do its part to transform the future of mobility and contribute to America's competitive strength.\" \n• U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue vowed to help Trump. \"The Chamber and its members stand ready help the new administration and the next Congress unite our country around a mission we believe all Americans can support-to grow our economy, create jobs, and lift incomes for all citizens,\" the organization, which calls itself the world's biggest business federation, said in an email. \n• Business Roundtable President John Engler, in a statement, said the nation's business leaders \"are eager to begin working with the new administration and incoming congressional leadership to accelerate economic growth and spur job creation.\" \n“President-elect Trump has embraced rebuilding America’s infrastructure, fundamentally reforming the anti-growth U.S. tax structure and bringing common sense to federal regulation. These are key pro-growth policies, critical to new innovation and investment. America’s business leaders fully support these priorities.\" \nThe Business Roundtable is an organization of top corporate CEOs , including heads of companies with St. Louis operations, such as Tim Wentworth of Express Scripts, Mark Trudeau of Mallinckrodt, and Glenn Kellow of Peabody Energy. \n• JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon called on employees, business leaders and government officials to work together on solutions to the United States' problems on Wednesday, in response to the surprise presidential election results. \nIn a memo to employees, Dimon cited a \"deep desire for change\" and a frustration with the economy among the electorate, which voted Republican candidate Donald Trump into office.",

      "text": "Run Defense Losses : 6 Run Defense Neutral : 18 I’m not going to harp on Ford’s pass rush productivity much, because he’s had good games in the past. It’s just worth noting that nine total snaps where Ford either pressured, hit, or sacked Blake Bortles is a really, really high number on 40 rushes. That said, it’s the WAY Ford was winning that caught my eye. I noticed two differences in Ford’s pass rushing from what I’ve observed his entire time with the Chiefs. The first of which is potentially career-altering for him, the second less so but also quite important. Change No. 1: Dee Ford is getting bend around the edge In case you don’t know what I mean by bend, here’s a great article about pass rushers that explains the concept in detail . Basically, it’s the concept of a rusher being able to plant his feet and move laterally around the edge of the kick-sliding offensive tackle toward the quarterback. You need flexibility to be able to do this, and it’s imperative that you get low and parallel to the ground (think Derrick Thomas practically running horizontally at times). The more upright you are, the easier it is for a tackle to shove you out of the play despite being behind after the first step. Ford has never, as far as I’ve seen, demonstrated bend as a pass rusher. Time and again we’ve talked about it as his primary weakness as a rusher and the reason he kept getting sent wide around the quarterback. Tackles knew that even if he got a step on them (with that truly marvelous first step of his) the just had to move their feet quickly and wait on him trying to run around them upright. They would then give him a shove and he’d sail 3-4 yards past the quarterback. I have always thought of the flexibility required for bend to be a natural trait. You either have it (like Von Miller) or you don’t (like Dee Ford). Apparently, I don’t know anything. Let’s look at that first gif’d play up close. This is what's changed with Ford's speed rush. Look at him getting bend around the edge and turning the corner. I guess you CAN learn it. pic.twitter.com/pOrysYJK9x — Seth Keysor (@RealMNchiefsfan) November 8, 2016 Watch Ford’s second through fifth steps there. While this isn’t some kind of DT highlight film, there is noticeable bend as he shortens his path around the edge to the quarterback after destroying the tackle with his first step. Take a closer look My exceptional artwork demonstrates the change. In the past, Ford would have been close to a 90 degree angle and trying to run around the tackle. Think of how much more leverage Ford has at the angle he’s at, and how much easier it is to plant and drive directly towards the quarterback. Try to imagine him upright here. Think there’s any chance he gets to the QB? I don’t. This wasn’t a one-time occurrence, either. Ford was demonstrating some bend (as well as hand fighting, which we’ll talk about soon) throughout the game. Here's why Ford's inside moves can be so effective... the T has to worry about getting left in the dust in a split second every single snap. pic.twitter.com/tvQ6gL4uLz — Seth Keysor (@RealMNchiefsfan) November 8, 2016 Again, when you watch that play, try to imagine what it would look like if Ford were upright. He’d lose all leverage and wouldn’t be able to plant and turn to the QB. I don’t think he’d even notch a pressure. I asked around on Twitter and other places to people I respect with regards to pass rushing, asking if bend is something people really CAN develop. The general answer I got is that while players don’t usually improve on it, if you’ve got the physical talent you can develop you balance with improved footwork and repetitions. Additionally, players learn how to lean on offensive tackles in order to maintain their balance around the edge, which is something I have definitely seen Ford doing as of late. Basically, you use the guy blocking you as a prop to help you get to the quarterback faster. Doesn’t that make you feel warm and fuzzy inside? Dee Ford getting some bend around the edge, when combined with his exceptional first step, makes him much more of a threat to go screaming around the edge. That threat sets up other moves, which leads me to the next change I’ve seen from Ford. Change No. 2: Ford is pass rushing with a plan It used to be that Ford would try to speed rush over and over again, and if that wasn’t working he’d attempt to convert it into a bull rush. Every now and then he’d dust something off like a spin move or a rip, but the vast majority of the time Ford just didn’t have a counter when he couldn’t get to the edge. It didn’t look like he had a plan so much as he’d think, “I’ll just go around him ... dang, he’s in the way, I’ll try to push him.” Not so anymore, at least not against the Jaguars. There, Ford was using complimentary moves to go along with his newly discovered bendy (definitely not a real football term) edge rush. I've seen Dee Ford use this move more lately. Get OT sliding then cut back using inside arm to shove OT aside. Very effective w/ speed rush. pic.twitter.com/hY2ycyPdAo — Seth Keysor (@RealMNchiefsfan) November 8, 2016 This is basically a counter for when the tackle does a good job keeping his feet in front of you. Ford (from both the left and the right side) will get his inside arm on the tackle and shove. This accomplishes two things: it increases the already-moving tackle’s momentum backward, and it helps propel Ford forward. Again, using the blocker’s body as a tool in your rush. Jacksonville’s right tackle had absolutely no answer for this whatsoever. Ford is just too quick jumping inside when you’re already trying desperately to keep him from going OUTSIDE. Ford seems to be employing less bull rush (though I saw that used at times, and occasionally effectively as the tackle was already off balance) and is more going to the Dadi Nicolas school of pass rushing: beating them with quickness rather than strength. It’s a good plan, as Ford is ridiculously athletic and not particularly strong. Keeping tackles from getting their hands on him is far more advantageous than trying to engage them directly the way Justin Houston does. Ford kept going back and forth between speed rushes and inside moves, employing a lot of hand fighting along the way. This is an area Ford improved on prior to recently in my opinion. It just didn’t matter as much when Ford could win the hand fighting battle as he wasn’t turning the corner fast enough to keep the tackle from staying between him and the quarterback. Like everything else, this aspect of Ford’s game looks significantly better when accompanied by some bend around the edge. And even though he doesn’t use it much, Ford can employ an absolutely vicious spin move. I know he didn't get pressure due to help from the guard but SWEET MOSES LOOK AT THAT SPIN MOVE. pic.twitter.com/0lF9sVUDaj — Seth Keysor (@RealMNchiefsfan) November 9, 2016 This play shows you the difference between a win and a play where a pressure, hit or sack is obtained. Ford absolutely destroys his blocker, but doesn’t get to the QB because the right guard gets in front of him in the nick of time. Had he not done so, Ford would’ve had a free run at Bortles. Like I said, Ford rarely employs the spin move. But it’s important that he use it at least a time or two a game if he wants to be a pass rusher with a plan. You want the tackle to be constantly guessing wrong as to what move you’re throwing at him. And Ford, at least right now, definitely looks like a man with a plan. The final note on Ford is that his run defense is not what I’d like to see in an outside linebacker, BUT it’s not nearly bad enough to offset how good he’s been getting after the quarterback. Ford was part of several 8-10 yard gains due to getting washed out or walled off by blockers (including tight ends one-on-one, which should not happen), but he wasn’t the biggest culprit in Chris Ivory going bananas. With Ford, run defense seems more about effort than ability. He’s not a strong player, but at times he set the edge very well against a big right tackle. Other times, he’d let a tight end push him around and wall him off. It was very inconsistent. Ford did have a few nice run snaps, including one stuff where he used a DJ-like stutter step to avoid the tackle and hit the runner for no gain. When Ford seems fired up against the run, he was... passable. Not good. Not average. But not crippling. He needs to maintain that effort though, as he doesn’t have Houston’s monstrous natural strength. All told, Ford’s film against Jacksonville was even more impressive than watching him live. The two big changes (especially the bend he’s showing) are both things that should, if they keep up, drastically affect his consistency as a pass rusher. I’m crossing my fingers and holding my breath, because if he keeps doing what he’s been doing lately (not just beating tackles, but doing it in a way that can be replicated consistently), Ford will absolutely continue to produce a ton of pressure for the Chiefs. What does that mean with Houston’s return and Chris Jones’s emergence as a legitimate interior pass rusher? Well, hopefully bad things for everyone else. More From Arrowhead Pride",

      "text": "Email \nAsia Ford had always been overweight. She was even born 12 pounds. But she didn’t let her history determine her future. It was one night in her kitchen that changed her life forever. \n“If I have learned anything about weight loss, it is that losing weight is a day to day and oftentimes an hour by hour journey,” Asia says on her GoFundMe page. “One that I have been on for 2 years. I have had many ups and I have had many downs. I decided to take control of my health once I watched my children’s father lose not one, but two of limbs due to diabetes as a result of his obesity. Every time we went to the doctor, my 3 children would worry about me. There is nothing like seeing the worry on your children’s faces and you know they are wondering, ‘will my mother be around to see me go to my prom, graduate, watch me get married, have my own children?’ On the path I was going, tipping the scale at over 500 lbs, the answer was certainly a no and I knew I had to change.” My Story: \"Chiseling My Physique Like It's Art\" \nOver the past three years, Asia lost over 250 pounds. “I didn’t want to die,” confesses Ford on a recent episode of the TDJakes talk show. “My ex-husband three years ago cut his finger in the kitchen and because he was diabetic it turned into an infection and he lost his hand to amputation. And my daughter, who thought her father was a hero, looked at me and asked ‘is daddy going to be alright?’ and I didn’t know the answer.” \nAfter she found out that her husband was going to be alright after losing his limbs, Asia wanted to start something, but didn’t know what to do. So her co-worker got her in a fitness bootcamp when she was 507 pounds. She decided to run a 10K after the losing the first 100 pounds. \nThe photo taken at the finish line of the race went viral inspiring the entire city, even people across the country and the globe. (photo credit: youtube.com) Bullying Affects Everyone: What You Need To Know To Prevent & Stop Bullying \nIt shows Ford struggling to cross the finish line but fast forward to now and you may not recognize her. \n“I’m over 200 pounds lighter, I feel a whole lot better,” said Ford when she finished the same race a year later. “I was what you call a closet eater,” confesses Asia. “I’d eat small portions at restaurants, but then knew I was hungry and would eat [later.]” \nWhen describing her first 10K, Ford gets a little teary-eyed. “There was a moment where I put my head down and started crying, started to kind of tear up, within a matter of seconds my hand kind of raised and without even being able to see it, I kind of clenched on to this hand,” said Ford. \nThat hand belonged to Lt. Aubrey Gregory who got out of his car when he saw Asia struggling. Page 1 of 2",

      "text": "Back to Top Post by Geordie on Aug 26, 2016 22:21:26 GMT Hmmm. So I'm not a Ford fan. I've had over 50 cars. Amongst those, one Ford, and that was a loathsome Mk3 Escort. That car took it upon itself to ignore the key in the ignition, and decide itself when it would go. And when it wouldn't. Trips through the Tyne Tunnel were undertaken after crossing fingers, placing a piece of lucky heather under the seat and speaking nicely to the car whilst caressing the steering wheel and dash top in a 'I love you and please don't stop' kind of way. Don't get me wrong. I like looking at old Sierras, Capri's, XR2's etc. But I'm just not a Ford guy. So this purchase has surprised me more than anyone. I have got to know a nice fella around the NE classic car shows. He shows his Ford Probes. Has six of them, and a nice chap he is too. I had a sit in one of his Probes a few months back, and was pleasantly surprised. Pop up lights. Unusual. Mazda V6 lump. Ticked a few boxes. So, this particular one? It came onto my radar quite by chance on Facebook. Only 2 owners. The seller had basically had it stored away for about four years, other than getting it out for an MOT each year. It had been owned by a dear friend of his, and he'd passed away from cancer four years ago, and he was sorry to see it go, but he was relocating down South for work reasons. I went to see it on a horrible day. Heavy rain fell as I looked round it. Yes, I'm fully aware that it's the worst thing you can do, as the rain hides the bad bits, but I had no choice. Looked straight and solid, started (with a jump), ticked over nicely, and drove pretty well. Felt like it was holding back a bit, but I put that down to lack of use and needing the cobwebs blowing out. These are becoming quite a rare sight on UK roads now, with only about 600 24v's left registered. So, seeing as I like things that are slightly unusual, the deal was done.
