      "text": "About global storage management Over the years, business enterprises worldwide have become increasingly dependent on technology. We expect this trend to intensify.Storage management is the process of enhancing the efficiency of electronic data storage. It monitors and tracks the performance of storage areas, which enables optimization and proactive management of storage devices. In addition, it maximizes the capacity of storage systems. Thus, storage management helps enterprises discover unused storage space and invalid data so that the latter can be shifted to alternative locations. The technology also helps streamline future storage requirements. The importance of storage management is increasing due to the growing complexity of computing and enterprise data. For instance, the volume of enterprise data is growing at more than 60% annually, and this burgeoning growth requires newer approaches to address its complexity.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan IBM set to treble UK cloud data centre capacity in 2017 Big Blue set to open four new data centres with cognitive services as part of \"long-standing commitment\" to the UK. \nIBM is set to expand its UK prescence with four new facilities. Image: IBM \nIBM is set to triple its cloud data centre capacity in the UK, with expansion and investment plans which will add four new facilities to the two already located within the country. \nThe company said the new facilities underscore a \"long-standing commitment\" to the UK. \nThe move will see IBM Cloud expand its data centre capacity to a total of 16 centres across Europe. The announcement follows a better than expected third quarter for IBM , which saw its cloud as a service revenue reach $7.5 billion. \nThe first of the four new data centres is due to open in Fareham, Hampshire by the end of December this year, with a further three set to open across the country in 2017. One of these will also be in Hampshire, but in Farnborough, while the two other locations won't be revealed until next year. \nThe expansion will give UK clients greater control over how they manage data and run their businesses in the cloud, IBM said, as it continues to \"invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and Blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security,\" said Robert LeBlanc, senior vice president of IBM Cloud. \nThe six data centres - part of IBM's portfolio of over 50 facilities across the globe - will provide customers with access to over 150 digital services and APIs. Those include the Watson cognitive computing platform and the ability to deploy Blockchain payment applications . They will also enable customers to deploy technologies for more widely used applications like big data analytics - all scalable via the use of cloud computing. \n\"We saw early signs of demand from clients and have been addressing this through our continued investment in the UK and Europe, a plan of investment which was decided many years ago,\" said Helen Kelisky, VP of Cloud IBM UK & Ireland \n\"The expansion strengthens IBM's ability to bring clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run their businesses and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud.\" \nThe data centre expansion will see IBM lease space with Ark Data Centres, the government's joint venture partner for delivering public sector data centre services across the Crown Hosting Framework. The framework, based in the same Ark facility, is already used across the public sector. \nUK clients of IBM Cloud currently include Boots, Dixons Carphone, the National Grid and the Wimbledon tennis championships .

      "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Global IT group IBM <IBM.N> will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union.\nIBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud.\nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing.\n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview.\nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision.\n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said.\nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc.\nCompanies including Google <GOOGL.O> and Facebook <FB.O> have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people.\nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment.\nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled.\nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.\n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter)",

      "text": "Business News | Tue Nov 22, 2016 | 7:48am GMT IBM invests in UK data centres as tech sector defies Brexit worries The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company IBM (IBM) is seen on a computer screen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 22, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nLONDON Global IT group IBM ( IBM.N ) will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. \nIBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fuelled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. \nCompanies including Google ( GOOGL.O ) and Facebook ( FB.O ) have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. \n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter) Next In Business News ",

      "text": "Brexit's good for tech, Brexit's bad for tech Google, Facebook and IBM are reaping the pre-Article-50 PR opportunities. Save Gail Orenstein/NurPhoto via Getty Images \nEver since 52 percent of referendum voters helped decide that life would be better outside of the European Union, Britain's economic future has been less than certain. The government continues to insist \"Brexit means Brexit\" and is attempting to negotiate trade terms before invoking Article 50 early next year, leaving markets and statisticians to estimate its true impact. \nWhile those talks are held behind closed doors, some of the world's biggest technology companies -- Google, Facebook and IBM -- have seized the opportunity and confirmed their commitment to the UK. \"Leavers\" may see it as justification of their vote, but there's more to these announcements than meets the eye. \nIt started when Google CEO Sundar Pichai visited London last week and announced plans to bring VR to one million UK schoolchildren . He later followed that up with updated plans for its new London HQ in Kings Cross . With help from Heatherwick Studio and Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), Google's first \"wholly owned\" building outside of the US will be constructed in the capital, creating up to 3,000 new jobs. \nFacebook's commitment to the UK came yesterday with a promise to hire 500 workers when it opens its new London HQ in Fitzrovia next year. Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's European chief, underlined Britain's importance as a tech centre and that it's \"an important part of Facebook's story.\" When its new offices open next year, the company will employ a total of 1,500 people in the UK. \nToday, IBM announced it will triple the number of its datacentres (from two to six) in the UK, allowing it \"keep pace with growing client demand\" and underscore its \"long-standing commitment to providing innovative solutions to the UK.\" The company didn't note the referendum in its statement, but IBM Europe's General Manager for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, told Reuters that \"everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit.\" \nAll three announcements can easily be positioned as pro-Brexit, confirmation that tech giants aren't phased by the UK's current economic status. Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan are happy to proclaim that \"Britain is open for business.\" Yet another endorsement of a UK free of EU regulation as a tech hub for the world — jamie martin (@jamieamartin1) November 21, 2016 \nBefore the vote, UK tech was earmarked as one of the industries that would experience the brunt of the impact. In fact, when we asked 50 technology companies that are either based in the UK or have large operations there, only one (Dyson) supported the Leave campaign. \nSkeptics will also be aware that Google's Kings Cross redevelopment has been on the books since 2013, when it spent $1.6 billion buying the land on which its new offices will reside. As for Facebook, it confirmed it was starting work on its new London HQ in September 2015. Both companies were committed to the UK months, if not years, before the EU referendum. \nBuilding offices is one thing, but finding skilled workers to fill them is another matter. \nBritain, more specifically London, is renowned for bringing in talent from across Europe, but its standing could be affected should the UK impose tougher immigration policies. Building offices is one thing, but finding skilled workers to fill them is another matter. \nAn average 15 percent fall in the value of the pound certainly makes hiring UK workers more cost-effective for Google and co. as a whole, but that same fall will make hiring non-UK talent hard: A £100,000 salary that used to be worth €140,000 is, at the time of writing, worth €117,000. With every aspect of Brexit, both sides can tout their own positives and negatives, but the reality is, until Article 50 is triggered, and the trade deals signed, no one really knows what the future has in store.

      "title": "IBM's Unlikely Silo Buster: An Intranet Radio Station | Fast Company | Business + Innovation",
      "text": "\nDuring daily programming, about 5,000 employees tune in, and they can talk about whatever they want. \n[Photo: flickr user derrickcollins ] Cale Guthrie Weissman 11.22.16 5:00 AM \nLast week, Miroslav Azis sat in a makeshift radio studio and waxed philosophic for an hour about an issue he often thinks about: the relevance of human-centered design. He hosts his weekly show, Public Services , on intranet-based IBM Radio. Broadcasting from IBM's offices in Austin, Azis discusses a range of \"complex, heady topics\" that often revolve around the deeper questions many technologists and designers think about. \"We have a lot of things we do in our everyday work,\" Azis says. \"But we don’t have time to think about those things.\" \nAlthough popularity of podcasts continues to grow (an estimated 98 million people are expected to tune in this year , according to Edison Research), the only people who can listen to Public Services are IBMers. Azis fits under that umbrella, having worked at the company for over three years as a designer. What the show creates, he asserts, is a way to feel more a part of the more than 370,000 -person global IBM juggernaut. \"This has really flattened the organizational structure,\" Azis says. IBM Radio creates a space for many people—from designers to executives—to take part, all on their own time. \"You meet people in other organization silos,\" he says. \nIBM Radio is a live-streamed intranet community station cofounded by Azis and a few other company designers in Austin. Over the last year, the station has blossomed, and now anyone else in the company can either listen in or record their own show. Those who take part consider it a community hub for the company, and IBMers around the world tune in every day. The Idea \nAzis and other designers wanted an internal outlet to share and discuss work. The original group was all on the creative side—all have music and/or college radio backgrounds—but they work on myriad IBM teams and hardly had the chance to talk with each other. Soon, they formed the idea of a radio station. \nAzis says the program \"came together overnight.\" After finding a bunch of spare servers in Raleigh, the group tinkered with some software to make it possible to broadcast live streams. Over the course of a day, they'd built a system that was able to transmit the content. IBM Radio was born, granting listening privileges to any employee within IBM's firewall. It’s a way for everyone at the company to listen in and discuss and learn about internal topics. \nToday, IBM offices throughout the globe have radio \"studios,\" although Austin is its headquarters. The station heads have a conference room there that’s been soundproofed and filled with recording equipment. \nIBM Radio runs nonstop from 9 a.m. Central until usually around 6 p.m. And it’s no longer merely design-centric. Employees from around the world contribute their own shows that include call-ins about career advice, a show that features weekly guests who talk about what’s going on at the company, and even shows where upper-level executives just tell interesting stories. The tie that binds is the internal workings of IBM. Azis says proudly that the radio station is meant for \"open discussions about what we want to talk about.\" Flattening The Organization \nAzis is considered a station manager, but he doesn’t get paid to keep the station afloat. Neither does anyone else who participates. This is just something that started for fun and has grown exponentially. \nThe company seems to have taken to it. The station tracks unique listeners—the number of individuals listening in—and found that it reaches between 5,000 and 6,000 people daily, according to Azis. While that’s a drop in the bucket compared to the overall size of IBM, it’s definitely more than just a few designers talking shop. Over the last year, more employees have begun to contribute their own shows to the weekly programming. Azis says there are no hard and set rules for program topics. Of course, they shouldn't talk about things too risqué, as managers could very likely be listening in. \"A safe space for people to hang out, have fun, and talk with each other.\" \nIn some ways, the radio station almost serves the purpose of a student union in college. The studio space in Austin is \"a safe space for people to hang out, have fun, and talk with each other,\" Azis says. \"This whole thing is about the community of people,\" he adds. \nUltimately the goal is to have the station broadcast 24 hours a day. That could prove challenging, given that it’s just a side project for all the people involved. However, employees in other countries (and time zones) have begun to take part, to include the U.K. and Singapore. \n\"We want to be able to talk product strategy, talk road maps,\" Azis maintains. The shows need to reflect the concert of people and roles at the company, he says, but as long as it stays behind the IBM firewalls and allows anyone to take part, the project persists. In the end, Azis says, \"this is for IBMers by IBMers.\" Never miss a story. Sign up for the Leadership newsletter and get the best stories delivered to your inbox daily. Send ",

      "text": "IBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. Global IT group IBM (IBM.N) will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union.\nIBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud.\nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing.\n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview.\nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision.\n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said.\nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc.\nCompanies including Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O) have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people.\nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment.\nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled.\nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.",

Gartner also judged each provider's execution in the market based on the evidence presented to Gartner analysts through formal presentations and ongoing communications from the providers outside the Magic Quadrant process. In addition, Gartner conducted a reference survey in which the providers' customers were asked to give feedback related to point services (for example, help desk and release management), and on the vendors' global expertise and level of skill in the delivery of services.\" Feedback from client interviews was also factored in. \nIn June, Garner recognized IBM as a Leader for the third consecutive year, and was positioned in the report for the fifth year in a row, for the Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites 2 \n1 – Gartner, Magic Quadrant for Managed Mobility Services, Worldwide, Katja Ruud , Leif-Olof Wallin , Eric Goodness , 27 October, 2016 \n2 – Gartner, Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suites , Rob Smith , Bryan Taylor , Chris Silva , Manjunath Bhat , Terrence Cosgrove , John Girard , 8 June 2016 \nGartner Disclaimer Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings.

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. IBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. IBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. IBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. Tech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fuelled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. Companies including Google and Facebook have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people. IBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. Brexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. Krause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. -Reuters",

      "text": "SHARES show chapters <p>Cloud moving from cost-saving to a platform for innovation: IBM</p> <p>Sebastian Krause, GM Cloud of Europe at IBM, says he believes there are plenty of opportunities in the U.K., specifically in the space of digital transformation. </p> 8 Hours Ago | 03:51 \nIBM is planning to triple its data center capacity in the U.K., the technology firm said on Tuesday, following the likes of Facebook and Google to commit investment to the country following the Brexit vote, as it looks to boost its challenge to rivals Amazon and Microsoft . \nIt marks IBM Cloud's largest commitment to one country at a single point in time though the company did not disclose the size of the investment. IBM is set to open four new data centers in Britain, which will bring its total to six. The first facility will open at the end of December with the other three going live in 2017. \nSebastian Krause, general manager for IBM Cloud in Europe, said that the U.K. is an \"attractive market\" to invest despite the country's decision to leave the European Union (EU). \n\"The growth rates for cloud in the U.K. should be around 25 percent … up to 2020, so it is a significant opportunity, specifically if you consider the European cloud market is about $100 billion in size … and the U.K. is approximately a third of that,\" Krause told CNBC in a TV interview on Tuesday. Sean Gallup | Getty Images A woman walks past the IBM logo \nAfter the results of the EU referendum in Britain on June 24, the pound has fallen around 17 percent against the dollar. But Krause said the devaluation of sterling was not a factor in IBM's decision to expand its data centers in Britain. \n\"We are evaluating areas where to invest in, we are observing the market quite intensely over time, so this decision has been evaluated for quite some time prior to the Brexit,\" Krause said. Changing legal requirements \nEven though Krause did not say the pound's weakness was a factor for investment, analysts said that it was likely to have played a part. But another major reason towards the investment is the \"huge demand\" for cloud services, according to Neil Campling, head of global technology, media, and telecoms research at Northern Trust Capital Markets. \n\"Data growth shows no sign of slowing,\" Campling told CNBC. \nThere is also a broader trend globally to have data stored locally or closer to businesses to comply with privacy and security laws, Campling added. \nKrause said that IBM's data center expansion will help it deal with any regulatory changes that requires localized data. \n\"Our policy and our strategy with regards to deploying data centers has always been to bring the data centers into the countries. So therefore, with six data centers in the future in the U.K. as well as 10 data centers in the rest of Europe… as well as more than 50 data centers around the world, I think we are very well prepared for those security discussions,\" Krause told CNBC. IBM focused on cloud \nIBM's investment follows notable other commitments by U.S. technology firms to the U.K. Last week, Google confirmed its plans to build a new London headquarters and generate 3,000 jobs. And on Monday, Facebook announced it would be boosting its U.K. headcount by 500. \nUnder chief executive Ginni Rometty, IBM has migrated toward cloud-based services offering users big data analytics tools and artificial intelligence (AI) through its machine learning platform known as Watson. IBM said cloud revenue jumped 44 percent in the third quarter of 2016. \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) – the e-commerce giant's cloud business – accounts for 45 percent of the worldwide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) market, eclipsing the combined share of Microsoft, IBM and Google, according to Synergy Research . IaaS is a form of cloud computing, which Amazon helped to create, that provides virtual computing resources online for the public. Amazon also leads in the Platform as a Service (PaaS) market which refers to cloud platforms that developers can build applications on top of. \nHowever, IBM is ahead in the managed private cloud market, according to Synergy Research, which is cloud services dedicated to a single organization rather than public. \nBut IBM is facing stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and even Alibaba. The latter announced on Monday that it is planning to launch four new data centers across the world. IBM UK clients \nOrganizations such as British retailer Boots as well as sporting tournament Wimbledon are already using IBM's cloud services and AI capabilities. \nAs part of the investment announcement, IBM also said that Thomson, part of the U.K.'s largest tour operator TUI, is using its AI platform Watson to trail a new virtual travel assistant in the form of a chatbot. Users can send messages to the bot and receive replies. \nIBM now has 16 data centers across Europe that form part of the firm's more than 50 facilities globally.",

      "text": "Contact(s) information \nArmonk, NY - 22 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced it has completed the acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, a global market-leading risk management and regulatory compliance consulting firm. The firm’s expertise and offerings directly address the standards for compliance implemented to ensure the integrity of the financial system, protect consumers and build trust through transparency. Promontory, combined with IBM's deep industry expertise and Watson’s cognitive capabilities, will directly address the massive operational effort and manual cost of constantly changing regulation and risk management requirements. With the completion of the acquisition, Promontory will help accelerate IBM’s development of cognitive solutions for risk and compliance.\nPromontory’s professionals will train Watson, which will learn by continuously ingesting regulatory information as it is created and through interaction in real-world applications. This includes solutions for tracking evolving regulatory obligations, expectations and control requirements, as well as solutions that address specific compliance needs, such as financial risk modeling, surveillance and insider threat, and financial crimes including counter fraud, anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC). \nThe acquisition complements IBM's Industry Platforms business, formed to develop open vertical platforms – the first comprehensive “as a service” offerings designed from the ground up for individual industries. These platforms will integrate IBM Cloud, Watson and capabilities from across digital ecosystems of specialized providers, and serve multiple clients in an industry – delivering dramatically reduced costs for outcomes spanning speed, quality, audit-ability, security and transparency. \nPromontory will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM. \nFor more information visit ibm.com/ Contact(s) information",

      "text": "Related resources \nYorktown Heights, N.Y. - 22 Nov 2016: President Barack Obama will award IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Fellow Emeritus Dr. Richard (Dick) L. Garwin the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the country, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors. Cited among his contributions are Dr. Garwin’s work on U.S. defense and intelligence technologies, low-temperature and nuclear physics, detection of gravitational radiation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computer systems, laser printing, and nuclear arms control and nonproliferation.\nThe award will be presented at a White House ceremony today and will be livestreamed at www.whitehouse.gov/live . \n“This is a fitting tribute for an exceptionally talented man who has dedicated himself to a lifetime of public service, including advising every U.S. President from Eisenhower to Obama,” said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director of IBM Research. “Dick exemplifies the values of IBM, working tirelessly on issues to help solve some of the world’s biggest problems and pushing the boundaries of knowledge in so many fields. We congratulate Dick on this well-deserved honor and draw inspiration from his dedication and spirit.” \nDr. Garwin joined IBM Research in 1952 as a physicist. During his more than 40-year career at IBM his work and discoveries spanned magnetic resonance, superconducting computers, silicon integrated circuit technology, laser printers and displays, gesture and gaze-controlled input to computers and devices, touchscreen monitors and more. In the 1990s he helped invent the “air-bag” technology used to protect hard disk drives in laptops. \nFrom 1965-1966, Dr. Garwin served as director of applied research at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center and was named an IBM Fellow in 1967, the company’s pre-eminent technical distinction. During his career with IBM, Dr. Garwin divided his time between his corporate responsibilities and his work as an expert in national intelligence and defense for the United States government. Since his official retirement in 1993, Dr. Garwin has remained very active with technology and policy issues as wide ranging as space satellites, nuclear arms control, healthcare and the environment. He continues to keep an office at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. \nIn 2003, he was recognized by the White House with the National Medal of Science for his research and discoveries in physics and his enduring contributions to national security. \nTo read more about Dr. Garwin’s career, visit the blog post: Dr. Richard L. Garwin: The Problem-Solver . \nAbout IBM Research \nFor more than seven decades, IBM Research has defined the future of information technology with more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs located across six continents. Scientists from IBM Research have produced six Nobel Laureates, 10 U.S. National Medals of Technology, five U.S. National Medals of Science, six Turing Awards, 19 inductees in the National Academy of Sciences and 20 inductees into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame.   about IBM Research, visit www.ibm.com/research .

      "text": "  09:05 AM EST Volume Releases World's First Commercial Cognitive Web Site Powered by IBM® Watson™ Next generation web interaction platform interacts with visitors in natural language. Wokingham, United Kingdom   \nDoes this mark the end of the traditional website, where visitors use cumbersome navigation bars, buttons and drop-down menus or spend arduous minutes finding the right answers to their questions? \nVolume’s Digital Concierge™, powered by IBM Watson™ uses Watson’s ‘conversations’ service to allow text-to-speech interaction between a human and a Smart Machine. \nThe cognitive application called ‘LUSY’ is trained in a single domain—the company, Volume. The aim is to provide all the information on the company through natural dialogue and Q&A. Volume’s Digital Concierge remembers returning visitors and can engage in chit-chat. The application ‘learns’ through every interaction and question, and only provides an answer when it reaches a level of confidence that this is correct. \nVolume’s CEO Chris Sykes states, \"It’s a bold move removing our corporate website for an AI application like our Digital Concierge. However, we needed to do this to amass all the questions it was being asked; whether on- or off-topic. Since its soft launch in October, the application has been asked over 16,000 questions. We learn from those and retrain the application, so it can answer more questions accurately and its domain knowledge grows. That’s the beauty of Watson-powered applications.\" \nVolume develops its AI-powered applications iteratively through agile software-development methodologies such as SCRUM. At the base layer it allows a human to have a relatively natural conversation with a machine. The next layer of cognitive services to be added will be able to detect ‘the mood of the customer’ and their character insights, which will dictate the type of content served up and its tone. The third layer is image- and voice-recognition to provide a more personalized customer experience. \nSykes comments, \"We have voice- and image-recognition capabilities right now. The problem we have at the moment is the quality of microphones and cameras in mainstream devices. The majority are not up to the task. For example, most integrated microphones don’t have noise canceling, so a spoken conversation can be restricted by ambient noise and busy environments.\" \nVolume sees industry-wide adoption for these applications in the not-too-distant future, from Digital Concierges to Technical Advisors, Digital Sales Agents and Smart Customer Service Reps. \nSykes concludes, \"The thing to remember is that these applications have the ability to ‘learn’. Ours is growing, but is still relatively young. As it develops, its use will spread; not only will it provide information on our company, but it will also conduct first interviews and induction training. Our AI focus is ‘optimizing human performance through Smart Machines’, where we move humans from mundane and repeatable tasks to higher-value interactions.\" \nYou can interact with Volume’s Digital Concierge here: www.volumeglobal.com \nContact:",

      "title": "IBM to launch four new cloud data centers in the U.K., ahead of Amazon and others",
      "text": "Despite the complications that the Brexit vote has caused for some British cloud computing buyers, IBM Corp. still sees a big growth opportunity in the local infrastructure-as-a-service market.\nThe company plans to address the increasing demand by launching four new data centers in the U.K. through 2017. The first facility is set to open by the end of this year in Fareham, a southern town located near the busy port cities of Southampton and Portsmouth. It should enable IBM to better target the numerous companies that operate in the two municipalities and the encompassing County of Hampshire, which is the fifth-largest in England with a population of nearly 2 million.\nBig Blue’s second planned cloud facility will come online in mid-2017 on a site leased from Ark Data Centres Ltd. The latter firm became the main infrastructure provider to the U.K. government last year after winning a £700 million ($865 million) contract known as the Crown Hosting Framework. IBM hopes that delivering services from the same location where several local agencies already run their workloads will put it in a better position to target the lucrative British public sector. Like the White House before it, the U.K. government adopted a “cloud-first” policy towards technology spending in 2013.\nIBM didn’t divulge where the two other planned facilities will be located or when they’re scheduled to come online. But the company did specify that the data centers are set to offer services that are currently available to customers stateside, including Watson, Bluemix and its recently introduced blockchain platform .\nThe expansion will bring the number of data centers that IBM operates in the U.K. to six, which puts it well ahead of bigger rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. that have only recently started establishing a local presence. Overall, Big Blue expects to have a total of 16 cloud facilities in Europe and more than 50 worldwide when construction completes next year. The company must keep investing in infrastructure if it wants to stay ahead of the competition, which is working hard to close the gap.\nAmazon Web Services powered up three new data centers in Ohio just a few weeks ago as part of an effort to court companies from the Great Lakes region. And a few months earlier, Google announced plans to launch 10 new cloud facilities of its own by 2018 in a bid to target international customers.\nImage courtesy of IBM ",

      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nThe long-awaited SHA-1 deprecation deadline of Jan. 1, 2017, is almost here. At that point, we’ll all be expected to use SHA-2 instead. So the question is: What is your browser going to do when it encounters a SHA-1 signed digital certificate? \nWe’ll delve into the answers in a minute. But first, let’s review what the move from SHA-1 to SHA-2 is all about. [ Safeguard your browsers; InfoWorld's experts tell you how in the \" Web Browser Security Deep Dive \" PDF guide. | Cut to the key news in technology trends and IT breakthroughs with the InfoWorld Daily newsletter , our summary of the top tech happenings. ] Getting from SHA-1 to SHA-2 \nSHA-1 is a cryptographic hash officially recommended by NIST . It’s used to verify digital content, as well as digital certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs). Whenever a PKI certification authority (CA) issues a certificate or CRL, it signs it with a hash to assist “consuming” applications and devices with trust verification. \nIn January 2011, SHA-2 became the new, recommended, stronger hashing standard. SHA-2 is often called “the SHA-2 family of hashes” because it contains hashes of many different lengths, including 224-bit, 256-bit, 384-bit, and 512-bit digests. The most popular one is 256 bits by a large margin. \nWho declared Jan. 1, 2017 the drop-dead date for SHA-1? Three of the top browser vendors and dozens of other software vendors. They belong to a vendor consortium called the CA Browser Forum , which publishes requirements for public CAs in its frequently updated Baseline Requirements document. \nThe CA Browser forum’s SHA-1 deprecation requirements apply to all but two types of certificates (covered below), although some browser vendors care only about web server certificates. Per the CA Browser forum, no public CA is allowed to issue SHA-1-signed certificates after Jan. 1, 2016, for certificates that expire after Dec. 31, 2016, although in some browsers, any SHA-1 certificate expiring after Dec. 31, 2017, is flagged, regardless of when it was issued. \nThe CA Browser Forum specifically excludes root CA server certificates and cross CA certificates from the SHA-1 deprecation requirements. This means you do not have to worry about your root CA’s certificate, although you probably need to worry about how it signs subordinate CA certificates and CRLs. Your browser’s reaction \nSome major browser vendors have been issuing warnings and error messages for two years. Today, some browsers put an X through the HTTPS indicator (Google Chrome), don’t display the lock icon (Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer), or simply remove the HTTPS portion of the URL (Apple Safari). \nSome browsers, such as Firefox, don’t show any indication when consuming an SHA-1 certificate; others may or may not depending on whether you're using a PC or mobile version of the browser. In some cases, the protection given by the SHA-1 TLS certificate is still active even though the browser appears to indicate that it is not (for example, Chrome, Edge, or Internet Explorer). SHA-1 deprecation in the major browsers Apple did not respond to requests for information about SHA-1 deprecation in Safari. Maxthon said it would follow Google’s schedule for Chrome, but provided no further details. Browser",

      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nWhen I go to practitioner conferences outside Silicon Valley, I'm reminded of the separation between the tech industry's notions and what IT organizations deal with every day. It's like they're living in separate worlds. \nBut I've noticed a few recent Silicon Valley concepts now taking root in the mainstream of IT, after years of being the next big thing within the Valley itself. Both their migration into the real world and the fact that mainstream IT doesn't jump onto the latest technology bandwagons are good because mainstream IT does need to evolve, but it also needs to be careful about what Silicon Valley notions it adopts. [ Download the Devops Digital Spotlight . | Get it now: The Digital Transformation and the Agile Enterprise quick guide. | Download InfoWorld’s essential guide to microservices and learn how to create modern web and mobile applications that scale. ] \nWhat cool concepts are making their way into mainstream IT from the current fads in Silicon Valley? \nOne is devops , the more flexible approach to development testing and deployment that breaks down barriers between developers and IT operations staff. In my admittedly unscientific sample of practitioner conferences, I'm seeing the on-the-ground IT pros begin to try the concept, dealing with the political issues that arise when you break down ownership boundaries while trying to get the pace advantages that devops promises -- a pace they need to get to in the modern world where IT projects simply can't take years any longer. \nDevops is an unnatural notion for many IT organizations, precisely because it reduces organizational barriers designed for safety, cost management, and control. But it's also a natural followup to agile development and Lean-based product development, which have been a big focus in mainstream IT in the last five years -- again, entering the mainstream years after they were the cool thing in Silicon Valley. \nThe use of the public cloud is also becoming mainstream , as fears around security and control have given way to the reality that IT needs to focus on getting things done fast and efficiently, and the cloud can safely and effectively provide the platform for doing so. \nResponsive design , to accommodate the broad variety of desktop and mobile screens users and customers have, is also beginning to gain traction in the mainstream. It's old news in Silicon Valley, but finally becoming part of application design thinking elsewhere. \nMachine learning is the newest darling of Silicon Valley, and it has already gotten the interest of mainstream IT, even if only in the early phases of understanding and perhaps some testing. Still, it's gained rapid interest outside Silicon Valley, suggesting this notion may fast-track its way into mainstream IT. \nWhat's not mainstream yet? \nPaaS seems to have gone nowhere . Developers still work and test locally, and devops encourages that local work. It's hard to see PaaS ever taking off. \nMobile devices are now mainstream, but mobile management and mobile applications still seem very siloed from what IT delivers to the desktop. I suspect it'll take years before the notions of omnidevice development, deployment, and management become mainstream, though in Silicon Valley it seems to be such an obvious move. Microsoft certainly thinks so, and that may be the critical support IT needs to make the leap. \nContainer technologies like Docker are one of the current tech industry darlings; they're an easier, lighter, more flexible way to deliver applications across systems than the virtual machines that became mainstream nearly a decade ago. But so far, these seem to be science fiction notions in mainstream IT -- something to read and think about but not yet commit to. Maybe containers will gain traction, but maybe not. \nLikewise, earlier container-style notions like MBaaS and the newer notion of microservices architecture seem to have gained little mainstream IT traction, though microservices is new enough where, like containers, it still stands a chance. \nIt's an old saying that the future is already here, albeit unevenly distributed. It's also a true saying. Silicon Valley is constantly inventing futures, but only some of them leave the Valley.

      "text": "Ratan Tata Tried To Sell TCS To IBM?   10:00   Mumbai: Hitting back at the Tatas, ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry on Tuesday rejected charges of not contributing anything to the group’s cash cows Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and alleged that patriarch Ratan Tata once tried to sell the IT firm to IBM and his “ego” led to bad business decisions like the Corus acquisition at double the original cost. “It is important to set the record straight since insinuations and leaks are being made explicitly to create an illusion that Mr Mistry was a ‘hands off’ chairman and TCS/JLR were on ‘auto-pilot’ during his leadership,” Mr Mistry’s office said in a five-page letter on Tuesday. Listing out details of the efforts undertaken by him as the non-executive chairman at both the companies, which contribute a whopping 90 per cent of the group profit, the letter said the salt-to-software conglomerate is “busy apportioning credit” for the stellar performances. The letter said Mr Tata, who took over as the interim chairman following Mr Mistry’s controversial dismissal from the group on October 24, had once tried to sell the group’s crown jewel TCS to global giant IBM. Without giving the timelines, the letter claimed the then chief F C Kohli’s illness had prevented JRD Tata from going ahead with Mr Tata’s proposal. “Ratan Tata was then heading Tata Industries’ joint venture with IBM and had approached JRD Tata with a proposal from IBM to buyout TCS. JRD refused to discuss the deal because Mr Kohli was still recovering in the hospital,” it said. However, Mr Kohli, considered the doyen of the domestic software industry, flatly refused the proposal saying “TCS has a bright future and the group should not sell the company”. “JRD turned down the offer, demonstrating true vision. But it was also a near-death experience for TCS at the hands of Ratan Tata,” the letter claimed. The Tatas and IBM had started the joint venture with equal holding in 1992, and dissolved it in 1999, while TCS was founded in 1968 and was taken public in 2004. JRD Tata stepped down from the chairmanship of the group in 1991, while Mr Kohli stepped down from TCS in 2000. The letter, which is third in a series of clarifications issued by Mr Mistry’s office, also blamed Mr Tata’s “ego” for bad business decisions, including the buyout of British steelmaker Corus at a high cost and also sticking to the CDMA technology for its telecom business imperiling thousands of jobs. A section of the letter headlined ‘One man’s ego versus an institution’ claimed that Mr Tata’s ego resulted in the Corus deal for $12 billion–twice the cost of what it was available for one year before – despite opposition from some board members and senior executives. “The overpayment for Corus made it harder to invest in it, which had been neglected, and thereby, placed many jobs at risk,” the letter from Mr Mistry’s office said. In the telecom business, Mr Tata made a “strategic” decision to enter the CDMA space as against the popular GSM, despite advice to the contrary, Mr Mistry said, calling it “a case of one person’s judgment adversely affecting jobs of thousands”. In its earlier two clarifications, the Mistry camp had focused on the allegations of the group drifting away from the Tata values during his tenure, independence of directors in group companies, explanations on a surge in expenses and the huge write-offs, which the group had to take under his leadership. In a nine-page letter on November 10, Tata Sons had accused Mr Mistry of not really contributing to the success of JLR and TCS, saying these assets were inherited by him from Mr Tata who had nurtured them and that the ousted chairman could not take credit for their stellar performance. In Tuesday’s statement, the Mistry camp gave credit for these two companies’ success to their leadership under Mr Kohli and N Chandrasekaran at TCS, and Ralph Speth and Ravi Kanth at JLR. Mr Mistry, being the non-executive chairman, gave them a strategic direction, ensured a “future proofing” of the businesses and also gave them time, the letter said. “As chairman of Tata Sons and TCS, Mistry’s access to senior stakeholders across the world was an enabling platform,” the letter said, claiming that he met at least 60 global chief executives to help TCS. To buttress the point, Mr Mistry’s letter enlisted training of 1.35 lakh people in digital area, the Japanese joint venture, industry leading growth in Europe and a surge in high revenue clientele during his tenure. During Mr Mistry’s four-year tenor between December 2012 and October 2016, Tata Consultancy Services’ cash and equivalents doubled to Rs. 20,500 crore with a surge in cash conversion, which helped it declare a special dividend last year, it said. The letter also said that “the best is yet to come” for TCS. Jaguar Land Rover, the letter said, is at a “critical juncture” where decisions taken today will decide its future resilience. “JLR strategy under Mistry’s chairmanship has been to achieve scale as well as minimise currency and supply chain risks by investing in new facilities,” it said, while underlining that it is now a stronger company that will reward the shareholders more consistently in future. Excluding the board and budget meetings, Mr Mistry spent over 120 days, including 38 days on JLR design review, 56 days on offsite strategy meetings as well as market visits to dealers in China, the US, and India, the letter said. It said that other group companies like Tata Chemicals, Tata Elixi, Tata Global Beverages, Titan and Voltas are also leaders in their respective fields.",

      "text": "How Trump’s Presidency Could Affect IBM and Its Peers PART 9 OF 9 How Major Analysts View IBM’s Stock By Anne Shields | Nov 18, 2016 2:07 pm EST Wall Street analysts’ views on IBM’s stock \nIn this series, we’ve discussed the impact of Donald Trump’s election and the US dollar’s rise on technology players such as IBM ( IBM ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Oracle ( ORCL ). \nIBM expects its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) EPS (earnings per share) to be at least $13.50 in 2016. The company also expects to generate FCF (free cash flow) of $11 billion–$12 billion, guidance it provided in January 2016. \nNow let’s take a look at select market-centric views and metrics for IBM, starting with Wall Street analysts’ views on the company. As you can see in the graph above, of the 28 analysts tracking IBM’s stock, 61.0% had given it “holds” as of November 17, 2016. About 29.0% had given it “buys,” and 11.0% had given it “sells.” Analysts’ recommendations changed in favor of “buys” on IBM’s stock following the company’s 3Q16 results. \nAmong major research houses, Bank of America ( BAC ) upgraded IBM from a “neutral” to a “buy” with a target of $185. Price performance and target prices \nIBM’s stock movement has been positive in the past month. As of November 17, 2016, the stock had risen more than 3.0%. As we mentioned earlier in the series, IBM’s consistent growth in the Strategic Imperatives segment, especially in the cloud space, and its focus on Watson have led to improvements in the market sentiment toward the stock. After hitting a six-year low of $117.85 in February 2016, IBM’s stock has recovered, rising ~35%. \nWall Street’s consensus target price for IBM is $158.53 per share. On November 17, 2016, IBM’s median target price was $165.0, and its stock was trading at $159.5. \nIf you’re interested in gaining exposure to IBM, you can consider investing in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ), which has 8.7% exposure to the application software space and invests ~0.70% of its holdings in IBM. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"SPY\",\"IBM\",\"MSFT\",\"ORCL\",\"AAPL\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\",\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Microsoft Corporation\",\"Oracle Corporation\",\"Apple Inc.\"]} X",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nLONDON (Reuters) - Global IT group IBM (IBM.N) will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. \nIBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. \nCompanies including Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O) have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. \n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter) Ask Brianna: Should I avoid credit cards?

      "text": "Tweet Share A woman passes by the IBM offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More LONDON (Reuters) - Global IT group IBM (IBM.N) will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. IBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. IBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. IBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. Tech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. Companies including Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O) have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people. IBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. Brexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. Krause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.

      "text": "Volume Releases World's First Commercial Cognitive Web Site Powered by IBM® Watson™ Next generation web interaction platform interacts with visitors in natural language.  10   WOKINGHAM, England, Nov.   Does this mark the end of the traditional website, where visitors use cumbersome navigation bars, buttons and drop-down menus or spend arduous minutes finding the right answers to their questions? Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161122/442068 Volume's Digital Concierge(TM), powered by IBM Watson(TM) uses Watson's 'conversations' service to allow text to speech interaction between a human and a Smart Machine. Volume's Digital Concierge ™ , powered by IBM Watson ™ uses Watson's 'conversations' service to allow text-to-speech interaction between a human and a Smart Machine. The cognitive application called 'LUSY' is trained in a single domain—the company, Volume. The aim is to provide all the information on the company through natural dialogue and Q&A. Volume's Digital Concierge remembers returning visitors and can engage in chit-chat. The application 'learns' through every interaction and question, and only provides an answer when it reaches a level of confidence that this is correct. Volume's CEO Chris Sykes states, \"It's a bold move removing our corporate website for an AI application like our Digital Concierge. However, we needed to do this to amass all the questions it was being asked; whether on- or off-topic. Since its soft launch in October, the application has been asked over 16,000 questions. We learn from those and retrain the application, so it can answer more questions accurately and its domain knowledge grows. That's the beauty of Watson-powered applications.\" Volume develops its AI-powered applications iteratively through agile software-development methodologies such as SCRUM. At the base layer it allows a human to have a relatively natural conversation with a machine. The next layer of cognitive services to be added will be able to detect 'the mood of the customer' and their character insights, which will dictate the type of content served up and its tone. The third layer is image- and voice-recognition to provide a more personalized customer experience. Sykes comments, \"We have voice- and image-recognition capabilities right now. The problem we have at the moment is the quality of microphones and cameras in mainstream devices. The majority are not up to the task. For example, most integrated microphones don't have noise canceling, so a spoken conversation can be restricted by ambient noise and busy environments.\" Volume sees industry-wide adoption for these applications in the not-too-distant future, from Digital Concierges to Technical Advisors, Digital Sales Agents and Smart Customer Service Reps. Sykes concludes, \"The thing to remember is that these applications have the ability to 'learn'. Ours is growing, but is still relatively young. As it develops, its use will spread; not only will it provide information on our company, but it will also conduct first interviews and induction training. Our AI focus is 'optimizing human performance through Smart Machines', where we move humans from mundane and repeatable tasks to higher-value interactions.\" You can interact with Volume's Digital Concierge here: www.volumeglobal.com Contact: © Volume Ltd 2016 This content was issued through the press release distribution service at Newswire.com.

      "text": "  12:10 PM EST Volume Releases World's First Commercial Cognitive Web Site Powered by IBM® Watson™ \nWOKINGHAM, England, Nov. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Does this mark the end of the traditional website, where visitors use cumbersome navigation bars, buttons and drop-down menus or spend arduous minutes finding the right answers to their questions? \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161122/442068 \nVolume's Digital Concierge ™ , powered by IBM Watson ™ uses Watson's 'conversations' service to allow text-to-speech interaction between a human and a Smart Machine. \nThe cognitive application called 'LUSY' is trained in a single domain—the company, Volume. The aim is to provide all the information on the company through natural dialogue and Q&A. Volume's Digital Concierge remembers returning visitors and can engage in chit-chat. The application 'learns' through every interaction and question, and only provides an answer when it reaches a level of confidence that this is correct. \nVolume's CEO Chris Sykes states, \"It's a bold move removing our corporate website for an AI application like our Digital Concierge. However, we needed to do this to amass all the questions it was being asked; whether on- or off-topic. Since its soft launch in October, the application has been asked over 16,000 questions. We learn from those and retrain the application, so it can answer more questions accurately and its domain knowledge grows. That's the beauty of Watson-powered applications.\" \nVolume develops its AI-powered applications iteratively through agile software-development methodologies such as SCRUM. At the base layer it allows a human to have a relatively natural conversation with a machine. The next layer of cognitive services to be added will be able to detect 'the mood of the customer' and their character insights, which will dictate the type of content served up and its tone. The third layer is image- and voice-recognition to provide a more personalized customer experience. \nSykes comments, \"We have voice- and image-recognition capabilities right now. The problem we have at the moment is the quality of microphones and cameras in mainstream devices. The majority are not up to the task. For example, most integrated microphones don't have noise canceling, so a spoken conversation can be restricted by ambient noise and busy environments.\" \nVolume sees industry-wide adoption for these applications in the not-too-distant future, from Digital Concierges to Technical Advisors, Digital Sales Agents and Smart Customer Service Reps. \nSykes concludes, \"The thing to remember is that these applications have the ability to 'learn'. Ours is growing, but is still relatively young. As it develops, its use will spread; not only will it provide information on our company, but it will also conduct first interviews and induction training. Our AI focus is 'optimizing human performance through Smart Machines', where we move humans from mundane and repeatable tasks to higher-value interactions.\" \nYou can interact with Volume's Digital Concierge here: www.volumeglobal.com \nContact: \n© Volume Ltd 2016 \nThis content was issued through the press release distribution service at Newswire.com.

In addition to business networking, Digital Summit will provide attendees with a series of professional development sessions on topics ranging from millennial marketing and business strategy, marketing analytics, customer journey mapping, and the new standard in user experience design.\nImmediately following a keynote address by Ann Handley, Wall Street Journal best-selling author and chief content officer at Marketing Profs, SevenTablets President Shane Long will educate the Digital Summit audience on predictive analytics and how it is transforming the ways modern businesses pursue value and competitive advantage. Long will speak on the tactics that go into this and describe how it is allowing businesses to make decisions and key adjustments in real-time, sharing anecdotes that touch on the recent US presidential election, business case studies, and more.\nSpeaking on behalf of the Dallas and Austin, Texas based company, Director of Digital Marketing Adam Rizzieri explains,\n“The value that our clients have access to by way of our predictive analytics engine and big data capabilities has allowed us unique insight and working knowledge of the topic that Shane [Long] will be speaking on at Digital Summit.

      "text": "By Simon Zekaria\nLONDON--International Business Machines Corp.(IBM) on Tuesday said it is building four data centers in the U.K., becoming the latest of several U.S. technology giants to expand in Britain since the country's vote to leave the European Union.\nNew York-based IBM said the multimillion-dollar investment would triple the number of its cloud-storage data centers in the U.K. to six, for a total of 16 in Europe and 52 globally. The new U.K. facilities will be running by the end of 2017, the company said. IBM declined to disclose the final investment figure or employment numbers.\nThe data-center industry is scrambling to keep up with ballooning demand for digital services. IBM competes against Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google as a major provider of cloud-computing services, in which data is stored using remote computer servers.\nIBM's announcement followed ones by Silicon Valley-based technology peers Google, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. on new office openings in London, one of Europe's biggest technology hubs.\nApple is opening a new London campus in 2021. Google is also building a new campus in the city, to house 7,000 employees. On Monday, Facebook said it is adding 500 employees in the U.K. when it opens its new London headquarters next year.\nU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May told business leaders on Monday that investments made in the U.K. by U.S. technology majors are a sign of confidence in Britain among large firms as the U.K. government prepares to negotiate the terms of the country's exit from the EU.\nWrite to Simon Zekaria at Simon.Zekaria@wsj.com\n 08:46 ET (13:46 ",

      "text": "12:00 AM, November 23, 2016 / LAST MODIFIED: 12:00 AM, November 23, 2016 IBM invests in UK data centres 0 Copy this link Reuters \nGlobal IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said on Tuesday. \nIBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc.

IBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. IBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. Tech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fuelled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. Companies including Google and Facebook have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people. IBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. Brexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. Krause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. -Reuters ",

      "text": " Volume Ltd\nNext generation web interaction platform interacts with visitors in natural language.\nWOKINGHAM, England Does this mark the end of the traditional website, where visitors use cumbersome navigation bars, buttons and drop-down menus or spend arduous minutes finding the right answers to their questions?\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161122/442068\nVolume's Digital Concierge ™ , powered by IBM Watson ™ uses Watson's 'conversations' service to allow text-to-speech interaction between a human and a Smart Machine.\nThe cognitive application called 'LUSY' is trained in a single domain-the company, Volume. The aim is to provide all the information on the company through natural dialogue and Q&A. Volume's Digital Concierge remembers returning visitors and can engage in chit-chat. The application 'learns' through every interaction and question, and only provides an answer when it reaches a level of confidence that this is correct.\nVolume's CEO Chris Sykes states, \"It's a bold move removing our corporate website for an AI application like our Digital Concierge. However, we needed to do this to amass all the questions it was being asked; whether on- or off-topic. Since its soft launch in October, the application has been asked over 16,000 questions. We learn from those and retrain the application, so it can answer more questions accurately and its domain knowledge grows. That's the beauty of Watson-powered applications.\"\nVolume develops its AI-powered applications iteratively through agile software-development methodologies such as SCRUM. At the base layer it allows a human to have a relatively natural conversation with a machine. The next layer of cognitive services to be added will be able to detect 'the mood of the customer' and their character insights, which will dictate the type of content served up and its tone. The third layer is image- and voice-recognition to provide a more personalized customer experience.\nSykes comments, \"We have voice- and image-recognition capabilities right now. The problem we have at the moment is the quality of microphones and cameras in mainstream devices. The majority are not up to the task. For example, most integrated microphones don't have noise canceling, so a spoken conversation can be restricted by ambient noise and busy environments.\"\nVolume sees industry-wide adoption for these applications in the not-too-distant future, from Digital Concierges to Technical Advisors, Digital Sales Agents and Smart Customer Service Reps.\nSykes concludes, \"The thing to remember is that these applications have the ability to 'learn'. Ours is growing, but is still relatively young. As it develops, its use will spread; not only will it provide information on our company, but it will also conduct first interviews and induction training. Our AI focus is 'optimizing human performance through Smart Machines', where we move humans from mundane and repeatable tasks to higher-value interactions.\"\nYou can interact with Volume's Digital Concierge here: www.volumeglobal.com\nContact: chris.sykes@volumeglobal.com\n© Volume Ltd 2016\nThis content was issued through the press release distribution service at Newswire.com.

      "title": "IBM Adds 4 Data Centers in U.K., Focusing on AI Cloud Services",
      "text": "VMware Expands Cloud Partnership with IBM to Include Desktop Services Advertisement \nIBM is tripling the number of data centers it has in the U.K., bolstering one of the businesses it’s counting on for growth and giving the British economy a vote of confidence after the country elected to leave the European Union. \nIBM currently operates two U.K. data centers. The four announced Tuesday come on top of a previous commitment from 2014 in which the company said it would spend $1.2 billion on 15 such facilities around the world. That would peg each center at an average cost of $80 million. IBM declined to disclose how much it’s spending in the U.K., or how many additional people it will need to hire to run these new facilities. Related \nIBM Makes Strategic Changes to PartnerWorld Program \nThe announcement “shows Britain is open for business,” said Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture, in a statement. “These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.” \nIBM’s project also coincides with the U.K. government’s autumn budget statement and a raft of initiatives aimed at encouraging technology investment. Other U.S. technology companies have also continued to invest in the U.K. even after the Brexit vote in June. On Monday, Facebook Inc. said it was hiring 500 more people in the U.K., expanding its headcount in the country by a third. And earlier this month, Google said it was committed to completing a 1 billion pound ($1.25 billion) new office complex in London and hiring thousands more employees in the U.K. \nArmonk, New York-based International Business Machines Corp. said the new data centers will particularly help it handle work for U.K. government clients and others in highly regulated industries like banking and defense contractors -- which are increasingly looking to move data to the cloud, but are often required to store it locally. \nThe centers also are equipped with IBM’s Watson artificial intelligence technology, “to meet growing demand,” the company said. \nThomson, the U.K.’s largest travel operator and a unit of German-based TUI AG, is testing a chatbot powered by Watson delivered through IBM’s cloud computing facilities. The bot will enable customers to ask for suggestions for places to visit and things to do in a particular destination. \nIBM has bet heavily that it can reshape its business model around its Watson AI product, part of a \"cognitive solutions\" business line that now accounts for 22 percent of the company’s $80 billion in revenue, at a time when profits from its traditional technology consulting and services business have been slowing. The company sold $12.7 billion in cloud computing services in the past 12 months. \nThe first two new U.K. data centers will be built in the English towns of Fareham and Farnborough, with the location of the other two to be unveiled next year. The Fareham facility is scheduled to open next month and all four new centers will be operating by the end of 2017, IBM said. Once the new data centers open, IBM will have 16 such facilities in Europe and 50 worldwide.",

      "text": "Next generation web interaction platform interacts with visitors in natural language.\nWokingham, United Kingdom - November 22,\nDoes this mark the end of the traditional website, where visitors use cumbersome navigation bars, buttons and drop-down menus or spend arduous minutes finding the right answers to their questions?\nVolume's Digital Concierge, powered by IBM Watson uses Watson's 'conversations' service to allow text-to-speech interaction between a human and a Smart Machine.\nThe cognitive application called 'LUSY' is trained in a single domainthe company, Volume. The aim is to provide all the information on the company through natural dialogue and Q&A. Volume's Digital Concierge remembers returning visitors and can engage in chit-chat. The application 'learns' through every interaction and question, and only provides an answer when it reaches a level of confidence that this is correct.\nVolume's CEO Chris Sykes states, \"It's a bold move removing our corporate website for an AI application like our Digital Concierge. However, we needed to do this to amass all the questions it was being asked; whether on- or off-topic. Since its soft launch in October, the application has been asked over 16,000 questions. We learn from those and retrain the application, so it can answer more questions accurately and its domain knowledge grows. That's the beauty of Watson-powered applications.\"\nVolume develops its AI-powered applications iteratively through agile software-development methodologies such as SCRUM. At the base layer it allows a human to have a relatively natural conversation with a machine. The next layer of cognitive services to be added will be able to detect 'the mood of the customer' and their character insights, which will dictate the type of content served up and its tone. The third layer is image- and voice-recognition to provide a more personalized customer experience.\nSykes comments, \"We have voice- and image-recognition capabilities right now. The problem we have at the moment is the quality of microphones and cameras in mainstream devices. The majority are not up to the task. For example, most integrated microphones don't have noise canceling, so a spoken conversation can be restricted by ambient noise and busy environments.\"\nVolume sees industry-wide adoption for these applications in the not-too-distant future, from Digital Concierges to Technical Advisors, Digital Sales Agents and Smart Customer Service Reps.\nSykes concludes, \"The thing to remember is that these applications have the ability to 'learn'. Ours is growing, but is still relatively young. As it develops, its use will spread; not only will it provide information on our company, but it will also conduct first interviews and induction training. Our AI focus is 'optimizing human performance through Smart Machines', where we move humans from mundane and repeatable tasks to higher-value interactions.\"\nYou can interact with Volume's Digital Concierge here: www.volumeglobal.com\nContact: chris.sykes@volumeglobal.com\nVolume Ltd 2016\n Volume Releases World's First Commercial Cognitive Web Site Powered by IBM Watson\n ",

      "text": "Ratan Tata wanted to sell the company’s “crown jewel” Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to IBM. (PTI) Ratan Tata wanted to sell the company’s “crown jewel” Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to IBM. A statement from Cyrus Mistry’s office today dubbed the move by Ratan Tata as a “near-death experience for TCS”. The statement is the strongest attack so far from the Mistry camp against the Ratan Tata camp.\nOn Tuesday, Mistry’s office also alleged that Ratan Tata’s “ego” had led to Corus deal at a high price. A number of board members and senior executives of the group had reservations against Ratan Tata’s decision to buy the European steel company for over $12 billion. They had reservations against the decision as a year before the deal, the European company was available for sale at half the price, according to Mistry. The Corus deal, however, had put Tata steel on the global map.\nLast month, Mistry was removed from the post of the chairman of Tata Sons, which is the holding firm of the $100 billion steel-to-software business empire. Mistry said that Ratan Tata’s decision to buy Corus at a higher price made it harder for the company to invest in acquired assets. It also placed jobs in the company at risk.\nMistry also defended his involvement in growing the revenues and profits of two group companies — Tata Consultancy Services and Tata Motors. These two companies make the bulk of Tata’s $100 billion revenues.",

      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity Total War: Warhammer released for Linux \nLinux gamers can rejoice and give thanks for today’s release of Total War: Warhammer. The turn-based strategy game is now available for Linux and SteamOS systems. You can get the game via Steam or from Feral Interactive’s online store for $59.99. [ InfoWorld celebrates Linux at 25: A pictorial history . | How Linux changed the world . | Linus Torvalds on the evolution and future of Linux . | Containers and unikernels prove less is more . | Quick guide to Linux admin essentials . | Stay up on open source with the InfoWorld Linux report . ] \nMarius Nestor reports for Softpedia: \nToday, November 22, you can also enjoy Total War: Warhammer on your Linux PCs, thanks to the hard work made by UK-based video game publisher Feral Interactive, the same company that brought us, Linux gamers, two other superb AAA titles a couple of months ago, namely Mad Max and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. \nLong story short, you’ll be able to play the game with both AMD Radeon and Nvidia graphics cards. Feral Interactive managed this time to implement support for the latest Mesa 13.0.1 3D Graphics Library compiled using LLVM 3.9 or newer for AMD Radeon GPU support. However, it looks like AMD GPUs are not supported on SteamOS. \nThe minimum requirements on Linux are a PC with an Intel Core i3–4130 running at 3.4GHz or AMD FX6300 processor running at 3.5GHz, with 4GB RAM, and at least an AMD Radeon R9 270 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti graphics cards with 1GB VRAM. Nvidia users should have the latest 367.28 video drivers installed. \nMore at Softpedia \nIf you aren’t familiar with the game, here’s the official trailer via YouTube: \nNews of the game’s release caught the attention of redditors in the Linux Gaming subreddit and they shared their thoughts: \nPontostroy : “It works fine on radeonsi and with Mesa-git from today even faster than windows . \nGreat job Feral.” \nErsthelfer : “Does this mean it runs better on Linux than on Windows (except ultra settings)? Or do I misread that?” \nGrandmastermoth : “Yes it does. Although only on that particular video card using MESA. We need more benchmarks…but it’s definitely promising :)” \nKiaserPhil : “If I buy this from Feral will I also be able to run it in Windows? I want to give Feral the money directly, but I’m concerned my laptop won’t be able to run it and that I’ll need to run it on my desktop, which is Windows only atm.” \nRyuzakiKK : “Yes, the feral store will give you a steam key. So you’ll be able to play on any platform you want.” \nGrandmastermoth : “There I was, eyes blinking thinking it was some pre-order trick. But no it’s released! And Steam has the SteamOS logo up too! Merry Christmas everyone!” \nEllie_feral : “Merry Christmas to y– wait” \nGrandmastermoth : “Aaah it’s close enough. They’re already selling Christmas paraphernalia in the stores anyway :/” \nMore at Reddit Linux-y things to be thankful for \nThanksgiving is this week and it’s the time of the year when we all consider the things we have to be thankful for in our lives. A writer at Network World has a list of Linux-y things that he’s thankful for having in his computing life. \nBryan Lunduke reports for Network World: \nThanksgiving is in a few days, and talking about “things I am thankful for” is pretty traditional this time of year. So, here we go. Here’s my list of Linux-y (and free software-y) things I am thankful for in 2016. (At least the ones I could remember when I sat down to write this list.) \nI am thankful for the developers of cmus, tmux, midnight commander and all of the other projects that help make using the shell in Linux such a productive and enjoyable experience. \nI am thankful for the developer of lolcat. You make my terminal so much more colorful—even when it doesn’t need to be. The ridiculousness of what you have created fills my heart with joy. \nI am thankful for Canonical and Ubuntu. I may not agree with how they do things (and I seem to be agreeing with them less and less lately), but I’m happy they’re around doing their own thing. They’ve helped raise awareness of Linux and free software—and that’s not nuthin’. \nMore at Network World VirtualBox 5.1.10 released \nVirtualBox has proven to be an incredibly useful tool for anyone who needs to run multiple operating systems on their computer. It’s free and open source software too, and the latest version (5.1.10) has just been released. \nHere’s a list of changes in VirtualBox 5.1.10: VirtualBox 5.1.10 (released 2016-11-21) This is a maintenance release. The following items were fixed and/or added: GUI: the USB filter settings dialog should allow to specify the USB revision in hexadecimal format (bug #15400 ) GUI: fixed crash on certain hosts when pressing certain key combinations (Windows hosts only; bug #15719 ) GUI: fixed issue with updating the available-geometry on host-screen work-area resize GUI: don't crash / hang on certain environments if accessibility support is enabled GUI: fixed various issues in Unscaled HiDPI Output mode (bug #15707 ) GUI: extend the VM Input menu with Print Screen -related actions GUI: improved handling of inserting the Guest Additions ISO image by trying all available optical drives rather than only the first one and by not asking the user if he wants to force unmounting (which doesn't work in most cases anyway) API: default to RTC using UTC for Solaris 11 guests Settings: be less restrictive when reading a VM configuration containing a host-only adapter without an interface name Storage: fixed resizing VDI images resulting in an unbootable image under certain circumstances (bug #15983 ) NAT: fixed several 5.1.8 regressions on Mac OS X and Windows hosts (bug #16084 ) Audio: fixed a few 5.1.x regressions by using the audio code from 5.0.x until the audio overhaul is completed VBoxManage: fixed documentation of the storagectl command (bug #15971 ) Build system: another fix for building VirtualBox on systems which default to Python 3 Windows hosts: hardening fix for Windows 10 build 14971 (bug #16202 ) Windows Additions: properly start the VirtualBox guest services even if the guest user name contains special characters (bug #15982 ) Solaris Additions: fixed preemptible mouse notification callback being executed under a spinlock for Solaris guests Linux hosts / guests: Linux 4.9 fixes (bugs #16155 and #16064 ) Linux Additions: fixed Linux kernel module override rule (thanks Mark Furneaux) \nDid you miss a roundup?

      "text": "Home > Cloud Computing > IBM Adds 4 Data Centers in U.K., Focusing on AI Cloud Services IBM Adds 4 Data Centers in U.K., Focusing on AI Cloud Services Nov 22, 2016 Bloomberg \nThe new data centers will particularly help it handle work for U.K. government clients and others in highly regulated industries like banking and defense contractors. Related Media IBM’s Rometty Almost Turned Down Promotion in Career Life Lesson Advertisement \n(Bloomberg) -- IBM is tripling the number of data centers it has in the U.K., bolstering one of the businesses it’s counting on for growth and giving the British economy a vote of confidence after the country elected to leave the European Union. \nIBM currently operates two U.K. data centers. The four announced Tuesday come on top of a previous commitment from 2014 in which the company said it would spend $1.2 billion on 15 such facilities around the world. That would peg each center at an average cost of $80 million. IBM declined to disclose how much it’s spending in the U.K., or how many additional people it will need to hire to run these new facilities. \nThe announcement “shows Britain is open for business,” said Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture, in a statement. “These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.” \nIBM’s project also coincides with the U.K. government’s autumn budget statement and a raft of initiatives aimed at encouraging technology investment. Other U.S. technology companies have also continued to invest in the U.K. even after the Brexit vote in June. On Monday, Facebook Inc. said it was hiring 500 more people in the U.K., expanding its headcount in the country by a third. And earlier this month, Google said it was committed to completing a 1 billion pound ($1.25 billion) new office complex in London and hiring thousands more employees in the U.K. \nArmonk, New York-based International Business Machines Corp. said the new data centers will particularly help it handle work for U.K. government clients and others in highly regulated industries like banking and defense contractors -- which are increasingly looking to move data to the cloud, but are often required to store it locally. \nThe centers also are equipped with IBM’s Watson artificial intelligence technology, “to meet growing demand,” the company said. \nThomson, the U.K.’s largest travel operator and a unit of German-based TUI AG, is testing a chatbot powered by Watson delivered through IBM’s cloud computing facilities. The bot will enable customers to ask for suggestions for places to visit and things to do in a particular destination. \nIBM has bet heavily that it can reshape its business model around its Watson AI product, part of a \"cognitive solutions\" business line that now accounts for 22 percent of the company’s $80 billion in revenue, at a time when profits from its traditional technology consulting and services business have been slowing. The company sold $12.7 billion in cloud computing services in the past 12 months. \nThe first two new U.K. data centers will be built in the English towns of Fareham and Farnborough, with the location of the other two to be unveiled next year. The Fareham facility is scheduled to open next month and all four new centers will be operating by the end of 2017, IBM said. Once the new data centers open, IBM will have 16 such facilities in Europe and 50 worldwide.",

      "text": "The Europeans Ratan Tata wanted to sell the company’s “crown jewel” Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to IBM. A statement from Cyrus Mistry’s office today dubbed the move by Ratan Tata as a “near-death experience for TCS”. The statement is the strongest attack so far from the Mistry camp against the Ratan Tata camp. On Tuesday, Mistry’s office also alleged that Ratan Tata’s “ego” had led to Corus deal at a high price. A number of board members and senior executives of the group had reservations against Ratan Tata’s decision to buy the European steel company for over $12 billion. They had reservations against the decision as a year before the deal, the European company was available for sale at half the price, according to Mistry. The Corus deal, however, had put Tata steel on the global map. Last month, Mistry was removed from the post of the chairman of Tata Sons, which is the holding firm of the $100 billion steel-to-software business empire. Mistry said that Ratan Tata’s decision to buy Corus at a higher price made it harder for the company to invest in acquired assets. It also placed jobs in the company at risk. Mistry also defended his involvement in growing the revenues and profits of two group companies — Tata Consultancy Services and Tata Motors. These two companies make the bulk of Tata’s $100 billion revenues. Earlier, a statement by Tata Sons on November 10 had insinuated that Cyrus Mistry made no “material contributions” to the success of TCS & JLR. The statement implied that the success of these two companies was because of “Ratan Tata’s personal vision and efforts”, Mistry’s office said in the statement. It further said that it is important to set the record straight as “insinuations and leaks” are being made to create an illusion that Mistry was a “hands off” Chairman and TCS/JLR were on “auto-pilot” during his leadership.",

      "text": "IBM Is Adding to Its U.K. Data Center Presence By Investopedia | November 22, 2016 — 1:58 PM EST \nWith cloud adoption rates soaring an estimated 84% over the past five years, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) has announced it's investing in four new data centers in the United Kingdom, bringing its total to six. As U.K. Minister of State for Digital and Culture Matt Hancock described it, his country is already a \"globally successful digital economy worth more than £118 billion [$146.7 billion] a year and strong cyber security defences to protect consumers and business.\" \nMinister Hancock added that expanding IBM's data center presence will give the UK's already fast-growing transition to the cloud a boost. Considering IBM's emphasis on machine learning and comprehensive data analytics, it's no surprise the new data centers will be \"infused with cognitive intelligence\" utilizing its machine-learning wonder, Watson, just as the existing two are. \nIn addition to the obvious opportunities the increased presence in the U.K. represents to IBM, the decision answers at least some questions tech industry pundits and investors have had regarding the impact of the upcoming Brexit. IBM had been in talks with U.K. officials before the voters' now infamous decision in June to leave the EU, and like other tech big hitters, it has determined the potential the opportunity represents outweighs the risks. \nIBM said it would also expand its presence in the U.K. by adding additional office space in what will be the home of the second of its four new data centers, which will be fully operational in mid-2017. \n10 stocks we like better than IBM When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the for investors to buy right now... and IBM wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of November 7, 2016 \nTim Brugger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

On Wednesday, May 4, for the first time ever, IBM is making quantum computing available via the cloud to anyone interested in hands-on access to an IBM quantum processor, making it easier for researchers and the scientific community to accelerate innovations, and help discover new applications for this technology. This is the beginning of the quantum age of computing and the latest advance from IBM towards building a universal quantum computer. A universal quantum computer, once built, will represent one of the greatest milestones in the history of information technology and has the potential to solve certain problems we couldn’t solve, and will never be able to solve, with today’s classical computers. (Jon Simon/Feature Photo Service for IBM) IBM scientists have built a quantum processor that users can access through a first-of-a-kind quantum computing platform delivered via the IBM Cloud onto any desktop or mobile device. IBM believes quantum computing is the future of computing and has the potential to solve certain problems that are impossible to solve on today’s supercomputers.\nThe cloud-enabled quantum computing platform, called IBM Quantum Experience , will allow users to run algorithms and experiments on IBM’s quantum processor, work with the individual quantum bits (qubits), and explore tutorials and simulations around what might be possible with quantum computing. \nThe quantum processor is composed of five superconducting qubits and is housed at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. The five-qubit processor represents the latest advancement in IBM’s quantum architecture that can scale to larger quantum systems. It is the leading approach towards building a universal quantum computer . \nA universal quantum computer can be programmed to perform any computing task and will be exponentially faster than classical computers for a number of important applications for science and business. \nA universal quantum computer does not exist today, but IBM envisions medium-sized quantum processors of 50-100 qubits to be possible in the next decade. With a quantum computer built of just 50 qubits, none of today’s TOP500 supercomputers could successfully emulate it, reflecting the tremendous potential of this technology. The community of quantum computer scientists and theorists is working to harness this power, and applications in optimization and chemistry will likely be the first to demonstrate quantum speed-up. \n“Quantum computers are very different from today’s computers, not only in what they look like and are made of, but more importantly in what they can do. Quantum computing is becoming a reality and it will extend computation far beyond what is imaginable with today’s computers,” said Arvind Krishna, senior vice president and director, IBM Research. “This moment represents the birth of quantum cloud computing. By giving hands-on access to IBM’s experimental quantum systems, the IBM Quantum Experience will make it easier for researchers and the scientific community to accelerate innovations in the quantum field, and help discover new applications for this technology.” \nWith Moore’s Law running out of steam, quantum computing will be among the technologies that could usher in a new era of innovation across industries. This leap forward in computing could lead to the discovery of new pharmaceutical drugs and completely safeguard cloud computing systems. It could also unlock new facets of artificial intelligence (which could lead to future, more powerful Watson technologies), develop new materials science to transform industries, and search large volumes of big data . \nIBM Quantum Experience \nQuantum information is very fragile and needs to be protected from any errors that can result from heat and electromagnetic radiation. Signals are sent in and out of a cryogenic dilution refrigerator to measure operations on the quantum processor. \nThe IBM team has made a number of robust engineering advances both at the device level and in the electronic controls to give IBM Quantum Experience users unprecedented and reliably high-quality performance in this five-qubit processor. \nCoupled with software expertise from the IBM Research ecosystem, the team has built a dynamic user interface on the IBM Cloud platform that allows users to easily connect to the quantum hardware via the cloud. The team sees the introduction to the public of this complete quantum computing framework as just the start of a new user community, which embraces the quantum world and how it works. \nIn the future, users will have the opportunity to contribute and review their results in the community hosted on the IBM Quantum Experience and IBM scientists will be directly engaged to offer more research and insights on new advances. IBM plans to add more qubits and different processor arrangements to the IBM Quantum Experience over time, so users can expand their experiments and help uncover new applications for the technology. \nQuantum computing – a different way of thinking \nWe live in a world where classical physics defines our experiences and our intuition, and ultimately how we process information. However, nature at the atomic level is governed by a different set of rules known as quantum mechanics. It is beyond the reach of classical computers to solve problems that exist in nature in which quantum mechanics plays a role, for example, understanding how molecules behave. \nTo overcome this, in 1981, Richard Feynman proposed to build computers based on the laws of quantum mechanics. Over three decades later, IBM is helping to make this a reality. \nQuantum computing works fundamentally differently from today’s computers. A classical computer makes use of bits to process information, where each bit represents either a one or a zero. In contrast, a qubit can represent a one, a zero, or both at once, which is known as superposition. This property along with other quantum effects enable quantum computers to perform certain calculations vastly faster than is possible with classical computers. \nMost of today’s quantum computing research in academia and industry is focused on building a universal quantum computer. The major challenges include creating qubits of high quality and packaging them together in a scalable way, so they can perform complex calculations in a controllable way. \nIBM employs superconducting qubits that are made with superconducting metals on a silicon chip and can be designed and manufactured using standard silicon fabrication techniques. Last year, IBM scientists demonstrated critical breakthroughs to detect quantum errors by combining superconducting qubits in latticed arrangements, and whose quantum circuit design is the only physical architecture that can scale to larger dimensions. \nNow, IBM scientists have achieved a further advance by combining five qubits in the lattice architecture, which demonstrates a key operation known as a parity measurement – the basis of many quantum error correction protocols. The road towards universal quantum computing hinges upon the achievement of quantum error correction, and the IBM team has taken another important step down this challenging path. \nNew frontiers for quantum computing \nThere has been tremendous progress and interest in the field of quantum of computing in recent years. By giving users access to the IBM Quantum Experience, it will help businesses and organizations begin to understand the technology’s potential, for universities to grow their teaching programs in quantum computing and related subjects, and for students to become aware of promising new career paths. \n“It is a beautiful challenge to pursue the path to build the first universal quantum computer, but it requires us to change how we think about the world. Access to early quantum computing prototypes will be key in imagining and developing future applications,” said Dario Gil, vice president of science and solutions, IBM Research. “If you want to understand what a true quantum computer will do for you and how it works, this is the place to do it. You won’t experience it anywhere else.” \nIBM’s quantum computing platform is a core initiative within the newly formed IBM Research Frontiers Institute . The Frontiers Institute is a consortium that develops and shares ground-breaking computing technologies to spur world-changing innovations. Companies from diverse industries can leverage IBM’s research talent and cutting-edge infrastructure to explore what the future of quantum computing may mean for their organization and business. Founding members of the Frontiers Institute include Samsung, JSR, and Honda. \nTo access the IBM Quantum Experience and for more information on IBM’s quantum computing research, please visit www.ibm.com/quantumcomputing .

      "text": "Distributed ledger blockchain technology may be be known for its original use for powering bitcoin and more recently for its fintech implementations, but now that same technology is being applied to supply chain management and tracking.\nIBM Corp and retailing giant Walmart have teamed up to utilize the blockchain to track Walmart’s pork supply chain in China.\nUsing technology designed by the open source Hyperledger Project, software that builds blockchain tools, and run in conjunction with a private database co-developed by IBM, Walmart’s blockchain implementation is able to track pork as it moves from the farm to the shelves, and is also being trialed as a way to track packaged goods in the U.S. as well.\nThe use of the blockchain to track goods all comes down to product safety and the ability to identify and remove items that have been recalled. Currently, if a consumer becomes ill as a result of tainted food, a retailer or manufacturer can take days to track down the source of the product, whereas with a blockchain based platform data can be easily tracked from the point of origin to the consumer themselves, allowing Walmart to be able to easily identify items that need to be recalled, and more importantly where the product issue may have occurred.\n“It gives them an ability to have an accounting from origin to completion,” NDP Group analyst Marshal Cohen told Bloomberg. “If there’s an issue with an outbreak of E. coli, this gives them an ability to immediately find where it came from. That’s the difference between days and minutes.”\nNext gen The technology is a step forward from current tracking methods such as barcodes and RFID tags, with IBM Global Supply Chain lead Paul Chang tell Fortune: \n“The missing piece was a shared forum where companies could begin to see each others’ transactions and develop trust . That missing piece is something like the blockchain.”\nInformation stored on the blockchain, where fraud and inaccuracies are much harder to get away with, includes details related to farm origins, factory data, expiration dates, storage temperatures, and shipping. “We can eliminate layers that exist today that add very little value to the industry.”\nWalmart Vice President of Food Safety Frank Yiannas explains that it’s an effeciency measure as well, in that it allows the company to pull a tainted packages off store shelves where the tainted product is stocked, versus the current practice of recalling that product from all stores.\n“With Blockchain, you can do strategic removals, and let consumers and companies have confidence. We believe that enhanced traceability is good for other aspects of the food systems. We hope you could capture other important attributes that would inform decisions around food flows, and even get more efficient at it.”\nImage credit: jeepersmedia/Flickr/CC by 2.0 ",

      "text": "Wednesday, November 23, 2016, 07:14 by Reuters IBM invests in UK data centres as tech sector defies Brexit worries The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company IBM. Photo: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters \nGlobal IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said yesterday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the EU. \nIBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe’s general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n“UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making and to deliver better customer service,” he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June Brexit vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation \n“Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,” he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain’s enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fuelled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country’s future relationship with the EU and, in particular, the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. \nCompanies, including Google and Facebook, have decided the advantages outweigh the risks but they’ve emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain’s future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nKrause, however, said IBM was “well-equipped” for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. « Oil prices rise to highest this month on hopes of Opec deal Advert \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

      "title": "IBM to treble UK data centre capacity despite Brexit worries",
      "text": "Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, November 23, 2016 \nLONDON — Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said yesterday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the United Kingdom after its vote to leave the European Union (EU). \nIBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe’s general manager for cloud services, Mr Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. “UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,” he said in an interview. IBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June Brexit vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n“Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,” he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain’s enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fuelled by world-class universities, against the uncertainty of the country’s future relationship with the EU, and in particular, the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. Companies, including Google and Facebook, have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they have emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI; retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone; and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain’s future compliance with European data-protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. Mr Krause, however, said IBM was “well-equipped” for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in future.

      "text": "It was a “near-death experience for TCS at the hands of Ratan Tata”, a statement from Mistry’s office said, recounting that it was JRD Tata who turned down Ratan Tata’s proposal from IBM. (Reuters) In a somewhat shocking revelation, ousted Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry on Tuesday claimed Ratan Tata had tried to sell Tata Consultancy Services to IBM. It was a “near-death experience for TCS at the hands of Ratan Tata”, a statement from Mistry’s office said, recounting that it was JRD Tata who turned down Ratan Tata’s proposal from IBM.\nA recent Tata Sons statement had attempted to belittle Mistry’s role as chairman of TCS and Tata Motors, saying Mistry had made no material contribution to the jewel in the Tata crown.\nThe note said the decision to buy Corus for over $12 billion, when only a year earlier it was available at less than half that, was based on “one man’s ego” and against reservations of some board members and senior executives.\n“The overpayment for Corus made it harder to invest in it, which had been neglected, and thereby, placed many jobs at risk,” it added. Moreover, Tata had decided to back CDMA technology over GSM against the advice of many of his own team members, the statement said. Attempting to put the record straight, the five-page note from Mistry’s office said it was important to do so since “insinuations and leaks are being made explicitly to create an illusion that Mistry was a ‘hands off’ chairman and TCS/JLR (Jaguar Land Rover) were on ‘auto-pilot’ during his leadership”.\nThe statement, the third in a series from Mistry’s office, noted that “Tata made a strategic decision to enter CDMA space despite advices to the contrary. This strategic decision led to a series of consequences that currently leave the company structurally challenged. Once again, one person’s judgment adversely affected the jobs of thousands,” it said.\nIn its earlier two clarifications, Mistry’s office had focused on the allegations of the group drifting away from the Tata values during his tenure, independence of directors in group companies, explanations on a surge in expenses and the huge write-offs, which the group had to take under his leadership.\nA few minutes after the statement was released by Mistry’s office, the Tatas hit back by sending a requisition to Tata Power — the only Tata Group company that hadn’t yet been asked by Tata Sons to convene an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to remove Mistry as chairman/director — to convene an EGM to do the same.\nIn the statement, Mistry while defending his performance as chairman has also bestowed lavish praise on several top Tata executives like TCS CEO N Chandrasekaran, Ravi Kant, former vice-chairman of Tata Motors, and Ralf Speth, CEO of JLR.\nMistry so far has been replaced as chairman of TCS and Tata Global Beverages. Meanwhile, Tata Sons has sent requisitions to the boards of other Tata Group companies like Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Chemicals and Indian Hotels to convene EGMs to remove him from their respective boards.\nMistry, on his part, has found support from independent directors of Tata Chemicals and Indian Hotels, who have applauded his efforts and praised his performance. Earlier this month, three independent directors of even Tata Steel — including old Tata ally Nusli Wadia — are believed to have spoken up in Mistry’s support. Wadia’s support for Mistry has led to Tata Sons pursuing to remove him from the boards of Tata Group companies in which he is a director. An aggrieved Wadia, in turn, has sent a defamation notice to Tata Sons, saying the special notice to remove him from the Tata Steel board had lowered his image.",

      "text": "About Telecom Billing Outsourcing The telecommunication sector is struggling because, despite overall growth, it faces reduction in average revenue per user (ARPU), stringent regulations, and competition from over the top (OTT) providers and new entrants such as Google that are entering the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) space. Therefore, CEOs are looking for ways to control costs, find new revenue streams, improve efficiency, and integrate diverse operating systems.Telecom players generally increase capital expenditure subject to substantial reduction in operating expenditure. They need to constantly improve quality and enhance customer service. To mitigate rise in expenditure, they turn to outsourcing to manage non-core business processes, customer care services, and infrastructural systems. Outsourcing has become an important tool to manage inefficiency and focus on core competencies.

      "text": "IBM Stock: International Business Machines Corp.’s Big Bet By Gaurav S. Iyer, IFC   23, 2016 Photo: Ethan Miller / Staff / Getty Images Where IBM Stock is Headed Next \nWhile most companies started packing their bags after Britain voted to leave the European Union (EU), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) decided to double down. \nThe giant IT vendor is going to build four new data centers on the island, a riskless bet that could pay off big-time for IBM stock. There is a growing appetite for cloud services, both in the corporate and personal markets, and IBM wants to press its advantage while land is cheap in the U.K. (Source: “ IBM Will Triple the Number of Cloud Data Centers It Has in Britain ,” Fortune , November 22, 2016.) \n“U.K. customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,” said IBM Europe’s general manager for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, to Fortune. \nBritain’s economy is much bigger than its physical presence would suggest, which is why IBM thinks there is money to be made on its shores. The company already has two data centers there, and it had planned this expansion well in advance of Brexit. \nWhen asked what impact Brexit had on IBM’s thinking, Krause said the company saw no reason to scale back its ambitions. “Everyone has concluded the U.K. economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,” he said. \nAs one of the leading IT vendors in the world, IBM has working relationships with hundreds of companies around the world. Many of these companies want to migrate their workbooks to the cloud, but some still want to house servers on their premises. \nCompanies have proprietary data that could be devastating if leaked, which is perceived as more likely on a public cloud. Whether those security concerns are valid, they are certain to impact businesses’ choice of cloud provider. \nIBM has an edge in this corner of the market, alongside Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), because the company has invested heavily into a mix of public and private servers. The addition of four giant data centers should bolster IBM’s competitiveness in Britain, particularly as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) rush to catch up in private cloud offerings. \nThese competitive advantages will likely play out in the medium-to-long term for IBM stock. But, in the meantime, the company can benefit from the U.K.’s wealth of talent.

      "text": "Summary \nThis article is part of a series of interviews with IBM executives. \nIn this article, I ask IBM about its strategy in relation to mobile, security and acquisitions. \nI also investigate some of the accounting reclassifications. This article is part of a series of interviews with IBM . I started covering IBM on Seeking Alpha on the 4th of July 2016. At that time the stock was priced at $152. It is now worth $162.7, offering a gain of almost 7% plus 1.8% in dividends in about five months. At that time, I valued IBM between $179 and $219, I think that this valuation is still representative. In today's article, I report some remaining questions about IBM's strategic imperatives and about the M&A strategy, as well as some accounting questions raised by some Seeking Alpha readers. In my first article , I praised the turnaround of the company. I then had the opportunity to conduct interviews with IBM executives. In the first part of my interview with IBM, I tried to understand the long-term vision of the firm. I then elaborated on Watson, IBM's cognitive system. Here I disclosed my discussion with IBM's corporate team. I then had the chance to dig deeper and have a conversation with Rob High , IBM Watson CTO, and tried to shed some light on Watson's performance and business model . In my last two articles, I interviewed the CEO of InsightNG, a partner of the IBM Watson Ecosystem and Don Boulia VP of Cloud . Today, I start my interview asking details about mobile, social and security. These imperatives are relatively smaller compared to, for example, cloud but are still highly relevant. Can you please elaborate on what services IBM offers in terms of security? \nIBM Security offers consulting and services for the prevention, detection, remediation and management of security incidents. IBM both consults, runs and manages clients' security, including providing consulting IBM CISO's (Chief Information Security Officers) from our services team that work with the client company. IBM Security: is a $2B unit within IBM with 7,500+ people, with 12,000+ customers, within 133 countries and 19 acquisitions since 2002 is #1 in enterprise security software and services protects 80% of the Fortune 100 protects 75 of the world's largest financial services companies by revenue protects 8 of the 10 largest US Banks by consolidated assets 8 of the 10 largest US Healthcare companies by revenue protects 9 of the world's largest global telecom companies by revenue protects 22 of the 25 world's largest banks is used by 7 of the 10 largest US Electric & Utilities companies by market value is used by 20 of the top 25 US Retail Companies is used by 40 of the top 50 insurance companies of the world \nMost of IBM Security clients don't want to be a reference for fear of becoming a target for hackers, but we can share the following: The McGill University Health Centre : IBM and Trend Micro helps this healthcare provider rapidly detect and respond to attacks, analyzing at least 700 events per second. The University of New Brunswick : IBM QRadar is helping the university modernize its security architecture, increase virtualization and save costs. Concur Technologies : To protect mission-critical applications, IBM Security AppScan helps Concur test for source and production code. Although these are imperatives, their revenues are still very small. How does IBM plan to develop these segments? Are these segments performing as expected? Will they be left behind and dropped to focus on cloud and AI that seem to have momentum? \nWe continued to see strong growth in 3Q for mobile (up 19 percent to $1.2 billion) and security (up 11 percent). This followed growth in 2Q for mobile (up 43 percent to $1 billion) and security (up 18 percent). So mobile is a $3 billion business YTD (up 42 percent) and security more than $1 billion (up 16 percent). These are important businesses for us. \nMany analysts, including analyst firm Technology Business Research, have identified IBM as the global leader in security services and software. IBM is the fastest growing and leading security company for the enterprise (it's growing faster than the market). In addition, IBM is leading the move to true cognitive security with Watson for Cyber Security, which was announced in May. Watson is learning the nuances of security research findings and discovering patterns and evidence of hidden cyber-attacks and threats that could otherwise be missed. \nGiven that it takes companies an average of 229 days to detect advanced persistent threats, and according to Juniper Research, cybercrime will become a $2.1 trillion dollar problem by 2019, IBM sees security as one of the critical areas companies should focus on. Acquisitions IBM is investing a substantial amount of capital into acquisitions. Can you please give us an indication of the rationale for each recent acquisition, what IBM plans to achieve/acquire with each of them and how is the integration going? \nIBM has made more than 30 acquisitions since the start of 2014. Most of these acquisitions fall within our strategic imperatives, and help IBM accelerate and scale quickly in those markets- for example, our most recent planned acquisition announcement for Promontory Financial Group will become our Watson Financial Services offering within our new Industry Platform business unit. \nAnother example - we acquired Merge Healthcare (a medical imaging analyzing and processing company), which joined our Watson Health business unit because we want to bolster our clients' ability to analyze and cross-reference medical images against billions of data points already in the Watson Health Cloud. \nOur acquisition of the Weather Company's digital properties seemed odd at first glance, but if you dig a little deeper, you'll realize there is rich data related to the weather. The weather affects every single industry and every single company. IBM will license weather forecast data and analytics to clients. You can also look at our Cleversafe acquisition and how it fits into our cloud strategy. Cleversafe is a developer and manufacturer of object-based storage software and appliances. We brought it into our cloud business to give our clients better data flexibility and cloud deployment options. Can you give an indication of IBM's future acquisition strategies? How much does it plan to invest, which type of companies? \nWe don't disclose any future acquisition plans. However, as mentioned above, our focus has been on strategic imperatives - cloud (e.g., video, object storage); data (i.e., Merge Healthcare); platforms (e.g., The Weather Company); and deep vertical industry expertise (e.g., Promontory Financial Group). Accounting reclassification From the latest financial reports, I can see that the segment reporting of IBM is changing. This of course creates problems for comparison. Would you be able to provide historical revenues and operating profits for each strategic imperative for the last few years on a comparable basis (maybe 2/3 years)? \nThe point with the new reporting structure is to provide better insight into the business as we go through our transformation. We expect the new structure will help investors understand where we are making investments and where we are seeing returns. \nYou can find historical data using the reclassified segments for 2014 and 2015 using this link . These are for the five segments that IBM began using in 1Q 2016 \nThis point has been raised by a Seeking Alpha reader and I think it makes sense. I looked into the link and I did not find any issue with the reporting. I would be interested to see whether readers spot any inconsistency. In addition, could you explain why Transaction Processing Software has been moved inside Cognitive Solutions, the two don't seem to be related. \nTPS is in Cognitive Solutions because it performs functions similar to the solutions software that is also part of CS. Operating system SW is in the Systems segment; cloud software is in the Technology Services and Cloud Platform segment. \nWhile Cognitive Solutions includes Watson Health and Watson IOT, which are today taking advantage of IBM's cognitive technologies. It is a segment where we are building platforms. Today analytics, which is the largest part of our solutions software portfolio includes the traditional analytics platform, industry solutions and the Watson-related businesses. TPS runs mission critical systems in industries like banking, airlines and retail. Systems/hardware These segments are losing revenues at a rapid pace, what is IBM plan in relation to them? Will IBM divest, keep them as cash cows, fight the decline, sell them or? \nOur systems performance reflects both product cycle dynamics in z Systems and portfolio transitions in Power and storage. Power systems reflects the declining UNIX market and growth in an expanding Linux market. At the same time our Systems business is delivering important technologies and capabilities that enable us to address the cognitive and cloud opportunities. As always, thank you for reading. Although I will keep analyzing IBM, this is probably the last article of this series. I hope you enjoyed it. If you wish to follow my future articles just click the \" Follow \" button next to my name at the top. I would also be interested to know what you think about IBM recent earnings' release and its future prospects. Finally, if you are would like me to cover a particular company please let me know in the comments. Thank you for reading! Elsewhere on Seeking Alpha",

      "text": "IBM is developing an incredible value proposition for the banking space. \nHuge brand recognition and cloud infrastructure put the company in an enviable position. \nInvestors, this is why you should prepare to capture a deluge of cash over the coming years. Over International Business Machines Corp.'s (NYSE: IBM ) 105-year history, its many services and several scandals have been written about enough to fill enough books and articles to satisfy even the most voracious reader for months' worth of reading. Many readers know me for a focus on the investment's ability to generate cash and for my sometimes-habit of rating companies based on the safety of their dividend. I'll cover these factors for IBM's case in the next section. What I'm excited to share with you today is an enormous business opportunity the company is gearing up to exploit in the coming years. The essence of the technology I'm introducing in this article has been touched on many times, but the implications for the economy and the IBM investor have not been well elaborated by the mainstream journalist nor analysts. I hope to bring some light to this topic for my readers today. This article will touch on IBM's financial position, its foray into blockchain technology, and why the blockchain is likely to generate cash-like gangbusters for the firm. Summary Financial Information IBM has been in business since 1911 (then operating under the clumsy name The Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company until 1924). The firm has a history of consistently paying its dividend, a history reaching back to 1987. Today, its 29-year record of consistent dividend payments looks poised to continue as free cash flows certainly cover the annual payout schedule of $5.33B.

Click to enlarge Source: Faloh Investment In terms of financial security, IBM is well positioned. The dividend is well secured by free cash flow, and there's even room for the company to grow the distribution if it chooses to do so. The Blockchain The most exciting technology. The blockchain concept and first implementation - both pioneered by Australian software engineer Craig Wright - have made waves in several places. Many of them illicit; the bitcoin \"alternative currency\" having had so few observers for the longest time became widely used for transactions in the black markets dealing various drugs and services. The seedy uses of the blockchain-based bitcoin currency aren't a result of an inherent evil in the new technology. But rather the result of the utility of the blockchain combined with its long-time obscurity from the eyes of law enforcement. What Is The Utility Of A Blockchain? First I'll note: There is not just one blockchain. Just like there is not just one brand of soda. There is the IBM-Blockchain, the Bitcoin-Blockchain, and so on. The function of this technology is to act as a secure ledger for transactions and as a storehouse of data. Additionally, anyone with access to a particular segment of a blockchain can view all of the transactions and data recorded therein. Now, the utility. A business really only makes money on the utility its product or service offers to individuals in the marketplace. In the case of an IBM-Blockchain, it plans to offer its brand of the technology to the banking industry. Here's what it will do for IBM's clients: Save money on document transfer and verification Streamline and eliminate ambiguity in multi-party transactions Speed up transactions More details on the blockchain from IBM are available here. How the IBM-Blockchain will continuously earn money for the company: It will retain ultimate control over access to its blockchain The company will add value with ongoing data hosting, connectivity, and security updates IBM will earn money through subscription and access fees When It Comes To Rolling Out Blockchain Technology, IBM May Be The Best Positioned Company On The Planet \nIBM is ... the world's most essential company. Our core systems run 90 percent of the top 60 banks and 80 percent of airline reservations. Seventy percent of the world's business data is managed by our mainframes. - Ginni Rometty, Chairman, President, and CEO, IBM Major banks and airlines already know and do business with IBM. This puts the company in a position to integrate this product into its offer, whether in contract renewals, or as part of its policy of continuous contact with its clients. Why This Is A Major Growth Opportunity For IBM - Not Just A Growth Opportunity Having another product to sell many of its existing clients is not the only benefit. As I mentioned before, the blockchain acts as a secure general ledger and will be used to speed up transactions. Every participant in a transaction will need access to the blockchain host of that specific transaction. The market opportunity for the IBM-Blockchain is therefore more expansive than service to the banking sector. It gives IBM a reach into everyone who does business with the banking sector! Finance-related businesses from Main Street to Wall Street will be compelled and even prefer to do business over the dominant blockchain as it speeds up transactions, saves money on paperwork, reduces time wasted on back-and-forth authentications, and increases security. The fundamental expansion in the number of clients IBM will have the opportunity to serve as a result of this upcoming product turns this up from a growth opportunity to a major growth opportunity. Summary Very, very many words have been written on the transformational power of the blockchain. For more detail on how this technology serves when underpinning transactions, I recommend you read the Wall Street Journal's What The Blockchain Is And What It Can Do . The business opportunity for IBM is enormous because of its established relationships with the very clients who will create a widespread need for access to the blockchain among their own clients. It's akin to free marketing and a built-in captive customer base for IBM's product. The company's size and enduring brand are significant factors which will lead the big banks to adopt the IBM-Blockchain rather than any competitor's. Economically, the profit margin on the IBM-Blockchain is likely to be substantial. The product is essentially an electronic data service. Ongoing capital needs will therefore be minimal. IBM's ongoing and aggressive expansion of its data center capacity actually represent investment into the future - the blockchain roll-out - not just a catch-up game for competing with other cloud programs, such as the wildly successful Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Web Services. Takeaway IBM's stock has rallied over 30% from a recent low of $117.85 per share and still offers a secure annual yield of 3.44%. The IBM-Blockchain represents a huge cash-generating opportunity just around the corner. I rate IBM a buy based on my research and the factors discussed in this article. One caution: It may be a couple more years before all of these benefits are realized in the form of additional cash on IBM's bottom line. IBM is a long-term dividend growth investment opportunity.

      "text": "Thomson is claiming a first with the launch of its virtual assistant using IBM’s Cloud platform and Watson technology.\nThe travel search service will enable customers to get immediate responses on suggestions for holiday destinations and experiences.\nThe tour operator says it’s trialling the tool, which uses natural language, following research showing 77% of people feel a virtual assistant would be useful in holiday search.\nSo far, the chatbot can be used via Firefox and Google Chrome.\nOver time, Thomson says the service will continue to develop as customer feedback is used to improve responses.\nIBM Watson has been developed to learn through interaction and therefore become smarter with its responses.\nJeremy Osborne, director of strategic innovation for Thomson-parent TUI UK & Ireland, says:\n“By leveraging IBM Cloud Technology with Watson’s cognitive intelligence, we are raising the bar in the travel industry. We are delivering an interactive service experiment to our customers that offers holiday inspiration ideas and personalised search results based on customer interests.\nThomson is not the only travel company to be using the technology with travel discovery service Wayblazer an early leader with the technology.\nWayblazer announced back in January that Trisept Solutions would be integrating the technology into its travel agency desktop system.\nIn June, Singapore-based Zumata announced it was working with IBM Watson serve up personalised hotel results on third party sites.\nA number of industry players, including airlines and online travel agencies, have launched chatbot services in recent months.\nOne of the most recent is Aeromexico with its Aerobot service which enables travellers to search for flights via Facebook Messenger.\nThe service, which is powered by customer experience specialist Yalo , enables flight search of Aeromexico and partner flights with users transferred to the airline’s website for booking.\nAvailable in English and Spanish, Aerobot also provides flight status updates and answers frequently asked questions such as luggage allowance.\nAeromexico’s vice president of ecommerce Brian Gross says:\n“Conversational commerce is about to go big in North America and across the world. But also, Mexicans are among the most avid users in the world of chat apps and of Facebook.\n“73% of Mexican Facebook users already contact their favorite companies via Facebook. Our customers already use and love these channels, so we want to be there too. And eventually, we’ll be able to service our customers who use artificial intelligence assistants like Google Home and Amazon Echo.”\n",

Companies in all industries, especially finance and health-related sectors, are increasingly challenged to proactively secure, monitor and report all activities related to potential security breaches.This has been a particular challenge with legacy applications, including those running on the IBM i. \nThe majority of terminal emulators used to access such applications rely on Java applets or ActiveX plugins, both seen as a security risk.This recent technical alliance combines the KPMG penetration tested Flynet Viewer web based terminal emulator , Flynet Viewer legacy modernisation tools and Raz-Lee’s iSecurity Suite of security, auditing, encryption and compliance solutions, offering IBM i users an unparalleled level of both application and system security. \nEli Spitz, VP Business Development at Raz-Lee said: “The technical alliance with Flynet will allow customers to enjoy worry free access, modernisation and liberation of their IBM i applications and platform. The Flynet web based terminal emulator allows users to access their IBM i applications from any device, the 100% pure html emulator doesn’t present a conventional threat surface to would be attackers, couple this with the Flynet framework acting in a “well behaved state” means that users can add additional security without making any compromises on availability or functionality”. \nChristian Rule Director of Business Transformation, Flynet “Raz-Lee’s credentials are second to none, with partners and customers in more than 40 countries worldwide. Flynet are proud to be recognised by Raz-Lee as offering a uniquely secure access and modernisation platform for IBM i. The combination of the respective technologies offers IBM i owners a way to administer, modernise and access applications from any device. Mobile and SOA projects can be delivered securely and with ease, greatly reducing the time to value whilst offering a level of threat mitigation not previously possible.” \n“Flynet’s browser based terminal emulation solution installs server side in about 15 minutes, deploying to an entire enterprise in seconds. The solution allows users to access the host from any web browser, on any device. It’s client agnostic and does not require any plug-ins, applets or client side software installation. The Flynet Studio UX application allows users to convert green screens to web UIs or web services in a tenth of the nearest alternative, what’s more it doesn’t require any coding at all. The combination of Flynet and Raz-Lee is the most secure, robust and quickest way for IBM i owners to answer the needs of the modern enterprise from mobile to IoT and beyond”. \nAbout Flynet Flynet is an established enterprise software company based in Cambridge.

      "text": "  Bret Greenstein, IBM \nIn the United States, the privatized healthcare system allows patients to choose where to go for their treatments. There is real competition among hospitals. As a result, patients and their families increasingly expect an excellent “customer experience” — in the hospital. \nThomas Jefferson University Hospitals, Inc. in Philadelphia and Harman International have long realized this trend and have cultivated an innovation team to look at how new technologies can improve the experience of patients and their loved ones. \nThe Cognitive Concierge in Your Hospital Room \nEarlier this year, IBM Watson IoT , Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals, Inc. and Harman International formulated an idea about the future of healthcare. They envisioned a hospital setting where patients can speak naturally to a cognitive concierge in their hospital room that will be able to answer questions, adjust their environment, and anticipate their preferences. \nVery soon after those early conversations, the teams got to work on a pilot project to produce a working prototype of a cognitive environment of care where we can all get a glimpse into the future of healthcare. \nImagine a family standing around a hospital bed. The patient turns to a speaker: “I am cold! Please make it a bit warmer in the room. Oh, and please raise the blinds for more light.” \nAs if by magic, the room complies with the request. The patient then asks “What’s for lunch today?” and hears a menu of options. A visitor then asks, “Please tell me about the doctor looking after my family member” or, “What are the visiting hours tomorrow?” \nYou get the idea. This prototype is just the beginning. There is a deeper trend of making technology fade into the background to the point where the patients’ experiences become about natural engagement and interaction with the environment. It is not a far stretch to foresee that cognitive-assisted services will supplement all manners of care in offering a more personalized healthcare experience. \nIntroducing “Cognitive Care” \nVoice assistance is giving way to “cognitive care,” which can apply to patients at a hospital, seniors at home, students at school, or any service provider that requires individual attention. \nFor example, a cognitive system — combined with the Internet of Things — can interact through objects in seniors’ homes, learn and anticipate their habits and needs, and offer guidance or encouragement at the right time and place. \nWith cognitive care at home, elderly people living alone can be more independent and can receive reminders for appointments and medications. They can access care services by means of voice commands. And their family and caregivers can feel assured that they will be alerted of any issues or changes to their health or wellbeing. \nThe amazing thing about the technology is that it can answer questions and execute requests that are very specific to the context of the user. This is possible because IBM Watson can correlate information across building systems, patient records, CRM systems and administrative records. \nWatson can draw patterns and remember preferences for follow-up visits, allowing for an engaging and interactive experience for patients. Patients are provided with a responsive, cognitive and personalized environment of care — when they need it most. \nTo usher in the Cognitive Era, we are working with leading thinkers and innovators, such as Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and Harman International, to put the experience of patients above all else. While I would not say that I look forward to sitting in a hospital room, I will say that use of our cognitive IoT solutions could make a real difference in people’s lives when they do need to be in a hospital. \nTweet this: \nBret Greenstein is the Vice President of IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform. \n ",

Seemingly, this acquisition with Promontory Financial was long-planned ones and IBM ensured that it had efficient resources to judiciously extract maximum productivity and value for its AI platform.\nPromontory Financial’s professional will be tasked with training Watson, by feeding it regulatory information periodically and through interactions in real-world applications. The solutions include regulatory expectations, obligations, and control requirements, specific compliance needs such as insider threat, counter fraud, and consumer complaint databases.\nThis collaboration midst the Promontory Financial’s experts and IBM’s Watson platform will aim at developing a smarter solution to find and regulate suspicious transactions and customers, which the firm ultimately plans to sell to banks.\nThe financial details of the acquisition were not released, and Promontory Financial would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM.\nStock Performance\nAt the closing bell, on Tuesday, November 22, 2016, International Business Machines’ stock marginally fell 0.06%, ending the trading session at $162.67.

      "text": "IBM Closes Buyout of Regulatory Compliance Firm Promontory by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 23, 2016 International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM - Free Report ) has announced the completion of its acquisition of Promontory Financial Group, a leading risk management and regulatory compliance consulting firm. What Led to the Acquisition? Today, financial regulations and risk management requirements are changing rapidly. These demand substantial operational efforts and costs to keep pace with. With Promontory’s expertise in the aforementioned field, the acquisition is likely to strengthen IBM’s capabilities going ahead. Additionally, with Watson that is equipped with cognitive capabilities, IBM will be able to speed up its development of cognitive solutions for compliance and risk management. \nINTL BUS MACH Price \nINTL BUS MACH Price | INTL BUS MACH Quote What Does this Mean for IBM? The Promontory acquisition will complement the Industry Platforms business of IBM, which has been created to offer “as a service” offerings custom built for individual industries. We note that, this will combine the benefits of the IBM Cloud, Watson and industry specific capabilities of specialized providers to achieve enhanced efficiency, security, quality and transparency while lowering operational costs. In other words, IBM is trying to strengthen its presence in the cloud business that is gathering steam with every passing day. As per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems is estimated to reach over $31 billion by 2019 growing at a CAGR of 55%. Notably, the banking sector alone will account for 20% share of the total spending on cognitive systems. Intensifying Competition We note that competition is intensifying in the financial regulations and risk management segment with the presence of players such as ICI Consulting, Primatics Financial, LLC and Resources Global Professionals. However, the Promontory deal puts IBM in good stead among its peers. Zacks Rank & Key Picks At present, IBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "  Goldman Sachs' Most Meaningful Short Positions List ExxonMobil tops the rankings   XOM +0% IBM +0% T +0% CAT +0% GE +0% PG +0% ABT +0% DIS +0% BA +0% FCX +0% DLR +0% AZO +0% CVX +0% \nData on the most meaningful short positions that count to hedge funds have been composed by Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research from the source FactSet. These data can be found on zerohedge.com . \nAccording to aforementioned sources, ExxonMobil Corp. ( NYSE:XOM ) is the leader of the ranking that covers \"50 stocks representing important short positions\" with a value of short interest of $4.5 billion as of Oct. 31. \nExxonMobil is tailgated by International Business Machines Corp. ( NYSE:IBM ) with a value of short interest of $3.7 billion. \nThe other top 10 stocks that occupy the ranking representing the most significant stock shares volume that have been sold short but not bought back yet by investors are AT&T Inc. ( NYSE:T ) and Caterpillar Inc. ( NYSE:CAT ) with a value of short interest of $3.6 billion, Chevron Corp. ( NYSE:CVX ) with $3.5 billion, Boeing Co. ( NYSE:BA ) with $3.3 billion, General Electric Co. ( NYSE:GE ) with $3.2 billion, Procter & Gamble Co. ( NYSE:PG ) and Abbott Laboratories ( NYSE:ABT ) with a value of short interest of $3.0 billion and Walt Disney Co. ( NYSE:DIS ) that closes the top 10 stocks group with a value of short interest of $2.9 billion.   XOM \nIf the first 10 ranking positions were sorted out according to the short interest computed as a percentage of float capital that is dividing the value of shares sold short by the value of shares available for trading, the first position would be occupied by Caterpillar with a ratio of 7% as of Oct. 31, followed by Abbott Laboratories with a ratio of 5% and Boeing with a ratio of 4%. \nCaterpillar has 585.07 million shares outstanding and approximately 99.84% of it is available for trading of the New York Stock Exchange. This means that approximately 40.89 million shares of Caterpillar have been sold short by investors and still not bought back. \nConcerning Abbott Laboratories a volume of approximately 73.5 million shares have been sold short on a float of 1.47 billion shares available for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \nWith a ratio of 4%, approximately 23 million shares of Boeing have been sold short on a total of 574.82 million of shares available for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \nBringing up the ranking’s rear is occupied by those stocks that have a value of short interest of $1.3 billion. Of these stocks worth mentioning are Freeport-McMoRan ( NYSE:FCX ) and Digital Realty Trust ( NYSE:DLR ) because their short interest ratios calculated as a percentage of float cap is 10% which is the highest in the overall ranking even though it cannot be seen as a prediction of increasing pessimistic market feeling on these three stocks. A red flag is usually raised when this ratio is more than 25%. \nAutoZone Inc. ( NYSE:AZO ), a U.S. retailer that distributes automotive replacement parts, occupies the upper middle of the ranking with a short interest of 9% and a value of $2.0 billion. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in any stock mentioned in this article. \nStart a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.

Of these, three will be asked to build a prototype platform during the next phase of the procurement process. \nIBM is going it alone on its design for the project, while T-Systems is partnering with Huawei and several others to create its platform . The company is also involved in Rhea Group’s bid. The fourth and final group features HPE, Advania, Sixsq and Indra. \nAs previously reported by Computer Weekly , Cern is one of 10 European research organisations backing the project, which is geared towards providing scientific researchers from across the continent with on-demand access to big data and high performance computing (HPC) capabilities. \nThe organisations said they are seeking to combine commercial cloud services with publicly funded infrastructures and participants’ own in-house IT resources to create the Helix Nebula hybrid cloud environment. \nT-Systems has confirmed its suggested design will be based on its Openstack-based Open Telekom Cloud service . The offering draws on the communications network of its parent company, Deutsche Telekom, and features networking kit from Huawei. \nThe offering is already used to provide public cloud services to enterprises, small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and public sector organisation across the continent.

Microsoft is donating $5m worth of cloud computing capacity to The Alan Turing Institute’s research teams to support their data science work.cer research project with Intel is progressing. \nBob Jones, leader of the Helix Nebula initiative at Cern, said one thing all of the selected consortia share is their commitment to innovation. \n“We are very pleased with the response to the tender and we would like to thank all the organisations that took the effort of submitting a bid. We realised it was a lot of work for those companies and we want to acknowledge it,” he said. CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join. E-Zine",

      "text": "Cyrus Mistry issues statement: Ratan Tata tried to sell TCS to IBM; made Corus buy costly Cyrus Mistry issues statement: Ratan Tata tried to sell TCS to IBM; made Corus buy costly Ratan Tata also decided to back CDMA as platform for telecom business, against his team’s advice: Mistry By: ENS Economic Bureau | Mumbai | Published:November 23, 2016 2:25 am Mistry’s latest salvo has come at a time when TCS has convened a shareholders’ meeting to remove Mistry as a director. \nCyrus Mistry, who was ousted as the Tata Sons’ chairman last month, on Tuesday alleged that Ratan Tata tried to sell TCS, the cash cow of the $103-billion group, to IBM but the then group chairman JRD Tata refused to even discuss the proposal and turned it down. \n“Midway during the TCS journey to date, FC Kohli (who was then heading TCS) was suffering from a cardiac condition. Ratan Tata was then heading Tata Industries’ JV with IBM and approached JRD Tata with a proposal from IBM to buy out TCS. JRD Tata refused to discuss the deal because FC Kohli was still recovering in the hospital from his setback,” Mistry’s office alleged. On his return, Kohli assured JRD that TCS had a bright future and the group should not sell the company. “JRD Tata turned down the offer, demonstrating true vision. But, it was also a near-death experience for TCS at the hands of Ratan Tata,” Mistry said. \nMistry also blamed Ratan Tata for the mess in its UK operations (Corus). Attacking Tata, Mistry said: “It is common knowledge that the decision to acquire Corus for over $12 billion, when only a year earlier it was available at less than half that price, was based on one man’s ego and against the reservations of some board members and senior executives.” \nMistry said the excess payment made it harder to invest in the acquired assets which had been neglected, and thereby placed many jobs at risk. Similarly, in November 2003, Tata, against the advice of many of his own team members, decided to back CDMA as the platform for the group’s telecom business. “This strategic decision has led to a series of consequences that currently leave the company structurally challenged. Once again, one person’s judgment adversely affected the jobs of thousands,” Mistry’s statement said. \nMistry’s latest salvo has come at a time when TCS has convened a shareholders’ meeting to remove Mistry as a director. \nAccording to Mistry, TCS had in FC Kohli a visionary founding CEO. “Today, N Chandrasekaran continues to provide strong and able leadership. Chandra, his leadership team, and the nearly 350,000 TCS employees have made us proud. Over the last 4 years, the TCS leadership team has engaged well, and complemented, the board. In his role as non-executive chairman, Mistry’s primary involvement with TCS has been focused on future-proofing TCS strategy and helping fortify their relationships at the C Suite level by leveraging the strength of the group,” it said. \nHe said the high dependence on TCS in the Tata Sons portfolio is a well-known fact. “This was repeatedly flagged in strategy presentations to the Tata Sons board by Mistry. Apart from strengthening other group firms, Mistry maintained that keeping TCS strong and relevant is critical,” the statement said. \n“For TCS to flourish, it was vital that TCS transformed from an IT solutions provider to a strategic partner because the digital imperative had become a strategic differentiator for many organisations. Consequently, the client relationship needed to move from engaging with the CIO (with whom traditionally Indian IT company CEOs maintained their relationship) to the CEO,” he said. As chairman of Tata Sons and TCS, Mistry’s access to senior stakeholders across the world was an enabling platform. “Over the last 3 years, Mistry met at least 60 global CEOs, some along with TCS leadership, to reinforce the capabilities of TCS for organisations to co-innovate in the digital world,” the statement said. \nLike TCS, JLR is fortunate to benefit from the strong leadership of Ralf Speth and his leadership team, who lead the highly committed JLR employees, he said. “JLR is one of the strong performers for the group today. The significant efforts of Ravi Kant, former vice chairman of Tata Motors, who virtually camped overseas to see the integration through and lead the transformation, too deserves special mention. JLR is at a critical juncture. The decisions taken today will decide its future resilience,” he said. Best of Express ",

      "text": "Tweet \nIBM has announced its commitment to a multi-million pound project that will see the company construct four new data centers in the UK to increase its cloud capabilities in the region. \nThe company revealed its new project ahead of the Autumn Statement, which offered a boost to the Government that has recently seen a number of large US technology companies increasing their operations in the country. IBM's decision to create four new data centers will triple its cloud computing capacity in the UK. \nCompanies that use the US company's data centers will gain access to their large amounts of storage and processing power. They will also be able to take advantage of IBM's own proprietary software such as its Watson artificial intelligence software. The company's customers in the region, which includes Boots and Dixons Carphone, have noted that IBM's new investment would make it the largest cloud network in Europe. When the project is completed, the company will have 16 data centers in the region with six of those located in the UK. \nDigital and cultural minister Matt Hancock applauded IBM's plan to offer more cloud data centers in the UK, saying: \"Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business. These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow\". \nA number of other large technology companies have recently revealed their own plans to expand their UK operations. Facebook announced this week that it will build a new headquarters and hire 500 new staff members to fill its new London office space and Google said that it will higher 3,000 additional staff members in London by 2020. \nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication.

      "text": "Wednesday, Nov 23, 2016 7:55 PM UTC IBM employee quits to protest company’s overture to Donald Trump Marketing strategist Elizabeth Wood says she felt \"deeply crushed\" at IBM chief's overtures to Donald Trump Topics: Donald Trump , IBM , President Trump , Racism , Trump transition , Business News , News , Politics News (Credit: AP/Mark Lennihan) \nAn employee at IBM has publicly resigned to protest the tech giant’s embrace of President-elect Donald Trump. \nElizabeth Wood, a senior content strategist in IBM’s corporate marketing department, announced this week that she is stepping down, after CEO Ginni Rometty offered to help the far-right leader “advance a national agenda in a time of profound change.” \nRometty published an open letter to Trump on Nov. 15, in which she expressed hope that they could “work together to achieve prosperity.” \n“I am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help achieve the aspiration you articulated,” the IBM chief wrote. She proposed ways in which the company could help the impending Trump administration create new jobs, build advanced infrastructure, reduce government inefficiency and make national investments. \nIn reply to her boss, Wood published her own open letter this week, expressing concern that her company would embrace a politician who ran an overtly racist, xenophobic and misogynist campaign. \n“Your letter offered the backing of IBM’s global workforce in support of his agenda that preys on marginalized people and threatens my well-being as a woman, a Latina and a concerned citizen,” she wrote. \nSalon spoke with Elizabeth Wood about her experience. Over the phone, the former IBM employee sounded concerned, yet brave and committed to doing what is right. “I was really offended — really deeply crushed,” Wood explained. “This was such a welcoming letter that it was just really distressing.” \n“It felt like such a clear message to IBMers,” she added. That message: profit trumps people. \nWood nevertheless spoke positively of her experience at IBM. “I did see a future in the company,” she said, noting she had not previously thought about leaving. She liked her job, and had worked there for roughly two years. “It took a while to get there,” Wood said. “But now, it doesn’t seem worth it to contribute that energy or give them that time, because it’s just, why — they don’t care about what, for so much of their own workforce, the real challenges and threats are.” Wood emphasized that, as a Latina woman, she feels especially threatened by the Trump administration her former employer has pledged to help. “The battle cry of Trump’s whole campaign has been this whole ‘build a wall’ nonsense,” she told Salon, noting that the billionaire has already surrounded himself with figures with extreme right-wing, bigoted ideologies. “A lot of people are scared. You can see it; you can feel it,” she added. “A lot of my peers are feeling powerless, saying, ‘I don’t know what to do.’ They are feeling threatened and unheard by this upcoming regime.” \nIn her letter to President-elect Trump, Ginni Rometty conceded that “there will be issues on which we agree, and issues on which we do not.” Yet she also detailed ways in which IBM — which she points out is “the nation’s largest technology employer” — could help Trump accomplish some of his administration’s economic goals. And the CEO highlighted that her company works in more than 175 countries around the world. \nWood expressed concerns about what such collaboration could mean. “IBM specifically has capabilities that will really aid in some of Trump’s more nefarious initiatives,” she said, citing the far-right administration’s pledge to carry out mass deportations and create a registry for Muslims. IBM does in fact have a precedent of working with ghastly regimes. In his book “ IBM and the Holocaust : The Strategic Alliance between Nazi Germany and America’s Most Powerful Corporation,” journalist Edwin Black detailed the past links between the powerful technology company and Adolf Hitler’s genocidal regime. Wood told Salon that she did not know about this history of Nazi collaboration, but commented, “It should serve as a warning to really consider when supporting political administrations like this.” The former IBM employee said she does not know what exactly she will do now; she did not have another job offer before resigning. But she feels confident that it was the right choice. Wood also made it clear that, although her open letter is addressed to Rometty, it is by no means only meant for her. “I know it wasn’t just her writing it; I’m sure there were many hands involved,” she said of the IBM CEO. Wood stressed that her warnings also apply to other corporations that plan to work with what will likely be an extreme and repressive Trump administration.
