      "text": "After years of anticipation, Netflix has produced and released six new hours of Gilmore Girls . These new episodes should be enjoyable to watch, if only because they let us all revisit beloved characters and familiar settings. \nBut they’re also six terrible hours of television. They tear up and throw out just about everything good about the show that the fandom relished, in service of a thoughtless artistic vision ripped from crappy early-aughts movie musicals. It’s hard to even believe how bad they are.\nThe original Gilmore Girls is a Bush Two-era classic, an occasionally melodramatic drama about a mother-daughter friendship anchored by its characters’ rapid-fire dialogue and encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture. In its dealings with class, female ambition, and generational divides, it sometimes approached the big leagues of genuinely transcendent, moment-defining television. \nthe original series was the best thing we, the girls, had seen It had flaws, sure — even the most adoring Gilmore Girls fan will concede that Rory was a little spoiled, and her mother Lorelai was a little immature, and that it’s weird as heck that they never bothered to fill the prop coffee cups with some kind of liquid. But it’s a cultural touchstone for millions of women for a reason: When it first came out, Gilmore Girls was the best thing we’d ever seen about mothers and daughters, and about girls who want to grow up to be not just successful, but important. \nNeil Jacobs / Netflix The reboot keeps much of the original creative team, with each episode written and directed by series creators Amy-Sherman Palladino and Dan Palladino. Casting director Jami Rudofsky, costume designer Brenda Maben, and producer Helen Pai are also notable holdovers, but change-ups in production design and cinematography stand out. The set has disorienting differences, mainly of scale , and much of the camera work is genuinely ridiculous. It looks like half of the series was shot from the angle of a security camera, and the other half was shot with hand-helds in extreme close-up. (Often peering directly up someone’s chin, Mr. Robot style.) \nSince Gilmore Girls left the air, budgets for TV have gotten much bigger, particularly on high-end cable and streaming services that place their bets carefully, then shell out for prestige content with a built-in fan base. Without knowing the exact number, it’s safe to say Netflix gave them a big leash. A Gilmore Girls reboot was a safe bet in terms of pre-existing interest, and Netflix reportedly spent $750,000 per episode (each) on co-stars Alexis Bledel and \nThe new Stars Hollow is as unsettling as a gussied-up corpse Graham alone. Unfortunately, the new Gilmore Girls creative team seems so preoccupied with finding ways to spend this money that they completely dismantled the light magical realism that made the original Gilmore Girls so special. The draw of the series’ setting, Stars Hollow, is that it feels like a place that might exist if we weren’t too mired in our current dreary lives to go search for it. It looks like a real town, operates like a town, does everything a town normally does, except that snow falls on cue, and everyone there is super-charming. The new Stars Hollow is revealed as a backlot facade when Rory and Logan decide to stand on top of one of the fake roofs during a incredibly long, Baz Luhrmann-y steampunk musical sequence soundtracked by The Beatles “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the rights to which must have cost a small fortune . Where the original series made the emphatic point that there was nothing to do within 50 miles of Stars Hollow, now there’s inexplicably an elaborate tango club with cathedral ceilings just a quick (and highly illegal) open-air Model-T ride away. \nThe new stars hollow is as unsettling as a gussied-up corpse Netflix has a reputation for giving its content creators complete freedom, so it’s retroactively clear that the family-friendly constraints of Gilmore Girls ’ primetime network days actually helped the team reign in some gaudier impulses. Aesthetic restrictions may have made the Palladinos double down on wit and sparkle in their writing — something they all but abandoned in the revival. And while the original scripts could be a bit prudish, at least they weren’t hostile and misogynistic in their dealings with sex. In one of the new episodes, Rory has her first one-night stand with a man dressed in a Wookie costume. Later, she pitches a reported piece on how women go to Comic Con just to have sex with nerds and then feel bad about themselves. Rory’s friend Paris (Liza Weil) operates a high-tech fertility clinic specializing in surrogacy, and refers to the women she employs as “breeders,” leading Lorelai’s live-in dude Luke (who has never been this stupid before) to believe he has to have sex with one of them in order to have a child. \nNeil Jacobs / Netflix The new episodes are also clogged with long, expensive setpieces that add nothing to the plot. The introduction of a Stars Hollow musical is just an excuse for Broadway darlings Sutton Foster and Christian Borle to show off for 20 minutes. Lorelai’s trip to California to “do Wild ” is clearly just a cynical joke-tweet that went too far. And Luke and Lorelai’s impromptu wedding takes several pages of visual inspiration from Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland for no obvious reason. \nFor all the new gloss, Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life is mostly joyless. All of the important characters are wallowing in misery, and not just because of the death of beloved patriarch Richard Gilmore (played by Edward Herrmann, who died in 2014). When we left Luke and Lorelai nine years ago, they were together at last, and seemingly poised to start the family they had discussed multiple times. Meeting them again, still unmarried — and more importantly, still childless after all these years — is actually depressing. The explanation is that they have communication problems, but come on. We’re supposed to believe they just forgot to talk about the prospect of a baby until it was biologically too late? Why? Lorelai’s oft-discussed triumphant life story, a gleaming heroine’s tale about independence, hard work, and inner strength, ends with her meekly accepting that she won’t get to have another child, and that she will have to take a ton of money from her parents to expand her inn — anything so she doesn’t go completely stir-crazy. \ndid luke and lorelai really just forget to live their lives for a decade? This six hours of television felt brutal and punishing — a story about female ambition cut off at the knees. It’s hurtful to see talented, brainy, driven Rory spiraling out 10 years down the line because she still has a terrible self-aggrandizing attitude. When we last saw her in 2007, she was heading off on Senator Obama’s campaign bus. Did she become a political reporter for a while? Does she really just have a handful of Slate and Atlantic bylines and one “Talk of the Town” piece to show for the last decade? Why didn’t she grow at all as a person? Did the writers really love her so much as she was that they just pickled her in it? The new episodes feel like an obnoxious, ham-fisted parable about what happens when kids are told they’re singularly special. At the last minute, the show tries to reverse itself by leading Rory to the idea of writing a memoir about her relationship with her mother… which is also a terrible, self-aggrandizing idea for a jobless person who is seemingly living off of a trust fund. It’s hard to say if the writers intended much of anything with a character arc that swings so dizzyling from cynical to smarmy. \nThe tacky technicolor veneer of the show only makes these cruel twists of fate feel more sinister, like we’ve been baited into a witch’s gingerbread cottage. \nNeil Jacobs / Netflix Rory’s friend Lane (Keiko Agena), who resisted her mother’s puritanical rules with her every breath in order to win the freedom to make music, now works in her mother’s antique store. Paris, who was ambition made flesh , falls apart at the sight of a high-school crush. This last development is especially mean, considering it wasn’t even a symptom of the writers trying to make room for former cast member Chad Michael Murray — they just hired a nondescript blonde man to stand in the frame without turning around! I usually don’t feel cool about speaking on behalf of all women, but this scenario has literally never happened. Paris is 32 and wildly successful, and her crush, Tristan, was in seven episodes, max. Grown-ass Paris does not care. \nAnd of course the four-part movie ends on November 5, 2016, just before the election that gave us President-Elect Trump. It’s a sparkly, sinister message-in-a-bottle from the final days before female ambition was excoriated on the grandest scale imaginable. How charming! Nestling into the couch with my sisters, mother, grandmother, and a party size bag of Cheetos, I expected six hours in Stars Hollow to be a salve. Turns out it’s a poison.",

      "title": "Fear of the Dark: Why Netflix’s ‘Black Mirror’ Is Great Science Fiction",
      "text": "| Featured , Future , Sci-fi 10 0 \nLegendary science fiction author Isaac Asimov once said, “The core of science fiction, its essence, has become crucial to our salvation, if we are to be saved at all.” \nWith its aim to predict and explore possible futures, science fiction is a powerful genre. \nThis is where Black Mirror is more than just a critically-acclaimed Netflix series. Created by Charlie Brooker, the dystopian series explores the negative implications of technological advancements on the future of humanity. The show is simply one of the most mind-expanding, gripping and unique works of television. It has the power to shift how you think about our species and the kind of future we might create for ourselves. A Portal Into the Future \nAs an anthology series, each standalone episode is a portal into an alternative future with a unique plot, a different setting and new characters. We are left asking ourselves: which of these worlds do we want to live in? What kind of future do we want to avoid? What kind of future do we want to pursue? How can we prevent some of the catastrophic events in these stories? \nHere are three big themes explored in season three and how they’re connected to our present. Digital Morality \nThe series does an exquisite job of exploring the consequences of a rapidly digitizing world on individual lives. One notable recurring theme of season three is the impact of social media on our collective behavior and the influence it has on group dynamics. As social media becomes an increasingly dominant part of our lives, we see a blurring of lines between our physical and digital realities. This has profound implications on our morality and ethical behavior. \n“ Nosedive ,” the first episode of the series, is set in a world where our society runs on social media scores. It tells the story of a social climber who plans a trip to a lush wedding, desperate to boost her online score. In this world, your score—which other people give you after interacting with you—determines your class, the resources you have access to and the kind of life you are allowed to live. A low social media score is equivalent to being poverty-stricken. \nLike many of the other episodes, such a reality may seem improbable. But the parallels with the world we live in today are ingenious. \nSocial media has come to play a significant role in our lives. As we curate our digital identities, the affirmation we receive on social media can sometimes have an impact on our self-esteem and happiness. “ Nosedive” takes this idea even further by depicting a world where our happiness and growth are literally determined by social media. \nThe issue of social media is taken to a different extreme in the episode “ Hated in The Nation ,” which tells a gripping crime story of the death of a journalist at the center of a social media firestorm. Like many other notable episodes in previous seasons, such as “White Christmas,” the episode makes a significant point: our code of ethics and legal policies need to keep pace with rapidly growing technologies and the digital tools such as social media in our everyday lives. \nAs our tools to push human progress become more powerful, so do their capacities for harm. \nThe season also raises the issue of digital privacy in “ Shut Up and Dance ,” starring Jerome Flynn and Alex Lawther, which tells the story of a teenage boy being blackmailed by online hackers. The main character is left to choose between carrying out traumatic instructions delivered by text and having his intimate secrets exposed. \nWe are left to wonder: how will our subconscious feelings and hidden desires remain secret in a world where everything is online and vulnerable to surveillance and hacking? \nThis is already an issue. \nHacking scandals involving platforms like Wikileaks and breaches by “hacktivist” groups like Anonymous already have the power to do great harm to corporations and individuals. Our devices have become extensions of who we are; they store our identities, our secrets, our memories… private information vulnerable to abuse. \nHow do we protect that information? To what extent do we have the right to privacy? Who has the right to hold us accountable for what we do in the digital realm? Virtual Worlds and Beyond \nBeyond social media and personal devices, season three offers a chilling depiction of the potential consequences of virtual and augmented reality. \nIn the second episode of the season, “Playtest,” a broke American traveler signs up to be an experiment test subject for a revolutionary new gaming system that integrates a virtual experience by directly interfacing with the brain. In “ Man Against Fire ,” soldiers are fitted with implants in their eyes to assist them in the battlefield through augmented reality. One soldier, however, begins to experience glitches that lead to a shocking revelation about use of the technology. \nBefore we discount the practicality of such technologies, consider that already in 2016, the VR industry received $1.3 billion in investment as big players like Oculus Rift released consumer versions of VR headsets and the secretive Magic Leap raised $793 million for its as-yet-unreleased augmented reality technology. \nWhile we are still at the humble beginnings of a form of technology with incredible potential, Black Mirror looks at the potential for abuse of a truly immersive and virtual world. \nThis has to be taken seriously. \nShould our morality and laws also apply in these digital worlds? Should what happens in the digital world be considered any less “real” than the physical world? These are discussions Black Mirror reminds us we need to have as we move forward with these emerging technologies. The Greatest Threat to Humanity \nThe popularity of the series and its ability to resonate with both techies and non-techies can be credited to the fact that its stories go beyond technology. \nEach episode encompasses themes such as love, violence, or war. They not only show the implications of technological growth on society but also on individuals. Above all, they look at human-level implications. They explore the manner in which technology will disrupt not just entire industries but also our psyches, our identities and our relationships. \nPerhaps the most notable episode of season three is “San Junipero,” which proves the producers can inspire rather than just scare their audience with the implications of technology. The plot is difficult to analyze without revealing spoilers—but it is a must-watch. \n“ San Junipero” is based in a seaside town in 1987, where two women “strike up a powerful bond that seems to defy the laws of space and time.” Their story makes a strong point: at the end of the day, love is one of the most significant contributors to human happiness. \nWhat matters to us is not simply the material possessions of technology, but its ability to enhance our lives and make us and our loved ones happy. “San Junipero” highlights what truly adds meaning to our lives, even when we are consumed by technology. \nAs the name suggests, the series is a “black mirror,” a reflection of society’s weaknesses, frailties and susceptibilities. But it doesn’t do enough to emphasize all the ways in which technology has improved our lives, allowing us to live longer, healthier and more prosperously than ever before. That said, while the dystopian nature of the episodes feeds into the pre-existing paranoia of the general public, it’s important to be aware of the dangers of technology. What better way to explore these dangers before they occur than through speculative fiction? \nA big takeaway from every tale told in the series is that the greatest threat to humanity does not come from technology, but from ourselves. \nUltimately, it all comes down to the decisions we make as a species and how we choose to apply our most powerful tools. Black Mirror is more than just a thrilling watch; it is a compelling work of art that can impact how we decide to move forward and which future we choose.",

      "text": "One of the most awaited Netflix releases in America was the revival of “Gilmore Girls” in the Netflix original series “Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.” A friend described the show to me as the equivalent of 2016, and she was not wrong at all. Things start out worrisome, get worse and worse, and when it’s finally over, you are questioning everything you ever knew and wondering how things can get any worse than this, only for them to get worse immediately after .\nThe revival, which checks in on all the characters who made the show popular the first go round, is set ten years later, and life is not going great. Lorelai’s inn has lost its chef (and her best friend), leading to a bunch of celebrity chefs coming in to work the kitchen briefly before Lorelai fires them. Rory is bouncing around from freelance gig to freelance gig. Such is the life of a Yale-educated journalist, apparently.\nAdded to the mix is a greater emphasis on the rich and often snooty Emily Gilmore, Lorelai’s mother and Rory’s grandmother. Emily is hard on Lorelai because of the latter’s life choices, but now she is struggling to cope with the death of her husband, Richard Gilmore (Mr. Gilmore was portrayed in the original series by the late Edward Herrmann, whose presence in the new series is dearly missed).\n“A Year In The Life” seems to be centered around the lack of moral judgment a millennial can exhibit. She feels no moral dilemma with frequently crashing at other people’s houses since she has no home of her own (Emily refers to it as Rory’s “vagabond existence”). She is sleeping with a man who is engaged to someone else (in the original series, she lost her virginity to Dean, who at the time was married to someone else). She got drunk and slept with someone dressed as a Wookiee (it is unconfirmed as of this writing whether or not the costume remained on while they had sex).\nOh, and while all this sex is going on, she has a boyfriend she is constantly forgetting about. To the point where it is a running joke (though a disturbing one at that). Paul, that poor boyfriend, eventually breaks up with Rory because they can never seem to sync up their schedules.\nAnd all of this emotional chaos leads us to the Four Words. The very Four Words the show was supposed to end with 10 years ago. No one knew what those words were, except for the show’s creator.\n“Mom?”\n“Yeah?”\n“I’m pregnant.”\nThat’s how the show ends. Those are the four words that everyone was dying to hear. We end the show exactly as it started: with a child out of wedlock.\nThat’s not an indictment of the concept of having a child out of wedlock, mind you. It happens all too often now. But Rory’s actions in the last episode, in retrospect, are all about her deciding to become her mother in that sense, which is sort of a sweet, if not weird, way to honor a mother. However, as with anyone in the current generation who goes through the same experiences Rory has, she does not appear to be weighing the full effect this will have on her lifestyle.\nShe deliberately chose not to tell the child’s father (the aforementioned Huntzberger, presumably), though she did sleep with him one final time following the best scene in the series (the return of the college organization, The Life and Death Brigade). She also visited her father, Christopher, to ask him how he felt about being left out of the child-rearing process. She knows exactly what she is doing and she can clearly tell how much it hurt her father that he didn’t to help raise her. But she is still dead set on doing it this way.\nThis is what makes Rory, the sweet and formerly innocent child who was one of the most clever in her class, such an awful person. Her judgment every step of the way has been incredibly bad. Her boyfriends – the whiny, emotional, overprotective first one, the punk second one, and the rich and carefree third one – were in no way good boyfriend material for her.\nMoreover, she herself was a terrible girlfriend. She made out with the second one while still dating the first, slept with the first after he was married to someone else, and briefly broke up with the third only for him to sleep with all of his sister’s friends. During this series, she regularly slept with him, despite the fact that he was engaged to someone else and she had a boyfriend of two years that she kept forgetting even existed.\nRory’s personal and social breakdown appears to be the central theme of the story, and even at the point of the plot where a character is supposed to turn around and everything be awesome again, it ends with her, at 32, announced to her mother that she was single, unwed, and pregnant.\nThe other major problem with the series is that the four episodes were too long. Each episode, which was named after and represented by a season of the year, was around 90 minutes long, and they were simply too long. Several of the scenes were filled with fanservice and provided little more than a plot point that could have been squeezed in elsewhere. The scene with Dean, the first boyfriend Rory ever had, was understandably awkward, but stretched for no other reason (seemingly) than to give him enough screen time to be worth having him back.\nThe best scene, as previously mentioned, is the return of the Life and Death Brigade, featuring the best characters from Rory’s college years, Finn and Colin (also Robert, but he is not as great as the other two). Rory’s tragic break-up with Logan at the end also means breaking up with these three, who genuinely like her despite their (admittedly hilarious) chauvanistic behavior toward all other women (at one point, Colin asks Robert why a waitress is sitting down, to which Robert replies that she is not a waitress, but his new fiancee, who’s name he does not know).\nThere are several great scenes that relive the nostalgia in effective ways. But the series as a whole is a reminder to the viewers that there isn’t always a picture-perfect ending, but it presents this great lesson in a ham-fisted and unsatisfying way.\nIf you liked the original series, go watch it to relive some old memories. It’s not something you can really watch without seeing the older series.\nThe post Review: “Gilmore Girls” Forces Us to Endure a Millennial’s Breakdown appeared first on RedState .",

      "text": "11/28/16 AT 2:11 PM Close \nDecember is fast approaching, which means Netflix will unfortunately be saying goodbye to a handful of titles. Each month, the popular streaming service removes a bunch of movies and TV shows from its lineup as it adds new series and flicks. \nOver the next few weeks, Netflix will be deleting over 40 titles including a few classic movies like “American Beauty” and “Top Gun.” Check out our list of the top 10 titles you should watch ASAP, before they’re gone for good. \n“50 First Dates” (2004) — Leaving Dec. 1 \nThis is definitely a romantic comedy you can’t miss. In this 2004 movie, Adam Sandler’s character Henry has to woo Lucy (Drew Barrymore) over and over and over again because she suffers from short-tern memory loss and keeps forgetting who he is. Henry, once a playboy, is in love with Lucy but has to figure out a way to get her to remember him. \n“American Beauty” (1999) — Leaving Dec. 1 \nIn this 1999 classic, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is going through a mid-life crisis so he quits his job, starts working at a fast-food restaurant, and fantasizes about having an affair with his teenage daughter’s friend. Although Lester seems pleased with his new life, things only get worse for him. \n“Top Gun” (1986) — Leaving Dec. 1 \nTom Cruise stars as an overly cocky fighter pilot trainee who quickly clashes with the other students in his class. Not only is Cruise’s character Maverick on a mission to become the best fighter pilot, he’s also trying to get his flight instructor Charlotte (Kelly McGillis) to fall for him. \n“The Best of Me” (2014) — Leaving Dec. 3 \n“The Best of Me” is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks and tells the story of Dawson (James Marsden) and Amanda (Michelle Monaghan ), high school sweethearts who reunite after 20 years apart when they both return to their hometown for a funeral. However, just because Amanda and Dawson are still very much in love with each other doesn’t mean they will get their happily ever after. \n“Holes” (2003) — Leaving Dec. 5 \nThis is one of Shia LaBeouf’s most well-known films. When his character Stanley is falsely accused of stealing sneakers, he must spend his time at detention camp digging holes for the warden. During his time at the camp, Stanley starts to suspect that the warden has ulterior motives for making them dig holes. \n“The DaVinci Code” (2006) — Leaving Dec. 14 \n“The DaVinci Code” is based on the 2003 mystery-detective novel by Dan Brown and tells the story of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a Harvard professor who is the prime suspect after police discover that someone was murdered at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The murder, along with clues found in some of Leonardo da Vinci’s painting, could expose a huge secret about Christianity. \n“Beyond the Hills” (2012) — Leaving Dec. 16 \nThis movie first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012 and won awards for Best Screenplay and Best Actress. It tells the story of two women who grew up together in an orphanage. One of the girls, Voichița (Cosmina Stratan ) went on to become a nun in an Orthodox church, while her friend Alina (Cristina Flutur) began working in Germany. Alina returns home to visit Voichița and tries to convince her to leave the church and move to Germany with her. \n“Dark Skies” (2013) — Leaving Dec. 22 \nIf you’re into horror films, then “Dark Skies” is a movie you may want to add to your list of Netflix movies to watch. In this 2013 film, Lucy (Keri Russell) and her husband Daniel (Josh Hamilton) have to protect their family after they are attacked by a terrifying and deadly threat. \n“Just Friends” (2005) — Leaving Dec. 26 \nJust about everyone has been in a situation like Chris (Ryan Reynolds) in the romantic comedy “Just Friends.” In the movie, Chris is in love with his BFF Jamie (Amy Smart), but she doesn’t want a romantic relationship with him. Chris is so hurt that he moves away, but returns years later to try and win her heart again. Related Stories Alexis Bledel Isn't Sure About More ‘Gilmore Girls’ Episodes \n“Spy Kids” (2001) — Leaving Dec. 27 \nIn this family-friendly movie, two kids — Carmen (Alexa PenaVega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) — become spies to try and save their parents from a dangerous mastermind. \nTo see the full list of movies leaving Netflix in December, click here .

      "text": "After years of anticipation, Netflix has produced and released six new hours of Gilmore Girls . These new episodes should be enjoyable to watch, if only because they let us all revisit beloved characters and familiar settings.\n\nBut they’re also six terrible hours of television. They tear up and throw out just about everything good about the show that the fandom relished, in service of a thoughtless artistic vision ripped from crappy early-aughts movie musicals. It’s hard to even believe how bad they are.\n\nThe original Gilmore Girls is a Bush Two-era classic, an occasionally sappy drama about a mother- daughter friendship anchored by its characters’ rapid-fire dialogue and encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture.

      "text": "The Trailer for Netflix's 'White Rabbit Project' is Here Get ready for more science. Netflix November 28, 2016 MythBusters is being reincarnated as White Rabbit Project. The show will star three members of the MythBusters team, has the same producers, and will use similar wacky experiments to answer our questions about the world. The only thing missing is a love-hate relationship between the show’s hosts. White Rabbit Project will also have a slightly different angle than its predecessor. MythBusters was all about taking a popular conception — will diving underwater protect you from gunfire, for example, or can daddy long-legs venom kill a human? — and using science to see if they hold water. This new show will apparently focus more on things that definitely happened. “The coolest tech. The weirdest weapons. The craziest escapes. Three science-loving sleuths put them under the microscope,” Netflix explained on Monday alongside a promotional video for the upcoming series that premieres on December 9. Familiar faces and MythBusters featured players Kari Byron, Tory Belleci, and Grant Imahara will rank “history’s greatest inventions, heists, and more,” Netflix teased on Monday. You can see exactly what the company means by putting things under the microscope in this new trailer: Although it had a long, 14-season run, MythBusters came to a close this year with a special episode devoted to explosions. That was meant to be the show’s legacy — blowing things up was a common feature of its experiments — but the TV-powers-that-be had something else in mind. The Science Channel announced in March that it would create a new series called Search for the Next MythBusters to turn the series into a reality competition in which contestants would attempt to debunk various myths. It’s basically the geeky version of Survivor with more millennials. 'White Rabbit Project' premieres on December 9. Then in September Netflix ordered a season of White Rabbit Project. (It couldn’t nab the show’s hosts, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, perhaps because they didn’t like each other very much.)",

One of them is Amazon Prime Video, which was initiated in 2006 as Unbox but changed into Amazon Video, a couple of years later. \nBoth Netflix and Amazon are leaders in On Deman Video providers, and it is, therefore, mandatory to compare them based on the services they provide, price, video quality, the quantity of content and some other parameters. 10 Point Comparison of Amazon Video & Netflix 1.

      "text": "By Kevin Fitzpatrick November 28, 2016 10:29 AM | ScreenCrush Netflix \nNot every new Netflix series can be a winner, but the presence of Drew Barrymore and Justified alum Timothy Olyphant at least has our attention for the new streaming “dark comedy” Santa Clarita Diet . See for yourself in the first photos, and find out when the new series premieres in early 2017. \nPer Netflix’s confirmation, Santa Clarita Diet will officially debut all episodes on Friday, February 3. In addition to the photos above and below (we’ll let you sort out for yourself who’s who), Netflix also dropped an updated synopsis: Netflix \nIn Santa Clarita Diet, Joel (Timothy Olyphant, Justified) and Sheila (Drew Barrymore, Blended) are husband and wife realtors leading vaguely discontented lives in the L.A. suburb of Santa Clarita with their teenaged daughter Abby (Liv Hewson), until Sheila goes through a dramatic change sending their lives down a road of death and destruction…but in a good way. \nSure! The series also stars Skylar Gisondo as Eric Bemis, with Victor Fresco ( Better Off Ted ) acting as showrunner, and Barrymore, Olyphant, Aaron Kaplan, Tracy Katsky, Chris Miller and Ember Truesdell serving as executive producers. \nFull trailer won’t be far behind, but what do we make of the first look?",

      "text": "'Gilmore Girls' star says a 'very pivotal' scene in his story was cut from the show \n\nNetflix's \"Gilmore Girls\" revival, \"A Year in the Life,\" was meant to give the cult TV show the ending it never quite got in its last season when its creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, was no longer on the show. But one actor says that his character's storyline was shortchanged.\nIn one major storyline, Michel (Yanic Truesdale) was considering leaving Lorelai's (Lauren Graham) Stars Hollow hotel, the Dragonfly Inn, for greener pastures in New York City. In a bid to keep him and realize her own dreams of expanding the business, Lorelai repeated a move she made in the original series when she needed money to send Rory (Alexis Bledel) to a private high school and asked her mother for another loan.\n\nProducers probably felt fans would assume that meant Michel would stay, but it was never addressed again on the Netflix series. But according to Truesdale, he and Graham did shoot a scene that wrapped up the story.\n\"There was this scene that got cut because the show was too long,\" Truesdale told Business Insider recently. \"That was a big moment for Michel and Lorelai where they go and they buy that other place to do the spa.\" \nIt should be noted that Truesdale hadn't seen the completed series when he spoke to us, so he was unsure about how the plot would play out. \n\"Now that that scene is not there, I don't know what you are left with with that storyline,\" Truesdale said. \"T hat's very unfortunate because that scene was very pivotal to all of that.\"\nBut fans may be able to see the scene in the future. Truesdale said producer Warner Bros. has plans to make it a bonus on the revival's potential DVD release. \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is currently streaming on Netflix. ",

      "text": " 35 PM EST Netflix Becomes #154 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Cooper Companies The most recent short interest data has been released for the 11/15/2016 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by \"days to cover.\" There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the \"days to cover\" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.",

      "text": "\nSee Full Gallery Here \nAs we stand on the precipice of December, chatter of New Year Resolutions is beginning to take hold, particularly for those coming off a weekend of Thanksgiving-themed indulgence. Netflix is no exception, as the online streaming giant has today vowed to begin its Santa Clarita Diet on February 3, 2017.\nWord comes by way of Entertainment Weekly, revealing that the original single-camera sitcom, one which stars Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant in lead roles, has now been earmarked for a February premiere. Showrunner Victor Fresco ( My Name Is Earl , Better Off Ted) is at the helm for all 13 episodes of Santa Clarita Diet , and will be tasked with introducing Netflix subscribers to Joel (Olyphant) and Sheila (Barrymore), a married couple of realtors “leading vaguely disconnected lives in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita.”\nIt’s not all sunshine and rainbows for Joel and Sheila, however; not only do they have to deal with teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson), but EW’s plot snippet teases how the show sends our leads “down a road of death and destruction…but in a good way” once Sheila goes through a “dramatic change.” Exactly what that change entails is a mystery, but expect more firm details – and perhaps Santa Clarita Diet ‘s first trailer – to surface online sooner rather than later. Aaron Kaplan, Tracy Katsky, Chris Miller and Ember Truesdell are among the supporting players on board for Fresco’s all-new sitcom.\nIt’s official: Netflix will begin its Santa Clarita Diet on February 3, 2017. The only question left now is, will you be tuning in?\n",

      "title": "The Fault in Stars Hollow",
      "text": "This post reveals plot points about both the Netflix revival of Gilmore Girls and the show’s original seasons . \nIn the Netflix revival of Gilmore Girls , Rory, it turns out, has a long-term boyfriend. One who is not named Dean or Jess or Logan, but instead Jeffrey. Or maybe Alan. Or Billy? Wait—Pete. Pete, right? Which would actually be pretty appropriate, in a meta kind of way ?\nWelcome to one of the earliest of many running jokes in the show’s revival, which is that Rory has a boyfriend named Paul—his name, for the record, is Paul—and that nobody, including Lorelai and Luke, can remember his name or, indeed, anything about him. Paul is perfectly nice, if a bit obsequious; he visits Rory in Stars Hollow, and brings not only flowers for her, but also thoughtful gifts for her family. And his kindness is repaid by forgetfulness: Rory forgets that she invited him. She and her mother head out for breakfast at Luke’s without him, simply forgetting he is there. When Paul meets them at the diner, good-natured as ever, they manage to leave him there.\nThat the new Gilmore Girls would make so many jokes at the expense of kind, forgettable Paul isn’t, on the whole, terribly surprising. While Stars Hollow may embody some of the best aspects of life in a small town—the intimacy, the democracy, the sense of an “us” to be fought for—it can also, at times, embody the worst: the insularity. The exclusivity. The sense of a “them” to be fought against. The mingling of all of those things, in the seven original seasons of Gilmore Girls , led to a show that is deeply concerned with questions of belonging—about who may be counted as “one of us” and who, by implication, may not. The show’s Netflix revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , has only amplified those anxieties: The Stars Hollow of 2016 is place that, though it congratulates itself on its cosmopolitanism, remains deeply provincial. Paul, the outsider, found that out the hard way.\nIt’s by now a cliché to say that Stars Hollow, much like the New York of Sex and the City , is one of the main characters of Gilmore Girls . But it’s a cliché because Stars Hollow-centrism is something the show itself insists on, again and again. The song that closes out Gilmore Girls ’s pilot episode is not the now-iconic one—“ where you lead, I will fo ow ”—but rather one that may be even more revealing about the show’s guiding philosophy: Yo La Tengo’s “ Welcome to My Little Corner of the World .” And the first scenes of the revival—as befits the circular logic that will drive the new episodes and culminate, finally, in the show’s vaunted “four final words”—find Lorelai and Rory Gilmore doing their traditional tour of the town, this time in winter, through the gazebo and past Luke’s, among twinkling lights and smiling people and freshly fallen snow. The camera swings in an almost dizzying arc as they walk, hinting that what was true in the first seven seasons will remain true in the new one: Stars Hollow is a place that is ruled by centripetal force.\nInto all this comes Paul. Poor, sweet, Rory-doesn’t-deserve-you Paul. The show has, in the end, about as much pity for Paul as it has respect for him, which is to say pretty much none. He is there merely for the sake of exposition—it’s in part through him that we first learn of Rory’s recently peripatetic existence—and to serve, again and again, as a kind of human punchline.\nAll of that puts Paul in league with the many other characters who have tried, and failed, to be truly welcomed into Stars Hollow’s little corner of the world. Remember how, when Lorelai and Christopher got married, “the town” resisted him, and the marriage, on the grounds of his outsider status? Remember how Lorelai tried to enlist Jackson and other residents with TownClout to encourage others to accept her new husband? Christopher was Rory’s father, and thus would seem to have a pretty good in with Stars Hollow’s residents; even that, though, wasn’t enough.\nPaul would learn the same lesson: He did nothing wrong except not belong. But that was enough to seal his fate.\nSo while the new Stars Hollow may have wifi and iPhones and a Kirk-led version of Uber—while its borders may be slightly more porous than they were before—the town, as before, remains definitionally insular. Still, its impulse is to conflate “newcomers” with “outsiders.” Take, in A Year in the Life , the collection of celebrity chefs—Roy Choi, Rachael Ray, Ina Garten in absentia—who are cooking at the Dragonfly and each of whom Lorelai unceremoniously dismisses from their roles. Their fireable offense? Their failure to be Sookie. \nRelated Story Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life Is a Rare TV Revival That Works \nTake, too, the many patrons of Luke’s whom Luke lies to about his diner’s wifi passwords; had those customers belonged in Stars Hollow, after all, they’d know that Luke’s is not the kind of place you go to check Facebook. They should have known. Had they been insiders, they would have.\nAnd then there’s Odette, Logan’s fiancée, about whom viewers know extremely little except that her soon-to-be husband has been cheating on her, for a long time, with his ex—a pretty sad situation for you to be in even if you happen to be a French heiress. But the show pays Odette, as a character and as a human, very little regard. It treats her, in the end, in much the same way that it treated Lindsay, Dean’s girlfriend-turned-wife, during Gilmore Girls ’s primary seasons: as a complication in the main story, which is Rory’s relationship with Dean. As, thus, a catalyst for Rory’s confusion. Lindsay and Odette—and also Jamie, Paris’s Paul-foreshadowing college boyfriend; and also Max, Lorelai’s season 1 fiancé—have existed, in Gilmore Girls ’s universe, almost entirely to help the eponymous women to reach important realizations about their own lives.\nWhich is, as a matter of sitcomic cosmology, a common approach: Gilmore Girls is just one of many series to take for granted that the only characters worthy of empathy are the ones who are primary in a show’s own, arbitrary universe. Ross, in Friends , treated Emily—the woman who had the misfortune of meeting Ross after he broke up with Rachel—horribly, and the horribleness only began when he said another woman’s name at the altar . The show never acknowledged that, though: Friends assumed instead that only the six primary pals deserved consideration and generosity, and made its narrative decisions accordingly. The “happiness” of the ending of How I Met Your Mother was similarly premised on the notion that the mother in question had been, all along, an interloper . Many shows—most shows—operate according to an “insider”/“outsider” logic; that is, for the most part, how storytelling works. It’s just that some shows extend that logic to a kind of cheerful xenophobia.\nGilmore Girls , to its credit, seems mostly aware of those pitfalls; it seems to understand, better than many of its fellow series, that Stars Hollow presents an implicit panoramic challenge: How do you create a town that is insular in the best ways without being, also, insular in the worst? How do you make a place that is more in the spirit of Capeside, Massachusetts or Cicely, Alaska or Pawnee, Indiana or Springfield, [redacted] , than in that of, say, Gopher Prairie, Minnesota ? How do you create a place that manages to be small of size but not also small of mind?\nThe show has successfully solved the riddle it set out for itself mostly through a kind of cultural doubling: Life in Stars Hollow has been heavily mediated, in Gilmore Girls , through music and books and movies and magazines and other products of a broader American culture. The show has met its geographical smallness with cultural bigness, and in that has found, for the most part, a happy balance. “I live in two worlds,” Rory said, as she delivered her Chilton graduation speech. “One is a world of books. I’ve been a resident of Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County, hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina and strolled down Swann’s Way.” The second world, though, is Stars Hollow and its residents and the immediate family the town represents: It is geography and it is humanity, combined into one.\nThe show’s revival, too, offers a dance between the worlds of fiction and non-, between very of-the-moment references to Lena Dunham and David Carr and trigger warnings and the timelessly soft swirls of a life-sized snow globe. A Year in the Life tries, so hard, to be both expansive and selective in its empathies. Often, though, the revival falls directly into a trap of its own making. So aware of the bigness beyond Stars Hollow’s borders, the new episodes stretch until they lose their balance. They succumb to their own dizzy circularity. The revival finds characters, in a town meeting, acknowledging that “there just aren’t enough gays in Stars Hollow”—and then debating, extensively, how to get more. It finds Taylor organizing an international food festival, in which, of the 195 countries meant to be represented, only 15 show up. It finds Stars Hollow trying to be cosmopolitan; it finds it, too, falling back into provincialism. Again and again, this storybook town tries to be more capacious than it is; again and again, it fails. Paul, who is briefly in Stars Hollow but won’t ever be of it, never stood a chance.\n",

While their role was less substantial than the main hosts in Mythbusters, it looks like they have what it takes to take the lead in their new Netflix exclusive series! White Rabbit Project looks to be Mythbusters 2.0 with crazier experiments, better camera quality, and possibly a bigger budget? The trailer does a really good job at making you think this is more of the same, while also looking better than the original series! Watch it below and binge the whole series on Netflix December 9th!",

      "text": "TiVo, Netflix Do a Deal They enter product, intellectual property agreements 11/28/2016 4:10 PM Eastern Follow @thebauminator Image source: Wikimedia Commons \nNetflix and TiVo, which merged with Rovi in September, said they’ve inked a string of deals tied to licensing, intellectual property and products. \n\nRELATED: TiVo CEO: Rovi Deal Not a Patent Play \n\nAmong them is a product partnership in which TiVo will continue to integrate Netflix into its set-tops boxes distributed at retail and through a growing group of MVPDs. \n\nA separate intellectual property agreement provides Netflix a license to the TiVo patent portfolios and a license to the Intellectual Ventures patent portfolio for over-the-top services. They said the agreement represents one of the first licenses granted under an exclusive partnership that Rovi and Intellectual Ventures announced earlier this year. \n\nPrior to merging with TiVo, Rovi and Netflix had been battling in the courts over patent claims. Last year, a California court moved to invalidate five Rovi patents and entered a judgement in favor of Netflix in the case. At the time, Rovi said it intended to appeal. \n\n“The partnership between Netflix and TiVo dates back to our early days of streaming video,” Bill Holmes, Netflix global head of business development, said in a statement. “Building on this history, the agreements provide consumers freedom to watch their favorite TV shows and movies whenever and wherever, with an integrated experience across more devices.” \n\n“Our agreements with Netflix represent a major milestone for TiVo as we expand our offerings for the fast-growing OTT space, and further demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovative technologies to new and emerging markets,” added TiVo CEO Tom Carson. “From products to patented technologies, TiVo is helping companies quickly adapt to a rapidly changing media industry and create beautiful user experiences that keep consumers connected to their favorite entertainment.” Want to read more stories like this?",

      "text": "This post reveals plot points about both the Netflix revival of Gilmore Girls and the show’s original seasons . \nIn the Netflix revival of Gilmore Girls , Rory, it turns out, has a long-term boyfriend. One who is not named Dean or Jess or Logan, but instead Jeffrey. Or maybe Alan. Or Billy? Wait—Pete. Pete, right? Which would actually be pretty appropriate, in a meta kind of way ?\nWelcome to one of the earliest of many running jokes in the show’s revival, which is that Rory has a boyfriend named Paul—his name, for the record, is Paul—and that nobody, including Lorelai and Luke, can remember his name or, indeed, anything about him. Paul is perfectly nice, if a bit obsequious; he visits Rory in Stars Hollow, and brings not only flowers for her, but also thoughtful gifts for her family. And his kindness is repaid by forgetfulness: Rory forgets that she invited him. She and her mother head out for breakfast at Luke’s without him, simply forgetting he is there. When Paul meets them at the diner, good-natured as ever, they manage to leave him there.",

      "text": "Spoiler alert: Do not read if you haven't watched \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" on Netflix.\nDear Rory,\nWhat happened? You were going to be the next Christiane Amanpour and spar with Norman Mailer and have Madeleine Albright as your mentor. Hopes were high for you, Rory, especially after you graduated from Yale and set off on the Obama campaign trail to be a political reporter.\nNine years later, we find you couch-surfing and freelancing, and girl, there's no shame in that. (Well, at 32 years old, maybe there's a little shame. But you're trying at least!)\nYour relationships with Paul and Logan, though? Unforgiveable! Didn't you learn anything from breaking up Dean and Lindsay's marriage? Such as: Don't keep sleeping with someone you know you can't have. You deserve better than a rich, two-timing daddy's boy who lives on the other side of the ocean and will never put a ring on it -- not on your finger, anyway. Not to mention those Life-and-Death-Brigade bros of Logan's, the one-percenters who think nothing of drunk-buying a nightclub or a bed and breakfast. While they are obnoxious over-30 Lost Boys, you are not Wendy.\nAnd Paul, as utterly forgettable as he is, never merited being strung along by you for two-plus years. Lorelai raised you better than this! You never treated anyone this carelessly. Emily, yes, but not you.\nSpeaking of your grandmother, the politically incorrect treatment of her staff isn't funny. Such behavior may have been more easily dismissed a decade ago, but not any more. She seems to genuinely care for Berta and her extended family but continually treats them (and their language and cuisine) as beings from another planet.\nEmily's astounding insensitivity is one of the reasons Lorelai left your grandparents' home at 16 when she was pregnant with you. She raised you by herself while she worked full time, went to college part time and, with her best friend, eventually opened her own successful inn. Your mom was the model of independence and female empowerment. Except for that time when she asked your grandparents to help pay for your education. Even then, she did it on her own terms. Oh, and that time she married your father. (We can write that one off, though, to the subpar Season 7, when your creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, was no longer with the show.) The point is, she forged her own path and didn't take any guff. So what happened to you, Rory?\nListen, kid, not everybody can write for The New York Times or Vanity Fair. That doesn't mean you give up your dream. Newspaper and magazine staffs are shrinking, and college grads and journalism veterans are competing for fewer and fewer jobs. Finish that piece for Jim at Conde Nast, and stick with The Stars Hollow Gazette while writing your book. Launch an online edition with your trust fund and build a local empire that can crush that ol' media mogul Mitchum Huntzberger. You cannot let him win, Rory! Christ, you went to Yale. Are you seriously telling me that none of your college contacts could help you out, i.e., Dr. Paris Geller, M.D., J.D.? Surely someone other than Mitchum can put in a good word for you! Maybe Jess needs an editor at Truncheon Books, or Taylor would pay you to write a book about the screwed-up history of Stars Hollow. At the very least, Doyle might be able to get you a writing gig in Hollywood.\nDon't just have Logan's love child (or is it the Wookie's?) and raise the baby by yourself. We've already seen that series. We loved it and we're ready to move on. Aren't you?\n(c)2016 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

The show is described as: “The coolest tech. The weirdest weapons. The craziest escapes. Three science-loving sleuths put them under the microscope. [The team ranks] history’s greatest inventions, heists and more.”\nIt also looks like a heck of a lot of nerdy fun, so Netflix viewers have something to look forward to when the series starts streaming on December 9.\n(via Polygon , image via screengrab)\nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "Signal Snowboards is trying to become the Netflix of the snowboard industry \nNovember 28, 2016 By Robert Pursell \nA week ago, Signal Snowboards officially introduced the world’s first-ever snowboard subscription service announcing the service through a video heralding the service as a breakthrough for the industry: \nThe video — and the concept of a snowboard company creating a community beyond the point of sale — piqued our interest here at GrindTV for a number of reasons, so we called up Signal’s founder, pro snowboarder Dave Lee, to get some more details about the service. \nHere’s what he had to say: Lee hard at work in his Huntington Beach, California factory. Photo: Courtesy of Signal Snowboards \nSo how did the idea to start a snowboard subscription service come about? \nHonestly, we kind of stumbled upon it. \nThe subscription thing has always fascinated me — it allows for a direct connection to people and makes buying a snowboard sort of a more experiential endeavor. You know, with typical retail, your stuff is on a shelf and the people in the store will kind of tell you what you need. \nWith this, you tell us what you need and we help tailor your buying experience to your personal preference. Lee says he is excited to be able to help more riders access more types of snowboards. Photo: Courtesy of Signal Snowboards \nWhat exactly is the goal behind the service? \nThe core mission behind the service is opening up accessibility and just kind of bringing people into snowboarding and introducing them to snowboarding culture. \nYou know, one of the reasons I think we’ve seen a stagnation in the growth of snowboarding is that , unlike its early days, people have gotten into snowboarding now with little to no connection to the core culture of the sport. \nSo we’re really looking to help people if they want to learn more about snowboarding and the culture aspect of the sport. Lee envisions building the Signal Subscription Service into a community.

But there’s so many different shapes of snowboards, maybe you bought a park board but after a little while want to try out a board made for riding powder. \nWell with our service, you choose a board and pay for it over 12 months. Then after a year you’ve got this board that’s all yours and move onto another style of board next. \nAlso, with our subscription you get Signal Care — our insurance package — that will fix or replace your board if it’s damaged, and access to the M.O.D. (Members Only Demo) Program, where you can demo other boards in our line for free for two weeks a year. \nAnd every month we send out care packages to our subscribers. Sometimes it’s a little gift, sometimes it’s a how-to video, but it’s all designed to get you more stoked on snowboarding.

One of the coolest services offered through the Signal Subscription Service that we’re in the process of building out is our concierge service. \nWith the concierge service we want to make sure you get the most out of riding every time you head to the mountains. So, if you were going to, say, Park City , Utah, we can tell you the best hotels in the area that we like to stay at, and the best mountains in the area for your style of riding as well as similar mountains nearby. \nAlso, we’ll be holding rider appreciation days where we get a bunch of our pros and members together and go ride at certain resorts and tell them a bit about the history of the mountain’s we’re riding on. \nRELATED: John Jackson talks progression, new Red Bull series \nAnd since we know where all of our members live, if we know you live near Lake Tahoe in California, and we’re putting together a rider appreciation day with John Jackson up there, we can call you up and invite you along. A photo posted by Dave Lee (@davemlee) on Sep 10, 2016 at 11:49am PDT \nWhat’s the feedback been like to the service? \nIt’s been extremely positive so far. \nWe have about 600 members right now, and the overwhelming feedback is that it has really opened up the accessibility of the sport for people. For instance, someone might not have $600 to dedicate to a new board right now but can easily pay $50 a month for the next year. \nSimilarly, we run a yearly heli boarding trip to the Baldface Lodge in British Columbia. Instead of having to pay $3,100 for the trip all at once, someone can sign up for the trip and spread those payments out over a year and experience their first heli trip. A photo posted by Dave Lee (@davemlee) on Nov 21, 2016 at 8:25am PST \nHow do you see the service evolving going forward? \nI think this will revolutionize the industry and become the best way to buy a snowboard ever. \nI see it like a Netflix-type deal. I think one-time snowboard purchases are a thing of the past. Snowboards are expensive and change all the time and you should always be happy with the one you’re on. \nSo, to that end, we are working on having a buy back program, and looking into developing a program akin to Netflix now where, in the future, you could ride a different type of board every month. It’s all about making it affordable and making it easy. And I think that will shape the future. \nMore from GrindTV",

      "text": "  6:04 pm \nNetflix is switching things up for December 2016. You’d think we’d get a bunch of new holiday movies in time for the Christmas season, but instead, we’re getting a wealth of brand new Netflix originals to binge. \nLeaving on December 1 are Oscar winners Sling Blade and American Beauty , box office hits such as The Da Vinci Code and 50 First Dates , and old favorites such as Top Gun and Event Horizon . However, in their place are some interesting original series, such as the upcoming drama focusing on the youth of President Obama. \nBarry , which delves into the past of the 44th president, while Fuller House Season 2 looks to recapture that nostalgic feeling that made the first season one of Netflix’s biggest successes. In addition, we’ll be getting 2016 box office releases such as The Angry Birds Movie and Captain America: Civil War ! \nBut what else can we expect from Netflix in December 2016?

      "text": "Netflix's chief content officer Ted Sarandos said last week that he believes Amazon Prime spent a gigantic $250 million on The Grand Tour (while also admitting that Netflix did try and sign the trio of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May). Well now Clarkson himself has hit back at that figure, claiming the astronomical number is total rubbish. \"Amazon spent far less than Netflix would have you believe,\" the host told CNN. \"It's nowhere near as expensive as people have been saying.\" The original figure that has been spread around is that the show cost a more modest, but still ridiculously expensive, $160 million. Clarkson said that \"of course\" he knew the real figure, but he sure as hell won't be the one to tell you. \"It's just not a British thing,\" he continued. \"I mean, look at me. Do I look like I'm making $300 million a year?\" Well, technically the show costs less than $250 million, and that cost goes towards the production, paying the crew, possibly marketing, and let's not forget that Hammond and May probably earn a tidy cut of whatever it was Amazon spent as well. And even if Jeremy was earning $300 million a year, we're sure he would definitely dress the same way anyway. If you haven't caught The Grand Tour yet then you can check out our reviews of episode one and episode two. The Grand Tour streams exclusively on Amazon Prime.

Most Popular By Lori Keong Nov 28, 2016 Blessings for these dropping temperatures that are making it totally acceptable to lounge around indoors with a queue full of movies on the agenda, and nothing else. New selections this month include the new Netflix biopic about young Obama attending Columbia in the early '80s, Barry (whose leading actor Devon Terrell really nails the resemblance, no?). Classics like National Lampoon's Animal House— one of our top movie picks— also join the movie library next month, though if you're more of a TV fiend, there's always Season 1 of Homeland to binge-watch ( and cry with ) on your days off or the second season of Netflix's Fuller House (why not make it a family affair?).

      "text": "5v 2A power supply for Pi \nMonitor, HDMI cable, keyboard and mouse (only for initial setup) \nI also recommend a heat sink for Pi chips as multimedia consumption does make them hot \nEthernet cable (optional) \nI will be using it in a headless manner, but we do need a monitor with an HDMI cable for initial setup. On your PC/laptop, download the ‘NOOBS’ distribution installer from the official site . It’s a zip file, which you’ll extract using the unzip command. \nInsert the Micro SD card and format it as FAT32 using Gnome Disk Utility. \nThen, change directory to the Micro SD card: cd /path_of_USB \nAnd unzip the NOOBS file into the Micro SD card: unzip PATH_OF_NOOBS \nIn my case it was: unzip /home/swapnil/Downloads/NOOBS_v1_9_2.zip \nJust ensure that all the content of the NOOBS folder is in the root directory of the Micro SD card. \nNow plug the monitor, keyboard and mouse into the Pi, insert the Micro SD card and connect the power supply. The system will boot up to NOOBS where you can choose the operating system you want to install. Choose Raspbian. Once the installation is finished, it will reboot into your brand new Raspbian OS. It will also automatically resize the file system to use all available space on the SD card. \nIf you can use an Ethernet cable, I would recommend that because it will give you faster speed compared to the WiFi on board. If not, then use the WiFi utility in Raspbian to connect to the wireless network. Once you are online, open the terminal and run the following command to find the IP address of your Pi: if config \nOnce you have the IP address, open the terminal on your PC/laptop and ssh into your Pi: ssh pi@IP_ADDRESS_OF_PI \nThe default password for the Pi is raspberry . If you want to change the password, run the following command and enter the new password after the prompt: passwd pi \nNow let’s update the system before we install Plex. This is a best practice for all fresh distro and software installations sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade \nOnce updated, connect the external hard drive to your Pi using one of the USB ports. It’s best to use a hard drive that has been formatted in the ext4 file system for better compatibility with Linux. Mount it and create an entry in the ‘fstab’ so that it auto mounts between reboots. \nNow it’s time to install Plex Media Server. We are using packages created by a third-party developer so let’s add their GPG key: wget -O - https://dev2day.de/pms/dev2day-pms.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add - \nNow add repos to the source list file: echo \"deb https://dev2day.de/pms/ jessie main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pms.list \nNow update the system: \nAnd then install Plex Media Server: sudo apt-get install -t jessie plexmediaserver -y \nNow run it: \nThat’s it. You have Plex Media Server running on your Raspberry Pi 3. Set up your media server \nPlex Makes it extremely easy to set up your Plex Media Center. Now you need to point your Plex Media Center towards the media files: movies, music, and TV shows. You can do it from any PC in your local network. Just type this address into a web browser, filling in your own Pi’s IP address: IP_ADDRESS_OF_PI:32400/web/index.html# \nIn my case it was: 10.0.0.26:32400/web/index.html# \nThis will open the Plex Media Server interface. The greatest feature of Plex is metadata that it pulls from the internet and attaches to your media files. But it’s extremely important to categorize your media otherwise Plex won’t detect it. So create these folders on your hard drive and store appropriate media inside the folders: movies, tv_shows, music, home_videos, photos . \nNow copy movies to the movies folder, TV shows to the tv_shows folder, any videos that you take from your phone or camera to home_video folder, and so on. If you copy TV shows or home videos to movies or vice versa, those files won’t show up on Plex and you won’t be able to play them. \nOnce you have taken care of your media files, open the movie tab on the Plex Media Center interface and browse to add the movies folder from your hard drive. Repeat the step for each media type. Once done, give Plex some time to scan and process those files. \nAnother interesting thing that you can do with your Plex is add online video channels such as CNN, PBS, and History.… Just go to the ‘Channels’ option and install channels that you like. Now all of these channels, in addition to your movies, tv shows, music and photos are accessible through your Plex server running on the Pi. Access your Plex Media Server \nThere are many ways to access your Plex Media Center: \n1. If you are on the local network open this URL in the web browser: IP_ADDRESS_OF_PI:32400/web/index.html# \nIn my case it was: 10.0.0.26:32400/web/index.html# \nIt will open the Plex Media Player interface, just log into your media server and start playing content. You can also manage your Plex Media Server from this interface. \n2. You can access your Plex Media Server from mobile devices using the official Plex app that’s available for both Android and iOS. \n3. Or you can set up a Plex Media Player device (such as RasPlex) and turn any HDMI-enabled TV into your very own entertainment system. (See the next tutorial on how to do this!) \nIf you want to be able to access Plex outside of your home network then you can purchase PlexPass which allows you to stream your content across devices over the Internet. Because Plex also remembers playback history and where you are in any content, you can also add family members, just like Netflix, so that you can maintain your own viewing history. \nAll of this for just under $100, and you got to build it yourself. Isn’t it fun? \nRead the previous articles in the series:",

      "text": "by Stephanie Topacio Long We don't have to wait for \"Fuller House\" Season 2 to hit Netflix to learn all of its secrets -- Jodie Sweetin recently spilled some key information. How not rude. The actress will be back as Stephanie Tanner (aka the other D.J. Tanner) in the second season of the \"Full House\" sequel series, and it sounds like there's a lot in store for the free-spirited sister. In fact, Sweetin promised \"some really crazy storylines\" during an interview with Parade. First, Stephanie will be getting a little more love in her life. This won't come as a shock if you've seen the Season 2 trailer -- it showed her cozying up with a surprising, yet hilariously fitting new man. \"She gets a love interest,\" Sweetin told Parade. \"I think the fans are really going to love who it winds up being.\" Based on the trailer, her bet seems like a safe one. The guy in question is -- wait for it -- a Gibbler. Yes, as in related to Kimmy ( Andrea Barber ), the longtime target of Stephanie's snarky comments and now housemate. And he's no distant cousin, either. Stephanie's love interest, Jimmy ( Adam Hagenbuch ), is Kimmy's similarly quirky brother. On top of the developments in her love life in the upcoming season, Stephanie will have her music career to keep her busy, too. Sweetin teased that her character will do \"a lot of fun stuff with that.\" She revealed that she has been exercising her creativity, and she even worked on a song with Juan Pablo Di Pace , who plays Fernando. Clearly, there's a lot to look forward to when the \"Fuller House\" shenanigans continue. Season 2 hits Netflix on Dec. 9.",

      "text": "By Laura Hurley 17 minutes ago \nMythbusters was a huge hit of a series for Discovery, and it almost certainly wouldn't have lasted for as long as it did if not for The Build Team of Tory Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara running their own sets of wild experiments alongside hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman. The Build Team was unfortunately booted from Mythbusters in 2014, but the trio has stuck together and will star in their very own Netflix series, called White Rabbit Project . The trailer for White Rabbit Project has hit the web, and it looks pretty awesome. Check it out! \nLet's be 100% honest: White Rabbit Project looks like a Build Team spinoff of Mythbusters , so anybody hoping that the new show would take Tory Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara in a brand new direction might be a little disappointed. For those of us who have spent the past couple of years missing their shenanigans during episodes of Mythbusters , however, the White Rabbit Project trailer couldn't be more exciting. \nWhite Rabbit Project will feature the Build Team trio playing with cutting edge technology, offbeat weapons, and crazy toys as they use science to try and prove the impossible. Tory, Kari, and Grant will also rank some of the greatest inventions and heists from throughout history, and it looks like they'll get pretty creative in doing it. If the trailer is anything to go by, these brainiacs haven't lost their chemistry or humor as a group. \nAlthough they frequently worked with hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, Tory Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara were always a distinct unit on Mythbusters . The new show just might not have felt right if all three members hadn't signed on as stars. Each of the three brought a unique personality and set of skills to their dynamic on Mythbusters. I know I'm glad that they'll be back as a team for White Rabbit Project , especially now that the Mythbusters mothership has come to an end on Discovery. \nLuckily, we won't have to wait much longer before we get a first look at The Build Team in action on their own show. The entire first season of White Rabbit Project will be available on Netflix starting Friday, December 9.

      "text": "By Kevin Fitzpatrick November 28, 2016 4:33 PM | ScreenCrush \nMythBusters may be carrying on under the banner of a new host , but at least some of the original team is getting back to work at what they do best. The M7 Build Team’s Netflix White Rabbit Project has an official trailer ahead of its December 9 premiere. \nThe former MythBusters team of Kari Byron, Tory Belleci, and Grant Imahara have released a first look at the new White Rabbit Project , which will see the trio “go down the rabbit hole on the internet” to test various concepts. So reads the offiical synopsis: \nIn the Netflix series, the three head down the rabbit hole to investigate weird and wonderful events from pop culture, science and history. Under their microscope are topics as diverse as jailbreaks, superpower technology, heists and crazy world war two weapons. In each episode the hosts immerse themselves in experiments, builds and tests as they sleuth the truth behind these and other well googled themes. \nIt was back in 2014 that MythBusters tacked on an announcement that Bryon, Bellecy and Imahara were no longer with the series , ahead of what turned out to be the show’s final year. The Science Channel will continue the franchise as MythBusters: The Search , a new reality competition to name the replacement hosts. \nStay tuned for the latest on The White Rabbit Project as it arrives, and watch the trailer again above.",

      "text": "Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Warning: This recap for the “Summer” episode of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life contains storyline and character spoilers.\nLorelai and Rory both have epiphanies about their future, but one of their plans causes a major mother/daughter rift during the summer of this very angsty Gilmore year.\nLorelai A lot of Lorelai and Rory time — some might say too much Lorelai and Rory time — is spent at the Stars Hollow Municipal Pool. It’s fun to see a new town locale, of course, but (also of course) the Gilmores aren’t there to swim. Their multiple appearances at the pool are more like one of their bits, as they lounge by the pool, reading, people watching, being jointly disgusted about all the kid pee swirling in the public waters, and mocking their fellow citizenry (woe be to the man who isn’t in tip-top shape, yet dares to traipse in front of the Gilmores in his swim trunks). For one day at the pool, they even hire — though we don’t see them actually get paid — local youngsters Dewey and Brandon to hold umbrellas over their heads to shade the sun, and fetch them cold drinks from coolers sitting right beside them. Rory’s man, er, boy, is even trained to refer to her as “Khaleesi.”\nLauren Graham and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Not so fun for Lorelai: As she feared, Michel is leaving The Dragonfly Inn. He wants to make more money and have more interesting and fulfilling work. He asks her if she’ll add a spa to the Dragonfly, which would make him consider staying, but when she says no, he tells her he’ll give her three months to find a replacement before he moves to New York to work for the W Hotel.\nRelated: Ken Tucker Reviews ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life — Summer’\nMichel’s impending departure, a big fight with Luke, a less big fight with Emily, and a huge fight with Rory are all rolling around in Lorelai’s head when she hears a sad song from a Taylor-penned music about Stars Hollow (read on). “I am not unbreakable… I am breaking right now” are probably the exact lyrics that lead her to go home and announce to Luke that she’s going to be leaving for a while to go “do Wild .” She means the Cheryl Strayed book, which she was reading earlier at the pool, about the woman who went on a life-changing 1,100-mile solo hike along the Pacific Crest Trail when she was facing personal loss and feeling lost.\nLuke is… surprised, as are we viewers who’ve only known Lorelai as someone who does not love the great outdoors. “There’s dirt, bugs, animals, mosquitos, rivers. You have to carry your own backpack by yourself,” Luke points out.\n“You have to sleep on the ground. You cook your own food. You boil your own water. You get your water from a stream… that’s in nature.”\nBut Lorelai insists. She needs to go find some direction for her future. “Because it’s never or now, she tells Luke.\nLauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More Related: ‘Gilmore Girls’: A Journey Through Lorelai’s Love Life\nRory Rory’s personal life continues its downward spiral. She still hasn’t broken up with Paul, that running joke that gets less funny, more cruel each time it’s told. Especially since she finds herself in this position: She’s scheduled to return to London to visit Logan in a few weeks, but calls him to say she’s thinking of flying over earlier, as in the next day. That’s when she finds out she’d have to stay at a hotel if she does, because his fiancée Odette, the French heiress, has officially moved into his apartment.\nAlexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Read More Career-wise, she’s taken a new job: She’s the unpaid editor of The Stars Hollow Gazette . When longtime editor Bernie Roundbottom — go ahead, get the giggles out — retires, Taylor plans to close the paper down, but Rory can’t stand to see that happen since it’s the publication that first sparked her love of journalism. But she quickly finds out she inherits a staff consisting of two very senior employees, a readership that cares about little more than seeing a poem on the front cover every week, and a distribution model that consists of her and Lorelai running (literally) around town to deliver stacks of the paper to local merchants.\nMilo Ventimiglia (Credit: Netflix) More A visit from Jess — that Jess — reveals that she’s gotten into the habit of drinking her lunch from a scotch bottle stashed in her desk, but things start looking up, temporarily, when Jess tells her she just needs to write something she knows to get her creative mojo back. Specifically, he thinks she should write a book about her relationship with her mom, and it really does seem like the best thing anyone has suggested to Rory in the whole miniseries thus far. Rory throws herself into the project, planning out chapters and making the decision to move back to New York — to an apartment with a writing room in Queens, more specifically — to focus on her work. She’s suddenly so inspired that she can’t wait to tell Lorelai about the book… and that’s where things really go downhill. Lorelai’s into Rory writing a book about Rory, but she doesn’t want to be included. Her story is her story, she says, and she’s worked hard to maintain control of who knows what about her. She’s particularly upset that Emily will read about how she once left Rory in a bucket in a hardware store. No matter how much Rory tries to explain how the book will be a good thing, Lorelai insists it not be about her, and even when Rory tells her how much the project means to her and how much she needs to pursue it, Lorelai is strangely unmoved, almost to an Emily level of irrational reaction. Rory even tells Lane later, “She looked at me the way she looks at Grandma, that hurt.”\nRelated: ‘Gilmore Girls’ Pro/Con List: Should Rory Be With Jess or Logan?\nAnd the day gets worse. In a phone call with Logan, Rory decides to break up with him. “Except we can’t break up, because we’re nothing,” she says.\nMatt Czuchry (Credit: Netflix) More Luke When Luke isn’t busy playing lifeguard at the municipal pool (seriously, “Summer” writer Dan Palladino really rode those pool storylines until the wheels fell off) and being the subject of Baywatch quips from the Gilmores, he’s playing daddy. Yep, April, the daughter all GG fans like to blame for that nasty blip in the Luke and Lorelai romance, pops in for a visit. She’s 22, an MIT student, about to go to grad school, has a nose ring that Luke hates, and she smokes pot. Or, that’s what she wants everyone to believe. When alone with pseudo stepsister Rory, she admits she has a lot of panic attacks and smoked pot just once and then ate a lot of cheese, and she begs Rory to take out her nose ring. Rory shares her tap dancing for stress relief videos with April, while Lorelai offers to help Luke pay for April’s tuition or summer trip to Germany. He refuses, saying April is his kid, and we’re reminded of how it’s not just Lorelai who makes certain parts of their lives so separate from each other.\nVanessa Marano and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Oh, back to the pool: Luke is the sponsor of the vandalized floaty hut at the pool. The man who once proudly sponsored a girl’s softball team is now the financial backer of the shed that houses the communal blow-up toys the children of Stars Hollow play with in the pee-addled waters of the municipal pool, and he’s so distressed about the hut being vandalized that he takes it upon himself and his tool box to fix the hut. Like we said, that pool set got a lot of focus in the episode. It must have set Netflix back some bucks.\nLauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Todd Lowe, Keiko Agena\n(Credit: Netflix) More Emily Emily is awakened one Saturday at noon by a call from Rory. To repeat: Emily Gilmore… sleeping. Until. Noon. Yeah, she’s not dealing with her Richard-less life very well, and Rory is worried about her. She visits her at the Gilmore mansion, and when she sees Emily has a huge TV in the living room and is eating meals on a TV tray (to repeat: Emily Gilmore… TV tray), Rory suggests her grandma go to the country club and get involved with people and activities there. She took that advice, and when Lorelai arrives a week later to accompany Emily to the cemetery to unveil the headstone for Richard’s grave, Lorelai is introduced to Jack Smith, who may or may not be Emily’s new… companion? It’s actually a re-introduction, as Jack was at Richard’s funeral (and witnessed Lorelai’s awful sex in the pool house story), but he and Emily recently reconnected at the club. Lorelai’s freaked out at the thought of the coupling, which she shares with Emily. A fight ensues, as Emily accuses Lorelai of being relieved that she doesn’t have to worry about her anymore if she has a man in her life. Emily also lets Lorelai know she spent a half a day with Luke, looking at potential locations for him to expand the diner. Luke hadn’t told Lorelai about it, because it was the same day he found out from Emily that she quit therapy, something Lorelai lied to him about.\nKelly Bishop (Credit: Netflix) More Luke and Lorelai confront each other about the lies and omissions later at the diner, and a fight ensues in which she asks why their lives are so separate, as partners, and he answers that it’s because that’s the way Lorelai wants it, that’s the way she has set it up.\nEmily has yet again been the spark of another major Luke and Lorelai fight. But, for the first time, it may be because she actually wants them to make their relationship more permanent.\nElsewhere in Stars Hollow (and beyond): * Beside Rory’s desk at The Gazette, she has hung a photo of the late, great, great, great David Carr , The New York Times media columnist and bestselling author who died in 2015.\n* Our obsession from this episode is Lorelai’s “Totes Y’all” pool bag. It is all kinds of adorbs, but to own it would mean not only shelling out $165, but also making Reese Witherspoon $165 richer… the bag’s from her Draper James lifestyle brand. What to do, what to do?\nRelated: 15 Gift Ideas for the ‘Gilmore Girls’ Superfan in Your Life\n* During a town meeting that unveils a new, very noisy air conditioning system, Rory is encouraged to join The Thirtysomething Gang, a group of locals who have returned home to squat with their ‘rents after getting chewed up and spit out by the real world.\n* Everyone in town is annoying Rory by congratulating her for being back in town. She insists she’s not, but her invitation to join The Thirtysomething Gang, as well as Lorelai’s invite to join The Parents of the Thirtysomething Gang Gang — suggests otherwise.\n* Bootsy, who runs the Stars Hollow newsstand, is getting a lot of time in this miniseries. Feels like we’ve seen him more on Netflix than we did in the entire run of the original series. He’s joined at the town meeting by Tom the contractor and music shop owner Sophie, two old faves we see for the first time in A Year in the Life .\n* The town meeting also includes Taylor’s announcement of Stars Hollow: The Musical , an “enchanted” musical history of the town, with book and lyrics by Taylor. He hired gloomy composer Nat Compton to write the music, and he knows Nat is good, because he once lived in Brooklyn. Lorelai, along with Gypsy, Babette, Tom, Sophie, and newbie Donald, agrees to serve as the musical advisory committee for the play.\nLiz Torres, Sally Struthers, Alexis Bledel, and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More * We see the secret town bar that we learned about in “Spring.” It’s in a gated alleyway in town, and while Michel and Lorelai are having their talk about him leaving the Dragonfly, everyone suddenly shouts of “Five-0! Five-0!” when Taylor is walking towards them. They immediately shut everything down and close the gates, and reopen when he passes. Lane and Zack are playing an acoustic gig as the venue’s entertainment.\n* A song in Stars Hollow: The Musical is about an incestuous brother/sister couple during Revolutionary War times. Sample lyrics: “It’s a love revolution in a revolutionary time.”\nRelated: ‘Gilmore Girls’: 10 Times Music Helped Make the Show Epic\nQuestions: We Got a Few * Lorelai and Rory didn’t want to reach into a cooler sitting beside them to grab their own strawberry sodas. Do we really think Lorelai is going to rough it on a Wild -like hike for thousands, even hundreds, even tens of, miles?\n* Until that phone call, did Logan think his affair with Rory would go on indefinitely, even if he marries Odette?\n* Did Claudia land a role in Stars Hollow: The Musical ?\nGilmore Gift of Gab “There’s two of them, man. And when they get mad, they become like five little Korean people, and they focus all their Korean vitriol on Lane and me.” — Zack, explaining why it’s so crucial that the floaty hut at the municipal pool be fixed, lest the Van Gerbigs face the wrath of pool toy-less twins Steve and Kwan.\n“It’s like a postcard from the real world.” — April to Rory, upon seeing Rory living back at Lorelai’s house, in her childhood room.\n“Fatherhood is just going to be a l t of pretending for me.” — Michel, explaining that Frederick has made him come to the municipal pool to get used to being around kids and pretending he doesn’t dislike them.\n“That was a total clam jam.” — Babette’s cringeworthy reaction to Lorelai telling her to stop flirting with a young auditioner for Stars Hollow: The Musical .\n“I’m here.” — Rory, to Taylor, when he asks her what her qualifications are to be the new Gazette editor.\nMichael Winters and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More “Do you have the George Clooney tequila? The one he enjoys with his celebrity friends on his many tequila-filled nights?” — Michel to the server at the secret bar. By the way, Michel, the tequila is called Casamigos.\n“She’s the one who quit therapy and drove that poor woman into show business.” — Lorelai, about Emily, to Rory, who accuses Lorelai of not looking after grieving Emily. Lorelai is referring to Claudia, the therapist who’s now auditioning for Stars Hollow: The Musical .\n“You think Michel only sees as far as his own reflection, — Michel, endearingly speaking about himself in the third person while telling Lorelai he knows she’s been diverting part of her salary to him, to keep him employed at the Dragonfly.\n“They should make a movie about poor Tori Spelling falling at Benihana … Tepanyaki: Grill of Death .” — Lorelai to Rory.\n“I remember you. Punk.” — Esther, a Gazette employee, to Jess when he visits Rory at the newspaper office. Jess and Rory reveal they haven’t seen each other in four years.\nRelated: ‘Gilmore Girls’ A to Z: From Al’s Pancake World to Zack Van Gerbig\n“You sent a vulnerable, wounded turtle into a nest of horny, gray-haired honey badgers.” — Lorelai, to Rory, about Rory steering Emily to socialize at the country club.\n“There hath pass’d away a glory from the Earth.” — the William Wordsworth (not Longfellow, as it is mistakenly attributed to in the episode) Quote: on Richard’s headstone (which has been redone five times, and still doesn’t meet Emily’s exacting specifications).\nRemember When … * A callback to the beginning of A Year in the Life : a song in the town musical confirms Taylor got the sewer system he so desperately wanted in “Winter.”\n* Screenwriter Doyle does a favor for Rory and writes a review of The Jungle Book movie for The Gazette , but he’s unhappy with how she edits it. Just like how she was upset with how he edited her back at The Yale Daily News , where she was writing reviews of campus plays and comparing ballerinas to hippos.\nDanny Strong (Credit: Netflix) More * Rory did always love The Stars Hollow Gazette . Remember when she got herself a subscription to the paper when she went to Yale?\nYou’ve Been Gilmore-d: * Guest stars in “Summer”: Sam Pancake (Lauren Graham’s real-life BFF) as Stars Hollow resident Donald; Ray Wise as (Emily’s new boyfriend?) Jack Smith; and (Tony winners and former real-life marrieds) Sutton Foster and Christian Borle as Violet and Carl, the stars of Stars Hollow: The Musical .\nSutton Foster (Credit: Netflix) More * Music in “Summer”: “I Feel the Earth Move” performed by Carole King as Sophie the music store owner; “Summer” by Charlotte Hatherley; “Bubbles” by The Free Design; and “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” by Nancy Sinatra.\n* Pop culture and cultural references in “Summer”: Annie Hall , Woody Allen, MIT, Noam Chomsky, The Returned , NoDoz, The Savoy, The Dorchester, Matilda , Game of Thrones , White Walkers, W Hotel, The Godfather , Aaron Sorkin, Baywatch , David Hasselhoff, MS-DOS, Halt and Catch Fire , Pat LaFrieda, Chinatown , There Will Be Blood , Michael Bay, snooker, Bataan Death March, Baby Monitor: Sound of Fear , Co-Ed Call Girl , Tori Spelling, Benihana, James Nesmith, Hamilton , Broadway, ABBA, “Waterloo,” Nostradamus, Joe Allen, School of Rock , Fiddler on the Roof , Edward Albee, Buster Rhymes, Lin-Manuel Miranda, RZA, Kinky Boots , Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? , yard sales, Lucy van Pelt, You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown , The Federalist Papers, Matlock , Andy Griffith, Longfellow, Duncan Phyfe furniture, Lou Grant , Dave Eggers, Nora Ephron, The Mysteries of Laura , On the Waterfront , “Gold Digger,” Kanye West, Narcos , The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Sandra Lee, Ina Garten, and Lipitor.\n* The food they ate in “Summer”: Popcorn, macaroni and cheese, O-So Strawberry soda , coffee, Pop-Tarts, hot dogs, Greek food, Chinese food, and Italian food.\n* Stars Hollow celebrations in “Summer”: A town meeting, the opening of the municipal pool, the planning sessions for Stars Hollow: The Musical , and, upcoming, 2016’s Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days of Summer event.\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is streaming on Netflix.",

      "text": "Sean Gunn (Photo: Netflix) More Warning: This interview about Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life contains spoilers.\nIt’s not Uber… it’s Ooober. For Gilmore Girls fans who’ve already delved into at least the first episode of Netflix’s A Year in the Life revival series, you know what we’re talking about: the latest entrepreneurial project from Kirk Gleason, the man who gave us Condoleezza Rice mailboxes, the Hay There skin care line, and Kirk’s Diner.\nYahoo TV talked to Sean Gunn, the actor behind Kirk and his delightful quirkiness, about his character’s latest adventures on Netflix, returning to the Gilmore set without co-star Edward Herrmann, and the ambiguous status of Kirk’s relationship with longtime — girlfriend? — Lulu.\nGunn also offered previews of his 2017 movie projects — The Belko Experiment and a Guardians of the Galaxy sequel, both collaborations with his screenwriter brother, James Gunn — and shared his all-time favorite Kirk moments, as well as his idea for the perfect Kirk storyline should there be more Gilmore Girls episodes in our future.\nRelated: ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ Winter Recap: Girl, Unhappy\nYahoo TV: Congratulations, Sean. You are part of what is arguably the pop culture event of the entire year.\nSean Gunn: Wow, thank you, yes. I’m flattered by that. It’s a little nuts. I can’t believe it, but I’m happy about it.\nDoes it feel that way to you? Do you feel in the middle of all that excitement?\nI do, yeah. It’s been such a whirlwind from the time that I realized that we were definitely doing it, which was late last year, then through shooting earlier this year, and now, with all of the buzz and all of the interest from the fans. It’s mind-blowing. I’m happy to be a part of it… I’m trying to grab onto my seat and hang on for the ride and enjoy it.\nFans have wanted a reunion pretty much since the day after the series finale. When it became a reality that this was going to happen, did you know right away how big a role Kirk would play?\nI think that’s just how it worked out. I was certainly very pleased when I read the script and I saw how much fun stuff I got to do. I think it was lucky, because I was shooting [the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel] at the same time. The fact that we were able to schedule around that and that I still got so much cool stuff to do was really great. I haven’t seen [ A Year in the Life ] yet. You’re one up on me.\nWhere were you on shooting Galaxy at that point? Were you right in the middle of that as well?\nYes. The Gilmore Girls shoot came completely in the middle of it. We started Guardians before Gilmore , and we ended after Gilmore wrapped. I was in Atlanta from January through June, shooting Guardians of the Galaxy . Then Gilmore was late February to early May. I was doing double duty, but it was awesome. It was the busiest time of my career, and I loved it.\nYou racked up plenty of frequent flier miles?\nYeah, I really did.\nGunn as Kirk, left, and as Kraglin in Guardians of the Galaxy . (Photos: Everett Collection) More Kirk and Kraglin, from Galaxy , are quirky, yet dramatically different characters. Was it fun to really throw yourself into both at the same time?\nYes, it was. I love both characters. I love both projects. I’ve been really focusing on the gratitude that I feel for where things are in my career right now, that I’ve been fortunate enough to have roles in these two great projects that came back. A Guardians sequel and a Gilmore Girls reboot right at the same time was really awesome.\nYou really were going back to two projects that each have such devoted fanbases.\nTotally. First of all, you have a little of the pressure taken off of you because although, of course, you still want it to be as good as it can possibly be, you’re not as worried about finding an audience. We know when we’re shooting Gilmore Girls that we have an audience. That certainly helps a lot. The same is true for Guardians . You never know exactly how well a movie is going to do, but it’s unlikely to bomb because of the success of the first movie. It’s even more reason to just focus on the work and telling a great story, telling it as well as you possibly can.\nRead More Did you pitch any ideas yourself for Kirk?\nNo. I never have. Amy [Sherman-Palladino] doesn’t really work like that, and I respect it. She has her hands on the reins, and she knows where she wants to take things. I have implicit trust in what she’s going to do. I’m more comfortable letting her take over than trying to think about, “This is what I think would be funny or cool to do.” There are so many different balls to juggle when you’re telling a large story that has a lot of different parts. Yeah, I’m happy to just get that script and open it up and see what I’m doing.\nPhoto: Netflix More What was your reaction when you read that Kirk would be starting Ooober?\nI thought it was hilarious. It sounded very Kirk-like. I wasn’t surprised. I thought the writing was really funny. It just really tickles me that [Lorelai’s] like, “How’s it different from Uber?” He says, “No, no. You call my mom and my mom lets me know, and then I come and pick you up.” Like, “How could you not know this? It’s the simplest thing in the world.” It’s very Kirk, and that was very fun to shoot.\nWe also see the premiere of the second original film by Kirk.\nOh, man. That was the first thing I shot, actually. When I stepped foot into Stars Hallow for the first time in almost a decade, I was shooting the black-and-white stuff for the new film by Kirk. That’s been a spoiler that I’ve been wanting to tell people for so long, but I haven’t been able to. I wanted the fans to know that there’s another film by Kirk coming out. I think people will be excited by that. God, yeah, it’s fun. I want to see it. I thought it was funny when we were shooting it, but you always get a little worried. You never know how things are going to end up looking.\nA scene from the latest film by Kirk. (Photo: Netflix) More What was that like for you, stepping back into this world? As an actor, it’s probably not something you think is going to happen when a series ends. You don’t know if you’ll ever get to work with this entire group of people again, on those sets, which were so beautiful and specific, making up that charming town.\nIt was a trip. It definitely brought me back. I keep using this word, but it’s true: I really just felt so grateful, because when the show started, I was in my mid-20s. I really loved doing the show, and I loved the character, but as it went on, you get wrapped up in Hollywood and in your career. I don’t know that I ever appreciated it as much as I should have while I was doing it originally. Then I came to appreciate it more as the years went on, particularly after it came out on Netflix and it had this revitalized fanbase. People started going crazy. I really realized how much the show had moved a lot of people. Then to get the opportunity to pick that back up again and to reach those fans again and to do our best to tell stories that people really want to hear, I just feel tons of gratitude for that. I was able to step back on set and know that it was special in a way that maybe I had missed the first time around.\nYou’ve talked previously about Edward Herrmann and how much he meant to you, some great advice that he gave you. What was that like for you and everyone in the cast, to return to that world without him there?\nYou know what’s weird is that yes, it was incredibly difficult, but also, in another sense, Ed was there in a way, because our collective love for him is something that’s very real and felt present as we were shooting it. It’s so sad to think about how much Ed would have loved to have come back and done the show, because I know he would have. But it’s also something to be celebrated, how great his work was and how much we continued to honor him. In my eyes — and I know that Lauren [Graham] and Alexis [Bledel] and Amy and Kelly [Bishop] and Scott [Patterson] would say the same thing — Ed is always there. Any time we do anything related to Gilmore Girls , Ed will be there.\nWas it a little extra special to have Kirk be at one of those famous Gilmore family dinners?\nFor sure. I adore Kelly Bishop as a human being and as an actress. I think her work on this show is absolutely superlative across the board. Just the opportunity, in those little moments, to work with Kelly is a real treat for me. I really appreciated that.\nWhat is your favorite moment or Kirk storyline from the new episodes?\nRight now, I can only say it in terms of what was my favorite to shoot. I loved shooting the film by Kirk. It’s so funny to me. Kirk is out in the middle of the road, and he’s leaning over the body. I think that that was probably my favorite thing to shoot. Although on the whole, my favorite thing was the food festival in the town square, with all the different countries represented. It was a fun scene, but it was also a comfortable old slipper, that scene. Everything was in place. Taylor was running the show. I was right over Taylor’s arm with a clipboard. The long walk-and-talks with Lauren and Scott. That day was like, “Oh, this is Gilmore Girls again. We are back at it. We are back right into the thick of it.”\nGunn and Mike Winters. (Photo: Netflix) More And pretty much any time Taylor and Kirk are together is a great moment.\nI love Mike Winters. He’s such a great actor. In some ways, I think that he gets overlooked a little bit because his character can be irritating at times. He’s the guy you don’t want to be. Taylor’s always going on and on about something or other. In terms of what he had to do technically as an actor with all his dialogue, with running the scenes in the town meetings at Miss Patty’s and quarterbacking a lot of the big festival scenes and stuff like that, that is not easy work, and he’s a master at it. He is a really, really great actor. I’ve always appreciated having somebody so sharp there to play off of.\nWe also get to see Kirk interacting with Luke. They developed a very unlikely, odd bromance throughout the original series, and that became such a beloved part of the show. Obviously the writers realized this, that you and Scott Patterson had such great chemistry. Did that just happen organically?\nYeah, I definitely sense what you’re talking about. I don’t know how it landed there, other than to know that I really like working with Scott a lot. I think our scenes play well. Scott is another guy who I think doesn’t always get enough credit for being as funny as he is. He’s a great straight man. You have these scenes with Luke and Kirk, where he’s the straight man and I’m the goofball. Scott is really good at that. I think it just developed organically over the years, but I do like that friendship. I think Kirk considers Luke a better friend than Luke considers Kirk, but that’s OK. That’s probably true of pretty much everyone in Kirk’s life. I think Luke was grudgingly warm with Kirk.\nWe know that Kirk and Lulu are still together, but we don’t really get confirmation on specifics.\nThat’s true. I don’t know. I don’t know any more than you do, unfortunately. We can see that they’re still together. I’d like to hope that they’re not living in Kirk’s mom’s basement. But I think Kirk is still living in that basement. My guess is that they’re still boyfriend and girlfriend. I guess they’re not living together. I’ve got to ask Amy that question.\nAfter doing these episodes, do you feel like you want to go and do more now? Do you feel like there should be another season, or do you think we should wait another few years, just continue to periodically check in with these great characters?\nThat’s a great question. I try not to want any one specific thing to happen because that’s then bound to probably not happen. Particularly in Hollywood, I try not to set my hopes on anything. I do believe that the idea that we could go back and shoot more in the future certainly seems possible. My gut is, let’s see how these go and then we’ll talk about it. I do think that if the demand is there from the fans, then I think it’s a question of money and schedules. I think that we all enjoy doing it. I would like to think that Kirk isn’t gone forever, but you never know.\nThe cast of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life at the premiere on Nov. 18. (Photo: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images) More It does seem like, hearing all of you talk about what it was like to return to the sets and be working with each other again, that many of you were almost surprised at how much you loved jumping back into the show. Is that true?\nYes, I was. I was surprised. I was mostly surprised by how much everybody seemed to really embrace it and be really into it. The first time around, we all worked very hard on the show. We worked long hours. Particularly the leads on the show worked long hours, with tons of dialogue. At times, it could be a very difficult show to shoot. This time around, I think it was just easier on everybody. We were all older and wiser and had a little more leeway from Netflix than maybe we’d had in the past, in terms of Amy being able to do things the way that she wanted to. In the same way I said to you that I was grateful for the opportunity, I think we all felt that. It was a nicer experience this time around. Yeah, I would think that that bodes well for maybe it’s possible to do it again. Who knows?\nWe just touched on the specifics of Lulu and Kirk, what we don’t know about them. Are there any other questions that you still have about Kirk, or about the other characters, or about the town that weren’t answered yet?\nOh my gosh. I have so many questions about Kirk. Don’t we all have questions? Isn’t Kirk just questionable in general? I try not to judge Kirk too much. My job is to breathe life into what’s on the page. I generally focus on that. In terms of what Kirk is doing when we don’t see him, he might be doing anything.\nRelated: ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ Spring Recap: Time for a Few Curveballs\nDo you have all-time favorite Kirk moments?\nYeah. The ones that jump to mind right off the bat are playing Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof . The film by Kirk, obviously. Playing Jesus in The Festival of Living Art. Cat Kirk, which I’m reminded of all the time, because I have cats. Personally, I’m a big cat lover, and whenever I post a picture of me with one of my cats on Instagram, I get a dozen comments from people saying, “Cat Kirk.” Those ones stick out. Then there’s scenes. Obviously running the night terrors — any time I’m naked, I remember well, which was more than once, sadly. Yeah, I have a couple of really great scenes with Scott that I love, one where I’m telling him about night terrors. I love the scene on the first date with Lulu, where I take Luke aside and have him give me pointers on how to act on the date.\nAfter all this Gilmore Girls hoopla, you have a pair of big movies coming up next year, Guardians and The Belko Experiment . Tell me about the latter.\nThe Belko Experiment is coming out on March 17. It is a psychological horror thriller, I would call it, I guess. It’s pretty violent. If you don’t like violence, you may want to skip this one. It’s intense. I had a lot of fun working on that movie, a bunch of great actors in that movie.\nI was just going to say, that cast is amazing. You and Michael Rooker, Tony Goldwyn, John C. McGinley. Have you done a movie like that before, that kind of intense psychological thriller?\nNo, not really. I’ve been killed in movies before, but no, I’ve never really done one exactly like this. I don’t know if there’s ever been a movie exactly like this. It’s a very different role for me, and I’m definitely excited for fans of Gilmore Girls to check this movie out. I’m excited for them to see me acting in a totally different way. The character, Marty, in Belko , is nothing like Kirk. At least I hope. If he’s a lot like Kirk, I might be in trouble.\nWill we recognize you?\nI would think so. My hair is blond in it, but that’s not that big of a deal.\nYou said it’s maybe unlike any other film. Can you tease a little more about that?\nI think it asks a very tough moral and ethical question, which is, would you be able to kill someone if you knew that you would be saving more lives by doing so? Would you be able to kill someone who is innocent if you knew that you could save more innocent lives if you did so? It is a very tricky and harrowing question, but it’s the question that the movie puts in front of you.\nIs your character, Marty, part of having to make that decision?\nEveryone is part of having to make that decision. Marty is a bit of a stoner, works in a cafeteria. I think the pressure of it all gets to Marty quite severely.\nThat is a good tease. There’s also the Guardians sequel in May, and that is a movie where your fans probably didn’t recognize you at first. What can you tease about the sequel and your character?\nMy role is a little expanded in this movie, which is nice. Kraglin is the right-hand man of Yondu [played by Michael Rooker], who is the leader of the Ravagers, who had abducted Peter Quill [played by Chris Pratt] from a young age. Guardians ends with Peter having double-crossed Yondu and the Ravagers, and not giving them the Infinity Stone as he had promised. The second movie takes place just a couple months after the first movie. We learn that the Ravagers are not pleased with the fact that Peter has double-crossed them. They’re also not pleased that Yondu doesn’t seem to be going after him as hard as they think he ought to. The Ravagers are starting to have a bit of turmoil within their ranks about whether they should mutiny against Yondu, and Kraglin is a part of all the drama that unfolds there. That movie was such a delight to make and getting to go back… it was yet another thing where I get to go back on the set and see all the people that I had worked with years earlier. Going back in, it’s so great.\nWhat’s your dream next thing?\nGosh. I try not to think in those terms too much. I chase the words. My dream next thing is a great script. This year I worked on Gilmore Girls, and I worked on the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel — great scripts for both. If I can keep getting great scripts, I’m set. I don’t need anything more than that.\nIf there are additional Gilmore episodes, movies, whatever it be, in our future, is there anything you absolutely want to see Kirk do or try? A third Kirk film?\nI’ll be happy with whatever Kirk might be doing, but I wouldn’t mind seeing Kirk run for political office or something like that. That might be fun. A power struggle between Taylor and Kirk just might really hit the spot.\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is streaming now on Netflix.",

      "text": "The key role of four companies from the title of this article (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) starts to resemble situation from the end of the ’60s and beginning of the ‘70s. This is when American market was stormed by fashionable firms like Nifty Fifty. Investors were convinced about the limitless potential of several companies and it led to very painful crashes. How will the history end this time?\nNifty Fifty \nAt the turn of the ‘60s and ‘70s, American stock exchange received a lot of attention with investment funds being on the rise. With the money from investors they were buying promising companies with solid fundamentals. This group among others consisted of industrial leaders, healthcare and even high-tech firms. Soon these companies got themselves a nickname – ‘Nifty Fifty’.\nThe key element of the Wall Street fashion was the belief in great perspectives. A decision to buy Kodak, Polaroid or Upjohn Company was motivated by a motto of ‘buy and hold forever’. Choosing amazing company’s stock should give profits over the incoming decades and not only years or months.\nIf a stock is ‘doomed’ for eternal growth then no price is too high. The result was radical overpricing and the first Nifty Fifty peak was in 1969, second in 1972/73. In the latter P/E for the most popular companies reached respective numbers: Polaroid – 95, McDonald’s – 86, Walt Disney – 82, Digital Equipment – 56, Eastman Kodak – 44. On many occasions, investors could not count on living long enough only to receive the amount they invested but no one seemed to care.\nVery good summary of this situation is a chart below. It shows the scale of the overpricing of American stocks relative to the rest of the world. Clearly, the highest levels were reached during 1969 but also pay attention where are we today!\n\nSource: www.zerohedge.com\nIn the beginning of 1969, the reality checked the prices of McDonald’s, Walt Disney and others and made it obvious that all these hopefuls will not rise until kingdom comes. Below you can see the size of the collapse (CPI adjusted).\n\nSource: Marc Faber\nSince the burst of a bubble in 1969, the market lost 66% with another bottom in 1982. Stock prices were going down for over a decade. Far from any surprise, Nifty Fifty were on sale. Polaroid, Avon, Xerox lost 91%, 86% and 71% respectively. Many of those bearing the nickname never returned to their previously privileged position (Sears, Kresge, JC Penney). There were those who end up bankrupt (Polaroid, Eastman Kodak).\nFacebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google \nWhy we talk about Nifty Fifty today? First and foremost the shared belief of companies doomed to succeed and their infinite potential for growth. Looking back at the ’60s and ‘70s we see that the number of favoured companies is ten times lower. Four companies – FANG – are responsible for 90% of S&P 500 capitalisation since 2015.\n\nSince 2015 FANG added 630 billion USD while the rest of S&P 500 added only 45 bn USD. We can say that the growth of this index is based on the popularity of few companies.\nSimilar to fashionable Nifty Fifty also FANG had to reach extreme heights of P/E. Netflix reached 318, Amazon 178, Facebook 46 and Google 29. This is dramatically different than the market itself – 21.2 – which itself is a bubble level. During last 12 months, we had 204 instances when insiders (management, board of directors, people with high-level access) sold their stocks and NONE purchase transactions.\nApart from the acronym companies there is also Tesla. The corporation which only bleeds money while trying to overestimate their income. Soon Tesla will have to compete with huge competitors like Volkswagen or Toyota and this only raises questions about today’s price of Tesla.\nMaybe some critics will say that comparison between FANG and Nifty Fifty does not make any sense and this case is rather about popular stocks regularly falling from grace. An example of GoPro fits here as many were hopeful for this fashionable company.\n\nOf course, individual cases such as GoPro are completely normal but when we see only a few overpriced stocks being the main engine of the market – this is showing very weak fundamentals of the market.\nSummary \nThe psychology of the crowd is a major factor in both examples of Nifty Fifty and FANG. Good performance of some equities make investors interested and ensuring voices of ‘experts’ only add to this hype. Soon in the environment like this prices are disconnected from essential data.\nHow to diagnose if we are seeing maniacal buying spree? Again, we go back to basics – P/E, CAPE, P/S – they are entry level tools easy to obtain. Another red flag is overly optimistic forecasts of ‘experts’, as one of Forbes authors wrote about FANG, to paraphrase “why should we care about the environment and the market where other companies are losing money if our price is going up?”\nInformation about FANG in this article exposes S&P 500 being evidently dependable on few very popular stocks. Central banks have their part in all this as the SNB put billions in Facebook, Google and other huge corporations. Investors should now either join the crowd, hope for these gains to continue forever or look for undervalued assets. We still believe that miners, commodities and Russian and Chilean equities are far more attractive.\nDuring mania everything is ok until the red colour enters the room with catastrophic results. When investors start questioning limitless growth small drop is due. Tense atmosphere makes everyone ask themselves – who will leave next? When the panic starts there are a lot of sellers and a deficit of buyers. The Nifty Fifty history shows that 90% sale is possible. Unaware investors have to realise that in order to compensate for such loss price must jump up by 1000%.\n \nIndependent Trader Team \nThe post FANG – stocks the street buys appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/StrangerThingsTV) \"Stranger Things\" season 2 will hit Netflix in 2017. \nThe first season of Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" introduced viewers to a group of likable kids from a small town. With the second season on the horizon, the show has added new cast members to help continue the story of the Upside Down. \nA handful of new cast members have been enlisted to portray characters in the second season. The latest of which is Brett Gelman, according to The Hollywood Reporter . Gelman, who is known for his works on Adult Swim, will reportedly play a character named Murray Bauman, a conspiracy theorist. Before his current occupation, though, Murray was a journalist who got discredited. He travels to Hawkins to pursue an investigation on an unsolved case. \nApart from Gelman, Dacre Montgomery and Sadie Sink had been cast respectively as Billy and Max, who are step-siblings. The former is described to be aggressive and edgy, while the latter has trouble trusting people perhaps due to her complicated past. Joining them are Sean Astin playing a Department of Energy executive named Owens, and Paul Reiser portraying a character named Bob Newby. \nFans will also be glad to know that breakout star Millie Bobby Brown will return for the second season as Eleven, but it is unknown if she will remain a regular cast member or simply a guest star. Joe Keery and Noah Schnapp, on the other hand, have been promoted to series regulars. Advertisement \nThe second season is reportedly going to be darker than the previous one and will take place a year after what transpired in the season 1 finale. \nWhile speaking to The Hollywood Reporter in an interview earlier this year, executive producer Shawn Levy revealed that fans can expect some lingering questions from season 1 to be answered. \n\"There were some troubling loose ends. Why did Hopper get in that car? What was that thing that Will coughed up in the bathroom? There's these loose ends that we are definitely going to pick up and follow, so that's one piece of it,\" he said. \nAdditionally, Levy revealed that the second season will be \"exploring new dark forces at play.\" \n\"Stranger Things\" season 2 does not have a definite release date yet, but rumor has it that it will land sometime in July 2017 on Netflix.

      "text": "14 hrs ago PHOTO COURTESY OF NETFLIX \nAlexis Bledel and Lauren Graham return as Rory and Lorelai Gilmore in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" \nNetflix’s mission to resurrect television shows thought dead and buried has had mixed results so far. For every “Arrested Development” that retains the spirit of the original, there’s a “Fuller House” that provokes the question, “Why?” \nBut even casual fans of the “Gilmore Girls” wanted a trip back to Stars Hollow. \nThe series lasted from 2000 to 2007 on the CW, but ended on a sour note as creator and writer Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino had left the show at the end of Season 6 because of a dispute with the network. The original series ended with young journalist Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) off to shadow the campaign of a young U.S. Senator from Illinois named Barack Obama. \nNow, as President Obama’s time in office winds down, the timing of “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” with the Palladinos back in charge is ideal. Netflix released four new 90-minute episodes (each a mini-movie based around a season) on Black Friday. If you spent the Thanksgiving weekend binging on all four, based on an informal poll of the Cap Times newsroom, you’re not alone. \nI've only watched “Winter,” which my cohorts insist is the weakest of the bunch, but I can say it’s a welcome return. There’s definitely a feeling of homecoming in the opening scene, as the camera lingers on snowy, idyllic Stars Hollow, the kind of small town that we wish existed but probably doesn’t, where everybody is smart, funny and caring, there are no chain stores, and the town busker keeps his guitar case closed because he’s just playing for the joy of it. That busker is singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips, and when he covers a Fountains of Wayne song in “Winter,” it hit my sweet spot. \nThen the camera finds Rory and her mother Lorelai (Lauren Graham) in the town gazebo, engaging in their favorite mother-daughter activity — rapid-fire dialogue. References to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop, Ben Affleck as Batman and Fitbit are volleyed back and forth. \n“Wow, winded!” Rory exclaims. \n“Haven’t done that for a while,” Lorelai responds. Don't miss a thing. Get a Cap Times daily summary sent to   \n“Felt good,” Rory said. And she’s right. \nThat first “Winter” episode may be burdened by the need to catch up with all the characters from the original series. Luke (Scott Patterson) is still wearing a backward baseball cap and running his diner, which now has Wi-Fi, and one great running joke is all the fake passwords he gives customers to annoy them and keep them from using his business as their office. He and Lorelai are living together in domestic bliss, debating whether they should have a baby, which leads to the hilarious return of Rory’s frenemy Paris (Liza Weil) as a high-powered fertility specialist. \nThe biggest change is the loss of Lorelai’s father Richard (Edward Herrmann, who died in 2014), and “Winter” revolves around the rift that’s grown between Lorelai and her mother (Kelly Bishop). In a flashback, the two argue in a way that’s surprisingly wounding, which makes it a little hard to accept their inevitable reconciliation at the end of the episode. \nFor those ready for big plot developments and twists, it sounds like the later episodes will provide the payoff. But if you’re just happy to be back around these folks again, grab some strong coffee and Pop-Tarts and settle in for a satisfying reunion. Tags",

      "text": "1 of 3 Sure, you've got mashed 'taters for Thanksgiving, and probably for a few days after. But if you want some of them French-fried 'taters a la Sling Blade on the Netflix, you're running out of time. MMMM- hmmm .\nThat movie, featuring a mentally challenged adult man fascinatingly portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton , has an impressive 96 percent \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Your writer highly recommends it, but stream it before it vanishes at the end of November. Bonus: See if you can find the original short, called Some Call It a Sling Blade featuring Thornton with J.T. Walsh and Molly Ringwald , who did not appear in the full-length feature. Thornton wrote the short, and the full-length adapted screenplay that the short pitched to Hollywood. He took home an Oscar for his writing and a nomination for his acting.\nAs Karl might say: \"Aight, den\" ... on to a couple more highlights from December's comings and goings in Netflix's video treasure trove (full list below):\nLove Kevin Spacey ? You'll cringe with his character in American Beauty ( 88 percent Fresh ) but hurry because it's gone Dec. 1. If you're into extreme sports, athletes who take incredible risks and/or need a good cry before the end of the month, might we suggest McConkey , a critically acclaimed documentary on extreme sports pioneer Shane McConkey. Try to figure out who's on top in \"Top Gun\" before it runs out of fuel on Dec. 1.\nWith the family all home to argue about the election, you might consider The In-Laws a good distraction from the inevitable. Think again . This isn't the 1979 version starring Peter Falk and Alan Arkin . There's never enough Falk and Arkin – ever. The remake does have Albert Brooks, so there's that. After Dec. 1, you won't have to worry about it any more – on Netflix, anyway.\nIf you just KNOW the government is hiding something really big via coded messages known only to the Illuminati, you have until Dec. 14 to find out – that's when The Da Vinci Code disappears like so much invisible continental congressional ink.\nDon't fret the losses ... a lot of cool new stuff is being added starting Dec. 1, including TOGA!!!! – National Lampoon's Animal House . And you'll be able to Netflix and Chill with Bob Ross to a greater degree than ever before ... featuring a collection of the big-haired painter's best, plus more than a few happy little trees starting bright and early Dec. 1.\nA slew of Netflix Originals are being added as well in December. Top of that list to watch with your Facebook-fake-news-sharing uncle is Barry , a biopic about Barack Obama that arrives on Dec. 16. Perhaps not. Possible alternatives from the newly arriving list include The Way of the Dragon , the awesome 1972 kung fu flick that features Bruce Lee denuding Chuck Norris ' chest of hair before dispatching him ... or perhaps Hitler: A Career ? Both arrive on Dec. 1. There's always America's biggest patriot beating up bad dudes in Marvel's Captain America: Civil War – arriving as a big present from Netflix on Christmas Day. Maybe just put your uncle on a filter and play it safe with My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic: Season 6 , arriving Dec. 20.\nHere's the full rundown:\nDeparting Netflix in December 2016 December 1 \n50 First Dates (2004)\nAmerican Beauty (1999)\nBlack Ops: Series 2\nCamp Takota (2014)\nCarmen Jones (1954)\nCats & Dogs (2001)\nCurious George: Swings Into Spring (2013)\nDon't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)\nElizabeth: The Golden Age (2007)\nEvent Horizon (1997)\nFrequencies (2013)\nMcConkey\nMedora (2013)\nMonkey Business (1952)\nMyth Hunters: Series 1\nMyth Hunters: Series 2\nNeil Young : Heart of Gold (2006)\nPaycheck (2003)\nPirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie (2008)\nRiver of No Return (1954)\nSling Blade (1996)\nThor: Hammer of the Gods (2009)\nThe Great War Diary: Season 1\nThe In-Laws (2003)\nThe Out-of-Towners (1999)\nTop Gun (1986)\nValley of the Dolls (1967)\nWorld Trade Center (2006)\nDecember 2 \nLegends of the Knight (2013)\nThe Red Baron (2008)\nDecember 3 \nThe Best of Me (2014)\nDecember 5 \nHoles (2003)\nDecember 14 \nThe Da Vinci Code (2006)\nDecember 15 \nHigh Profits: Season 1\nWorld War II in Colour (2009)\nDecember 16 \nBeyond the Hills (2012)\nDecember 22 \nDark Skies (2013)\nDecember 26 \nJust Friends (2005)\nDecember 27 \nSpy Kids (2001)\nDecember 31 \nHercules: The Legendary Journeys: Seasons 1-6\nArriving on Netflix in December 2016 \nDecember 1 \nAlways (1989)\nAngels in the Snow (2015)\nBeverly Hills Cop (1984)\nBeyond Bollywood (2014)\nBlack Snake Moan (2007)\nChill with Bob Ross: Collection (1990)\nCompulsion (1959)\nD2: The Mighty Ducks (1994)\nDavid Blaine : Street Magic (1997)\nDreamland (2010)\nFor the Love of Spock (2016)\nGirlfriends' Guide to Divorce: Season 2 (2015)\nGlory Daze: The Life and Time of Michael Alig (2016)\nHarry and the Hendersons (1987)\nHitler: A Career (1977)\nHoliday Engagement (2011)\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids (1989)\nHouse of Wax (2006)\nHannibal (2001)\nMerli: Season 1 – NETFLIX ORIGINAL\nMerry Kissmas (2015)\nNational Lampoon's Animal House (1978)\nPicture Perfect (1997)\nRainbow Time (2016)\nRodeo & Juliet (2015)\nSwept Under (2016)\nSwitchback (1997)\nThe Angry Birds Movie (2016)\nThe Crucible (1996)\nThe Little Rascals (1994)\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)\nThe Rock (1996)\nThe Spirit of Christmas (2015)\nThe Way of the Dragon (1972)\nToys (1992)\nUncle Nick (2015)\nWaking Life (2001)\nWe're Back!

      "text": "Courtesy of TiVo November 29, 2016 | 06:53AM PT \nNetflix will be getting its own dedicated button on TiVo ’s remote controls, as part of product and patent-licensing agreements set by the two companies. \nThe duo’s product agreement calls for TiVo to continue integrating Netflix into TiVo set-tops available from pay-TV providers and at retail. That will include unified search across the content catalog and a Netflix button on TiVo remotes. \nTiVo was acquired by entertainment-technology provider Rovi for $1.1 billion this year , and the merged company adopted the TiVo name. Both Rovi and TiVo historically have engaged in aggressive patent litigation. Rovi had sued Netflix alleging it infringed five its its patents — but the streaming provider won a victory in the case last year after a U.S. federal judge ruled the Rovi-owned patents at issue were invalid . \nThe litigation between Netflix and Rovi is now all water under the bridge. Under a separate agreement announced Monday, Netflix has acquired a license to TiVo’s patent portfolios as well as a license to the portfolio for over-the-top services from patent holding company Intellectual Ventures. Rovi formed a partnership with Intellectual Ventures earlier this year to pool their OTT-related patents. \nTiVo and Rovi together have over 6,000 issued patents and pending applications worldwide, including patents covering DVR and interactive program guide functions. \n“The partnership between Netflix and TiVo dates back to our early days of streaming video,” Bill Holmes, Netflix global head of business development, said in a statement. “Building on this history, the agreements provide consumers freedom to watch their favorite TV shows and movies whenever and wherever, with an integrated experience across more devices.” Filed Under:",

      "text": "MORE >> \nWhen Netflix first announced it was officially bringing Gilmore Girls back to the small screen, fans thought they would finally get the answer to the question that’s been bugging them for years: who does Rory Gilmore find herself with in the end? \nThis is why fans were so shocked to find out that Rory didn’t end up with Dean, Jess, or Logan. Instead, she was in a long-term relationship with the (unfortunately) forgettable Paul. But things aren’t as cut and dried as they seem; while they weren’t officially together, Rory and Logan were still acting like a couple every time Rory headed to London despite the fact that they were seeing other people. \nEven though it wasn’t the first time Rory was the “other woman” (no one can forget when she lost her virginity to Dean — while he was married!) the relationship still shocked fans and the cast, as it turns out. “It did surprise me,” Alexis Bledel , who plays Rory told Entertainment Tonight . “And I think it’s a little uncomfortable for [Rory], even though she’s kind of putting on a brave face that she’s fine with it.” 51 Photos » \n“I think she’s actually not that emotionally connected to it,” she continued. “I think she’s kind of just going through the motions at this point when we pick up with them.” \nBledel’s co-star Matt Czuchry agrees, pointing out that his character (Logan) and Rory weren’t ready to say goodbye to each other. “I think they were both in the same place at the same time,” he admitted. “Rory and Logan have always had a love for each other that has gone back and forth, and they’ve never really wanted to say goodbye. They’re both in the same place at the same time in this particular story, so it’s a mutual relationship that they’re carrying on.” \nOn a lighter note, Bledel stopped by The Tonight Show to talk about the show with newly-minted Gilmore Girls fan, host Jimmy Fallon . Fallon is currently watching the original show on Netflix and is only on season four, so he tried his best to avoid talking about A Year in the Life spoilers, instead, asking Bledel to name her favorite GG characters. \nWatch the video below to find out Bledel’s favorite Gilmore Girls characters.",

Welcome back, you guys. \nTheir mission? The dynamic trio have to “rank history's greatest inventions, heists and more” by investigating the weird and unusual found in science, history and pop culture. The new series hails from the producers of the MythBusters , so if you loved that show (which I’m sure many of us did), the White Rabbit Project will definitely be your cup of scientific tea. Also, it looks like a whole lot of fun, but don’t just take my word for it, have a look at the first trailer below. \nHere’s the show’s official description: In White Rabbit Project, Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara head down the rabbit hole to investigate weird and wonderful events from pop culture, science and history. Under their microscope are topics as diverse as jailbreaks, superpower technology, heists and crazy World War II weapons. In each episode the hosts immerse themselves in experiments, builds and tests as they sleuth the truth behind these and other well-Googled themes. \nThe first full season of Netflix's White Rabbit Project will arrive on the streaming giant on Dec. 9.

      "title": "'Luke Cage' season 2 air date, plot spoilers: Claire Temple takes on a big role; Netflix superhero mashup starts here?",
      "text": "  \n(Facebook/MarvelsLukeCage) The first season of 'Marvel's Luke Cage' is available on Netflix. \nNetflix's own slice of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been racking up good reviews with the presentation of its originally produced superhero drama TV series like \"Daredevil,\" \"Jessica Jones,\" \"Luke Cage,\" and the upcoming \"Iron Fist,\" \"The Punisher\" and \"The Defenders.\" \nThe Mike Colter-starrer, for instance, was received well among the avid fans and casual viewers, too. It didn't really come as a big surprise that the web streaming service giant has green lighted a new season which, according to reports , will be the springboard for the upcoming superhero mashup series event, \"The Defenders.\" \nSpoiler alert for those who missed \"Luke Cage\" season 1, the show ended with a rather bitter note for the characters when Luke has to be taken back to Seagate Prison. It closed with Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) promising her man of steel-like boyfriend that she's asked the help of a lawyer friend. \nIt would be safe to assume that the attorney she's talking about is either Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) from \"Daredevil\" or Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) from the same show. Advertisement \nBanking on this idea, speculations are now indicating that the aforementioned major crossover would probably happen first here in \"Luke Cage\" season 2. \nGetting more clues from this slate of hints, it can also be said that the nurse will have a big role in this huge collaboration of heroes and vigilantes. It has to be noted that before Claire was seen in \"Luke Cage,\" she already appeared in \"Daredevil\" and \"Jessica Jones.\" \nTo pump up the hype, yet another publication said that the second installment of \"Luke Cage\" will also see the meeting of Luke and Danny Rand (Finn Jones) of \"Iron Fist.\" Both will reportedly be called Heroes for Hire. \nAlthough Netflix has yet to announce the official air date of \"Luke Cage\" season 2, this report said that the show could be expected to roll out after 2017.

      "text": "TiVo Corp (NASDAQ: TIVO ) announced after the close Monday that it had entered into a licensing agreement with Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ). The agreement covers product and IP licensing solutions. \nJPMorgan’s Sterling Auty maintains an Overweight rating on TiVo, with a price target of $34. The Netflix Contract \n“The licensing deal eliminates the ongoing legal battle between the companies over the ROVI patents,” Auty mentioned. \nThe analyst believes the agreement shows the combined strength of the TiVo and Rovi patent portfolio, which has “broader applicability.” \nTiVo is likely to be able to leverage the agreement with Netflix to work on signing OTT providers it has yet to sign. \n“The deal is a positive as it adds incremental revenue, although not huge at first, and eliminates the legal costs associated with Netflix litigation,” Auty went on to say. Details Of The Agreement \nUnder the product agreement, TiVo would continue to integrate Netflix into its set-top boxes, enabling consumers to benefit from “unified search and Netflix button on remote controls.” \nIn addition, a separate intellectual property agreement provides a license to Netflix to the TiVo and Rovi patent portfolios for the over-the-top (OTT) offerings. \nTiVo did not disclose any financial terms associated with the agreement, although the company reiterated its FY 2016 guidance. \nAt last check, Netflix was up 1.01 percent at $118.11, and TiVo was up 1.2 percent at $21. \nImage Credit: By Jared C.

      "text": "Former MythBusters Team Return For Netflix’s White Rabbit Project   Joseph Lee Tweet \nNetflix has released a trailer for White Rabbit Project , a new series featuring the M7 Build Team from Mythbusters (Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara). \nHere’s a synopsis: In the Netflix series, the three head down the rabbit hole to investigate weird and wonderful events from pop culture, science and history. Under their microscope are topics as diverse as jailbreaks, superpower technology, heists and crazy world war two weapons. In each episode the hosts immerse themselves in experiments, builds and tests as they sleuth the truth behind these and other well googled themes. \nThe three left the series in 2014, shortly before the show itself ended. The Science Channel will continue to air the show as Mythbusters: The Search , a reality show to find new hosts.",

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "Ever since Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life debuted on Netflix , longtime fans and newcomers to the franchise have been abuzz about Rory, Lorelai, and the whole town of Stars Hollow .\nSome of the series’ characters are more beloved than others, however, which Alexis Bledel revealed when she appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to talk about the Netflix revival with the late night funnyman.\nFallon, who recently started watching the show, revealed that he was upset with the pivotal plot twist in Rory Gilmore’s love life in the fourth season of the show, before also revealing that he was “Team Jess” — referring, of course, to Rory’s bad boy (and best) ex-boyfriend . He then told Bledel that besides Rory, his favorite characters on the show were Luke, Kirk, and Rory’s inimitable rival-turned-bestie Paris Geller. He then queried Bledel as to who her favorite characters were.\n“ I think Caesar is awesome,” she said referring to the long suffering cook at Luke’s Diner. “He’s underrated, he’s amazing.” \nBledel also revealed that she loves the double trouble duo of Rory’s neighbor Babette and Stars Hollow’s resident dance teacher Miss Patty. \n“They were on All in the Family together and every time they would come to set and sing show tunes, and it was such a raucous day on set every day they were there, so I have to appreciate them.” \nHer final favorite character? The town’s quirky everyman, Kirk.\nWatch the full interview in the clip above.\n",

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "\nEver since Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life debuted on Netflix , longtime fans and newcomers to the franchise have been abuzz about Rory, Lorelai, and the whole town of Stars Hollow .\nSome of the series’ characters are more beloved than others, however, which Alexis Bledel revealed when she appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to talk about the Netflix revival with the late night funnyman.\nFallon, who recently started watching the show, revealed that he was upset with the pivotal plot twist in Rory Gilmore’s love life in the fourth season of the show, before also revealing that he was “Team Jess” — referring, of course, to Rory’s bad boy (and best) ex-boyfriend . He then told Bledel that besides Rory, his favorite characters on the show were Luke, Kirk, and Rory’s inimitable rival-turned-bestie Paris Geller. He then queried Bledel as to who her favorite characters were.\n“ I think Caesar is awesome,” she said referring to the long suffering cook at Luke’s Diner. “He’s underrated, he’s amazing.” \nBledel also revealed that she loves the double trouble duo of Rory’s neighbor Babette and Stars Hollow’s resident dance teacher Miss Patty. \n“They were on All in the Family together and every time they would come to set and sing show tunes, and it was such a raucous day on set every day they were there, so I have to appreciate them.” \nHer final favorite character? The town’s quirky everyman, Kirk.\nWatch the full interview in the clip above.\n",

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival  33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival   11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival Tuesday Nov 29, 2016 at 11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nIf you were a fan of Discovery Channel’s pro-science show MythBusters over the course of its 280-some episodes and 8 Primetime Emmy nominations, you’ll recognize the stars of the new Netflix Original Series, White Rabbit Project . The producers of the myth-busting forebear return for this new series that stars Kari Byron , Tory Belleci , and Grant Imahara . The first trailer for White Rabbit Project reunites the build team members who don’t seem to have missed a step in the transition to the new show. \nThat being said, there will be some differences in the layout of the upcoming series. No longer will there be a focus on any actual “myth-busting” but rather an exploration of history’s great inventions, cutting-edge technology, and some of the most improbable escapes and heists ever attempted. That’s not to say that Byron, Belleci, and Imahara won’t be subjecting themselves to the unpredictable and often dangerous chaos their job entails; far from it. As the first trailer reveals, they’re still up to their old tricks, just in a new setting. \nCheck out the first trailer for White Rabbit Project below: \nThe coolest tech. The weirdest weapons. The craziest escapes. Three science-loving sleuths put them under the microscope. \n\nKari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara rank history’s greatest inventions, heists and more in this series from the producers of “MythBusters.” \nLook for Season 1 of White Rabbit Project on Netflix starting December 9th.

Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. \nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "Tweet \nWelcome to the final preview for the Netflix UK releases coming in December 2016. Netflix UK is having a bumper month in December because it’s getting a slew of brand new movies and TV series and quite a few movies returning to just in time for Christmas. New Release Highlights New Movies \nAlthough we’re not going to be as lucky as the US who is getting   on Christmas Day, we are going to be getting Iron Man 3 which is the most recent solo outing for Iron Man. It’s a good movie, probably not as good as the first two but it’s better than nothing. We’re seeing Catching Fire return from The Hunger Games franchise to sit alongside the final movie currently streaming on Netflix. \nWe’re also seeing Ender’s Game return to Netflix which stars Harrison Ford. The sci-fi epic pits kids up against an alien species. New TV Series \nThis month we’ll be getting   much earlier than what we first predicted. The second season is set to brighten up your Christmas just a few months after the first season landed on Netflix. \nWe’ll continue getting new weekly episodes of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend as well as the coveted Shooter series which has been getting rave reviews. We’ll also see the debut of Syfy’s adaptation of Van Helsing which has also been getting good reviews.

      "text": "What's on Netflix > Coming Soon > Christmas Titles Coming to Netflix in December 2016 Christmas Titles Coming to Netflix in December 2016 Tweet \nA fair few Christmas titles are coming to Netflix throughout the month of December 2016, and we’re going to preview each one below. Naturally, don’t expect hundreds of new Christmas titles and you certainly shouldn’t expect massive Christmas movies such as Home Alone, National Lampoons Christmas Vacation or such. \nThis list does feature a lot of TV movies and Netflix exclusives which make Netflix the ideal home for your Christmas entertainment over the holidays. You can see the full list of what’s coming to Netflix in December 2016 on our preview page. Angels in the Snow (2015) \nDecember 1st \nClearly going for the Love Actually audience, this TV movie released at the tail end of last year to relatively mixed reviews. It tells the story of a family looking to get away from the struggles of life in a mountain cabin made by the father. Merry Kissmas (2015) \nDecember 1st \nThis TV movie also released last year, stars one person whose only wish is to find true love and with her current partner this isn’t the case. She then meets the perfect man and then has to choose between the perfect man and the perfect life. Uncle Nick (2015) \nDecember 1st \nThis movie stars comedian Brian Posehn who stars as the drunk Uncle Nick. The movie comes from Chris Kasick and is essentially another Bad Santa clone but not quite as good. You’ll recognise some of the other cast members here too and while critics hated the movie, it’s received some good reviews from Joe Public so you’ll need to make your own decision on this one. The Spirit of Christmas (2015) \nDecember 1st \nThis TV movie that first premiered on The Hallmark Channel will make most rom-com fans very pleased to have a Netflix subscription over the holidays. It tells the story of a girl searching for a promotion when selling a property only to find out that it’s being haunted by a ghost and a ghost she just so happens to fall in love with. Fuller House (Season 2) \nDecember 9th \n  while not a full Christmas series was considered be to enough of one to warrant pushing forward the release date. The first season released in February 2016 and season 2 looks to continue the story of the Tanner girls who have moved back into their childhood home after hard times hit. \nWe’re expecting a thanksgiving and Christmas episode at the very least in season 2 and to be fair, Fuller House is a perfect cosy binge-watch. Ricardo O’Farrill: Christmas Special (2016) \nDecember 12th \nThere’s plenty of new stand-up comedy coming in December 2016 but Ricardo O’Farrill has specifically called his special a Christmas special, hence being on this list. This is a Spanish speaking title so you’ll need to brush up before diving in. Marvel’s   (2016) \nDecember 25th \nAlthough you wouldn’t consider   as a Christmas Movie, that’s now been changed given its release date on Netflix. The latest Marvel movie comes to Netflix as part of the new Disney deal where new theatrical releases come to Netflix just months after their initial releases. \nThis is by far the biggest Marvel movie to date featuring a massive amount of heroes that we’ve come to know over the past few years and it all ends with perhaps one of the biggest hero battles of all time. It’s glorious and can be watched on Christmas day on Netflix. Also on What's on Netflix Subscribe to our newsletter",
