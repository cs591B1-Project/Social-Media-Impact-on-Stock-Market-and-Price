Effective April 3, he will be appointed executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, design and developing Starbucks locations.\nSchultz is being replaced by former Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) senior exec Kevin Johnson, who will become the new CEO.\nIn a statement, Schultz said the move “ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.”\nSchultz famously returned to Starbucks in 2008 to help guide the coffee giant through the recession and restore growth at the company.",

This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2gruw5F",

      "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Is Stepping Down",
      "text": "Starbucks ‘ chief executive Howard Schultz will step down from his role in 2017, ending a successful tenure atop the coffee giant in which he steered it to become a strong performing global powerhouse.\nThe coffee chain on Thursday announced that effective April 3, Schultz would retain his role as executive chairman but would no longer serve as CEO so he could pivot his focus on “innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries around the world.” Schultz has been advocating a push into more premium coffees as a way for Starbucks sbux to compete and establish its brand with a stronger footing for the future. He’s sought to explore new concepts like the Starbucks Roastery in Seattle, a massive retail location that has a cafe and tasting room and helped kick off the company’s bigger bet on a more premium retail and coffee experience.\nSchultz will be succeeded internally by Kevin Johnson, who served as president and chief operating officer and is a seven-year member of the Starbucks board.\n“As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson-our current president, COO, a seven-year board member, and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years-has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer,” Schultz said in a statement. “This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.”\n \nThe news caught investors off guard. Shares were down a little over 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday.\nBu Schultz leaves Starbucks on firm ground after his second successful run as CEO. He previously ran the company from 1987 to 2000, but returned in 2008 after Starbucks fired former CEO Jim Donald. Under Donald, the brand found itself out of favor with consumers and shuttered stores as it faced slow growth in the U.S. during the financial crisis.\nSince then, Schultz has had immense success turning around the company. Annual net revenue climbed from $10.4 billion in 2008 to $21.3 billion in the most recent fiscal year. The company has over 25,000 stores today, an almost even mix of company-operated and licensed locations. Back in 2008, it had close to 1,700 locations.\nWith that pace of expansion and sales growth, Starbucks has been a success story at a time when many big restaurant concepts have faced persistent sales and traffic challenges. This summer, for example, shares dipped after Starbucks posted U.S. comparable-store sales growth that was under 5% for the first time after 25 straight quarters of increases above that pace. That exemplifies the high bar that Wall Street investors had set for Starbucks that most other chains of similar size haven’t been expected to achieve.\nNew CEO Johnson has been integral to that success as well. He’s led the company's global operating businesses across all regions and has helped steer marketing and investments in tech.\n“Over the past two decades, I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team,” Johnson said in a statement. ” Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard's commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future.”",

      "text": "If you find it easier to work in the din of Starbucks or a bar than around your chattering colleagues in an open office, you’re not alone.\nConversation and music is more distracting than meaningless noise, and leads to a greater decline in work performance, according to a new study from a Japanese sound engineer.\nOpen offices are beloved by tech startups and other creative types, and were given a boost by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who left his private office to sit amidst his lieutenants at City Hall. But there has been a sustained backlash from workers who complain about a lack of privacy and there’s evidence that employees in open office are more likely to miss work due to illness than their enclosed counterparts. Now open-office dissidents can add overheard noise to their list of grievances.\nIn the study, from Takahiro Tamesue of the University of Yamaguchi, research subjects tried to complete tasks on computers, like counting the number of times an image flashed, while listening to both unintelligible noise and human speech. The subjects were also asked to rate the noises on how annoying they found them.\nThe more meaningful noises, like conversations, were the most annoying, and proved to be the most distracting, Tamesue concluded.\nSound proofing open offices often isn’t practical, so it may be necessary to figure out a way to mask meaningful noises, Tamesue said in a press release that accompanied his study. Or maybe companies should just go back to giving their employees offices if they want work to get done.",

      "title": "Starbucks Chief Howard Schultz to Step Down Next Year",
      "text": " count=\"292\" data-total-count=\"292\">SEATTLE — Howard Schultz , the leader of Starbucks , said on Thursday he would step down as chief executive next year, handing over to his personally selected successor the management of the company he built into the world’s largest coffee business, with over 25,000 stores in 75 countries. Mr. Schultz, one of the most visible chief executives in the country, has made Starbucks a vocal part of the national conversation on issues like gun violence, gay rights, race relations, veterans rights and student debt. The handover will take place on April 3, and he will remain at the company as executive chairman.\nMr. Schultz, 63, will be succeeded by his close friend Kevin Johnson, the company’s current president and a longtime Starbucks board member.\n“This is a big day for me,” Mr. Schultz said in an interview. “I love the company as much as I love my family.”\n But he said he decided it was the right time to hand the keys to Mr. Johnson, whom he described as being “better equipped” to “run the company than I am,” ticking off a list of Mr. Johnson’s operational talents, saying that he wanted to “relinquish the role and responsibility to the right person.”\nThe move is likely to ignite renewed speculation about whether Mr. Schultz is paving the way to leave the company entirely to enter politics. His outspoken positions on social issues have led many people, including his closest friends, to say he may run for president. He has spent an increasing amount of time traveling around the country speaking publicly about the need to fix the “dysfunction in Washington.” He has a close relationship with President Obama and had been a supporter of Hillary Clinton.\nDealBook 2016: Playing on the Global Stage Video by The New York Times Conferences Mr. Schultz will continue to lead the Starbucks’ efforts on social issues as well as the development of its effort to develop a superpremium line of coffee and coffee stores. The latter has been a passion project for Mr. Schultz that he hopes will “shine a halo on the entire company.”\nMr. Johnson, 56, spent his career in technology as a lieutenant of Steven A. Ballmer, the former chief executive of Microsoft, and later as chief executive of Juniper Networks, before being recruited out of retirement by Mr. Schultz in 2015 to become president and chief operating officer of Starbucks.\nAlthough the change may come as a surprise to the public and some Starbucks employees, the company has been sending to signals to Wall Street for the last year about its intentions to carry out a the succession plan, announcing a reorganization in the summer that gave Mr. Johnson oversight of the day-to-day operations.\nMr. Johnson, a soft-spoken operator known for his focus on building Starbucks’ mobile payments systems and on executing the company’s global strategy, has been on a listening tour with employees over the last year to better appreciate the company’s culture. Conversations with store managers who told intimate stories about their passion and relationship with the company have been known to bring Mr. Johnson to tears.\nThe succession plan is the second time Mr. Schultz has sought to step back from overseeing the company. He became the company’s chairman in 2000 but returned as chief executive in 2008 after firing the installed chief, James Donald, as sales faltered. During his period as chairman, he had pursued other activities including buying the professional basketball team the Seattle SuperSonics, which he later sold to an Oklahoma City investment group. Upon returning to Starbucks as chief executive, Mr. Schultz increased the company’s market value to $84 billion from $15 billion.\nJournalism that matters.\nMore essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times In an interview on Thursday in a tasting room at Starbucks flagship Reserve Roastery in downtown Seattle, a Willy Wonka-like 15,000-square-foot premium coffee emporium that the company hopes to open in large cities around the world, Mr. Schultz was animated and emotional about his decision.\nMr. Schultz and Mr. Johnson met in the early 2000s when Mr. Schultz worked with Microsoft to help deploy wireless internet in Starbucks stores. They became close friends, and Mr. Johnson became a sounding board for Mr. Schultz. Mr. Johnson joined the Starbucks board in 2009.\n Mr. Schultz said that unlike his previous effort to step back, “I was not as emotionally prepared for the moment as I am now. I don’t think I had the conviction — I was still meddling.”\n“I got succession wrong the first time,” he added. He said of Mr. Johnson, “I’m not going to be hovering and shadowing him.”\nStill, Mr. Schultz says he intends to remain a visible and active presence at the company — his office is connected to Mr. Johnson’s — as he works to introduce the company’s premium coffee brand with a small team inside that he described as the equivalent of a start-up.\nThe project calls for the opening of several large emporium stores — one is being built in Manhattan and another in Shanghai — each year for the next several years, as well more than 1,000 smaller premium stores and premium “bars” in thousands of current Starbucks stores. “Building a new brand is not unlike what Ralph Lauren did with Purple label,” Mr. Schultz said.\nHe is also planning to remain the voice of Starbucks’ social impact efforts, like when he asked his employees to write “Come Together” on cups during the government shutdown in 2011 or his decision to offer full- and part-time employees tuition for a college education.\nSome of those efforts have been widely criticized. A plan to write “Race Together” on cups to spur a conversation about race relations, for example, backfired.\nStill, Mr. Schultz said he intends for the company to “maintain our moral courage.”\nAs for whether Mr. Schultz is laying the groundwork to run for president, he said, “I’m all in on all things Starbucks and have no plans to run for public office.” Asked whether he might change his mind in the future, he said, “That’s the way I feel today.”\nContinue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

      "text": "By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch December 1, 2016, 4:41 PM Longtime Starbucks chief Howard Schultz to step down as CEO Stumble \nStarbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz -- the expansion-minded Seattle espresso fanatic who turned a local coffee house into a global brand with 25,000 stores and $21 billion in sales -- announced Tuesday he will be stepping down as chief executive in the spring. In 2006, the Starbuck's CEO told 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley of his humble beginnings. Today, he announces plans to offer college degrees to employe... \nSchultz, 63, will be replaced as CEO by Kevin Johnson, the current president and chief operating officer, the company said in a statement, adding that Schultz will remain chairman of the Starbucks board. \nJohnson will take over as barista-in-chief next April. He’ll certainly have his work cut out for him. Starbucks, once one of the fastest-growing and most profitable companies in U.S. history, faces significant challenges to deliver the kind of growth investors have been used to from the company. \nShares of the Seattle-based company fell 3.3 percent to $56.57 in after-hours trading after the news was released. \nThis is a developing story. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board. \n“Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination. The best evidence of the success of the core strategy driving our business is that we continue to deliver quarter after quarter of record, industry leading revenue, comp sales and profit growth, and that the newest classes of Starbucks stores continue to deliver record-breaking revenues, AUV’s and ROI — both in the U.S. and around the world,” said Schultz. “As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson — our current president, coo, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years — has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nAs president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses across all geographies as well as the core support functions of Starbucks supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms.

Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future,\" said Johnson. “It is an honor for me to serve the more than 300,000 partners who proudly wear the green apron and I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team. Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.” \nJohnson's career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks. At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

      "text": "Starbucks CEO Schultz to Step Down, COO Johnson Named New Chief (SBUX) By Ben Curry | December 1, 2016 — 4:00 PM EST \nLong-serving Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX ) Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz has announced his intent to step down from his position as corporate chief. Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer, will assume the role of chief executive officer, effective April 3, 2017. Schultz will remain as executive chairman. \nShares of SBUX spiked down 4 percent in the post-market session immediately following the announcement, although the shares have rapidly bounced back and SBUX is only off ~2 percent as of writing. FindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSchultz first joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing when the company only had four stores, and departed in the mid-1980s to start his own coffee store concept. He acquired the Starbucks name in 1988, led the company through its IPO in 1992 and its massive expansion throughout the U.S. and the world over the next 25 years. Besides his role as chairman, Schultz will focus on the further development of the chain’s high-end store concepts worldwide. (See also: Starbucks Hikes Prices Again .) \nAs president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses, and led operations concerning supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Board. \nJohnson's career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks Inc. ( JNPR ). At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

      "text": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz stepping down from top job at coffee chain Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz stepping down THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz speaks during Starbucks annual shareholders meeting March 18, 2015 in Seattle, Washington. (Stephen Brashear) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Updated:  43 PM \nStarbucks says CEO Howard Schultz, who transformed the chain into a global coffee brand, is stepping down from that role at the coffee chain that he joined more than 30 years ago. \nThe Seattle-based company announced Thursday that Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will become chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, currently chairman and CEO, will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. Schultz, 63, is credited with turning around the coffee chain's fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the company's popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nThe company's sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they've slowed more recently. \nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6% to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. \nHe joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and has spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.

      "text": "Howard Schultz is stepping down from his role as chairman and CEO of the coffee-shop chain Starbucks. But he won’t be leaving—Schultz will be developing a higher-end chain of shops for the company.\nThe coffee chain announced that Schultz will remain at the company as an executive chairman after he leaves his post next year. Current president and chief operating officer Kevin Johnson will take up the position, effective April 3, 2017.\nSchultz, in his new role, will focus on building out an upscale chain of coffeehouses called Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, and expanding the line’s retail presence around the world. The company had been experimenting with different global retail formats, under Schultz’s leadership. Earlier this year, it moved into the birthplace of espresso —opening its first coffee shop in Milan.\nSchultz previously left the company in 2000 , after growing it from a local coffee chain in Seattle into an $80 billion global powerhouse. He returned eight years later, in the midst of a global recession that he said had left the company in worse shape than he had anticipated.\nStarbucks’ stock was trading as low as $3.92 a share in November 2008, and is now at around $58 a share. It fell almost 4% in after-hours trading on the news of Schultz’s resignation.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Howard Schultz, the visionary leader of Starbucks, will be stepping down next year as CEO of the iconic coffee giant.\nSchultz’s surprise decision to step aside as the leader of Starbucks sent the stock sinking 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday.\nStarbucks said Schultz isn’t going away completely. Effective April 3, he will become executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, the design of Starbucks locations and the company’s social impact initiatives. Current chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a tech industry veteran, will replace Schultz as CEO.\n“This is a good thing. I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz told CNN’s Poppy Harlow by phone on Thursday.\nEven though Schultz hadn’t telegraphed the move, the CEO said he had been planning the move for at least a year.\nAsked if he’s going to Washington, Schultz laughed and said, “No, I’m not going to Washington.”\nInstead, Schultz emphasized a desire to focus on the company’s social impact initiatives.\n“Given the state of things in the country, there is a need to help those left behind,” Schultz told CNN.\nSeparately, in a conference call, Schultz said Johnson brings “unparalleled understanding of market dynamics” and he deserves a “tremendous amount of credit” for the company’s recent record results.\nSchultz joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of retail operations and he helped turn the company into a retail powerhouse and an iconic American brand. He stepped down as CEO in April 2000 to concentrate on executing the company’s global strategy.\nBut Starbucks struggled without him at the helm and seemed to have lost its way. Schultz returned as CEO in 2008 and helped guide the coffee giant through the Great Recession and get it back on track. Today, Starbucks is valued at $84 billion and it has more than 24,000 retail stores in 70 countries.",

      "text": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation Updated: 3:41 p.m. By The Associated Press Updated: 3:41 p.m. 0 \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks says CEO Howard Schultz, who transformed the chain into a global coffee brand, is stepping down from that role at the coffee chain that he joined more than 30 years ago. \nThe Seattle-based company announced Thursday that Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will become chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, currently chairman and CEO, will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. Schultz, 63, is credited with turning around the coffee chain's fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the company's popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nThe company's sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they've slowed more recently. \nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and has spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.",

This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future,\" Schultz said in a news release. (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...",

      "text": "Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down from the coffee giant’s top spot, making way for COO Kevin Johnson.\nSchultz will continue to be involved with the company as executive chairman and chairman of the board. According to the company’s statement Thursday, Schultz will shift his focus to innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve Roasteries around the world, expansion of the Starbucks Reserve retail store format and the company’s social impact initiatives. In this new role Schultz will continue to serve as chairman of the Board.\nCEO of Starbucks Howard Schultz plans on creating a new brand of stores called Starbucks Reserve-Only The new stores will offer premium small lot reserve coffee in more of a cafe environment than the current Starbucks stores The new Reserve-only stores will be about twice as large as current Starbucks stores The new cafes will be in hundreds of locations and they'll start popping up next year\nMedia: Wibbitz “Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination,” Schultz said in a statement.\n“As I focus on Starbucks next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson – our current president, COO, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years – has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer,” he continued. “This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.”\n As president and chief operating officer since March 2015, Johnson has led the company’s global operating businesses across the world. Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009, and will continue to serve as a member of the Board.\n\"I have grown to know Starbucks first as a customer, then as a director on the board, and for the past two years as a member of the management team,” Johnson said in a statement. “Through that journey, I fell in love with Starbucks and I share Howard’s commitment to our mission and values and his optimism for the future.”\nJohnson's career spans 33 years in the technology industry which included a 16-year career at Microsoft and a five-year tour as CEO of Juniper Networks. At Microsoft, he led worldwide sales and marketing and became the president of the Platforms Division. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee where he served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and the management team in 2015.\nThe first Starbucks opened in Seattle on March 31, 1971. It was located at 2000 Western Avenue from 1971–1976 and later moved to the infamous 1912 Pike Place location.\nSchultz joined the company in 1982 as the Director of Marketing. He lead the company's first successful retail pilot store, but left in 1985 after founders Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker refused to roll-out stores company-wide. In 1989, the founders sold the Starbucks retail unit back to Schultz so they could focus on another company, Peet's Coffee & Tea.\nSchultz was also the the former owner of the Seattle SuperSonics. Schultz's ownership of the team was often criticized, and was marked by feuds with one of the team's star players, Gary Payton. Schultz enraged many sports fans when he announced the sale of the team in 2006 to Clay Bennett, chairman of the Professional Basketball Club LLC. Bennett moved the team to Oklahoma City, and where it became known as the Thunder for the 2008–09 NBA season.\nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "text": "By The Associated Press December 1, 2016 4:42 pm Share \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks says CEO Howard Schultz, who transformed the chain into a global coffee brand, is stepping down from that role at the coffee chain that he joined more than 30 years ago. \nThe Seattle-based company announced Thursday that Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will become chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, currently chairman and CEO, will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. Schultz, 63, is credited with turning around the coffee chain’s fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the company’s popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nThe company’s sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they’ve slowed more recently. Advertisement \nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and has spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. Topics: ",

Share story Seattle Times staff The Associated Press \nStarbucks could be in for a new coffee cup-related brouhaha after mislabeling a landmark on an Oregon-themed travel mug. \nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the Seattle-based coffee chain has introduced a travel mug bearing sketches of notable Oregon landmarks, including Crater Lake National Park, food carts in Portland and Ashland’s Shakespeare Festival. \nBut there was also a waterfall design identified as “Klamath Falls” — and no such waterfall exists. \nThe simple line drawing of a falls topped by an arched bridge was likely meant to depict the majestic Multnomah Falls, a popular spot in the Columbia River Gorge.

Schultz, 63, has overseen the expansion of the company's popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nSpeaking on a conference call, Johnson called Schultz one of the world's \"most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.\" \nThe company's sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they've slowed more recently. \nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In his message to employees Thursday, he said he planned to extend his \"focus on our social impact agenda.\" \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations.

Schultz, 63, has overseen the expansion of the company's popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nSpeaking on a conference call, Johnson called Schultz one of the world's \"most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.\" \nThe company's sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they've slowed more recently. \nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In his message to employees Thursday, he said he planned to extend his \"focus on our social impact agenda.\" \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and has spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.  ",

      "text": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation 4:32 p.m. 4:32 p.m. 0 \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nThe company has credited the rewards program and app for helping its strong sales growth in the U.S., although expansion has slowed more recently. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in the leadership team. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nOver the years, Schultz has also said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nSchultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009.",

      "text": "Photo: Ted S. Warren, STF Starbucks CEO Schultz to step down, focus on innovation 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nNEW YORK — Starbucks says CEO Howard Schultz , who transformed the chain into a global coffee brand, is stepping down from that role at the chain that he joined more than 30 years ago. \nThe Seattle-based company announced Thursday that Kevin Johnson , who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will become chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, currently chairman and CEO, will become executive chairman to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. \nIn a message to Starbucks employees, Schultz spoke of his \"enduring love\" for the company and called himself \"incredibly excited\" to work on projects such as the expansion of premium Starbucks Roasteries around the world. \nHe is credited with turning around the coffee chain's fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. Schultz, 63, has overseen the expansion of the company's popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nSpeaking on a conference call, Johnson called Schultz one of the world's \"most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.\" FindTheCompany | Graphiq \nThe company's sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they've slowed more recently. \nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In his message to employees Thursday, he said he planned to extend his \"focus on our social impact agenda.\" \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and has spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.",

More >> More >> \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks says CEO Howard Schultz, who transformed the chain into a global coffee brand, is stepping down from that role at the chain that he joined more than 30 years ago. \nThe Seattle-based company announced Thursday that Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will become chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, currently chairman and CEO, will become executive chairman to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. \nIn a message to Starbucks employees, Schultz spoke of his \"enduring love\" for the company and called himself \"incredibly excited\" to work on projects such as the expansion of premium Starbucks Roasteries around the world. \nHe is credited with turning around the coffee chain's fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. Schultz, 63, has overseen the expansion of the company's popular loyalty program and mobile app and worked to expand food and beverage offerings. \nSpeaking on a conference call, Johnson called Schultz one of the world's \"most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs.\" \nThe company's sales have grown impressively in the U.S., although they've slowed more recently. \nDuring an interview with CNN in September, Schultz publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In his message to employees Thursday, he said he planned to extend his \"focus on our social impact agenda.\" \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and has spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Enlarge this image Howard Schultz, who is stepping down as CEO of Starbucks, speaks at the coffee company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle in March. Ted S. Warren/AP   Ted S. Warren/AP Howard Schultz, who is stepping down as CEO of Starbucks, speaks at the coffee company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle in March.\nTed S. Warren/AP Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nAuthor Interviews Starbucks CEO: Can You 'Get Big And Stay Small'? Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\n  \"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks announced the change, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nSchultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson, who joined the Starbucks board in 2009.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.",

      "text": "Shares of Starbucks Corp. fell in the extended session Thursday after Howard Schultz said he was stepping down, yet again, as the chief executive of the coffee retailer.\nStarbucks SBUX, +0.93% shares, which at one point dropped as much as 11% after the news broke, declined 3.3% to $56.58 in after-hours trading. The company said Kevin Johnson, the current president and chief operating officer, will take the CEO reins on April 3.\nThursday’s after-hours Starbucks action. Thursday’s drop carries with it a sense of foreboding, as this isn’t the first time Schultz has stepped down as CEO. Back on April 6, 2000, Starbucks announced that Schultz was stepping down after a 13-year run to focus on the company’s global strategy.\nFollowing that announcement, Starbucks shares shed 28% over the next seven weeks before staging a steady recovery that fell apart in the Great Recession.\nSchultz returned to Starbucks as CEO on Jan. 8, 2008, as a result of challenges facing the company during the financial crisis. Shares hit a post-Schultz high of $19.82 (accounting for splits) by May 5, 2006, a run-up of 460% following his departure, but they were trading at less than half that about 18 months later.\nStarbucks stock during the last period Howard Schultz was not CEO. “In 2007-2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies, especially consumer brands, and Starbucks was not immune,” Schultz said on a conference call. “The management team at that time, all good people, did not have the experience needed to navigate through that period.”\nSchultz, who will still act as chairman, said he would be focusing on growing out Starbucks’s premier Roastery stores and Reserves stores, which are meant to challenge high-end coffee chains like Blue Bottle Coffee Co. There is currently one Roastery store in Seattle, where the company custom-roasts small batches of coffee from all over the world. Schultz said he plans to open six more Roastery stores by 2019, with an eye on 20 world-wide.\nMore from MarketWatch McDonald's Big Mac: A Short History Trump just unleashed the stock market’s ‘animal spirits’ How Jill Stein's Election Recount Efforts Could Play Out",

      "title": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation",
      "text": "Dec 1, 6:34 PM EST Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation By CANDICE CHOI and MICHAEL SISAK Associated Press AP Photo/Ted S. Warren NEW YORK (AP) -- Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Since returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Investor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. During a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. Schultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. In a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. Over the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings - a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. Johnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.",

      "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz stepping down",
      "text": "Howard Schultz, who helped turn Starbucks into an iconic global brand as well known for its activism as its coffee blends, will step down from the role of CEO in April. Schultz will become the company’s executive chairman, concentrating on ramping up Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, a new premium experience that the company is betting on to boost growth worldwide, as well as the company’s well-known forays into community activism. Kevin Johnson, the company’s current president and COO will become the CEO, retaining the title of president.\n“In all my years at Starbucks I have never been more energized or exhilarated about the opportunities that lie ahead,’’ Schultz said in a conference call Thursday afternoon. “I’m not leaving the company. I’m here every single day, and I’m going to contribute to what I consider a significant growth opportunity. ... But Kevin and the team are in charge.’’\nIt’s the second time since Schultz bought the Starbucks Coffee Company in the late 1980s that he has stepped down from the role of CEO. He resigned in 2000, only to return to the helm eight years later.\nBut “ the differences between then and now couldn’t be greater,’’ he said, noting that when he returned to the top job in 2008, Starbucks and other companies were riding out the dramatic financial downturn that was the Great Recession. \"The management team at that time ... just did not have the capability or experience to really navigate through that difficult period.\" In recent years, he says, the company has assembled “the strongest leadership team in our history.\"\nJohnson, who began his career as a systems engineer for IBM, joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and began working at the company in 2015. He previously spent 16 years at Microsoft working on global sales and marketing, then five years in Silicon Valley as CEO of Juniper Networks, a Sunnyvale, Calf.-company that develops networking products.\nIt is Johnson’s deep background in technology that Schultz said will be pivotal for Starbucks’ future growth. Technology can be used to bolster the customer experience, while Schultz focuses on the more premium offerings that will make a visit to Starbucks stand out from other eateries or retailers.\n\"We’ll be opening globally in years to come roasteries, reserve stores and reserve bars that will be customer destination venues,’’ Schultz says. By the end of 2019, the company plans to have unveiled more than 20 roasteries, and it plans to open more than 1,000 reserve stores, a new premium coffee space that will highlight new brewing techniques, and artisanal food offerings. Schultz said that those locations are expected to \"deliver twice the unit economics of a typical Starbucks store.''\nSchultz, who will continue to be chairman of the board, will also continue to spearhead the social causes that have sometimes made him and Starbucks a lightning rod. In 2013 he asked customers not bring firearms into stores. And in 2015, as the nation was grappling with a wave of police shootings of unarmed black men and boys, Starbucks employees were told to write “Race Together” on cups, with the company saying that it wanted to help spark a discussion about race.\n“We want to use our scale for good,’’ Schultz said, noting a few of its many initiatives, including hiring over 10,000 veterans and their spouses, and making a dent in the youth unemployment rate by giving thousands fo young people. \"We think companies need to do more for the people they serve and the people they employ.’’\nJohnson acknowledged that Schultz is a major act to follow. \"Howard is among the world’s most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs,’’ Johnson said. But, the company's leaders work \"well together and have built a foundation of trust, transparency and teamwork.’’\nContributing: Elizabeth Weise",

      "title": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz will resign from position for second time | Business",
      "text": "Howard Schultz will step down as Starbucks chief executive – again.\nIn April, the company said on Thursday, Schultz will become “executive chairman”, and the Kevin Johnson, chief operating officer, will step up to replace him. \nShares of the coffee retailer’s stock took a sharp dive on the news in after-hours trading, dropping 3.3% to $56.78.\nSchultz, who will remain chairman of the board, will devote time to furthering a “social impact agenda”, he said in a call with investors. His duties will also include developing new technologies for Starbucks stores, like the company’s recent foray into carbonated “nitro” cold brew.\nIn 2000, Schultz left the CEO position after running the company since 1987; in early 2008 he returned to steer it through the financial crisis after the company lost half its value on the stock market over the course of a single year. \nThe coffeehouse chain’s current situation is different from its position eight years ago, Schultz said, because the 2016 management team was better-suited to the challenges of the market than 2008’s senior staff had been.\n\nThe move is not entirely a surprise. Schultz stepped down from a seat in the board he will now chair in 2013, and rumors about his political aspirations have circulated for some time. A spokeswoman for the company dismissed them.\n“Howard has long said that we need to stop looking to Washington DC for wisdom and inspiration, and instead look for it in our cities and towns, in businesses and community organizations, and in one another,” she told the Guardian. Schultz “has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company”, she said. \nIn his new position, Schultz will shift focus to “retail innovation”, the company said in a press release . Schultz said that he was “delighted” Johnson would take over his duties and said he would focus on finding “the balance between profit and conscience” with the company’s veteran-hiring programs and its anti-poverty programs. \n“I think we can all agree, Republican or Democrat, that there’s a lot of people being left behind and that companies can do more for the communities they serve and for the people they employ,” Schultz told investors.\nSchultz has been a very public CEO. The coffee executive had been vocally political during the 2016 election season, telling CNN’s Poppy Harlow, “I think it’s obvious that Hillary Clinton needs to be our next president” in September. \nThe company overwhelmingly contributed money to the Clinton campaign – nearly $65,000 to Trump’s $1,400 in contributions.\nSchultz wrote a downbeat memo to staff when Trump won the election: “[L]ike so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned,” he wrote. “We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world,” Schultz wrote, though he said he was “hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division” of the season.\nOn the conference call, Schultz was more upbeat: “These are exciting times for us all,” he said.",

      "title": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation",
      "text": "NEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.”\n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks announced the change, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nSchultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson, who joined the Starbucks board in 2009.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\n ",

      "text": "Howard Schultz will be stepping down as chief executive officer of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ). Kevin Johnson will takeover CEO duties on April 3, 2017.\nThe stock is down about 4 percent at $56.30 in the after-hours session.\nTheStreet's Brian Sozzi wrote in July , \"Schultz's first signal to Wall Street of a succession plan arguably came in 2014, when he established the new position of chief operating officer. Given Johnson's expanded responsibilities, it looks like the CEO job is his to lose.\"\nSchultz actually stepped down as Starbucks CEO from 2000-2008. Schultz became Fortune magazine's \"2011 Businessperson of the Year\" for his initiatives in the economy and job market.\nSince his return in 2008, the stock has grown from $9 per share to $60 per share. The stock is down about 6 percent over the past year.\nSchultz will remain chair of the company.\n ",

      "text": "Rep. Keith Ellison, frontrunner for DNC chair, is still being plagued by his past associations with anti-Semitism 3:07 p.m. ET \nTen years after he renounced his ties to the Nation of Islam, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) is still grappling with the implications of his past involvement with the African-American political movement. Since Ellison, the first Muslim to be elected to Congress, announced his plan to run for chair of the Democratic National Committee, he has been confronted once again with columns he wrote and statements he made in the 1990s. \nOn Thursday, a CNN KFile review unearthed Ellison's \"decade-long involvement in the Nation of Islam and his repeated defense of ... radical black leaders against accusations of anti-Semitism.\" CNN did note that no evidence was found that suggested Ellison made \"any anti-Semitic comments himself,\" though he has admitted he was \"slow to judge those who did.\" \nIn a 1995 op-ed, Ellison called Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, a \"role model for black youth\" and maintained — contrary to evidence otherwise — that Farrakhan was \"not an anti-Semite.\" CNN also reported that as recently as 2000, Ellison \"appeared at a fundraiser ... for domestic terrorist Sara Jane Olson,\" a member of the group that kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst and who was connected to a killing and the bombing of two police cars. \nWhile discussing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East in 2010, Ellison questioned whether it was logical or \"right\" that American policy \"is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people,\" referring to Israel. A statement released Thursday by the Anti-Defamation League called these remarks \"both deeply disturbing and disqualifying.\" \"His words raise the specter of age-old stereotypes about Jewish control of our government, a poisonous myth that may persist in parts of the world where intolerance thrives, but that has no place in open societies like the U.S.,\" the ADL's statement reads. You can read the full statement below. Becca Stanek ADL out with a statement saying Ellison remarks on Israel are \"disqualifying\" pic.twitter.com/AUFEpzPnfC",

      "title": "Starbucks CEO Stepping Down To Focus On High-End Coffee Shops",
      "text": "View this image ›\nAP/Kin Cheung\nID: 10091936 Howard Schultz, the CEO who led Starbucks as it transformed the global coffee business, is stepping down from the top job at the company.\nBut he’s not leaving the coffee giant, which runs more than 25,000 cafes in 75 countries — Schultz will remain as chairman of its board, and will focus on the company’s rollout of high-end coffee shops and retail stores, according to a statement released Thursday.\nSchultz, 63, first took over the Starbucks brand as CEO in 1987 and ran the company as it drove an explosion of espresso culture in the US and around the world. He first stepped down as CEO in 2000, returning to the top job in 2008 as the company’s share price tanked.\nThis time around, Schultz will be replaced as CEO by Starbucks’ current president and chief operating officer, Kevin Johnson, who will take over next April.\nSchultz said his new role at the company will focus on its Reserve brand of high-end cafes, and its Roastery retail stores. “I am personally as passionate about developing the Reserve brand, and opening more Roasteries, as I was about opening our first espresso bar more than 30 years ago in Seattle,” he said on a call with investors and reporters.\nThe move comes as Starbucks faces tight competition. The high end of the coffee market has been flooded with well-funded brands looking to eat away at Starbucks’s market share, while affordable competitors like McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts are putting more emphasis on the quality of their coffee. His new role will help fend off such competition, Schultz told the Wall Street Journal .\nStarbucks opened its flagship Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle in 2014, a 15,600 square-foot facility where beans are roasted and visitors can buy $12 cups of super-premium coffees. The company has plans to open 20 to 30 more large Reserve Roasteries and build up to 1,000 smaller stores with the Reserve brand.",

      "text": "A \nREUTERS: Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans. \nStarbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to US$56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008. \n\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior. \n\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below US$10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above US$60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations. \nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure. \n\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. \nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune. \nJohnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015. \nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp . \nOn a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\" \n\"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management. \n\"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's. \nTraffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales. \nThe company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics. \n\"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said. \n(Reporting by Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; additional writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Oatis) - Reuters",

Starbucks announced Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, that Schultz is stepping down from the coffee chain that he joined more than 30 years ago, and that Kevin Johnson will become chief executive as of April 3, 2017. Schultz will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) NEW YORK Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. Schultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. Since returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. Starbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. Investor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. During a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. Schultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. In a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. Over the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. In a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. Johnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo A man walks out of a Starbucks coffee shop in Seoul, South Korea, March 7, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\nBy Lisa Baertlein and Gayathree Ganesan\n(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive.\nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans.\nStarbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008.\n\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior.\n\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.\nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure.\n\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. \nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune. \nJohnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015. \nJohnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N) from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).\nOn a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\"\n\"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.\n\"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's.\nTraffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales.\nThe company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics. \n\"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n(Reporting by Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; additional writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Oatis)",

      "title": "Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation",
      "text": "By CANDICE CHOI and MICHAEL SISAK\nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\"\n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\"\n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.\nPrint Comment Recommend (-) Comments - of - Comments < Previous 10 Next 10 > Add a Comment Please login or register to comment.
