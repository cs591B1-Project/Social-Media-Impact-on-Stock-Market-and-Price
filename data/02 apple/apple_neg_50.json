      "text": "print A screenshot from a YouTube video shows a knockoff iPhone wall charger the user says he bought on eBay that exploded. Raymus Munt/YouTube \nIt should go without saying, but if you buy a spare charger for an Apple device, you should absolutely make sure it’s from a known, reputable company. \nYour latest reminder of this comes from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute , a UK consumer protection organization that teamed up with Illinois-based safety testers UL to examine 400 “counterfeit Apple chargers” from various suppliers. \nAccording to the study , all but three of the 400 counterfeit chargers failed a “basic” safety test, in which high voltages were applied to the chargers to see if they had enough isolation to protect against electric shocks. \nThe study comes just a few weeks after Apple reportedly conducted its own study on third-party power accessories, and found that roughly 90% of Apple chargers and cables sold through Amazon were unsafe. CNET and Bloomberg recently reported that Amazon is trying to take more concrete steps to prevent the sale of those knockoff devices. \nFlickr/unten44 Whatever the case, fake chargers are still more common than they should be today. The CTSI has a few simple tips for ensuring yours is safe — making sure it plugs in smoothly, that its pin size isn’t abnormally large or small, that it has the appropriate commission (FCC, CE, etc.) and manufacturing markings, that it has detailed safety warnings and instructions, and so on.\nThe simplest thing you can do, though, is to simply buy from a big name. Here’s a crude, but generally effective tip: If you don’t know them, they don’t own a website that looks professional, and you can’t find any stories about their background on Google, stay away. \nGetting chargers and cables directly from Apple is the easiest thing to do. Especially on the cable side, if you don’t want to pay the premium Apple often slaps on, look for accessories with Apple’s MFi (Made for iPhone/iPad/iPod) certification on its packaging. \nIf you get an iDevice Lightning cable or dock, you want its pins to look like this. Apple If you buy a device on Amazon, using a site like Fakespot to ensure its user reviews are legitimate can’t hurt, either. Apple has a set of tips on how to avoid counterfeit charging accessories on its site as well.\nAnecdotally, I’ve used chargers from Anker, Monoprice, and AmazonBasics for years without any issues. There are others, but the point is that, while it’s possible to get a reliable, speedy Apple charger without paying as much as Apple charges, you shouldn’t cheap out. There are real safety risks, for both you and the products you're charging. \n“Sadly, we suspect our work is just skimming the surface and we urge consumers to be vigilant when buying electrical products online: be wary of deals that look too good to be true and search for reviews of the seller before making your purchase,” said Lord Toby Harris, chair of the UK’s National Trading Standards, in a statement.

      "title": "Review: Bragi’s ‘The Headphone’, cord-free wireless earbuds worth considering before Apple’s MIA AirPods",
      "text": "Reddit They apparently didn’t get the message about not naming cord-free earbuds with a singular naming scheme, so this new product from Bragi is awkwardly named, “The Headphone.” But branding aside, these earbuds have made quite an improvement over the company’s first-generation product called “The Dash,” which was one of the first to hit the market a year ago. My biggest complaint when testing The Dash was half-baked fitness features, unnecessary built-in storage, and sloppy touch controls that cluttered what could have been an otherwise decent cord-free earbud experience. The Headphone fixes a lot of those issues (mostly by simply removing the problematic features), and what you end up with is a basic but less expensive cord-free earbud that actually works well enough for everyday use. They’re also one of the first cord-free earbuds worth considering before the launch of Apple’s delayed AirPods . Design | They have slimmed down just enough compared to The Dash to not feel or look too bulky in your ear. They don’t protrude from the ear much more than the average wired set of earbuds, and they were light and comfortable enough to wear for extended periods of time. In the process of scaling back features, they also lost two little sensors on the inside of the ear that made The Dash uncomfortable for my ears. They come with three ear tip sizes including a small and large silicon tips and medium Comply Foam tips that provide an even snugger fit and more isolated sound. The Headphone isn’t waterproof like The Dash, which the company is still selling as a premium version, and it also doesn’t have a companion iOS app or the ability to receive firmware updates down the road. The company says it’s sweatproof, however, and still suitable for workouts. There are three buttons on the right ear: + and – buttons to adjust volume up or down or skip to next and previous songs (with a double or triple press), and one main button to pause/play music and answer calls. The buttons are quite small and stiff, which means they require the tip of your nail to push in easily, but they are a welcomed improvement over the messy touch controls the company included on the previous generation product. You can also hold the volume up button to enable an audio transparency mode, which lets in outside sound so you can better hear your surroundings. Some prefer a headphone that doesn’t totally isolate and block outside noise, and others will find it handy to enable this feature in certain situations like when talking with others or, for example, cycling outdoors where you might want to be aware of your surroundings for safety reasons. I found the audio transparency to work well, but you can also use just one earpiece instead if that better suits your usage. If you take out the right ear, audio will automatically pause, while taking out the left ear pauses only the left side allowing you to use the right by itself. Pairing | Bluetooth pairing is the same old experience— no W1 chip here— but I didn’t have any issues with pairing to my iPhone 7 or Mac initially. Once paired for the first time, The Headphone automatically paired reliably for me afterwards, but will have the usual Bluetooth range limitations and start to drop out from time to time if you stray from your device. If you’re using multiple devices automatic pairing is less reliable; you’ll often have to manually disconnect and connect from your Mac or iPhone if you want to switch from one device to the other in the same room. Sound Quality | The sound quality on The Headphone(s) is really nothing to brag about, but it passes the test for the price point when comparing to other Bluetooth headphones and the competitors . They sound better than Apple’s EarPods, for example, but they are still a bit on the thin side and won’t blow you away. Sure, you can find better sounding Bluetooth earbuds with a wire, but the options for cord-free earbuds at this point are few and far between. They still don’t sound as rich and full as the Sol Republic Amps Air — the best sounding cord-free earbuds I’ve tested so far— but those are also much bulkier compared to The Headphone. If you’re happy with the audio on Apple’s EarPods or similar sub-$100 earbuds, these likely won’t disappoint. Call quality is another story, but a familiar one for earbuds and especially cord-free earbuds. The company says it uses “Left and right external auditory microphones and EarBone microphone,” but the mic was only just passable for short calls in relatively quiet environments. I wouldn’t buy this to rely on for calling or for important calls with noisy surroundings. Charging case (but no battery for mobile charging) | A big downside to Bragi’s The Headphone is the fact that the charging case doesn’t include a built-in battery for on-the-go charging. Most of the competitors are doing this and some at similar price points, so it’s something to consider if you’re someone that is on the move often or for long periods of time. But they claim 6 hours of battery life on a single charge (and they take around 2 hours to charge from 0%), which for most people will be enough for an entire day’s worth of usage and commutes. You’ll find a battery life indicator next to the Bluetooth icon on your iPhone’s status menu bar. A short 3-inch micro-USB to USB cable is included for plugging in the case. Should you buy it (them)? The two big factors for me when it comes to testing these products is fit/comfort and sound quality. So far one or the other has been a deal breaker in making cord-free earbuds my daily drivers over wired Bluetooth options. But Bragi’s The Headphone is one of the first products I’ve tested that managed to pass in both of those categories, scoring high points for fit and squeaking by on sound quality. If Sol Republic could shave off 15-20% in overall size in a future generation Amps Air product without sacrificing their great sound quality, they’d be my top pick. But as the market stands right now, Bragi’s The Headphone at $149 is so far the best overall cord-free earbud I’ve reviewed.",

      "text": "| Editorial \nThe heated U.S. election campaign that saw Donald Trump elected 45th President of the United States raised many issues. A critically important one was the growing proliferation of fake news online . Both sides shared increasingly bizarre, heavily partisan, fake news stories during the fraught campaign. They fueled conspiracy theories on a variety of baseless issues . They were fed in part by social media, and social networking companies seem to have no idea how to respond. \nThe issue is that the brilliantly clever algorithms that power the likes of Facebook and others cannot differentiate fact from fiction the way humans can. As a result, false and even dangerous stories have often gone viral. People are demanding an explanation from the likes of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, but few have been forthcoming so far. \nDiscussions about how to solve this problem will no doubt continue. Interestingly, Apple is actually in a better position than many of its Silicon Valley competitors to overcome the issue of fake news. The Whole Widget \nApple has been criticized over the years for building a closed hardware and software ecosystem. This approach has some disadvantages, but Apple’s control-freak tendencies have brought some editorial rigor to Apple News. The company built partnerships with top publishers, pulling together content from high quality, established news sources. Apple News does not rely on shares and things going viral. By curating stories from top outlets it has greatly reduced the possibility of Apple News spreading nonsense. \nSocial networks do a brilliant job of bringing us content we like, as well as content we will probably like, but haven’t yet discovered. The problem is that algorithms cannot fact check or rebut inaccuracies like humans can. Algorithms do not have that editor’s instinct that a story just does’t feel right. The consequences of this can be devastating. A falsehood can spread in an instant, taking hold before it can be countered. Learning from Apple to Counter Fake News \nCan social media companies learn from Apple’s heavily curated approach? Apple’s model means that most Apple News content will have gone through a proper editorial process. To that end, The Washington Post ’s esteemed media columnist Margaret Sullivan said that Facebook “should hire a top-flight executive editor and give that person the resources, power and staff to make sound editorial decisions.” \nWhile wanting to deal with this issue, social networks will rightly be wary of losing their defining qualities of openness and sharing. Apple is essentially defined by the opposite qualities, but it means the company is better placed to stem the tide of fake news. \nBut, Apple’s approach only benefits Apple users—or more specifically, the subset of Apple customers interested in this issue. Until social media companies borrow a page from Apple or find their own way to solving this problem, the scourge of fake news will remain. Share this:",

      "title": "The Horn Effect: Why Apple should keep making displays and routers!",
      "text": "\n\"Sure, we could do that, and we'd make a few million dollars, but is that really a business we need to be in?\"\n\nRene Ritchie has been covering Apple and the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial director for Mobile Nations, analyst for iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him on Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter @reneritchie.\n\nI've heard the above quote attributed to Steve Jobs several times and it fits with the \"thousand nos for every yes\" mantra Tim Cook has been repeating over the last few years as well. It makes sense for a company that, despite its size and last decade of success, still runs like a web of small startups. But that doesn't make it sting any less when some of those \"nos\" hit the products I love.\nTwo recent product decisions, one real, one rumored, have hit me particularly close to home lately: Apple Display and AirPort Routers.\nDeath of the display When the last Apple Display debuted after the IPS iMac it was a revelation. A gorgeous 27-inch panel that also worked as a hub for the full range of MacBooks. It was updated for Thunderbolt, but as the iMac got thinner, went 5K, and went DCI-P3, bringing sleeker design, better sharpness, and wider color to the market, the Apple Display got left behind.\nLast summer Apple announced they were discontinuing the old Thunderbolt Display. This led some to believe Apple was getting out of the display business entirely and others that they were merely clearing the deck for the long rumored Apple 4K and 5K Displays. Ultimately, this past October, Apple announced new 4K and 5K displays… from LG.\nI'm sure Apple put enormous effort into working with LG on them, but the industrial design was decidedly not-Apple, and the branding was pure LG.\nRumors on the router \nRumor has it Apple may be discontinuing the AirPort Extreme, Express, and Time Capsule as well. Though an early driver of wireless technologies and still offering an 802.11ac version that's up-to-date-ish with Wi-Fi standards — and still top rated for customer sat! — there's no denying the AirPorts haven't been updated in years either.\nMeanwhile next-generation mesh networking routerss from Ubiquity, Netgear, eero, and even Google have launched that are more robust and even easier to set up — using an iPhone app, no less.\nSome have likewise taken these rumors as Apple exiting the router business while others again hope it's Apple clearing the deck for a next gen Home Hub product.\nNiche needs According to numbers I heard bandied about last year, only a very small, single digit percentage of MacBook Anything owners regularly connect to external displays. I don't know what percentage use AirPorts for Wi-Fi, but in a world with multiple vendors, it's inarguably not big business for Apple.\nThat makes people like me, who've owned multiple generations of Apple Displays and AirPorts, the minority, not the mainstream majority. And it makes it tough to argue, based on numbers alone, that Apple should devote some of their deliberately limited focus and resources on accessories rather than devices.\nBut not all arguments should be based on numbers.\nMaking a difference \nApple still offers Magic accessories for Mac, with features like Force Touch that no other vendor can supply. Likewise Apple Pencil. The Smart Keyboard is something that, even though Logitech makes one as well, shows the way forward for iPad Pro. Likewise Smart Battery Case, and even dongles. Not all Apple accessories are things only Apple could do, though, but they're mostly low ticket items like docks and cases.\nMacBooks are no longer bound to MagSafe, though, and that means anyone can make a USB-C display. But not the experience.\nIf, for an end-user, the interface is the app, then the display is experience. I've used Apple Displays with Mac mini, Mac Pro, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro, but when I'm using it, the machine behind it disappears. All I see is the display.\nRight now, for me, that display still has Apple on the logo and in the design. It makes it apparent I'm using an Apple product, which reassures me and delivers the kind of ecosystem value Apple typically appreciates and optimizes for. It's the type of awareness other brands pay billions for in posters and placements. Giving it away to LG or anyone seems imprudent, especially long term.\nSame for the AirPort. Right now I have a Time Capsule that just works to back up my Mac whenever I'm in Wi-Fi range. I'd love one with mesh support, but right now I'm considering my next router with mesh support and without an Apple logo.\nMaybe it won't be a concern, and an Apple Home hub will materialize, and it'll have all sorts of \"only Apple\" benefits like local/cloud fusion for iCloud and updates, and wireless distance charging for the next iPhone, or whatever. But I don't know and I don't like that I don't know.\nThe horn effect As profit centers go, displays and routers and their ilk are likely less than a rounding error for Apple. They also pull focus. Part of Apple's success, though, has been the halo effect — once you start buying something Apple, you keep buying more things Apple. Once you get the device, you get the accessories. The opposite — a horn effect? — would be buying non-Apple accessories leading to buying non-Apple devices.\nA few more small yeses help support the bigger yeses. Mind share is invaluable and that makes it feel like key accessories, niche or not, are something Apple should absolutely still be in.\n",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \n(NEWS10) — Shopping online especially through your phone can be great. If you’re a loyal customer, you get deep discounts access to exclusive sales and it’s convenient. However, shoppers beware: There is a surge in fake apps hitting the app stores both on Google and Apple. \nIf you’re like Kyle Giglio, you do most of your holiday shopping from the palm of your hand. \n“[It’s] very convenient to have a mobile app when you’re out shopping,” Giglio said. \nHe has got it down to a science. \n“If I’m going to a store and then I see something, I go to my phone and say, ‘Can I find it cheaper on eBay or Amazon?’” Giglio explained. \nBefore you start downloading an app, watch out for the copy cats launched by third parties to collect your information \n“Coming into holiday, we have seen hundreds of them getting launched all the time,” Chris Mason from Branding Brand said. \nMason’s company Branding Brand creates apps for some major retailers like Sephora, American Eagle, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and hundreds of other trusted brands. \nMason has noticed the app market, both on the Google Play and the App Store, surge with dozens of dupes made to look like they’re from a real retailer. Names like Dillard’s, Payless, Big Lots and Pandora are some that were hijacked. \n“If you download the Dillard’s app, it looks like its Dillard’s, [but it’s] actually someone trying to dupe consumers into downloading their app,” Mason said. \nApple has already removed some of these fake apps, but when we searched, we found more pop up like Just Fab and Shoe Dazzle. \n“[There are] fake apps for Shoe Dazzle and Just Fab,” Mason said. “Just Fab doesn’t have an app. Someone is positioning themselves as the app for that retailer.” \nWhen you type in shopping in the app store, hundreds of apps pop up. To make sure you’re downloading something put out by a company you trust, just go to their website and they’ll probably have a link to download their official app. \n“Look at the reviews for the app,” Mason advised. “If there are no reviews or reviews are bad, then that’s a red flag.” \nSo before you fill up that digital shopping cart like Giglio, beware, because even he didn’t know about the risk until he was told. \n“You’re putting your device at risk,” Mason said. “We don’t know what they’re for. They could be trying to steal consumer information, they could be installing malware on your device.” Share this: ",

Affected countries include Egypt, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, Tanzania, and Vietnam.\n\nPreviously those countries' storefronts showed pricing in U.S. dollars. That could, of course, be potentially confusing for anyone wanting an app or in-app purchase, given exchange rates.\n\nThe changeover is expected to be fairly seamless, as Apple noted that any auto-renewing subscriptions will continue automatically.\n\nApple typically uses local currencies in major markets such as France and the U.K.",

Developers can download the beta via Apple's official developer portal, while public beta participants can access it through the Software Update feature on previously registered devices. Specific changes over the slightly older version are not yet known. The most recent beta update for iOS 10.2 arrives only four days after the reveal of the fourth one. Apple's tvOS was updated on Wednesday . The iOS 10.2 update includes redrawn emoji and 72 new characters, conforming with the Unicode 9.0 specification. The new iOS and tvOS versions also include a dedicated \"TV\" app. iPhone 7 owners will get new wallpapers, and the native Videos app is gaining a widget. Apple is also adding a \"Celebration\" effect in Messages. When released, iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 will further include single sign-on support for streaming TV, allowing people subscribed to cable/satellite or online-only services to access channels across multiple apps without constantly re-authenticating.

      "text": "Share This Tweet This Apple may have recently unveiled its new and improved dual-camera technology on its recently-released iPhone 7, but rumors abound that the next- generation iPhone might pack an even more impressive camera. The California tech giant reportedly forged a collaboration with LG Innotek to develop a smartphone camera module specifically designed for 3D photography. Both Apple and LG have not given any clear timeline for its release, even though speculations on this new technology continue to circulate. With that, many expect that Apple's next-generation product lineup, including the iPhone 8, will come up with this latest technology. Advertisement According to The Korean Economic Daily , Apple is now \"studying how to apply its 3D camera technology with LG Innotek's smartphone camera. Such joint efforts will likely to bear fruits sometime within the next year.\" In an attempt to add 3D technology, Apple is utilizing the Israeli camera technology startup company Linx, which was acquired by the company back in 2015. Linx holds the expertise in allowing apps to freely use the 3D information by the camera on the device, such as the ability to refocus the image after it has been captured, 3D object modeling and real-time background replacement for video call, reported by Gadgets 360 . In its larger iPhone 7 Plus model, the Cupertino-based company has already used LG Innotek's dual-cam solution. In fact, it's precisely this technology that Apple leveraged to offer its much touted Portrait Mode. While detailed information remains unavailable so far, Apple's ambition to bring 3D photography technology to its next generation technological lineup could mean the manufacturer is implementing LG's dual-cam tech in all of its next lineup phones. Advertisement Another rumor says that the next-gen iPhone camera is going to support features in 2D and 3D for augmented reality gimmicks that will make easier for users to interact with the physical world in new meaningful ways.

      "title": "Security Researchers Break iOS Activation Lock On Apple iPhone And iPad",
      "text": "by Rob Williams   Security Researchers Break iOS Activation Lock On Apple iPhone And iPad \nIt's no secret that Apple places a high value on customer security and privacy , and the company goes to great lengths to make sure that it's a market-leader in both regards. However, even the most careful companies can be exposed to crippling security vulnerabilities. If software contains a previously unidentified bug or exploit, it just sits there waiting for some enterprising user to spot it. And that's just what happened with Apple's Activation Lock. \nWhen an iPhone or iPad is lost, the user has the ability to enable \"Find My iPhone\", which can immediately locks the device, requiring correct credentials to regain access. This is useful in case a device gets stolen or is simply found by another person - whatever's on the device will remain safe. \nHowever, a couple of researchers have just revealed their discoveries about a flaw that affects the Activation Lock, and you might be surprised by just how easy it is to exploit. Even you may be able to do it, by the looks of things. \nIn order to check online for those correct activation details, Activation Lock requires internet access to function. To do that, the user must first connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot. This is where the exploit comes in. Because there's no character limit for the various fields required, it's easy enough to overload the device with incredibly long names and passwords. Pasting such long strings in effectively crashes the security layer, granting access to the OS. \nIn the video above, a user types in a bunch of random characters and then copy / pastes them over and over to create a string likely 1,000+ characters long. After hitting enter, and letting the device struggle, a Smart Cover is placed on the iPad, effectively putting it to sleep. When the cover is removed, the iPad will then bug out a little bit, before granting access to the home screen. \nThis almost seems a little too easy, but likewise, a fix should be relatively simple to implement. Given that most people don't need 1,000+ character limits, that's likely to be reduced to a much more sane number (imagine even typing in 128 legitimate characters - it'd take forever!), thus effectively eliminating the bug (we hope).",

      "title": "Buffer overflow exploit can bypass Activation Lock on iPads running iOS 10.1.1",
      "text": "Further Reading iOS 7 Activation Lock cutting iPhone theft, damaging resale market Apple's Activation Lock feature, introduced in iOS 7 in 2013, deters thieves by associating your iPhone and iPad with your Apple ID. Even if a thief steals your device, puts it into Recovery Mode, and completely resets it, the phone or tablet won't work without the original user's Apple ID and password. This makes stolen iDevices less valuable since they become more difficult to resell, and it has significantly reduced iPhone theft in major cities .\nThe feature has been difficult to crack, but a new exploit disclosed by Vulnerability Lab security analyst Benjamin Kunz Mejri uses a buffer overflow exploit and some iPad-specific bugs to bypass Activation Lock in iOS 10.1.1.\nWhen you're setting up a freshly-reset iPad with Activation Lock enabled, the first step is to hit \"Choose Another Network\" when you're asked to connect to Wi-Fi. Select a security type, and then input a very, very long string of characters into both the network name and network password fields (copying and pasting your increasingly long strings of characters can speed this up a bit). These fields were not intended to process overlong strings of characters, and the iPad will gradually slow down and then freeze as the strings become longer. During one of these freezes, rotate the tablet, close its Smart Cover for a moment, and then re-open the cover. The screen will glitch out for a moment before displaying the Home screen for a split second, at which point a well-timed press of the Home button can apparently bypass Activation Lock entirely (but it will have to be extremely well-timed, since the first-time setup screen will pop back up after a second). Further Reading How security flaws work: The buffer overflow\nThis video shows the exploit in action, and we were able to reproduce it on an iPad Mini 2 running iOS 10.1.1. In our testing, however, we couldn't reproduce the bug on an iPhone 5 running iOS 10.1.1—the first-time setup screens on all iPhone models doesn't rotate as it does on the iPad, nor can the iPhones be locked with Smart Covers. These screens also wouldn't rotate into landscape mode in iPads running iOS 9, so if you haven't updated yet (or if you're using an older iPad and can't update), you're probably vulnerable to a whole bunch of other security bugs but it's not possible to make the screen glitch out in the same way.\nThere could be an alternate form of the exploit that works on iPhones, though as of this writing it only appears to be possible on iPads running iOS 10.1.1. We've contacted Apple for comment and will update if we receive a response.",

      "text": "Close \nChargers that are not made for Apple devices are not safe, investigators warn consumers . \nThe Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), a UK a non-profit that represents trading standards professionals, says the majority of counterfeit chargers are dangerous the BBC reported Friday . \nCTSI tested 400 fake chargers for Apple devices and found only three of them had enough insulation to protect against electric shocks. The rest failed a basic safety test. \n“Only buy second-hand electrical goods that have been tested and only buy online electrical goods from trusted suppliers,” said CTSI Chief Executive Leon Livermore . “It might cost a few pounds more but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one.” \nAnother operation targeted local charity shops, antique dealers and secondhand shops and found 15 percent of 3,019 used electrical goods were non-compliant with UK standards. \nThe operations were conducted by UL, a global independent safety science company. UL applied a high voltage to the chargers bought in eight different countries, including the US, Canada, Colombia, China, Thailand and Australia. \n“Criminals across the globe are using online platforms to lure you in with cheap deals for fake items, many of which are dangerous and have been known to overheat and cause house fires,” said Toby Harris , chair of Trading Standards. \nHow to Keep Yourself Safe \nThe CTSI recommends that people safeguard their family and home from the threatening chargers by using only genuine charger made and licenced for use with device. Overcharging your phone or tablet is also a bad idea. Going to sleep while your device is plugged to the charger and putting in under a pillow or in contact with bedding could lead to fires. Lastly, CTSI recommends that people never use a damaged charger with a cracked case, or worn out cable or a charger that is not working properly. \nHow to Spot Dangerous Chargers: \nCTSI recommends people look out for counterfeit adaptors by looking at: \n1. Plug pins \nMake sure there is at least 9.5 mm between the edge of the pins and the edge of the charger (9.5 mm is about the width of a ballpoint pen). If the distance is less than 9.5 mm there is a risk of electric shock when plugging in and unplugging the charger from a socket. \nPlug the charger into a socket but don’t switch it on or connect it to your appliance. If if doesn’t fit properly then the pins might be the wrong size or length. This could lead to overheating, arcing and mechanical damage in both the socket and the charger. Related Stories Apple iOS 10.1.1 iPhone Update Has Glitches with Battery and Earpods \n2. Markings \nCheck for a manufacturers' brand name or logo, model and batch number. Also check for a CE safety mark. However, consumers should be aware that it can be easily forged. \n3. Warnings and Instructions \nChargers’ instructions should include information on conditions and limitations of use, how to operate the charger safely, basic electrical safety guidance and details of how to safely dispose of the charger when it is no longer required.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Shares of chip maker Cirrus Logic ( CRUS ), a prominent supplier to Apple ( AAPL ) for its iPhone , are up $1.44, or almost 3%, at $50.77, after the company yesterday dropped over 10% amidst a broad sell-off of tech, and of chip stocks generally.\nBut part of what hit the stock was also specifically worries over the prospect Apple is cutting its production orders for the iPhone amidst flagging demand. There was an example of that from UBS ’s Steve Milunovich on Tuesday , and then another yesterday in a report from DigiTimes on Thursday; and then this morning, Junheng Li of JL Warren Capital wrote of cuts to this quarter and next quarter’s production.\nNeedham & Co. ’s Rajvindra Gill today defends Cirrus shares, reiterating a Buy rating and a $65 price target, writing that “our supply contacts indicate stable iPhone 7 orders heading towards the end of the year.”\nMore important, he writes, even after factoring some “volatility” in Apple’s iPhone “builds,” he comes up with an estimate for revenue to decline 33% to 37% for Cirrus in the March quarter of 2017, compared to the prior quarter, which would be “roughly inline with the 4-year median rate for sales to be down 32%,” quarter-over-quarter.”\nHe sees several “vectors of growth” for Cirrus, including, you guessed it, a presumed “ iPhone 8 ” next year.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray One Street observer this morning thinks yesterday’s sharp sell-off in tech names was a great opportunity to pick up a valuable name, Qualcomm ( QCOM ).\nQualcomm shares yesterday closed down $3.97, or almost 6%, at $64.16. The stock is down 16 cents at $69.06 this morning.\nNorthland Capital Markets ’s Tom Sepenzis today urges investors to “buy on the dip” Qualcomm’s shares, which he rates Outperform, with a $75 price target.\n“Expansion into new markets including the IoT, automotive and eventually, the server market add several avenues for upside over the next few years,” for Qualcomm, he writes.\nSepenzis, moreover, thinks Qualcomm is going to come out on top in the war for mobile baseband modem chips, where Intel ( INTC ) has lately been its biggest obstacle.\nIntel, you’ll recall, this year won part of the business to supply the modem in Apple’s ( AAPL ) iPhone that Qualcomm had previously had to itself for several iterations of the device.\nBut Sepenzis points to reports that Intel’s modem is slower than Qualcomm’s, and thinks Apple might cut off Intel if it continues to lag Qualcomm:\nThere have been several reports over the past month that have compared the speeds associated with both the INTC and QCOM modems in their respective iPhone models, with INTC coming up short. Apple apparently has throttled the speeds on the QCOM modems to keep the experience consistent across carriers, with the QCOM X12 modem capable of 600 mb/s while the INTC XMM 3360 modem tops out at 450 mb/ s. While Apple will certainly keep a second source if possible, it isn’t going to do so for too long if it has to handicap half of its devices. This should give QCOM a path towards recapturing all of Apple over the next two years if Intel doesn’t find an answer. Currently, the next generation INTC XMM 7480 modem is still capped at 450 mb/s. QCOM has already introduced the X16 modem, capable of 1 gb/s, the first gigabit modem.",

      "title": "Why You Shouldn’t Let a Personal Virtual Assistant Represent Your Brand",
      "text": "\nSource: iStock \nWith the rise of Personal Virtual Assistant offerings from Apple, Amazon, and Google, the fact is that these brands are increasingly becoming part of your customers’ lives. With a simple voice command, these AI-powered helpers provide on-demand information and productivity. And, when it comes to your customers, you have every reason to be jealous.\nAs Apple and other Personal Virtual Assistant (PVA) providers open their APIs, more brands can reach customers through these interfaces. Which can mean great things for your business, because artificial intelligence can both increase efficiency and minimize customer frustration. But the more you rely on external AI systems to manage touch points, the less you can control and benefit from these interactions.\nEach “Siri, where’s the closest [your store]?” makes Apple the hero. Each “Okay, Google, set up an appointment with [your brand]” is a lost opportunity to show that you – not Google Assistant – make things easy.\nSimply put, PVAs get between you and your valuable customers. Despite this, it’s understandable why there is a significant temptation to partner with these automated middlemen. After all, executives everywhere are curious about the business benefits of AI, including:\nStrengthening competitive advantage\nGenerating revenue\nEnabling new efficiencies But while every relationship is about compromise, do you really need to trade direct access to your customers to get these benefits?\nA MORE HARMONIOUS CHOICE\nArtificial intelligence clearly offers a lot of advantages to enterprise-level companies. But relying on external AI means PVA providers reap the benefits, and deprive you of the opportunity to create your own brand experience.\nThe alternative? Having an enterprise Virtual Assistant of your own. Especially in today’s customer-obsessed business environment, competing with rival suitors is the only way to keep your customers happy – and loyal. Here’s how having your own AI-powered customer care solution lets you do just that.\nBENEFIT #1: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE\nMarketing alone can only do so much. In fact, for many brands, customer experience is the most important (or even only) differentiator they have. That means direct access to your customers is one of your most valuable resources.\nBy having your own Virtual Assistant, you can ensure a positive end-to-end customer journey. It’s a lot easier to stand out from the competition when there’s no third-party Virtual Assistant cutting you off from your own customers.\nBENEFIT #2: REVENUE GENERATION\nCustomer experience is critical to brand affinity. It’s not only about additional revenue opportunities – it’s also about mitigating risk and the loss of existing customers. Just one negative experience with your brand can turn once loyal customers into detractors. And thanks to the rise and pervasiveness of social media, each view or share compounds the damage of a frustrating customer experience.\nWith your own Virtual Assistant powering customer care, you own the channels customers use to communicate with you. That means you can deliver a truly branded experience, including supporting lucrative upsell and promotional opportunities. Customers still get the on-the-go convenience they demand, while you strengthen your relationship at the same time.\nBENEFIT #3: DATA OWNERSHIP\nIn the competitive world of customer care, data ownership is critical. Customer insights provide valuable data that can be used to create even more intelligent solutions via Machine Learning – but where this data lives is extremely important. If a PVA is controlling the dialogue with your customers, then your company data is actually being held elsewhere. This means that buying preferences, customer data, frequency of contact or any information that your customers share may not make its way to you. Your customer data is a valuable asset, which is why it’s important that you control the interactions with your customers.\nBENEFIT #4: NEW EFFICIENCIES\nReducing frustration and manual effort? That could be a lot easier – and with automation, it is. If you have a branded Virtual Assistant, you can automate routine transactions and streamline more complex ones. Like sending a map and directions to customers who ask for your closest location. Or resetting a password without the need for a live agent. Or serving up product recommendations at just the right time to optimize conversion. You can even reference prior customer actions to show that you really do listen and remember.\nFor consumers, artificial intelligence continues to offer improvements in everyday life. And for businesses looking to expand their customer care capabilities, the implications are significant too. Standing out from the competition. Enhancing revenue streams. And empowering easier and more efficient ways to get things done.\nHaving an enterprise Virtual Assistant of your own makes these benefits possible. All while minimizing customer effort – and without surrendering direct access to your customers. When it comes to harnessing artificial intelligence for customer care, a branded Virtual Assistant is the smart way to build stronger, more profitable relationships.\n",

      "text": "TELL ME MORE! \nBaroness Lucy Neville-Rolfe from the Department for Business, Energy and Industry says: \nThe Government is committed to promoting consumer awareness of the dangers of buying counterfeit goods and encouraging consumers to choose legitimate goods and services, which helps honest traders. \nChoosing “legitimate goods and services” is absolutely the answer. The question, though, is how to be sure you’re getting the real deal. A recent test by Apple showed that 90 percent of its goods marked as ‘genuine’ by online sellers were counterfeit. Even those brandishing the logo aren’t necessarily from Apple, and could be quite dangerous. If you didn’t know any better, which would you buy? \nAmazon’s new ‘Brand Registry’ program will help. It requires sellers to get the permission of IP owners before selling branded products. But it’s a bandaid to a much larger problem . \nCounterfeit goods are worth an estimated $461 billion a year, and until you can shut down the flow of cheap goods from China, and other manufacturing-dominated Asian countries, the issue isn’t going anywhere. Cheap is cheap, and it’s naive to assume customers are going to pay more for trusted merchandise when most assume the fake is the same as the original — or close enough. \nIn the mean time though, the CTSI has these tips for safeguarding your home and personal belongings if you feel you’re using a charger that might not be authentic: Only using a genuine charger made and licenced for use with your product. Don’t over charge your product, once it is charged disconnect it and turn the charger off. Never cover your device while its being charged, don’t put it under a pillow at night or in contact with bedding. Never use a damaged charger with a cracked case or frayed cable or one that is not working properly.",

      "text": "By James Walker 42 mins ago in Technology A safety test of over 400 fake Apple chargers has revealed a staggering 99 percent are dangerous and pose potentially fatal risks. It comes after Apple filed a lawsuit against a counterfeit charger manufacturer selling on Amazon. The mass safety test of fake Apple chargers bought online was commissioned by the UK's Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI). It began an investigation into unofficial budget chargers to determine whether they meet the regulations for power adapters in the UK. Trading Standards bought 400 chargers from a range of online retailers. It then gave them to safety specialists UL for testing. The company applied a high voltage to the chargers to test their insulation, indicating whether they could be at risk of causing electric shocks or fires. Out of the 400 devices tested, just three included sufficient insulation to pass the most basic safety test. Counterfeit chargers can often be several pounds cheaper than their genuine alternatives. Reputable third-party vendors that meet the requirements usually have similar prices to Apple. If the price looks too good to be true, the product should be avoided. Trading Standards urged consumers to spend the extra money, warning that the fake products pose credible risks to life. \"It might cost a few pounds more, but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one,\" Leon Livermore, the chief executive of CTSI, said to the BBC . Trading Standards warned you should look for three key indications that a charger is fake before plugging it in. If the plug doesn't fit easily into the socket, the pins may be the wrong size or aligned incorrectly. In the UK, there should be 9.5mm of clearance between the edge of the pins and the edge of the plug. Different standards are present in other countries. Every power adapter should come with detailed user instructions describing the conditions and limitations of use. If a leaflet isn't provided, the product may not be genuine. Chargers sold in Europe should also come with a \"CE\" safety mark inscribed on the plug. While this can be forged, it's usually an indication the product is genuine. Similar marks exist in other regions. The report from Trading Standards comes shortly after Apple filed a lawsuit against a counterfeit accessory manufacturer trading on Amazon. As part of the case, it claimed that 90% of chargers sold on Amazon with \"Apple\" branding are fake. Reviews left on some of Mobile Star LLC's products included multiple accounts of chargers catching fire within hours of being unpackaged. Amazon is reportedly readying a new initiative to try to banish fake products from its site. Amazon isn't the only retailer having trouble handling counterfeit goods though. The problem currently shows no signs of going away, putting people and houses at risk. Trading Standards urged customers to check the authenticity of chargers while buying and after the product arrives. If there's any uncertainty around its safety, the device should not be plugged in.",

      "text": "In an October lawsuit, Apple accused a company selling electronic devices through Amazon of faking the authenticity of its iPhone chargers. Now, independent research has verified that phony power accessories pose a dangerous risk.\nImage: moomsabuy / Shutterstock.com \nIn its report, the UK-based Chartered Trading Standards Institute , which commissioned the testing and released the results today (Dec. 2), emphasized that unofficial and fake devices are \"unknown entities.\" Leon Livermore, chief executive of the institute, noted that counterfeit goods \"could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one.\"\nOf 400 purported iPhone chargers tested, only three had enough insulation to protect against electric shocks, meaning that less than 1 percent of accessories tested were actually safe to use.\nMORE: The Best Gifts for Travelers \nThe tests, performed by the Illinois-based global safety specialists UL, applied a high amount of voltage to the chargers. The power accessories were bought online from retailers in eight different countries, including the U.S., Australia and China.\nAccording to the Trading Standards Institute, consumers can check to see whether their Apple device chargers are legitimate.\nFirst, the plug should easily fit into the power socket, without requiring any force. Next, look for Apple branding, a batch number and the UL and CE safety marks, although these can be forged. Lastly, did your charger come with instructions and safety materials? If not, it may be junk. Of course, consumers can always skip the uncertainty and buy directly from Apple or well-known accessory makers such as Belkin, Kensington, Monoprice and TwelveSouth. \nSee Also : Best Portable Chargers and Battery Packs \n15 Best iPhone 7 Accessories How to Buy USB Type-C Cables That Won't Fry Your Gadgets Best Portable Charger - Battery Packs for Phones, Tablets About the author Henry T.

      "title": "How to tell if you have a fake Apple charger",
      "text": "A recent report suggested that 397 fake Apple chargers tested out of a crop of 400 are dangerous. That’s a scary figure, and one worth paying attention to if you want to keep your family safe. Unfortunately, even if you think you’re buying a charger from Apple on sites like Amazon, it turns out many of those are fake, too . Apple actually warned us about that last month.\nYou can avoid this entirely by visiting Apple’s website or walking into an Apple Store to buy your chargers, but what about products you already have plugged into outlets around your home? Thankfully, Apple has some pretty clear cut guidelines that can help you identify whether or not you have a fake charger.\nLook for the right logos “To identify counterfeit or uncertified cables and accessories, look carefully at the accessory’s packaging and at the accessory itself,” Apple explains on its website . “Certified third-party accessories have the MFi logo on their packaging. An Apple Lightning to USB cable has ‘Designed by Apple in California’ and either ‘Assembled in China,’ ‘Assembled in Vietnam,’ or ‘Indústria Brasileira’ on the cable about seven inches from the USB connector. You’ll see a 12-digit serial number at the end of this text.” You’ll want to look for similar markings on the charging brick, too.\nExamine the Lightning connector See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Apple says you can identify its Lightning cables by the connectors, too, which only have a single piece instead of several glued together. The width is always 7.7mm, too, while third-party Lightning connectors have varying widths. Also look for a gray or metallic face plate, the area around the charging connectors, anything else is counterfeit. Also look for a laser-etched USB logo.\nBuy from trusted sources To ensure safety, your best bet is to buy from Apple directly. You can also buy from trusted vendors that sell MFI-certified products, like Belkin and the like, since they’re approved to be used with Apple devices. Beware of where you’re buying from, though. While Amazon is making it a priority to cut down on counterfeits in 2017, there are very likely still counterfeit products available for sale. And, as always, if the price seems to good to be true, it probably is.",

      "text": "After a brief lull, Apple’s advertising game is finally back on track Yoni Heisler Share View photos During the throes of Apple’s epic legal battle with Samsung a few years ago, one of the more interesting nuggets of information to emerge — aside of course from a bevy of iPhone prototypes — was that Apple executive Phil Schiller was extremely unhappy with Apple’s advertising efforts. If you recall, Samsung released a string of clever ads that targeted Apple and its fan base directly. The ads were creative, funny and, for the first time, put Apple on the defensive. While we had seen anti-Apple ads from the likes of Microsoft before, Samsung’s efforts were far more effective. DON’T MISS: What it takes to get a NES Classic A representative example of Samsung mocking all things Apple can be seen below. Meanwhile, Apple’s own advertising efforts at the time were bland, predictable, and altogether stagnant. In 2013, the Wall Street Journal even took note, asking if Apple had “lost its cool to Samsung?” When Schiller got wind of the article, he was none too pleased and fired off an email to TBWA — Apple’s longtime ad agency — exclaiming that “we have a lot of work to do to turn this around.” Specifically, Schiller wanted Apple’s ads to be more creative and wanted Apple’s ad agency to “experiment with ideas” in a more open and expansive way. In the years that followed, Apple itself became more open to exploring new business relationships with different ad agencies. What’s more, Apple began doubling down on its own in-house advertising unit. In short, Apple stopped relying exclusively on TBWA and began entertaining ad ideas from wherever they happened to emanate from. At the same time, Apple also became more aggressive about hiring some of the top ad talent in the industry. The results of Apple’s renewed focus on advertising have been striking. Over the past few months alone, the quality and uniqueness of Apple’s commercials have been taken up a notch. Some are creative, some are emotional and some are downright quirky, but the overall takeaway is that Apple’s recent string of commercials have been anything but boring and predictable. Touching on this point, longtime Apple ad guru Ken Segall recently opined that Apple’s most recent ad — Bulbs — is one of the “greatest commercials Apple has ever made.” Segall writes: \nThis spot is so artfully constructed, and so intensely energetic from the start, it literally embodies the ad’s concept. That being: ideas have tremendous power. \nThe montage is built upon the foundation of the recurring visual: a line of exploding light bulbs that seemingly goes on forever. I love that the images representing civilization’s greatest ideas are not the “usual suspects.” Depicting a range of great ideas allows the ad to weave in a sense of humor — thus toilet paper can share the stage with space exploration. It’s a nice ad, to be sure, but as Segall points out, a number of other Apple commercials over the last few months have been unusually memorable, from Taylor Swift falling down on a treadmill to the heavily stylized “Diver” iPhone 7 ad that has the markings of a short film. Say what you will, but these commercials are not only memorable, but help spark conversation. In fact, a few such ads have even managed to go somewhat viral. A few months ago, for example, Apple’s Cookie Monster commercial touting the iPhone 6s’ Hey Siri feature has garnered 12.6 million views on YouTube since its release. Meanwhile, the aforementioned Taylor Swift ad has garnered an even more impressive 19.1 million views. Not every single Apple ad over the past 18 months or so has been a standout effort, but there’s no denying that Apple’s batting average has improved considerably during that window. Funny enough, Apple’s ads have gotten so good that they can sometimes oversell a given feature. During the Bulbs ad above, for example, it’s hard to realistically take seriously that the Touch Bar belongs deserves a spot next to inventions like the wheel and fire in the pantheon of human achievements. Similarly, Apple’s Balloons commercial below is great, but the ability to send full-screen balloon animations — while nice — is hardly compelling and “magical.” That said, isn’t that, in a certain sense, the entire point of advertising? If Apple can create a commercial that evokes an emotional response from users, no matter the subject matter, that’s all it really needs to do. We saw a similar effort with this Steph Curry commercial dubbed ‘Half Court’ intended to highlight the iPhone’s ‘Live Photos’ feature. Speaking to Apple’s renewed advertising prowess, the company with the recent release of the iPhone 7 managed to create a remarkably clever and engaging commercial for an otherwise unexciting feature — improved water resistance. But saving the best for last, one commercial that was an absolute home run was Apple’s recent ad for Apple Music starring James Corden. Without question, this was one of the funniest ads Apple has ever released. All the while, the ad also managed to touch on all of Apple Music’s most attractive selling points.",

      "text": "As I started the DirecTV Now app on my Apple TV, Storage Wars spilled across my screen — and I couldn’t change the channel fast enough. \nMy reflex wasn’t related to my feelings about the A&E show. Rather, it’s a critique of DirecTV’s new cord-cutting service. Whether you watch its live television service through your Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, or computer’s web browser, the video feed comes on instantly — just like it would if you were watching a normal TV. And that’s both a great decision and terrible design, b ecause through over-the-top services like DirecTV Now, television essentially works like a utility. So, just like your water faucet or lights, beware of leaving the TV running, as I’ll explain. \nBut first, it’s worth explaining what DirecTV Now actually is. Pulling video from DirecTV (without needing a satellite dish), the service takes aim at cable companies by delivering television programming over the Internet. DirecTV Now offers four packages ranging in price from $35 to $70 per month, which include between more than 60 to at least 120 channels of live and on-demand video, along with some local stations. Though I only tested the service on Apple gear, it’s also accessible via Amazon , Android, Chrome and Google’s Cast devices. \nWith no installers giving me a four-hour setup window, wonky company-owned gear, or annoying contracts, DirecTV Now’s setup is advertised to be a snap. Despite a couple of hiccups, that claim held true. \nStill, immediately after plugging my credit card information into DirecTV’s website, my computer’s web browser required an update of Microsoft’s Silverlight software and a restart in order to view the video stream. Once that software was in place, the first show I pulled up, ESPN’s SportsCenter, froze, displaying an error message: “Hmm… this video is taking a little bit longer than usual to load. Thanks for your patience!” Given that it was launch day, it’s likely new users were rushing to the service, thus the clogged pipes. But since then, other errors have interrupted my viewing, something I never experienced while watching cable TV. \nAnd when it came time to watch my favorite shows, I encountered another unpleasant surprise. It began by me searching the service for “Colbert” and finding nothing. I looked for “Late Show” instead and found 15 shows and three movies, but not The Late Show with Stephen Colbert . (And demonstrating DirecTV’s unsatisfying search capabilities, the movies Clean Slate and 28 Days Later were two of the results). Turns out Colbert isn’t available on DirecTV Now, because CBS is surprisingly not included in the package, opting to go direct to consumers with its own subscription-based app instead. \nWith more than 120 channels, it’d be exhaustive to list every offering here. So instead I performed some highly unscientific research of asking my friends what their appointment TV-viewing shows are. HBO’s shows were a popular response, and the pay channel (as well as Cinemax) are available as add-ons or a rock-bottom price of $5 per month. Sports fans will delight that the MLB, NHL, NBA, and SEC’s respective networks are included, though DirecTV’s NFL offering is not. Reality TV connoisseurs will lament the lack of Survivor and Amazing Race, since CBS isn’t offered. Drama watchers get a mixed bag, missing out on shows like NCIS (CBS, again) but getting all of AMC’s award-winners. And kids make out great in the deal, with three different Disney channels and two Nickelodeons. \nAnother major selling point is DirecTV Now’s ability to stream local channels, which makes it good for people who enjoy their regional newscasts. But less publicized is that the local TV stations it offers are from major markets only, and vary wildly in consistency. For instance, if you live in Chicago, you’ll get local ABC and NBC, but not FOX. And it gets worse from there — there’s not a a single local station to be found where I live in the Pacific Northwest. \nDirecTV Now’s video has mostly streamed crisply and quickly, nearly equaling the responsiveness of my Comcast setup on my television and my iPad. But it’s worth noting that the resolution of the DirecTV video, while clear, didn’t appear to be high definition. Testing it on a 43-inch HDTV, the image looked slightly blurry, and I don’t have high expectations for better image clarity on a larger screen. \nAnd speaking of that big screen experience, DirecTV Now’s Apple TV interface is a mess. When you launch the app, you’re thrust into whichever show is on the channel you left off watching. Swiping down on the touch pad reveals a bare-boned menu, the same display that appears when you press the remote’s ‘menu’ button. But if you swipe up instead, up pops a richer menu full of channel and show options. Swiping left and right changes the channel, which I wish I had known at the outset. \nCuriously, though you can use the Siri Remote’s microphone button to dictate search terms, you can’t use Siri to select a program on DirecTV Now, like you can with Hulu and other apps. I’d expect this to change in the near future, but Apple TV still feels like a hobby to the company, despite its claims to the contrary. \nYou can also pause live television on DirecTV Now, but you can’t fast forward or rewind it, at least not that I could tell. Some live programs let you rewind them completely to watch from the start, while others give you no such option. And there’s no obvious reason why this is the case — it’s probably due to obscure contract negotiations, but to a user it feels utterly random. \nThis odd twist doesn’t seem to involve DirecTV Now’s on-demand library. The service boasts more than 15,000 videoes, which may seem like a solid number until you start digging in to the offerings. For example, my wife hunkered down to watch the previous night’s episode of This Is Us , only to discover that the most recent episode available DirecTV Now was from Oct. 31., making it three episodes behind terrestrial TV. So while this over-the-top service may be good for people who like live television, DirecTV Now subscribers better not be late to the couch. \nThen again, a key selling point for this cord-cutting package is that AT&T wireless customers don’t need to watch TV on the couch at all. Though customers of any wireless provider can subscribe to DirecTV Now, AT&T customers get their data “zero-rated,” meaning it doesn’t count against their monthly data limits. The arrangement comes after AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015 in a $49 billion deal. \nThat’s a sweet deal for AT&T users. But it’s a controversial one, too. While telecoms like AT&T love zero-rating deals because they can provide a competitive advantage, detractors argue such deals can make it harder for upstart services to compete, as users will opt to stream content via a service that won’t kill their data budget. It’s a bit of an abstract debate, but it’s worth considering as you weigh your streaming options. \nEven if zero-rating doesn’t bug you, DirecTV’s impact on your high-speed Internet bill just might. Just like years ago when mobile data providers started to clamp down on unlimited data caps, many broadband carriers recently have started doing the same. In the past, Internet Service Providers like Comcast have throttled the Internet speeds of customers who downloaded huge quantities of data. Now the country’s largest ISP is charging its customers higher rates when their monthly downloads exceed one terabyte. Today’s DirecTV Now customers may not have to worry about hitting that limit, but as more people stream 4K video (which is not currently available on this service, but is the future of video, and is not being earnestly deployed by data limit-free cable television services), this will be an issue to sweat. \nSo, when I say that I couldn’t turn off Storage Wars soon enough, this far off digital doomsday is what I was eyeing. While it’s nice to ape old school television with instant-on video feeds, it’s also entirely unnecessary, and will only eat up precious megabytes. This may seem like a minor point, but like DirecTV Now in general, it will be a major shift in how we think about television. People who leave the tube on for background noise or like to fall asleep watching television will need to change their ways if they subscribe to DirecTV Now. Forget Storage Wars . Bandwidth wars are up next. ",

      "text": "\nAs I started the DirecTV Now app on my Apple TV, Storage Wars spilled across my screen — and I couldn’t change the channel fast enough. \nMy reflex wasn’t related to my feelings about the A&E show. Rather, it’s a critique of DirecTV’s new cord-cutting service. Whether you watch its live television service through your Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, or computer’s web browser, the video feed comes on instantly — just like it would if you were watching a normal TV. And that’s both a great decision and terrible design, b ecause through over-the-top services like DirecTV Now, television essentially works like a utility. So, just like your water faucet or lights, beware of leaving the TV running, as I’ll explain. \nBut first, it’s worth explaining what DirecTV Now actually is. Pulling video from DirecTV (without needing a satellite dish), the service takes aim at cable companies by delivering television programming over the Internet. DirecTV Now offers four packages ranging in price from $35 to $70 per month, which include between more than 60 to at least 120 channels of live and on-demand video, along with some local stations. Though I only tested the service on Apple gear, it’s also accessible via Amazon , Android, Chrome and Google’s Cast devices. \nWith no installers giving me a four-hour setup window, wonky company-owned gear, or annoying contracts, DirecTV Now’s setup is advertised to be a snap. Despite a couple of hiccups, that claim held true. \nStill, immediately after plugging my credit card information into DirecTV’s website, my computer’s web browser required an update of Microsoft’s Silverlight software and a restart in order to view the video stream. Once that software was in place, the first show I pulled up, ESPN’s SportsCenter, froze, displaying an error message: “Hmm… this video is taking a little bit longer than usual to load. Thanks for your patience!” Given that it was launch day, it’s likely new users were rushing to the service, thus the clogged pipes. But since then, other errors have interrupted my viewing, something I never experienced while watching cable TV. \nAnd when it came time to watch my favorite shows, I encountered another unpleasant surprise. It began by me searching the service for “Colbert” and finding nothing. I looked for “Late Show” instead and found 15 shows and three movies, but not The Late Show with Stephen Colbert . (And demonstrating DirecTV’s unsatisfying search capabilities, the movies Clean Slate and 28 Days Later were two of the results). Turns out Colbert isn’t available on DirecTV Now, because CBS is surprisingly not included in the package, opting to go direct to consumers with its own subscription-based app instead. \nWith more than 120 channels, it’d be exhaustive to list every offering here. So instead I performed some highly unscientific research of asking my friends what their appointment TV-viewing shows are. HBO’s shows were a popular response, and the pay channel (as well as Cinemax) are available as add-ons or a rock-bottom price of $5 per month. Sports fans will delight that the MLB, NHL, NBA, and SEC’s respective networks are included, though DirecTV’s NFL offering is not. Reality TV connoisseurs will lament the lack of Survivor and Amazing Race, since CBS isn’t offered. Drama watchers get a mixed bag, missing out on shows like NCIS (CBS, again) but getting all of AMC’s award-winners. And kids make out great in the deal, with three different Disney channels and two Nickelodeons. \nAnother major selling point is DirecTV Now’s ability to stream local channels, which makes it good for people who enjoy their regional newscasts. But less publicized is that the local TV stations it offers are from major markets only, and vary wildly in consistency. For instance, if you live in Chicago, you’ll get local ABC and NBC, but not FOX. And it gets worse from there — there’s not a a single local station to be found where I live in the Pacific Northwest. \nDirecTV Now’s video has mostly streamed crisply and quickly, nearly equaling the responsiveness of my Comcast setup on my television and my iPad.

Swiping left and right changes the channel, which I wish I had known at the outset. \nCuriously, though you can use the Siri Remote’s microphone button to dictate search terms, you can’t use Siri to select a program on DirecTV Now, like you can with Hulu and other apps. I’d expect this to change in the near future, but Apple TV still feels like a hobby to the company, despite its claims to the contrary. \nYou can also pause live television on DirecTV Now, but you can’t fast forward or rewind it, at least not that I could tell. Some live programs let you rewind them completely to watch from the start, while others give you no such option. And there’s no obvious reason why this is the case — it’s probably due to obscure contract negotiations, but to a user it feels utterly random. \nThis odd twist doesn’t seem to involve DirecTV Now’s on-demand library. The service boasts more than 15,000 videoes, which may seem like a solid number until you start digging in to the offerings. For example, my wife hunkered down to watch the previous night’s episode of This Is Us , only to discover that the most recent episode available DirecTV Now was from Oct. 31., making it three episodes behind terrestrial TV. So while this over-the-top service may be good for people who like live television, DirecTV Now subscribers better not be late to the couch. \nThen again, a key selling point for this cord-cutting package is that AT&T wireless customers don’t need to watch TV on the couch at all. Though customers of any wireless provider can subscribe to DirecTV Now, AT&T customers get their data “zero-rated,” meaning it doesn’t count against their monthly data limits.

Today’s DirecTV Now customers may not have to worry about hitting that limit, but as more people stream 4K video (which is not currently available on this service, but is the future of video, and is not being earnestly deployed by data limit-free cable television services), this will be an issue to sweat. \nSo, when I say that I couldn’t turn off Storage Wars soon enough, this far off digital doomsday is what I was eyeing. While it’s nice to ape old school television with instant-on video feeds, it’s also entirely unnecessary, and will only eat up precious megabytes. This may seem like a minor point, but like DirecTV Now in general, it will be a major shift in how we think about television. People who leave the tube on for background noise or like to fall asleep watching television will need to change their ways if they subscribe to DirecTV Now. Forget Storage Wars . Bandwidth wars are up next. \n",

      "text": "By Michael Firth Neowin LLC @techfirth · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nApple today posted an article on its Chinese support site, explaining the recent state of iPhone 6s devices experiencing problems with unexpected shutdowns . \nThe article starts by stating that a small number of units are affected, specifically those manufactured in September or October 2015. \n\"After hearing reports from iPhone customers whose devices unexpectedly shut down, we thoroughly looked into these reports, and collected and analyzed devices\" \nIt goes onto explain that the fault lies with the battery, and the fact that some of the units were exposed to controlled ambient air for longer than they should have been; \n\"...iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs. As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns\" \nApple also cleared up any suggestion that there may be safety issues related to the faulty batteries; \n\"It's important to note, this is not a safety issue.\" \nLastly, the article explains that not all unexpected shutdowns are, erm, unexpected; \n\"We also want our customers to know that an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature. To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage.\" \nAs you'd expect, Apple recommends booking an appointment with an Apple Store or Apple Authorised Service Center if you're experiencing the issue. \nYou can now also check your serial number online , to see if yours is one of the affected units. \nIt's unclear why the post was made only to the Chinese portion of the Apple website (though the article is published in both English and Chinese), but it's possible that Apple has come under renewed pressure from the China Consumers Association after they put pressure on Apple last month over the issue.",

      "text": "Random iPhone 6s shutdowns due to faulty battery component, Apple says Apple is offering a fix free of charge after a China consumer group complained about the problem U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 2, 2016 11:31 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 6s 4 great gifts for mobile professionals \nA problem with iPhone 6s products randomly shutting down comes from a battery flaw found in a small number of models, according to Apple. \nAfter a Chinese consumer watchdog group reported the issue, Apple is offering a fix free of charge to any eligible iPhone 6s user through its customer support sites. \nOn Friday, Apple explained on its Chinese site that the problem was found in iPhone 6s devices containing a faulty battery component. This component was \"exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have\" before it was assembled into the battery packs, Apple said. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \n\"As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur,\" the company said. \nHowever, the faulty components were only found only in a \"small number\" of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015. \n\"It's important to note, this is not a safety issue,\" Apple said. Its iPhones are built to automatically shut down under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature, to protect the device's electronics. \nApple has posted customer support websites where consumers can submit their iPhone 6s serial numbers to see if they are eligible for a battery replacement. \nLast month, the China Consumers Association asked the company to investigate the shutdown issues, after receiving a \"considerable number\" of complaints from iPhone users in the country. \nThe shutdowns would occur when the device’s battery charge dropped between 60 to 50 percent in both cold and room-temperature environments, according to the association. The phones would also fail to turn on unless connected to a power supply. \nAlthough Apple claims to have addressed the problem, the China Consumers Association said earlier this week that consumers continue to complain the shutdown issues are also found in older iPhone 6 and 6 plus models. \nIn addition, consumers with iPhone 6s models built outside the September and October 2015 date range have also reported the problem. \nThe China Consumers Association has asked Apple to investigate the other claims. But on Friday, Apple said it had found no other problems. \n\"We looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly,\" the company said. \"After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports.\" To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook , LinkedIn or Twitter . Related:",

Apple is blaming air for the issue. \nDo you have a problem where your iPhone 6s randomly and unexpectedly shuts down for no reason? Apple is blaming air for the issue. \nSeriously, the problem is down to air. \nIn a support document posted to the company's website, Apple says it has traced the problem to \"a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs.\" \nThis, in turn, caused \"batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur.\" \nApple is also keen to emphasize that this is not a safety issue. The company also points out that the iPhone is designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as under extreme cold, and that this is a feature to protect the circuitry from low voltage conditions. \nInformation on which specific iPhone 6s handsets are affected can be found here . If your device is affected, Apple will replace the battery free of charge.",

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Andrew Cunningham)\nApple's Activation Lock feature, introduced in iOS 7 in 2013, deters thieves by associating your iPhone and iPad with your Apple ID. Even if a thief steals your device, puts it into Recovery Mode, and completely resets it, the phone or tablet won't work without the original user's Apple ID and password. This makes stolen iDevices less valuable since they become more difficult to resell, and it has significantly reduced iPhone theft in major cities .\nThe feature has been difficult to crack, but a new exploit disclosed by Vulnerability Lab security analyst Benjamin Kunz Mejri uses a buffer overflow exploit and some iPad-specific bugs to bypass Activation Lock in iOS 10.1.1.\nWhen you're setting up a freshly-reset iPad with Activation Lock enabled, the first step is to hit \"Choose Another Network\" when you're asked to connect to Wi-Fi. Select a security type, and then input a very, very long string of characters into both the network name and network password fields (copying and pasting your increasingly long strings of characters can speed this up a bit). These fields were not intended to process overlong strings of characters, and the iPad will gradually slow down and then freeze as the strings become longer. During one of these freezes, rotate the tablet, close its Smart Cover for a moment, and then re-open the cover. The screen will glitch out for a moment before displaying the Home screen for a split second, at which point a well-timed press of the Home button can apparently bypass Activation Lock entirely (but it will have to be extremely well-timed, since the first-time setup screen will pop back up after a second).\nRead 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "  09:44 AM EST Qualcomm: Apple’s Gonna Dump Intel if They Keep Lagging, Says Northland One Street observer this morning thinks yesterday’s sharp sell-off in tech names was a great opportunity to pick up a valuable name, Qualcomm ( QCOM ). Qualcomm shares yesterday closed down $3.97, or almost 6%, at $64.16. The stock is down 16 cents at $69.06 this morning. Northland Capital Markets ’s Tom Sepenzis today urges investors to “buy on the dip” Qualcomm’s shares, which he rates Outperform, with a $75 price target. \"Expansion into new markets including the IoT, automotive and eventually, the server market add several avenues for upside over the next few years,” for Qualcomm, he writes. Sepenzis, moreover, thinks Qualcomm is going to come out on top in the war for mobile baseband modem chips, where Intel ( INTC ) has lately been its biggest obstacle. Intel, you’ll recall, this year won part of the business to supply the modem in Apple’s ( AAPL ) iPhone that Qualcomm had previously had to itself for several iterations of the device.",

      "title": "Aero Flux vs Apple AirPods: Which wireless earbuds should you get? | Mic",
      "text": "TWEET It was recently revealed that Apple is gearing up to ship the highly anticipated AirPods in time for Christmas . Initial excitement for the new device died down after months of delays , but the wireless earbuds are bound to be a hit given Apple's reputation. But perhaps it's not wise to toss your money to the company on the basis of its prestige alone — there are other options, and the Aero Flux wireless earbuds are a prime contender. Aero Flux vs. Apple AirPods — which are better? Aero Flux wireless earbuds are billed as a cheaper alternative to the AirPods — founder Jack Kim said as much in a profile with Digital Trends . His product is currently available to pre-order for $89 , nearly half of Apple 's $159 AirPods price tag. For the average consumer, that dip in cost will be enticing. But can the Aero Flux stand up to AirPods performance-wise? The two products share a number of similarities: Both utilize a Bluetooth connection to wirelessly transmit sound. Both come equipped with portable charging cases. And both feature intuitive CPUs that pause audio whenever you remove the earbuds. That being said, there are some distinctions that set the two apart. A case for the Apple AirPods Apple AirPods Source: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP The Aero Flux can certainly challenge the AirPods, but the latter has a number of advantages. Most notable is the AirPods' inclusion of Siri , which makes them significantly more useful. With nothing but your voice, you can instruct Siri to place phone calls, adjust volume or search for directions — without ever touching your iPhone . The AirPods also feature some minor spec advantages over the Aero Flux. You get five hours of playback on a single AirPods charge compared to four with the Aero Flux. Additionally, using the charging case will net you 24 hours of total playback; the Aero Flux only grants you 16. And in a pinch, 15 mins of charging can power the AirPods for three hours. Aero Flux hasn't indicated its charging speed, but it's likely its charger won't be able to top that impressive pace. Last, but not least, the AirPods will naturally sync with other Apple devices, providing an unparalleled level of convenience. A case for the Aero Flux Aero Flux Source: Gadgetsin It's hard to compete with an industry leader like Apple, but the Aero Flux has a few things going for it. For one, these earbuds are water resistant , which will come in extreme handy whenever traveling through inclement weather. Another neat feature is the Aero Flux's ability to connect to two separate devices — one on each earbud. In terms of the sound quality, Aero Flux might have Apple beat. Its \"AeroBoost\" increases bass by up to two times compared to traditional earphones. Of course, the primary advantage of the Aero Flux is its cheaper cost. Granted, the earbuds' price will rise to $129 after the pre-order period, but the current $89 price tag is very alluring. You'll get solid wireless audio for a fraction of the AirPods' cost. Apple AirPods vs. Aero Flux: The verdict When deciding on these two products, it ultimately comes down to what you value the most. Do you want access to a personal assistant and need to seamlessly connect to all of your Apple devices? AirPods are for you. Do you want an affordable pair of Bluetooth earbuds with water resistance? Go with the Aero Flux. Either way, you're acquiring a decent set of headphones for an increasingly wireless world. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "TWEET Google Maps is the leader in mobile navigation , thanks to Street View and its early implementation of mass transit maps. Apple, however, could close the gap with a newly approved fleet of drones working by its side. According to Bloomberg , the iPhone maker is purportedly constructing an arsenal of drones to capture aerial footage in an effort to improve its native Maps app. The drones will be able to better scan street signs and traffic changes in comparison to the fleet of camera-equipped minivans Apple previously utilized. Apple Maps on the iPad Source: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images The report said Apple took the necessary steps to secure approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to collect data with the drones. Apple has yet to say anything about this — Mic has reached out and will update with any comment. The photos and videos captured by Apple's drones could prove invaluable for its navigation software. A source close to the situation told Bloomberg the drones' information would be sent to Apple's team for swift and accurate updates to the Maps app utilized by iOS users all over the world. Apple suffered early setbacks following the launch of Maps back in 2012. A number of errors and inaccuracies were reported, while Google's app continued to excel. Since then, Apple has steadily improved its program and the application of these drones could further refine its product going forward. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "TWEET Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the world to Airpods at Apple's iPhone event back in September . The wireless earbuds garnered a ton of hype ( and mockery ) but faded from the limelight after a series of delays hit their release date. Now they're reportedly just a few weeks from shipping. MacRumors obtained an email thread in which Cook himself reassured an anxious customer of the Airpods' impending arrival: Customer's comment: \"Give us a release date. I really bought in to the wireless vision you painted. Now I'm stuck waiting with my EarPods but can't charge my 7 at the same time, which I need to do at work. Let us know if it's a month or 6 months, because then I'll just buy some other wireless headphones.\" Tim Cook's response: \"Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay — we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.\" A \"few weeks\" is still vague, but it's at least a hint for eager Apple customers. The company was originally supposed to ship the Airpods by October; now we should hopefully see them by Christmas . Apple Airpods Source: Stephen Lam/Getty Images Airpods utilize a Bluetooth connection to wirelessly transmit sound. An embedded W1 chip intuitively recognizes when a user is speaking or listening to filter noise and engages the Airpods' built-in microphone accordingly. Perhaps most groundbreaking is the integration of Siri, which allows users to give voice commands to make phone calls, adjust volume, look up directions and more. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Apple explains why some iPhone 6S models are randomly shutting down Apple explains why some iPhone 6S models are randomly shutting down \n  \nAfter launching a battery replacement program for some iPhone 6S users on Thursday, Apple has now explained what caused the problem in the first place. \nIn a post on its Chinese support site , the company said those devices manufactured between September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to ambient air for too long. \nThe company also reaffirmed this was not a Note 7-like safety issue and told users that not all unsolicited shutdowns are indications of a problem. For example, an iPhone shutting itself off in extremely cold temperatures can be a self-protective measure. \nThe company is replacing the affected batteries free of charge and users can insert their serial number in order to check eligibility. \nRelated: iPhone 6S long-term review \nThe post (via Neowin ) reads. \" ...iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs.As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns. \n\"It's important to note, this is not a safety issue. \n“We also want our customers to know that an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature. To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage.\" \nThe battery replacement program is the second such initiative introduced in the last few weeks . \nHowever, whereas the battery replacements are free, devices affected by the Touch Disease flaw, which causes degradation of display sensitivity and, in some cases, screen flickering will be subject to a $149 charge. \nThis is because Apple believes the issue has, in part, been caused by users repeatedly dropping devices on hard surfaces. \n  \nHave you been experiencing random iPhone 6S shutdowns?

      "title": "Apple: A Dividend Achiever in the Making",
      "text": "How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock? \nApple is not on this list. It only resumed paying a dividend in 2012 after nearly a two-decade hiatus. \nBut that doesn’t mean Apple is a weak business. It has an incredibly strong competitive advantage – and one of the (if not the most) well-known brands in the world. \nBut it could be argued that Apple will surely be a Dividend Achiever – and very likely a Dividend Aristocrat – over time. \nBusiness overview \nApple is a huge technology company with a wide lineup of products. It manufactures cell phones, laptops and tablets under the iPhone, Mac and iPad brands. It also sells other products like Apple TV. \nThe iPhone is Apple’s most important product. It currently represents 60% of Apple’s revenue. The iPhone was a game changer for Apple. The innovation of the iPhone allowed Apple to take the lion’s share of profits in the smartphone industry. \nApple does not receive the highest market share in the industry, but it makes up for this with extremely high margins and growth. \nIndeed, Apple’s growth of revenue and earnings per share over the past five years has been extremely impressive. \nSource: 2016 10-K , page 24 \nConditions over the past year have soured, however. Now that Apple has finished the iPhone 6 cycle, the company is seeing a modest deterioration. Earnings per share fell 10% in fiscal 2016. \nFortunately, Apple recently unveiled a major new product release, the iPhone 7. This should rejuvenate iPhone sales, which is critically important for the company. Apple will benefit from its booming services business. \nAs a result, the company should see more than enough growth to provide shareholders with double-digit dividend growth each year moving forward. \nGrowth prospects \nThe market continues to trade Apple at a frustratingly low price-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 13. Compare this with the Standard & Poor's 500, which trades for a P/E ratio of 25. Investors seem to doubt Apple’s growth potential as the company’s results last year were a disappointment. \nWhile Apple did take a step back in fiscal 2016, it is not because of a fundamental deterioration of the business. Instead, the company simply took a \"breather\" because it did not benefit from a major new iPhone release. \nThis is an important distinction. Apple is a lot like a baseball player who hits his home runs in “bunches.” Apple produces huge growth when it comes out with new products and suffers mild declines in the interim years. \nViewing Apple over a two-year frame further explains this dynamic. \nSource: 2016 10-K , page 26 \nApple suffered declining revenue across its three biggest geographic segments, but there is more to this story than meets the eye. The company simply suffered from very difficult comparisons, given the huge growth rates seen in fiscal 2015 due to the iPhone 6 release. \nApple management understands that, with inconsistent growth rates, the stock is likely to retain a below-average P/E ratio. In response, the company is planning more regular updates to its product line. The hope is that this will create a smoother revenue stream. \nOne way it plans to do this is by investing in its services business. Apple’s services platform includes the App Store, iTunes, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple Care. \nSource: 2016 10-K , page 28 \nServices are growing at a high level. Growth is accelerating as consumers are using services at an increasing rate. For example, last quarter services revenue increased 24% year over year to $6.3 billion. This was a record quarterly performance for the services business. \nApple will also realize growth from new geographic markets. The company continues to grow in China and will look to India for future growth. Apple has only about a 3% market share in India. \nApple’s lower-priced iPhone SE should compete well in the India market, where consumers typically purchase lower-priced devices. \nDividend analysis \nIt is not an exaggeration to say that Apple has one of the securest dividends in the entire market. The company has a highly profitable business model with several competitive advantages. Famous quality/value investor Warren Buffett bought into Apple despite his long-standing aversion to technology businesses. \nIn addition, Apple has a pristine balance sheet. It has a mountain of cash with a modest debt position. Apple ended last quarter with $237 billion of cash, marketable securities and long-term investments. This dwarfs its $75 billion in long-term debt. \nLastly, Apple’s dividend takes up only a small portion of its earnings per share. Apple currently distributes $2.28 per share in annual dividends. This represents 27% of Apple’s fiscal 2016 earnings per share. \nIts extremely low payout ratio leaves plenty of room for many years of dividend growth up ahead. \nFinal thoughts \nThe Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Achievers lists are great places to look for investors interested in dividend growth stocks, but they shouldn’t be the only places you look. \nInvestors may be limiting themselves by only considering stocks that already qualify for these lists. By doing so, an investor may make the mistake of missing the next Dividend Achievers or Dividend Aristocrats. \nApple has a 2% dividend yield and is not yet a Dividend Achiever. This seems fairly unimpressive at first glance. But Apple has indicated plans to increase its dividend by at least 10% per year going forward. \nThe company certainly has the fundamental strength to become a Dividend Achiever and possibly a Dividend Aristocrat in time. \nDisclosure: I am not long any of the stocks mentioned in this article. \nStart a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.

      "text": "– A + Executive leading HealthKit, other software platforms leaves Apple By Roger Fingas \nFriday, December 02, 2016, 12:37 pm PT (03:37 pm ET) \nAn executive hired to lead teams responsible for HealthKit, CareKit, and ResearchKit —as well as related machine learning algorithms —has left Apple after just a few months on the job, a report said on Friday.\n\n\n\n\nYoky Matsuoka was only hired in May and reported to Jeff Williams, the company's COO and its head of teams for the Apple Watch and various health initiatives, Bloomberg explained . The reason for the departure is unknown, as Apple has refused to comment and Matsuoka herself has stayed silent.\n\nThe executive is veteran of the technology industry though, with accomplishments like co-founding Google X, and helping to invent a robotic hand. Most recently she was a VP at Alphabet's Nest Labs, where she developed the technology that lets the Nest Thermostat automatically adapt to habits and conditions.\n\nApple has been building up its health teams for years, initially with the Apple Watch in mind, but more recently to expand its \"Kit\" platforms and embark in new directions. Earlier this year the company met with U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials to discuss things like \"two possible (and related) products in the cardiac space\" and a project involving Parkinson's disease.\n\nDiagnosis is also thought to be a major interest of the company moving forward, with CEO Tim Cook suggesting that there should be a human equivalent of the \"check oil\" light on a car. Matsuoka may have been hired to help with these efforts.",

      "text": "  10 Perfect Gift Ideas for iPhone Owners Check out some great accessories for Apple's popular and powerful smartphone by Brent Dirks December 2, 2016 \nEven though it’s hard to believe, the iPhone is nearing its 10th anniversary in 2017. And in that time, Apple has sold more than 1 billion handsets – a staggering amount. \nWhile the handset can do so much on its own, the wide amount of accessories help add another layer of usefulness to the awesome smartphone. Here are 10 perfect holiday gift ideas for any iPhone owner on your list. What you can read about: show full table of contents Anker Slim Shell for the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus Anker Slim Shell for the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus \nBlack is back with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. With the new handsets, Apple unveiled a pair of unique shades – matte black and the very popular jet black. If you’re wanting to protect your expensive new iPhone but show off its color, take a look at the Anker Slim Shell. \nThe SlimShell is made with a hardened polycarbonate material for maximum protection. Along with a smooth finish, the case also sports removable side buttons. A complete clear version for the iPhone 7 is just $9.99 while the case for the larger handset is $3 more . Eero Home Wi-Fi System \nIn a modern home, Wi-Fi is almost as important as electricity and running water. And while you can pay your cable or phone company a bundle for fast Internet service, actually getting those super speeds in every nook and cranny of a home is often times easier said than done. \nEero wants to throw the idea of using just a single router out the window. In its place, the system is designed to create an enterprise-like mesh network around your home using multiple access points. One device is recommended for every 1,000 square feet. \nThere are two different ways to get started as you can purchase a single unit for $190.02 or a pack of three for $461.83 . \nThe retail price for the three Eero system is somewhere the neighborhood of twice as expensive as the most advanced consumer-grade router. That’s a pretty penny, but at least in my testing, it passed my testing with flying colors. Bluesmart Black Edition International Luggage \nEven luggage is getting smart. A perfect option for frequent travelers, Bluesmart’s Black Edition International Luggage can do a lot more than carry your clothes. The carry-on rolling bag sports built-in GPS and 3G connectivity, so you can locate it anywhere in the world using the companion iPhone app. Take that lost luggage. \nThat’s far from the only trick in up its sleeve. A built-in power bank can charge your iPhone if it ever goes dead. The app can also control the TSA-approved lock so you can control the contents from an iPhone. It can be set to even automatically lock if you move far enough away from it. \nAnd you’ll never have to hope that your bag clocks in below airline-mandated weight limits. Weight sensors can tell you exactly how much your carrying before traveling. Dog & Bone LockSmart mini \nWhile technology like Apple Pay is helping us leave our credit cards at home, most of us still need to carry around a host of keys. But with the Dog & Bone LockSmart mini, you can lighten your load a bit. It looks like a normal padlock, but there’s one big twist – there’s no place to insert a key. Instead, you’ll use the companion iPhone app to lock and unlock it. Completely waterproof, it can be placed anywhere, and the built-in battery can go for up to two years before needing to be recharged via the micro-USB plug. With the app, access can be shared with other users and you can even track who has access the lock. Pearl RearVision \nFounded by three former Apple employees, Pearl Automation first device is designed to help give your older vehicle a big upgrade. As you could probably tell by the name, Pearl RearVision is an iPhone-connected backup camera made for any car. \nThe completely wireless camera-equipped license plate frame connects to the back of you vehicle. The weatherproof device is charged by the sun and connects to an iPhone via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. You’ll need to connect a small dongle to a car’s OBD port as well. \nThere are two HD cameras with wide-angle lenses built into that can provide a view exactly what’s behind you, even at night. When connecting to the app, you’ll be able to see a rear view and the app will even alert you to obstacles in the car’s path. Griffin iTrip Clip \nIf you’re an iPhone 7 users, there’s no need to trash your regular wired, headphones. Griffin’s iTrip Clip can turn any old pair of headphones into a wireless set. \nUsers will plug their wired headphones into the small adapter than can connect to any Bluetooth-capable device. The adapter features a play, volume, and track control buttons. An integrated microphone will allow anyone to receive handsfree calls and even access Siri. \nAs a nice touch, the adapter will automatically connect to paired devices once in range, which is around 30 feet. The built-in battery can provide up to six hours of use and 180 hours of standby time. It can also be used in a car with an AUX in port but without Bluetooth capability. Blink Home Security Camera System \nWhile there are a huge number of Wi-Fi enabled home security cameras to select from, most still require at least one wire, the power cable. But the Blink system is completely wireless. Each camera is powered by a pair of included AA lithium batteries. Blink says the batteries should last for up to a year with “normal” use. \nEach camera is a little wider than a deck of cards. The middle is dominated by the motion sensor. The camera is on top while under it is a small LED that turns on when the camera needs to capture video in low-light scenarios. There is no true night vision capability found on other camera systems designed for home use. \nSince there are no wires to contend with, a camera can be placed virtually anywhere inside your home, as long as it is within 100 feet of the sync module. \nOne camera and the Wi-Fi sync module retails for $99 while the three-camera system is reasonably priced at $229 . If you want to start small and possibly expand later, additional cameras are $70 each.",

      "text": "Last Updated: DEC 02, 2016 New Delhi Email Author Photo: Veniamin Geskin \nRumours about the iPhone 8 began surfacing long before we were done predicting about the iPhone 7. And they were not some burly imaginative renders that looked futuristic but the ones that made some real sense to the tech Nostradamus in us.So far, a lot has been revealed about the next iPhone. All this information gives a small, a tiny hint into what Apple might have in store for us the next year, especially when that year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary. So let's take a quick look at what we know so far. Design and build quality \nMost rumours hint that the iPhone 8 will come in two sizes and three models -- 4.7 inch, 5.5 inch and 5.5 inch OLED. Or, it could come in these three sizes -- 5.2 inch, 5.5 inch and 5.8 inch, with the last two having OLED screens. Apple might adopt bigger sizes, but from earlier experience we know that abandoning the 4.7-inch size phone could have dire consequences. So chances of that happening aren't that high. \nWord about curved display is also doing rounds on the internet. And that of a bezel-less display have similar ring to it. If there is going to be a 5.8-inch curved OLED display on an iPhone 8, it might end up looking like the Note 7 running iOS, and Apple surely wouldn't want that. Let's discuss more on bezel-less screens in the display section below. \nThen there is the tale of disappearing home button. Apple replaced the clickable home button with touch button on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that has haptic feedback built into it. The company may go a step further with the iPhone 8 by entirely removing the home button. The claim is supported by a patent that Apple filed, which talked of a capacitive fingerprint sensor with a \"dielectric structure having a contact surface\" Also Read: iPhone 7 Plus in Varanasi: Apple's newest phone meets one of oldest cities in the world \nWireless charging is something that all the variants of iPhone 8 will possibly have. Or at least that is what a report that cites information from Foxconn suggests. But the rumour that the iPhone would be charged without using a charging pad, what some may call \"true wireless charging\", is rubbish. We don't have a technology yet, not even in the developing phase, where a charger can transfer current to a small electronic device kept several meters away. Pad charging is acceptable and very probable, given the phone is required to have a glass design. Display Apple will be switching to a different technology for its screens. The OLED screens that SHARP CEO Tai Jeng-wu confirmed Apple would be using in iPhone 8 would suck less battery than the previous LTPS displays. But the report that hints that full face of the iPhone 8 will be covered by the screen is a little hard to believe. OLED display technology is quite advanced, and we already have devices that carry a curved screen made using that display. But unless the ever invincible, unbreakable glass is invented, I am skeptical of smartphone companies handing over the front to the screen completely.OLED displays are sharper and brighter than LTPS panels. But Apple may not use it on all of the iPhone 8 variants. On one or two it may keep the good old LCD retina display alive because it is much loved by the users and the LCD screens have ability to show more accurate colours. Also Read: iPhone 8 may come with truly wireless charging and bezel-less curved display Performance \nRaising the bar with every iPhone, Apple has this habit of topping the performance charts with its new processor in the iPhone. Year after year. The iPhone 8 will possibly house the next-gen Apple chipset - the A11 -- and we expect it to keep up the tradition of the being significantly faster in benchmarks than the A10 inside the iPhone 7. \nA11 is said to be manufactured by TMSC (and not Samsung as many reports stated earlier) on its 10nm processes. Qualcomm snapdragon 835 is also built on a similar process, but by Samsung. It is believed that TMSC will also use the 10nm process for MediaTek and HiSilicon processors. Camera After a dual-camera setup (rear camera having two sensors) on the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple will undoubtedly further spruce up the photography performance on the iPhone 8. In the iPhone 7 Plus, the telephoto lens lacks optical image stabilisation. Apple will possibly fix this in the iPhone 8. In fact, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is often accurate about Apple, says that the company will be using the dual camera setup on iPhone 8 with OIS on both lenses. In the world of Android, Hauwei has already deployed OIS in both lenses in the Mate 9. Also Read: Huawei launches Mate 9 Pro with 2K curved screen, 6GB RAM The Unknowns \nAlthough a lot of information related to the iPhone 8 is tricking out of the Apple campus, there are many bits that are still unknown. We don't know much about the front camera of the iPhone 8. Many Android companies are focusing heavily on the front camera and it is possible that Apple may also join the bandwagon with the iPhone 8. It may put in a better image sensor for the front camera in the phone as well as may give it a wider lens. \nWe know the home button is going away in the iPhone 8, at least the rumours say it, and there is a possibility that too ease the unlocking of the phone, Apple may include an Iris Scanner in the phone. \nAnd then there is the battery. Not much is known about that but the chances are that the iPhone 8 may get a bigger and longer lasting battery, along with possibly faster charging because some of these solutions -- the Dash charging in OnePlus 3, for example -- are already there in the Android phones and consumers like them. We also haven't heard anything about the internal storage and RAM. But chances are that RAM is going to be 3GB, which will be similar to what high-end Android phones have nowadays, while the base internal storage will be 32GB. Until this year, it used to be 16GB before Apple changed it with the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Chances are that Apple won't change it again in just one year. Pricing and availability Apple keeps the same base price for every launch, and will probably be the same with iPhone 8. It is expected to somewhere between Rs 50,000-Rs 55,000. Given the 10th anniversary occasion there might be a special edition device costing more. But otherwise, expect the obvious. The phones will be launching in September.

      "text": "Yoky Matsuoka. After just five months at Apple, Yoky Matsuoka is reportedly leaving the company.\nBloomberg reported Friday that Matsuoka, a former University of Washington robotics professor, is departing from Apple.\nMatsuoka oversaw health initiatives at Apple like HealthKit and ResearchKit. We’ve contacted Matsuoka for more details and will update this post when we hear back.\nMatsuoka taught robotics at the UW and Carnegie Mellon, a job she left to join Google in 2009. After helping to start Google X , she officially left UW in 2012 and joined Nest, where she helped build the learning software behind the company’s smart thermostat.\nShe rejoined Google for a short time in 2014 when the search giant bought Nest, but left for a job a Twitter the next year. However, health problems kept her from taking taking the job . After a year off and a full recovery, she joined Apple in May.\nBesides her work on robotic hands, Matsuoka won a MacArthur Foundation genius grant for her part in helping stroke victims use limbs.\nApple continues to invest in its health-related projects that range from apps on the Apple Watch to software that utilizes machine learning for analyzing patient health data. Apple is investing heavily in machine learning , as evidenced by its $200 million acquisition in August of Seattle-based startup Turi, a UW spin-off that helps developers and data scientists build machine learning into their apps and research projects.",

      "text": "UK standards body says 99% of fake Apple chargers sold are unsafe Buy quality products, avoid the fakes on Dec 2, 2016, 4:30 PM TechSpot \nApple recently sued US-based firm Mobile Star LLC for trademark infringement, alleging that it has been selling counterfeit goods using Apple logos and product images in its Amazon listings. While the company is looking to protect its brand name, it also argues that buying one of these fakes means you could be putting yourself at risk of fire and even “deadly” electric shock. They are often poorly built with inferior or missing parts, flawed designs, and inadequate electrical insulation. \nThe Chartered Trading Standards Institute, a UK consumer protection organization, recently recently ran its own tests as part of an investigation into the safety of counterfeit Apple chargers. The result? Out of 400 units all but three “ failed a basic safety test ,” in which high voltages were applied to the chargers to see if they had enough isolation to protect against electric shocks. \nThe tests tests were performed by safety specialists UL and the chargers were bought online from eight different countries, including the US, China and Australia. \nLeon Livermore, the chief executive of Chartered Trading Standards Institute, urged shoppers to buy electrical goods only from trusted suppliers. “It might cost a few pounds more, but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home or even your life.” \nIndeed, paying $30 for a phone charger is ridiculous, but buying a poor quality counterfeit can damage your devices and put yourself at risk. This has become an increasingly troublesome issue for Amazon and is one of the reasons the company is finally cracking down on fake products . \nIt should be noted that it’s “counterfeit” and not all “third-party” cables and chargers that are considered dangerous. Brands like Amazon Basics, Anker, Monoprice and a few others have been producing quality UL-certified cables and chargers for a fraction of the cost of their original Apple counterparts.

      "text": "Random iPhone 6s shutdowns due to faulty battery component, Apple says Apple is offering a fix free of charge after a China consumer group complained about the problem U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | December 2, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 6s 40% off Corsair Waterproof Shockproof 256GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive - Deal Alert \nA problem with iPhone 6s products randomly shutting down comes from a battery flaw found in a small number of models, according to Apple. \nAfter a Chinese consumer watchdog group reported the issue, Apple is offering a fix free of charge to any eligible iPhone 6s user through its customer support sites. \nOn Friday, Apple explained on its Chinese site that the problem was found in iPhone 6s devices containing a faulty battery component. This component was \"exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have\" before it was assembled into the battery packs, Apple said. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \n\"As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur,\" the company said. \nHowever, the faulty components were only found only in a \"small number\" of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015. \n\"It's important to note, this is not a safety issue,\" Apple said. Its iPhones are built to automatically shut down under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature, to protect the device's electronics. \nApple has posted customer support websites where consumers can submit their iPhone 6s serial numbers to see if they are eligible for a battery replacement. \nLast month, the China Consumers Association asked the company to investigate the shutdown issues, after receiving a \"considerable number\" of complaints from iPhone users in the country. \nThe shutdowns would occur when the device’s battery charge dropped between 60 to 50 percent in both cold and room-temperature environments, according to the association. The phones would also fail to turn on unless connected to a power supply. \nAlthough Apple claims to have addressed the problem, the China Consumers Association said earlier this week that consumers continue to complain the shutdown issues are also found in older iPhone 6 and 6 plus models. \nIn addition, consumers with iPhone 6s models built outside the September and October 2015 date range have also reported the problem. \nThe China Consumers Association has asked Apple to investigate the other claims. But on Friday, Apple said it had found no other problems. \n\"We looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly,\" the company said. \"After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports.\" Related:",

      "text": "December 2, 2016 1:00 pm From left: Roku; Apple; Amazon If you're looking to stream Netflix, Amazon, Hulu or other services for the first time, want to upgrade to the latest tech, or want to give a loved one the gift of streaming, here are the most popular hardware options to choose from. Chromecast Chromecast Ultra The idea of “casting” can scare nontechies. It shouldn’t: Simply plug the tiny Chromecast into your TV and, after an easy setup via a smartphone or tablet, you’ll be able to use those devices to stream Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. to your television. If you own a Google Home, voice command allows you to instruct the Chromecast to play YouTube videos (more apps like Netflix will be compatible soon). $69 Apple Apple TV You ask Siri the weather. Why not also instruct her to “Show me TV shows with James Marsden”? The Siri-enabled Apple TV (available in 32GB and 64GB) will search iTunes and Netflix for a list you can then narrow down by saying, “Just the Westerns” or “Just the new ones.” One issue: Apple TV doesn’t have an Amazon app, so the only way to watch Amazon Prime shows is to stream them to the device via another Apple product. $149–$199 Amazon Amazon Fire Stick, Fire TV Like shoes and bags, your player should match your TV. The Fire TV runs 4K Ultra HD video, so it pairs well with new souped-up sets. While little bro the Stick doesn’t, it’s low in price and super small (more counter space!). Both have remotes that run Amazon’s voice assistant, Alexa. Want to rewind to see that Grey’s Anatomy kiss again? Say, “Rewind 30 seconds.” Want to skip the Walking Dead in which Glenn dies? Say, “Next episode.” Fire Stick: $40; Fire TV: $90 Roku Roku Stick, Roku Ultra Think of the easiest thing to do. Using a Roku is easier. The pared-down home screens make getting to Netflix, Hulu and other platforms brainless. The search function is “agnostic” and won’t prioritize one streaming service’s content over another’s—so you’ll never accidentally buy a movie you can watch through one of your monthly subscriptions. The Roku Stick is the only portable device with a quad-core processor (i.e., it works as smoothly as the bigger boxes). The Ultra plays 4K video, has a voice-controlled remote and a “lost remote finder” feature. Roku Stick: $50; Roku Ultra: $130 < >",

      "text": "Random iPhone 6S shutdowns due to faulty battery component, Apple says Apple is offering a free fix after a consumer group in China complained about the problem U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 2, 2016 12:47 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 6s Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! \nA problem with iPhone 6S products randomly shutting down comes from a battery flaw found in a small number of models, according to Apple. \nAfter a Chinese consumer watchdog group reported the issue, Apple is offering a fix free of charge to any eligible iPhone 6S user through its customer support sites. \nOn Friday, Apple explained on its Chinese site that the problem was found in iPhone 6S devices containing a faulty battery component. This component was \"exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have\" before it was assembled into the battery packs, Apple said. \n\"As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur,\" the company said. \nHowever, the faulty components were only found only in a \"small number\" of iPhone 6S devices made in September and October 2015. \n\"It's important to note, this is not a safety issue,\" Apple said. Its iPhones are built to automatically shut down under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature, to protect the device's electronics. \nApple has posted customer support websites where consumers can submit their iPhone 6S serial numbers to see if they are eligible for a battery replacement. \nLast month, the China Consumers Association asked the company to investigate the shutdown issues, after receiving a \"considerable number\" of complaints from iPhone users in the country. \nThe shutdowns would occur when the device’s battery charge dropped from 60 percent to 50 percent in both cold and room-temperature environments, according to the association. The phones would also fail to turn on unless connected to a power supply. \nAlthough Apple claims to have addressed the problem, the China Consumers Association said earlier this week that consumers continue to complain the shutdown issues are also found in older iPhone 6 and 6 plus models. \nIn addition, consumers with iPhone 6S models built outside the September and October 2015 date range have also reported the problem. \nThe China Consumers Association has asked Apple to investigate the other claims. But on Friday, Apple said it had found no other problems. \n\"We looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly,\" the company said. \"After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports.\"   Related:",

      "text": "Apple and Samsung woes shake smartphone suppliers Slowing sales and Galaxy Note 7 furore turn spotlight on other growth areas Read next by: Louise Lucas in Hong Kong \nWhen the Apple tree is shaken, the effect is felt in the lower branches — the myriad companies supplying the hundreds of parts that go into a smartphone. \nThe tree has taken some shaking this year. Of the two companies that dominate the smartphone sector, Apple last quarter reported the first annual decline in iPhone sales volumes . Samsung has been burnt by the furore around the exploding Galaxy Note 7 . \nMore broadly, Gartner, the consultancy, forecasts smartphone sales to rise just 7 per cent this year, half the rate of 2015, adding to worries that the vast industry formed about the production of smartphones will soon be starved of growth. \n“With sales of 1.5bn a year, smartphones are a monster market,” says Steven Pelayo, tech analyst at HSBC, who points to the relatively smaller PC and tablet markets. “It’s been a supercycle that has cannibalised everything. But what’s the next big driver?” \nThat question is ricocheting around the boardrooms and factory floors across Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and China. Apple alone relies on more than 200 suppliers for its products, the vast majority based in Asia. \nAs chief executive of Japan Display, which generates 85 per cent of its revenues from smartphone makers and half from Apple, Mitsuru Homma knows the quandary only too well. \n“If we stay with smartphones, then five to 10 years later JDI will probably no longer exist,” he says. “I feel very much the sense of crisis.” \nEven the Japanese government, JDI’s main shareholder, is in agreement, he adds. The display maker is looking to diversify into supplying the devices linked to the internet of things and artificial intelligence. \nMr Homma sees opportunities in self-driving cars, which will require interactive screens and maybe entire smart dashboards as well as medical monitors where the highest resolution can be, literally, a matter of life or death, and virtual reality. \n[Smartphones have] been a supercycle that has cannibalised everything. But what’s the next big driver? Steven Pelayo, tech analyst at HSBC \nCars also feature in Sony ’s plans, along with the internet of things. The Japanese consumer electronics group staked its fortunes on image sensors and now boasts a 40 per cent market share by value. “Image sensors are input devices, so we believe there are new markets out there,” says Tsutomu Haruta, general manager. \nSony’s advantages, according to Shoichi Kitayama, general manager, are that its sensors can see bikes and people in the dark and pictures remain sharp even in high temperatures. Come 2025, he says, the average car will have two or three image sensors. At the top end that will stretch to 10. \n“The economies of scale will be comparable to smartphones and will come close in terms of wafers used,” he says. \nBut he concedes those markets are new and untested — and for now are going to be smaller than the smartphone bounty. \nQuite substantially smaller on Mr Pelayo’s reckoning. The semiconductor content per car is forecast to double from $350 to $700 by 2020 — equivalent to adding more than two iPhones, with about $150 in chip content apiece, in the average car over the next four years, or roughly one-half of an iPhone every year. \nWith about 80m cars shipped a year, this would equate to about 40m more iPhones “or less than two weeks of smartphone production”. \nThe numbers pan out similarly miserably for other applications: the 2m virtual reality headsets expected to be sold this year; the 12m annual servers sold or even the 20m Apple watches. \nSome are undeterred by the punier numbers, pointing out that smartphones are still in the picture for now, albeit growing slower and with an evolving modus operandi. \n“You’ve got to look at what the smartphone brands are doing,” says Cherry Ma, tech analyst at CLSA. She spots two trends that will drive growth in certain areas: smartphone makers upgrading cameras, sound and aesthetics in an attempt to win share; and a consumer swing towards Chinese handset manufacturers. \nThis year will see as many as 20 handsets featuring dual cameras offering better image quality, up from just one device last year. While global handset sales have grown 1-2 per cent this year, Chinese brands combined are growing at 20 per cent, she says. \n“Even though the smartphone market is getting saturated, there is growth in dual camera phones so there are more image sensors in each phone,” says Sony’s Mr Haruta. He adds that while the number of smartphone players has been winnowed down, the top players are focused on cameras. \nSmartphones and their number of components © FT Graphic",

      "title": "Apple Watch Series 1 review",
      "text": "Apple Watch Series 1 review Back to the future @hughlangley \nHow often should smartwatches iterate? It's a difficult question. Motorola isn't seeing the benefit in doing it yearly, and it's not the only one. Apple chose to wait 18 months between the first and second models of its smartwatch, but that may still have been short enough to irk those who spent a great deal of money on the first. \nBut it didn't just launch a sequel in the Apple Watch Series 2 ; it refreshed and revamped the original model into what has become the Series 1, which lacks the built-in GPS, waterproofing and better screen of the Series 2. It does, however, trump the original model with a dual-core processor, making it noticeably faster. Price when reviewed: $269 Check current price \nApple has also discontinued the original model entirely - just as well, it could get a bit confusing otherwise - meaning the Series 1 is now your cheapest option if you're looking to get an Apple Watch. But this raises more questions. Is it worth getting when the Series 2 is available? And what if you already have an original Apple Watch - should you upgrade to the Series 1 instead? Apple Watch Series 1: Design \nApple Watch Series 1 shown left, original right \nIf you can't see any difference in looks, that's because there aren't any. The Series 1 is identical to the original Apple Watch and ostensibly the Series 2, although the latter is actually 0.9mm thicker. You'll only notice that if you put them side by side, but if anyone sees an Apple Watch on your wrist, we guarantee they'll have no clue which version they're looking at. \nWhere the Series 1 does lack, however, is in choice of materials. While combinations of colours and straps are plentiful, Apple is only offering the Series 1 in the Sports model; if you want a stainless steel case, you'll have to go for the Series 2. \nThis makes sense on a price level as you'd theoretically end up paying more for a stainless steel Series 1 than a Sport Series 2, but some people who don't care for the additional fitness features might be wishing Apple offered the pared-down model in a classier material. \nStill, you've got the option of silver, gold, rose gold and space grey cases, with loads of bands both inside and outside Apple's store, so there's plenty of potential to jazz it up to your liking. \nThe 450 nit display on the Series 1 remains the same as the first, while the Series 2 has a marked improvement of 1,000 nits. I've always thought the Apple Watch screen was good, even in sunlight, but you'll get more brightness out of Series 2. Waterproofing is also different, and keen swimmers may be better going for Series 2 because of it. The Series 1 has the same IPX7 rating at the first watch which means you can shower with it no problem. The rating technically means it can withstand immersion in water up to one meter for up to 30 minutes, but Apple recommends against dunking it, and so would we. Apple Watch Series 1: Performance \nThis is where the Series 1 outpaces the first Apple Watch, or \"Series 0\" if you prefer. Apple has included the new S1P dual-core processor, and it makes a noticeable difference. The S1P is different to the S2 chipset of the Series 2, which differs due to the inclusion of GPS, but speed wise the Series 1 and Series 2 are the same. \nAnd that's really good news. Performance was one of our main problems with the first Apple Watch. It was often sluggish when moving between menus, hanging when opening apps, and quite stuttery overall. That's not us being persnickety; we'd often be waiting on that spinning wheel for as twice as long as it would take to reach into our pocket, take out our phone and open the app on there instead. It was in those moments that the watch had defeated its purpose. \nWith Series 1, the experience is much smoother with noticeably less judder when moving around the operating system. Opening apps is much faster, the spinning wheel of frustration now making only minor cameos. It does pop up when loading apps that aren't in the dock, but it sits on the screen for a couple of seconds at most. On the original model I could be waiting for ten seconds, maybe even longer, for an app to boot - and sometimes still am, even with OS3 installed. When you're trying to open something like Shazam to identify a song, why bother? \nI've heard some people say the display shows up a little faster when raising the Series 1 watch, but side by side it's been the same for me in testing. The battery life is very similar too, although I'm getting a little more out of the Series 1 than my original. Part of this, I think, is that over time the battery of my Series 0 has worn a bit, but I also think the new processor is helping get a little more life out of the battery as well - probably because it's not working so hard to open apps all the time (I usually notice more battery being sucked out when booting apps on the watch). \nI can get about a day out of it with normal use, which isn't quite as good as what we've had on the Series 2. In both cases it's less than what we'd like from a smartwatch, but Apple thinks most people are fine with charging it on their bedside overnight. That will obviously have to change if it ever adds proper sleep tracking tech to the watch, which we suspect it eventually will. Right now there are third party apps like Sleep++ which do let you track, but they're quite basic and if you do want to monitor your shut-eye then you'll need to be more vigilant about charging. Luckily the Series 1, as with all the other models, charges up pretty quickly. Apple Watch Series 1: Watch OS 3 and fitness \nThe other big change that comes with Series 1 is Watch OS3. OS3 can be downloaded on the original model too, and doing so will bring some improvements to performance, but overall I'm still finding it sluggish at times - the spinning wheel of frustration still lingers more than it should do. \nThe Series 1 is better equipped for the new software, and it's the smooth experience the Apple Watch should have been when it launched in 2015. We've discussed the merits of OS3 in both our Series 2 review and my initial review of the software , so I'm not going to delve too deep into it again here. However it does feel like Apple is listening and learning how people use its watch, and with OS3 it feels like the company admitting it got things wrong and making the changes.",

      "title": "Apple's Steve Jobs: Parisians Are Fighting Naming a Street After Him",
      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Parisians Are Up in Arms Over Naming a Street After Steve Jobs \nA proposal to name a street after the late Apple chief executive and co-founder Steve Jobs has divided the leftist city council of a Paris district. \nThe local district mayor wants to call one of several new streets around the vast Halle Freyssinet high-tech startup hub the “Rue Steve Jobs” in honor of the U.S. inventor of the iPhone who died in 2011. \nBut Green and Communist local councilors in Paris’s 13th district don’t like the idea because of Apple’s aapl social and fiscal practices. \n“Steve Jobs was chosen because of his impact on the development of personal computing and because he was a real entrepreneur,” said a spokeswoman for mayor Jerome Coumet, defending the proposal. \nShe said other streets would be named after British computer scientist and code-breaker Alan Turing, U.K. mathematician and computer pioneer Ada Lovelace, U.S. naval officer and computer programming pioneer Grace Murray Hopper, and French civil engineer Eugene Freyssinet, who invented pre-stressed concrete. \nLeftist councilors are not impressed however by Jobs’ reputation and heritage. \nThey criticized working conditions at Apple’s Chinese subcontractors as well as the iPhone maker’s alleged tax avoidance methods in Ireland, which have come under fire from the European Commission. \n“The choice of Steve Jobs is misplaced in light of the heritage he has left behind,” communist local councilors said in a statement. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nThe Paris city council, in which leftist parties have a majority, will take a vote on the issue sometime next week. \n“Steve Jobs is not a perfect man, but he has changed our daily lives by popularizing computers, the mouse and the smartphone,” Coumet said on his Twitter twtr feed. \nHalle Freyssinet, a former freight railway station designed in 1929, will become one of Europe’s biggest start-up hubs and will house some 1,000 start-ups when it opens early next year.

Business Insider spotted the release .\nAn English text version of the statement was included in the release. You can read it below in full.\nImage: apple/screengrab\nNow that the cause for the shutdowns has come to light, hopefully the statement will be visible for all Apple customers —not just those accessing the Chinese language site.\nWhen reached for comment, Apple representatives had nothing to add to the statement.\nBONUS: This shape-shifting furniture assembles like LEGO",

      "text": "As I started the DirecTV Now app on my Apple TV, Storage Wars spilled across my screen -- and I couldn't change the channel fast enough. \nMy reflex wasn't related to my feelings about the A&E show. Rather, it's a critique of DirecTV's new cord-cutting service. Whether you watch its live television service through your Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, or computer's web browser, the video feed comes on instantly -- just like it would if you were watching a normal TV. And that's both a great decision and terrible design, b ecause through over-the-top services like DirecTV Now, television essentially works like a utility. So, just like your water faucet or lights, beware of leaving the TV running, as I'll explain. \nBut first, it's worth explaining what DirecTV Now actually is. Pulling video from DirecTV (without needing a satellite dish), the service takes aim at cable companies by delivering television programming over the Internet. DirecTV Now offers four packages ranging in price from $35 to $70 per month, which include between more than 60 to at least 120 channels of live and on-demand video, along with some local stations. Though I only tested the service on Apple gear, it's also accessible via Amazon , Android, Chrome and Google's Cast devices. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nWith no installers giving me a four-hour setup window, wonky company-owned gear, or annoying contracts, DirecTV Now's setup is advertised to be a snap. Despite a couple of hiccups, that claim held true. \nStill, immediately after plugging my credit card information into DirecTV's website, my computer's web browser required an update of Microsoft's Silverlight software and a restart in order to view the video stream. Once that software was in place, the first show I pulled up, ESPN's SportsCenter, froze, displaying an error message: \"Hmm... this video is taking a little bit longer than usual to load. Thanks for your patience!\" Given that it was launch day, it's likely new users were rushing to the service, thus the clogged pipes. But since then, other errors have interrupted my viewing, something I never experienced while watching cable TV. \nAnd when it came time to watch my favorite shows, I encountered another unpleasant surprise. It began by me searching the service for \"Colbert\" and finding nothing. I looked for \"Late Show\" instead and found 15 shows and three movies, but not The Late Show with Stephen Colbert . (And demonstrating DirecTV's unsatisfying search capabilities, the movies Clean Slate and 28 Days Later were two of the results). Turns out Colbert isn't available on DirecTV Now, because CBS is surprisingly not included in the package, opting to go direct to consumers with its own subscription-based app instead. \nLeslie Moonves, CEO of CBS , on Maximizing Distribution for Content \nWith more than 120 channels, it'd be exhaustive to list every offering here. So instead I performed some highly unscientific research of asking my friends what their appointment TV-viewing shows are. HBO's shows were a popular response, and the pay channel (as well as Cinemax) are available as add-ons or a rock-bottom price of $5 per month. Sports fans will delight that the MLB, NHL, NBA, and SEC's respective networks are included, though DirecTV's NFL offering is not. Reality TV connoisseurs will lament the lack of Survivor and Amazing Race, since CBS isn't offered. Drama watchers get a mixed bag, missing out on shows like NCIS (CBS, again) but getting all of AMC's award-winners. And kids make out great in the deal, with three different Disney channels and two Nickelodeons. \nAnother major selling point is DirecTV Now's ability to stream local channels, which makes it good for people who enjoy their regional newscasts. But less publicized is that the local TV stations it offers are from major markets only, and vary wildly in consistency. For instance, if you live in Chicago, you'll get local ABC and NBC, but not FOX. And it gets worse from there -- there's not a a single local station to be found where I live in the Pacific Northwest. \nDirecTV Now's video has mostly streamed crisply and quickly, nearly equaling the responsiveness of my Comcast setup on my television and my iPad. But it's worth noting that the resolution of the DirecTV video, while clear, didn't appear to be high definition. Testing it on a 43-inch HDTV, the image looked slightly blurry, and I don't have high expectations for better image clarity on a larger screen. \nHere’s Why AT&T’s DirecTV Now Service Isn’t as Good as It Could Be \nAnd speaking of that big screen experience, DirecTV Now's Apple TV interface is a mess. When you launch the app, you're thrust into whichever show is on the channel you left off watching. Swiping down on the touch pad reveals a bare-boned menu, the same display that appears when you press the remote's 'menu' button. But if you swipe up instead, up pops a richer menu full of channel and show options. Swiping left and right changes the channel, which I wish I had known at the outset. \nCuriously, though you can use the Siri Remote's microphone button to dictate search terms, you can't use Siri to select a program on DirecTV Now, like you can with Hulu and other apps. I'd expect this to change in the near future, but Apple TV still feels like a hobby to the company, despite its claims to the contrary. \nYou can also pause live television on DirecTV Now, but you can't fast forward or rewind it, at least not that I could tell. Some live programs let you rewind them completely to watch from the start, while others give you no such option. And there's no obvious reason why this is the case -- it's probably due to obscure contract negotiations, but to a user it feels utterly random. \nThis odd twist doesn't seem to involve DirecTV Now's on-demand library. The service boasts more than 15,000 videoes, which may seem like a solid number until you start digging in to the offerings. For example, my wife hunkered down to watch the previous night's episode of This Is Us , only to discover that the most recent episode available DirecTV Now was from Oct. 31., making it three episodes behind terrestrial TV. So while this over-the-top service may be good for people who like live television, DirecTV Now subscribers better not be late to the couch. \nThen again, a key selling point for this cord-cutting package is that AT&T wireless customers don't need to watch TV on the couch at all. Though customers of any wireless provider can subscribe to DirecTV Now, AT&T customers get their data \"zero-rated,\" meaning it doesn't count against their monthly data limits. The arrangement comes after AT&T acquired DirecTV in 2015 in a $49 billion deal. \nWhy the FCC Is Blasting Verizon and AT&T Over Net Neutrality \nThat's a sweet deal for AT&T users. But it's a controversial one, too. While telecoms like AT&T t love zero-rating deals because they can provide a competitive advantage, detractors argue such deals can make it harder for upstart services to compete, as users will opt to stream content via a service that won't kill their data budget. It's a bit of an abstract debate, but it's worth considering as you weigh your streaming options. \nEven if zero-rating doesn't bug you, DirecTV's impact on your high-speed Internet bill just might. Just like years ago when mobile data providers started to clamp down on unlimited data caps, many broadband carriers recently have started doing the same. In the past, Internet Service Providers like Comcast have throttled the Internet speeds of customers who downloaded huge quantities of data. Now the country's largest ISP is charging its customers higher rates when their monthly downloads exceed one terabyte. Today's DirecTV Now customers may not have to worry about hitting that limit, but as more people stream 4K video (which is not currently available on this service, but is the future of video, and is not being earnestly deployed by data limit-free cable television services), this will be an issue to sweat. \nSo, when I say that I couldn't turn off Storage Wars soon enough, this far off digital doomsday is what I was eyeing. While it's nice to ape old school television with instant-on video feeds, it's also entirely unnecessary, and will only eat up precious megabytes. This may seem like a minor point, but like DirecTV Now in general, it will be a major shift in how we think about television. People who leave the tube on for background noise or like to fall asleep watching television will need to change their ways if they subscribe to DirecTV Now. Forget Storage Wars . Bandwidth wars are up next. \nThis story was originally published on TIME . ",

      "text": "Reprints Loading the player... \nThe battle to provide the best digital butler for homes is something Amazon ( AMZN ), Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) will be fighting over for years. \nThese in-home devices with artificial intelligence and language processing skills could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track. \nAmazon upped its game with announcement's at its re:Invent AWS user conference that ended Friday. \nAlready, Amazon grabbed an early lead with its digital butler called Echo — a 9-inch tall cylindrical device with speaker and wireless internet connection. It's infused with artificial intelligence and the ability to understand language, providing the brains that bring Alexa, the voice of Echo, to life. Simply ask, and Echo plays music from the cloud and delivers broadcast news, sports, weather and many other features via the voice of Alexa. It can also control lights in the home. The Echo sells for $179.99, with a low-end compact version, the Echo Dot, selling for $49.99. \nThe Google unit of Alphabet recently followed Amazon with the introduction of Google Home , a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant, which sells for $129. IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system . Strong earnings growth (the C and A in the CAN SLIM System, for Current earnings and Annual earnings) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but New products or services often generate stellar profitability. \nMicrosoft has yet to introduce a similar device for the home but has deep roots in artificial intelligence with its Cortana platform, available on mobile devices and PCs. This is also true of Apple with its Siri platform and Facebook ( FB ) with its Messenger platform. Facebook and Microsoft are tapping into software apps for smartphones called bots, software that performs automated tasks. \nThe devices have the potential of being the central hub of a smart-home ecosystem. Amazon is reportedly working on an Echo device that comes with a 7-inch touch screen , according to a Bloomberg report. It said the device could be introduced in the first quarter of 2017. Amazon's Re:Invent Announcements \nAmazon revealed several new services based on artificial intelligence at re:Invent conference, held in Las Vegas. \nOne is Rekognition, a platform that enables developers to build applications that analyze images, and recognize faces, objects, and scenes. \nAmazon also introduced Polly, an artificially intelligent text-to-speech platform that could be used, for example, with software bots to provide a customer service feature. \nA third announcement was Lex, which can be used to build conversational applications. Lex helps power the Amazon Echo device, giving a personality to its voice by Alexa. \nAs to who will be the top dogs in this battle of brains is a wide open debate. Amazon is currently the market leader with Echo, reportedly with more than 4 million sold, but even it has work to do, according to commentary from Edison Investment Research via email. \n\"Still an awful lot of work to do for Amazon,\" Edison said about Echo. \nOn Wednesday, Amazon and Intel ( INTC ) announced a partnership, with two technology initiatives for the smart home ecosystem. \nOne initiative is designed to enable Alexa to remotely control and coordinate device actions with an Intel-based Smart Home Hub. The second is an Intel-based smart speaker reference design with Amazon Alexa included. It is intended to help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services . \n\"We would not be surprised to see Google follow suit in this strategy with Google Assistant where, once again, it will have the advantage because we have long believed that Google Assistant is vastly superior to anything else in terms if the user experience that it offers and the usefulness of its responses,\" the Edison commentary said. \nRBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney in a research note said Amazon has been investing in voice technology for more than five years and believes it could be the next major disruption in computing, serving as a primary user interface in the next computing generation. \n\"We've been hearing many of the 'smartest people' at Amazon want to work on Alexa because they sense it's a major growth area for the company and will be 'something big,' \" Mahaney wrote. \"We believe the Echo devices could be one of the (technology) gifts this holiday season.\" \nMahaney has an outperform rating on Amazon and price target of 950. \nAmazon stock fell 0.45% to 740.34 in the stock market today . The stock has been sliding since hitting an all-time high of 847.21 on Oct. 6. \nPacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin in a research note said initial customer response to the AI applications announced by Amazon at re:Invent was strong and could further complement and differentiate Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. \nBracelin has an overweight rating and price target of 905 on Amazon stock. \nRELATED:",

      "title": "Apple Slashes Supplier Orders For iPhone 7 As Demand Declines: Customers Already Looking Forward To The iPhone 8",
      "text": "Apple - Here's What You May Not Know Now Playing Apple is said to have started reducing orders for the iPhone 7, as demand for the smartphone is now declining. Among the factors for the trend is that both consumers and suppliers are already looking forward to the iPhone 8. ( Jack Taylor | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nApple has started to reduce its orders for the iPhone 7 amid declining demand for the smartphone, according to a report by DigiTimes. \nThe publication's sources, which come from the supply chain in Taiwan, said that demand for the iPhone 7 in China and other markets has decreased significantly since the smartphone was launched in September. Massive Demand For iPhone 7 At Launch Now Fading \nAccording to the sources of DigiTimes, the massive demand during the launch of the iPhone 7 was fueled by the massive customer interest in the jet black option for the smartphone, in combination with the exploding battery issue of the device's supposed rival, Samsung's Galaxy Note 7. \nHowever, the demand for the iPhone 7 is now tapering off, pushing Apple to decrease the quantities of its orders for the smartphone. The trend is similar to the usual slowdown of Apple's iPhone manufacturing process during the end of each year, as demand for the smartphone is at its highest between the period of the traditional September launch and the holiday shopping season. \nAs such, the expected shipments for the iPhone 7 over the first half of 2017 have been affected, with companies in the device's supply chain coming up with conservative estimates. For the first six months of 2017, sales for the smartphone is expected to be at least 5 million units lower compared with the shipment figures from the second half of 2016. Hype For The iPhone 8 \nPart of the reason why demand for the iPhone 7 is declining is the hype that has started to surround its successor and Apple's next flagship smartphone, the iPhone 8. \nBoth customers and component suppliers have shifted their focus on the upcoming smartphone, which is expected to be released some time next year. Instead of purchasing the iPhone 7 now, customers are seemingly holding off on doing so to wait for the iPhone 8, with suppliers ready to take on any orders from Apple concerning the anticipated device. iPhone 8 Rumors \nThe rumor mill has been busy churning out information regarding the upcoming iPhone 8, generating excitement among fans of Apple's smartphone. \nApple is said to be testing more than 10 different prototypes for the iPhone 8, which is expected to feature an overhaul in terms of design and capabilities. Among the rumors on what the iPhone 8 will bring include curved OLED screens and a new 3D dual-lens camera , which Apple is said to be developing with LG.  ",

(Reuters) \nHow much does an Apple iPhone cost in India? While there are many models of the phone available, there is no one price that these, or for that matter, any Apple product, sell at. But the Cupertino-based tech giant may soon remove that anomaly, by setting up its centre in India; this would not only bring price parity, but also help stock products in adequate numbers. Starting 2017, the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers will be available in more Indian cities. That apart, the company will also work with a host of application providers. To ensure more buyers, it will move to a dedicated distribution centre managed by its global logistics partner, DB Schenker, at Bhiwandi, near Mumbai. That should add to Apple’s muscle at a time when it is the country’s second-largest-selling smartphone brand by revenue in FY16. It will also allow Apple to ease operations and streamline logistics and supply-chains for an easier transition to the GST regime. \nMoreover, once the Bhiwandi centre is set up, the company can provide hardware tailored to the needs of its corporate clients. But will the “pivot to India” be enough to revive Apple’s fortunes (they have sagged, lately)? For a country fuelled by aspirations, Apple represents a premium brand. But with the likes of Google and Samsung offering products at a premium and that too a plethora of new features, just new stores may prove to be a game-changer for the company.  ",

      "text": "Off Topic Apple , Battery , iPhone , Thrillist Michael W \nI just came across news of a new Apple repair program where the tech giant will replace some iPhone batteries for free. \nSome iPhone 6S models shut down out of nowhere on their own. If this happens to you, then you might qualify for a free battery replacement. \nThrillist reports that Apple said the issue, which causes the phones to shutdown is just a small number of iPhones manufactured between September and October 2015. \nSo how would one go about getting an iPhone battery replaced? You’ll need to visit an Apple store or authorized service provider. They’ll be able to check if you qualify for the free replacement battery by checking your phone’s serial number. \nOn a positive note, if your iPhone 6S is automatically shutting down, this is not a safety issue. So don’t expect a travel warning or your iPhone to be banned from being brought on planes like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was. \nI’m debating whether or not I should have my iPhone 6S checked out. While it doesn’t shut down frequently, it does freeze up at times. Could it be a battery issue or something else? Who knows, maybe an Apple Genius does! \nFind out more from Thrillist about iPhone batteries being replaced here . Post navigation",

      "text": "What Should My Urine Smell Like? Dec 02, 2016 The urine of a healthy and properly hydrated person should be light in color and have little odor. Health conditions, medications, supplements, the food you eat and dehydration can all affect the smell of your urine. Natural remedies can sometimes help, depending on the cause of your smelly urine.\nIf you are concerned about the odor of your urine you should ask yourself these questions: When did I notice a change in odor? What medications or supplements do I take? Have I added or deleted any supplements from my regime? Do I drink enough water? What is the color of my urine? Do I have pain when I urinate? Do I have any other health conditions? Has my diet changed? Have I been exposed to any new toxins? \nThe answers to the above questions may help you to connect the dots and figure out the cause of the odor of your urine. Rule Out Dehydration \nUrine will have a strong smell and dark color (like tea) when you are dehydrated. If you consume a lot of caffeine or alcohol, even if you drink enough fluids, you may be dehydrated. If you exercise a lot, even if you drink a lot, you could be dehydrated. Try to drink more water or herbal tea if you do not have plentiful and pale urine. Fluids are best consumed over the course of a day. Too much fluid at a time will just be flushed out of your body. Very large amounts of fluid at once can cause dangerous imbalances in your body. \n(Note – “sunshine yellow” urine can be cause by B vitamins. This bright yellow colored urine is not a cause for concern if it is caused by the vitamins; it is just your body flushing out the excess.) Sulfur Smell \nCertain foods can cause a sulfur smell (think of the smell of eggs boiling.) Garlic, onions and asparagus all have the potential to cause this type of odor in your urine. Ammonia Smell \nAn ammonia smell can be caused by dehydration, infection, liver damage and certain foods (especially nitrogen rich food.) Sweet Smell \nA sweet or sugary smell can be caused by glucose (sugar) or ketones in the urine. Often diabetics will “spill sugar” into their urine when their blood sugar is high. Ketones in the urine can be a result of low carb/high fat and protein diets where the body is using ketones instead of glucose as fuel. Ketones may also be present in the urine in a person with anorexia. Medication or Vitamin Smell \nMedications and vitamin supplements can cause your urine to smell “off” because some of the components of them will be excreted through the urine. An unfamiliar smell in your urine is not uncommon when you begin taking a medication. After you have surgery, your body will be flushing out the anesthesia, which can also cause your urine to have an “off\" odor. Chemical Smell \nIf you have been exposed to chemicals, your body will try to eliminate them and this can affect the odor of your urine. For example, some paints are quite toxic and your body can absorb those chemicals, especially if you paint a large area with little ventilation. Your body may put off a chemical smell for days after this type of exposure. Foul Smell \nFoul smelling urine could be cause by something as simple as what you ate for dinner. It can also be caused by infection. If you have an infection, however, the smell will not disappear over time and it will likely get worse if you do not treat an infection. Other signs of infection are blood in the urine or cloudy urine. What Should I Do about Smelly Urine? Urine Test Strips \nYou can buy urine test strips at the pharmacy. Basic test strips will check your protein, glucose (sugar), pH, and ketone levels. This gives you quite a bit of information to work with. You can also buy test strips that can check for white blood cells or red blood cells in the urine, which can alert you to infection or blood in the urine. Get Medical Advice \nIf you have fever, pain when urinating, or other unusual or serious symptoms, you should consult a health professional for advice. Natural Remedies to Improve the Smell of Urine Apple Cider Vinegar \nTaking the apple cider vinegar tonic addresses a number of health issues that can cause your urine to be off. It can fight a mild urinary tract infection, restore proper pH to the body, detoxify the body, and help to balance blood sugar. 1 Tablespoon in a glass of water once or twice a day is a common amount to take. Activated Charcoal \nActivated charcoal can also help a variety of the above issues. It neutralizes odors, helps with infection, and can help your body to detox from medication or chemicals. Take 1-2 tablets 2-3 times daily. Do not take charcoal within two hours of medication. Ideally, it is taken on an empty stomach, but taking it with food is okay if that is the only time you can take it. It should always be taken with plenty of water to avoid the risk of constipation. Activated charcoal can be found at your local health food store or online. \nHave you dealt with an unusual odor in your urine? Did you find the cause and cure? Please send us some feedback !

      "text": "Apple last week submitted a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that suggests it’s interested in testing self-driving cars.\nThe company appears eager to work with other companies in a data-sharing effort but is also keen to preserve privacy, which is in line with the hard-line stance it took in the Apple-FBI controversy earlier this year. \nThe letter is the clearest indication yet of Apple’s ongoing interest in and knowledge of autonomous vehicles, despite reports that Apple was rolling back plans to build its own vehicle. As Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, wrote in the letter , which is dated November 22:\nApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\nThe company wants to have control over the exact arrangements of the data-sharing program. \n“Apple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses,” Kenner wrote. “Data should be sufficient to reconstruct the event, including time-series of vehicle kinematics and characteristics of the roadway and objects. By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone. This will allow everyone in the industry to design systems to better detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios.”\nPerhaps most interestingly, though, Apple would like “new entrants” to the vehicle market to have “the same opportunity” that “established manufacturers” have when it comes to testing on public roads “without pursuing exemptions” included in regulations known as the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. But, Kenner pointed out, The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act currently doesn’t allow for that.\n“Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously,” Kenner wrote to conclude the letter.\n",

      "text": "Apple pushes out iOS 10.2 Beta 5 Apple pushes out iOS 10.2 Beta 5 Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + Software updates - Software updates + \nApple rolls out iOS10.2 Beta 5 Apple pushed out iOS 10.2 Beta 5 today to developers and subscribers of the public beta program. With the small number of changes and known issues in this build, it would seem that we are very close to seeing the final version of iOS 10.2 disseminated. With the latest build of Apple's mobile operating system, there will be new wallpapers for the iPhone and 72 new emoji in line with the release of Unicode 9. Perhaps the most important new feature is the one that will allow users to authenticate their cable or satellite service just one time and be allowed to view streaming video over multiple apps without having to sign in for each one.In addition, the Messages app gets a new \"Celebration\" effect and the native \"Videos\" app is being given a widget. The update comes just four days after iOS 10.2 Beta 4 was released. The file that was rolled out today weighs in at 1.95GB and carries the following changes: The TV app should no longer crash or show “TV is unavailable” on iPod touch. Syncing with iTunes 12.5 through 12.5.3 should no longer delete TV app library content. \nKnown Issues: TV app cannot be restored after it is deleted. \nEven though there is only one known issue listed, it does point to a 6th Beta on the way since we're pretty sure Apple wouldn't want the TV app to remain MIA permanently once deleted. \nIf Apple stays at this pace, we could see the final version of iOS 10.2 launched in a matter of weeks.

In a dynamic that still defies explanation, Apple's success is rarely applauded; on the contrary, its success is often used to justify the position that the company has peaked and is about to undergo an unforgiving fall from grace.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nYou get one last chance to buy a NES Classic Edition before Christmas NES Classic and Hatchimals might actually be in stock at one store this weekend This dude actually built a portable, wearable Tesla coil gun ",

      "text": "12/02/16 AT 9:47 PM Close \nA former manager at Foxconn, the company that manufactures Apple’s iPhone handsets, allegedly stole 5,700 iPhones and sold them for $1.5 million, according to AsiaOne . The Taiwanese manager faces 10 years in prison. \nThe Taiwanese testing department manager, identified by his family name Tsai, reportedly had eight employees smuggle out iPhone 5 and 5s devices, valued at over $1.5 million, between 2013 and 2014. The company first noticed the issue after an internal audit. Tsai was then arrested and bailed in 2016. \nThai was charged with breach of trust and faces 10 years in prison according to prosecutors. Foxconn has been hit with a few scandals in recent years from employee misconduct to labor disputes, according to AsiaOne. Related Stories Here's How to Spot Dangerous, Counterfeit Apple Chargers \nIn fact, in 2014, five former Foxconn employees were charged with breach of trust in Taiwan for soliciting $160 million in kickbacks from suppliers in exchange for buying their equipment. They were sentenced up to 10 years and six months in prison by a district court last month. \nFoxconn is one of Apple’s biggest suppliers, helping manufacture iPhones and other products for the Cupertino company. Foxconn has more than 1.3 million employees and has also been under the spotlight over labor unrest, employee suicides and the use of underage interns in recent years.

      "text": "E-mail \nDespite persistent rumours of Apple planning to abandon the home button on iPhones, it might actually be the iPad to be the first to get this feature omitted. The move is to allow for a larger 10.9 inch screen compared to the current iPad’s 9.7 inch while having the same footprint. The rumour comes from a report by Japanese blog Makotakara who has leaked some Taiwanese chain supply information before with reliable accuracy, informing ahead of everyone else that a 10.1 inch iPad was on the way back in October. According to their sources in Taiwan, the new thin-bezel iPad will have a thicker 7.5mm body despite the wider screen, thickness equal to the original Apple iPad Air. A larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also expected to come with a 7.2mm thickness (up by 3mm). \nThe larger screen has been said to fit the demands of educators and enterprise markets who can use the extra screen real estate. The new iPad screen will not be OLED when it launches in the first half of 2017, however OLED models are expected to hit the market in 2018 according to an August report by KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo . The new 2017 iPad update will also bring the A10X CPU, a faster performance chip than the one used on the iPhone 7.",

First, CellularInsights noted in October that iPhone models with Intel modems performed worse in LTE speeds than models with Qualcomm modems. The difference exacerbates dramatically as signal strength weakens. This wasn't entirely unexpected, as Qualcomm has always been the top dog in cellular baseband modems.\nThen there were reports that Apple was purposefully limiting certain iPhone models in an effort to make this difference less noticeable, essentially handicapping Qualcomm models. Even if Apple wasn't throttling speeds intentionally, it's more likely that the company simply may have chosen not to enable some features that would have unlocked higher speeds on certain networks to make performance more comparable across models.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 5 hours ago with 3 comments \nApple today released iOS 10.2 beta 5 to both developers and Public Beta testers, bringing a couple fixes to the next minor iteration of the company's mobile operating system. The news comes just four days after the firm seeded beta 4 . \nThe release notes for build 14C89 list two fixes. The new TV app will no longer crash or show that content is unavailable on the iPod Touch, and syncing with iTunes 12.5.x will no longer delete content from the app. \nWhile the TV app is the most notable change that you'll find in iOS 10.2, there's also support for 72 new emojis with Unicode 9, which include bacon and avocado. There are also a few new wallpapers, which you've probably seen before in iPhone 7 promotional images. \nApple promised that the TV app would arrive via a software update in December, so given the frequency of the betas, you can expect it to arrive soon, alongside macOS 10.12.2 Sierra, tvOS 10.1, and watchOS 3.1.1.

      "text": "Activation Lock Loophole Could Embolden iPad Thieves 8 hrs ago 0 \nApple's iCloud Activation Lock, designed to disable stolen iOS devices, can be bypassed by fiddling with the login screen and iPad smart cover, potentially letting thieves wipe the devices and resell them. \nIn a report published this week, a security blogger identified a creative way to disable Activation Lock. Hemanth Joseph, a self-described \"cyber security enthusiast\" from India, uploaded a YouTube video in which he floods an iPad's Wi-Fi network login screen with character inputs and then opens and closes its Smart Cover. \nDoing so takes advantage of a loophole in Apple's Wi-Fi login system: its password field apparently has no character limit, so entering an extremely long password will cause it to crash, after which opening and closing the iPad's smart cover will cause it to display the home screen. From there, a thief could restore the device as new and sell it online. \nThe Activation Lock was introduced in iOS 7. When it's working properly, it requires an Apple ID and password to reactivate an iOS device if its owner loses it and remotely wipes it using the Find My iPhone feature. Get news headlines sent daily   \nIn a blog post, Joseph wrote that he shared his findings with Apple on Nov. 4, and the company responded a few days later that it was investigating the issue. An Apple representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its plans to fix the vulnerability. \nThe Activation Lock feature has been a hacking target before. In 2014, two hackers released a tool that allowed users to plug a bricked iOS device into their computer and alter the \"hosts\" file inside. The iPhone or iPad was then tricked into connecting to a hacked server, which unlocked the gadget. \nThis article originally appeared on PCMag.com . Tags",

      "text": "When you break it down, Apple chargers are a pretty great metaphor for 2016. Fresh out of the box, everything seems to be running smooth; a new frontier where you can forget about old problems. Then, as the months go on, it predictably begins to tether, fall apart and make you sad. The next step, once you've finally had enough of that whole stop/start charge glitch, is to scour the online world for a cheap replacement. Well, it turns out we've been playing with fire this whole time, folks. That's after a study published by UK business watchdog Trading Standards claimed that a whopping 99% of counterfeit Apple chargers sold online fail a basic safety test. Yikes. Related: iPhone 8 release date, rumours, news, specs and price Investigators purchased 400 Apple chargers from different retailers around the world over the internet before putting them through the same tests required to be sold in shops in the UK. The results make for some grim reading, with 397 failing. \"Criminals across the globe are using online platforms to lure you in with cheap deals for fake items, many of which are dangerous and have been known to overheat and cause house fires,\" said Lord Toby Harris, chairman of Trading Standards, in a statement. Of course, this isn't the first time we've heard of pesky fake Apple chargers, with the Cupertino giant itself bringing the hammer down on Amazon back in October. Thankfully, Apple has its own guide for checking if you have a potentially dangerous Lightning connector. If you're serious about avoiding trouble, though, the safest option is to cave in and buy Apple's official product. Since no-one actually likes that sort of danger, right? ",

      "text": "Image credit – iFixit\nAs you might have heard, Apple has launched a repair program for the iPhone 6s in which users are reporting that their phones are shutting down randomly. The repair program basically swaps out the old battery for a new one , but for those who want to know why exactly their iPhone 6s handsets have been shutting down at random, Apple has an answer for you.\nIn an explanation posted on Apple’s Chinese website (via Business Insider ), “We found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs. As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur.”\nThe Cupertino company also wanted to reassure customers that their phone is still safe to use despite the shutdown. “It’s important to note, this is not a safety issue. We also want our customers to know that an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature. To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage.”\nHopefully this explanation will put customers’ minds at ease, especially following the reports of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 exploding and its subsequent recalls. In the meantime you can hit up Apple’s website to check to see if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement.\nFiled in",

      "text": "One of the rumored features of 2017’s iPhone is that Apple will finally be adopting AMOLED displays . Given how many iPhones Apple typically sells, it seems that quite a few smartphone makers over in China are worried that this could end up with Apple hogging all the displays for themselves, like they did with the fingerprint scanners. So much that according to a report from DigiTimes (via AppleInsider ) that cites local Chinese media, a bunch of Chinese smartphone OEMs have formed a consortium and will be working with panel maker Royole on the production of AMOLED screens. This consortium is said to consist of Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, and BBK.\nIt seems that the worry for Apple’s iPhones aren’t for their 2017 release, but what will happen later in 2018-2020 where they expect that persistent demand for AMOLED displays will result in component shortages for other smartphone makers. Last we heard, Apple is said to be sourcing their AMOLEDs from Samsung, so unless those OEMs are getting theirs from Samsung as well, we’re not sure if there is really anything to be worried about.\nThe move to AMOLED has been rumored about for a while now. Some rumors claim that this will only happen in 2018 , while some say that it could happen next year. Either way it is inevitable but until we see it for ourselves, take it with a grain of salt for now.\nFiled in",
