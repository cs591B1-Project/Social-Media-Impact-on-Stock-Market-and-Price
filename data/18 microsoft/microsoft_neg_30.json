      "title": "Microsoft Launches New Files Experience for Office 365 Groups",
      "text": "\nNew Files Experience Includes Email Attachments Microsoft is rolling out a new Files view for Office 365 Groups to First Release tenants. The old Files view (in OWA) opened the group document library to view the documents organized in a folder structure, just like you’d expect in a “regular” SharePoint Online document library. The new approach opens an all-encompassing view of all of the files available to the group. The new view includes files circulated as attachments to messages sent to the group and files shared from OneDrive for Business and other SharePoint document libraries.\n \n \nIt’s All About Attachments According to Microsoft, many active groups do not use the Files function as effectively as they might. Many users continue to circulate documents via email rather than placing them in a document library and sending a “cloudy attachment” link. This is not all that surprising as the majority of groups created to date are likely to be as replacements for email distribution groups.\nIt’s also hard to break user habits about how they handle attachments. Cloudy attachments work well, but they are still not as straightforward as attaching a file from the local PC, so people simply keep on doing what they have done since the dawn of time.\nThe logic behind the change seems to be that the new view surfaces files that group members might not realize exist and makes those files easier to work with. In some respects, this is the same logic that underpins Delve, which is all about revealing information to users.\nUsing Attachments Better All recent versions of OWA have been able to interact with attachments stored in a user’s personal inbox. The new Files view brings this capability to shared group attachments. A group member can now download attachments or save them to a more appropriate location in the document library or the user’s personal OneDrive for Business site. In addition, they can edit an attachment and send that edit back to the group (see screenshot above). When a file attached to a message is edited, a copy is made and automatically uploaded to the Email Attachments folder in the group document library.\nValue Depends on How Files Are Used The value gained from the new Files view will differ depending on how a group is used. After checking against several groups, I found that many of the attachments circulated with messages are images, not all of which have any business value and whose value exists entirely in the moment. The new view seemed slower to open than the classic document view, perhaps because a more complex query has to be resolved in the background.\nSponsored There’s no way to set the classic view as the default for a group either. You have to allow the new view to appear and then click the Browse Library button. This seems like a mistake because some groups are highly document-centric and won’t care less about the other debris that can accumulate through email attachments.\nFor instance, the authors of the “ Office 365 for IT Pros ” eBook coordinate our edits using an Office 365 Group and are accustomed to working with a customized view of the document library that holds the chapter files. The new Files view is distracting because it includes so much more than the current set of documents. In addition, the workflow that we have used for the last two years is hindered because three steps are needed instead of one to get to the chapter files.\nAccess Files view Click Browse Library Select desired folder In short, this is a change that might work for general-purpose groups but not for others. Microsoft needs to provide a method to allow group owners to customize the Files view to meet the needs of users.\nExpect a Microsoft blog post about this update soon. In the interim, you can check out message MC85367 posted in the Office 365 Admin Center or this support article .\nSponsored In other news about Office 365 Groups, Microsoft has updated SharePoint Online settings to give tenant administrators more control over how sites are created. In a nutshell, now that SharePoint sites can have associated groups and groups all get an associated SharePoint site, users have the options to create “classic” sites (no associated group) and “group-enabled” sites. This blog post explains all.\nFollow Tony on Twitter @12Knocksinna .\nWant to know more about how to manage Office 365?

      "text": "MINNEAPOLIS   U-Tools Software LLC today announced the release of U-Recover ® for Microsoft ® Windows ® 10.  U-Recover brings back many of the Windows 7 file recovery and protection features that were removed from Windows 10.  It integrates with Windows Explorer to let users create and configure Previous File Versions (Shadow Copies) in the same way that they did on Windows 7.\n\"I created U-Recover because I had missed the file protection features that were in Windows 7,\" explained Alan Klietz , the owner of U-Tools Software. \"Windows 7 had a perfectly good way to recover deleted files called Previous File Versions. In Windows 10 it was replaced with something called File History, which many people do not like. Several other useful data recovery features were taken out, such as the ability to automatically create system restore points or volume snapshots. I decided to bring it all back.\"\nContinue Reading\nU-Recover application roadmap U-Recover also adds extra file recovery features that go beyond Windows 7 including the following:\nExpose a volume snapshot or restore point as a disk letter for easy browsing or searching. Access a private file from within a volume snapshot and view it using administrator rights (not possible on Windows 7). Access files stored in snapshots of old System Backup Images. U-Recover Professional Edition adds additional support for the Enterprise, including unattended operation, scheduled operation, e-mail alerts, and support of Group Policy.\nFor more information on the capabilities and uses of U-Recover please see the detailed product description at https://u-tools.com/u-recover .

      "text": "Microsoft Confirms Minimum PC Specs For Windows 10 VR Headsets By Adnan Farooqui on 11/21/2016 07:10 PST \nMicrosoft is getting serious about virtual reality with the Windows 10 Creators Update that’s due to arrive early next year. The company is trying to create its own VR platform using Windows Holographic, the environment that’s actually used to power Microsoft’s HoloLens augmented reality headset . Microsoft announced at its event last month that VR headsets for Windows 10 will start at as low as $300. The company has now confirmed the minimum PC specifications required to run these headsets. \nThe confirmation comes via the latest beta builds of Windows 10 in which Microsoft has included a new “Windows Holographic First Run” application. The app basically checks whether the computer is compatible with the VR platform. \nAs far as the minimum specifications go, they are quite basic. Users will require a PC with at least 4GB of RAM, a graphics card with DirectX 12 support, 4 CPU cores, including dualcore processors with support for hyperthreading as well as a USB 3.0 port. \nThat’s really what the VR platform appears to require before it can run on a Windows 10 machine. It’s safe to say that most modern Windows 10 computers will have these specs so support for the VR platform isn’t going to be that big of an issue. \nFiled in Computers .

      "text": "0 0 \nIf you’re looking to buy a Surface Pro 3, we suggest you wait until Microsoft opens the Black Friday season in the Windows Store. Starting from November 24, you will be able to purchase your favorite Windows 10 computers, Xbox One games and other products for the best possible price. \nMicrosoft is already teasing some hot Black Friday deals on its website . When it comes to the Surface family, the company seem to focus mainly on the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 . No information is available yet regarding the Surface Pro 3 discounts. \nSince the Redmond giant can’t miss such an opportunity to sell some Surface Pro 3 devices , it will definitely offer some appealing discounts for this tablet. Most likely, more information about the Black Friday Surface Pro 3 offer will be offered on November 24. \nHowever, there are two questions that we just can’t help asking: How big is that discount? Will it convince potential buyers to purchase the Surface Pro 3? \nTo answer the first question, we must take into consideration the fact that the current Surface Pro 3 price tag is $999 for the Intel Core i5 4GB RAM model and $1,949 for the Intel i7 8GB RAM version. Starting from November 24 , Microsoft allows fans to save $280 on the Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core i5, 256GB storage and 8GB RAM. \nTaking into account this piece of information, it’s not too far-fetched to suggest that the company could offer a minimum $300 discount for the Surface Pro 3. \nBut is this enough to convince buyers to purchase the Surface Pro 3? As a quick reminder, the Surface Pro 3 is plagued by huge battery issues that reduce battery autonomy to zero. More specifically, users have to keep the LGC battery powered Surface Pro 3 devices plugged in permanently to be able to actually use them. \nUnfortunately, this bug has been plaguing users for many months now and diminished consumers’ trust in the Surface Pro 3. As a result, even with a $300 discount, it will be very hard for Microsoft to convince buyers to actually purchase a Surface Pro 3 device. There is no guarantee that a brand-new tablet won’t be affected by severe battery issues shortly after purchase. \nMicrosoft should rather offer a 50% off discount for the Surface Pro 3 to make it at least interesting for potential buyers. After all, the risk they take when purchasing a Surface Pro 3 device is not to be ignored. \nWould you buy a Surface Pro 3 tablet if Microsoft offered it to you for $499, $1,449 respectively? \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Everybody wants a bigger or smaller piece of the early virtual, augmented and mixed reality action, as well as a fast-growing pie of resulting profits. HTC and Valve have partnered on perhaps the most critically acclaimed high-end VR headset thus far, Sony and Oculus promise to provide tough competition , while Samsung leads in humbler, smartphone-dependent goggles .\nOf course, Google is now rising against the Gear VR lineup with a complex Daydream platform , both mobile tech specialists also working behind the scenes on completely standalone VR devices .\nAnd then there’s Microsoft, focused on turning the dev-friendly HoloLens into a consumer-oriented product… sooner or later, as well as opening the Windows Holographic OS to a wide range of lower-cost gadgets from third-party OEMs.\nThe HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus and Acer-made virtual reality headsets are apparently coming next year for $299 and up, supporting different experiences contingent on each of their price tags, specific capabilities and the skills of connected PCs.\nWith more official details right around the corner , we’re happy to report unofficial news about compatibility with Windows 10 computers featuring as little as 4GB RAM, a DirectX12-enabled GPU, quad-core CPU and 1GB free storage.\nYes, we’re talking any quad-core CPU, even dual cores with hyperthreading, and at least in theory, graphics cards as modest as NVIDIA’s GeForce 410M, GT 540M, GTX 660 or GT 740. Technically, you’ll need a USB 3.0 port too, but in its absence, you may “experience issues” rather than get booted out of the Windows Holographic ecosystem.\nThe post Microsoft’s minimum Windows 10 PC requirements for low-cost VR headsets are indeed modest appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

(Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) November 21, 2016 9:36 AM Strong, sometimes foul political language marks the AMAs KRISTIN M. HALL | Associated Press \nComing on the heels of a divisive political election, the American Music Awards on Sunday night in Los Angeles became a platform for strong, and sometimes foul, political language. Here's a look at some of the top moments from the American Music Awards show: \nNOT TRUMP'S NIGHT \nLess than two weeks after the presidential election, President-Elect Donald Trump was bound to be hot and divisive topic at the show. And the insults and jokes came from all sides, including the hosts, the presenters and the performers. Co-hosts Gigi Hadid and Jay Pharoah started off the show with not-so-great impressions of Melania and Donald Trump. \nSinger Idina Menzel and businessman Mark Cuban commiserated about not getting invited to the presidential inauguration, as both were supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. And Menzel gave a shout out to the cast of the Broadway show \"Hamilton\" who have been criticized by Trump on Twitter. \nAnd Rock And Roll Hall of Famers Green Day blasted Trump during their performance of \"Bang Bang\" when lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong sang a new chorus in the middle, \"No KKK, no fascist USA, No Trump.\" \nDRAKE WINS BIG \nDrake doesn't always show up to award shows even when he's likely to win, but since he set a record with 13 nominations, he must have felt obliged. \nIn fact, he did win four awards, including favorite rap/hip hop artist and favorite rap/hip hop album for his hugely successful \"Views\" record, which has dominated radio with singles like \"Hotling Bling\" and \"One Dance.\" \nHe thanked his hometown, Toronto, and his family and collaborators, and said he was just focused on the music. \n\"For our genre, I just like to keep things exciting and keep making music, shout out to everybody that's trying to do the same thing,\" he said. \nAlthough he didn't perform, Drake debuted a funny Apple Music commercial in which he lip-synced to Taylor Swift while working out, an homage to another Apple commercial starring Swift. \nHe hinted at new music to come, but also seemed to reference some of the criticism he's received from other rappers for his success, adding quickly, \"so watch how you speak on my name.\" \nDROPPING THE F BOMBS \nThe censors were on their toes with several unscripted moments in which curse words were flying profusely. \nMost award shows have to bleep out or mute some lyrics or accidental slips of the tongue, but this year's show seemed to be full of foul language, mostly on purpose. \nChrissy Teigen unleashed a mouthful of colorful language about the election that most people didn't hear on the broadcast as she was introducing her husband, singer John Legend. \nElectronic duo The Chainsmokers also let a couple of curse words slip when they were caught unprepared for winning the favorite electronic dance music award. \nFormer One Direction singer Zayn gave a big thank you to his \"(expletive-deleted) fans\" for winning new artist of the year. \nAnd artist of the year Ariana Grande was twice muted for language on the broadcast during her acceptance speech. \nMaybe next year the show should consider moving to cable. \nPURPLE REIGN \nThe death of Prince earlier this year continues to have an impact on today's music and fans showed their appreciation again by voting for \"Purple Rain,\" as the favorite soundtrack, more than 30 years after it was released. \nHis sister, Tyka Nelson, who noted that her brother had the courage to be different, accepted the award on his behalf. \n\"Prince defied the odds, a black teen from Minneapolis with the goal to electrify the world,\" Nelson said. \nBut she said being known as a great songwriter was the most important to him. \n\"He wanted to be the world's most prolific songwriter, and with 984 titles to his credit and counting, he has done just that,\" Nelson said. \nNelson began to tear up as she talked about her family and said she would keep the award at Paisley Park, the late singer's estate, and raised it in the air. \n\"Until we see you again, this is for you,\" Nelson said. \nSELENA SPEAKS OUT \nSelena Gomez also wasn't expected to be in attendance at the Microsoft Theater as she had been taking time off touring to treat depression and anxiety. \nStill one of the most followed celebrities on Instagram, earlier this year she stopped posting her to social media accounts. She took to the stage after winning favorite female artist - pop/rock to talk about dealing with an overexposed life. \n\"I think it's safe to say that most of you know a lot of my life whether I liked it or not, and I had to stop, 'cause I had everything, and I was absolutely broken inside,\" said 24-year-old Gomez. \n\"I don't want to see your bodies on Instagram. I want to see what's in here,\" she added, pointing to her heart. \nEven Lady Gaga appeared overjoyed for Gomez's honesty, with a big smile and her hands pressed together. \n\"I am not trying to get validation, nor do I need it anymore,\" Gomez announced to a round of applause from the crowd.",

      "text": "Microsoft hints at what you'll need to run Windows 10 VR headsets The company's minimum spec requirements for VR aren't too demanding. Share Save \nThere's still much we don't know about Microsoft's plan to deliver virtual reality in Windows 10. At this point, we've heard it'll start with $299 headsets from a variety of PC manufacturers, and support for the Windows Holographic VR platform will arrive in in the Windows 10 Creators Update next year. There's plenty left up in the air beyond that (we'll likely hear more during an event next month ). For now, we've got a sense of minimum PC requirements to run VR experiences, The Verge reports . \nAccording to the \"Windows Holographic First Run\" application, which is available in the most recent Windows Insider test builds, the VR platform will need at the minimum 4GB of RAM, a DirectX 12 graphics card, USB 3.0 support and four CPU cores. If you've got a dual-core CPU with hyper threading (which appears as four different cores in Windows), you'll probably be safe as well. \nOf course, Microsoft's final specs will likely include more detail about the actual CPU speed and GPU hardware you'll need, but for now these requirements make it clear Windows Holographic should run on mid-range computers. It's also unclear what sort of VR experiences these specs will get you — they likely won't be enough to run Eve Valkyrie well. \nIn comparison, both the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive require a quad-core Intel Core i5 4590 or faster processor, 4GB of RAM, USB 3.0 and either an NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD R9 290 video card. Oculus also just rolled out a new feature that'll let its VR headset run well on even slower hardware. Based on what we've heard from Microsoft, it seems like the company is trying to make VR more accessible than the Oculus Rift and Vive. That starts with cheaper headsets, but hopefully its final PC specs will come in much cheaper than the competition as well. ",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Monday, November 21, 2016 Microsoft Temporarily Drops Entry-Level Surface Book To $1,250 Last month, Microsoft unveiled updated Surface Books with Intel Core i7 processors and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M with twice the graphics performance of its predecessor. However, the Surface Book i7 definitely isn’t for everyone, as it starts at a hefty $2,399.\nFor those of you that don’t want to drop over two grand on a new notebook/convertible, Microsoft has you covered. The company has slashed $250 off the price of its entry-level Surface Book, taking it from $1,499 to a more palatable $1,249. Microsoft says that this pricing is available “while supplies last” through November 28 th . \nSo what exactly do you get for your $1,249 outlay? Well, the entry-level Surface Book is equipped with a sixth-generation Intel Core i5 ( Skylake ) processor, 8GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and integrated Intel graphics. \nThe 3.34-pound magnesium-bodied convertible of course includes a 13.5-inch 3000x2000 (267 DPI) display with a 3:2 aspect ratio and support for 10-point multi-touch. And in case you were wondering, the Surface Book in this configuration can run for up to 12 hours per charge (compared to 16 hours for the Surface Book i7) and includes a Surface Pen, which will come in handy when drawing in Paint 3D with the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update . \nIf the entry-level Surface Book is too limited for your needs, Microsoft has another enticing deal coming on Black Friday. It will offer the Surface Book with Core i5 processor, 256GB storage and a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce GPU for $1,499 — this represents a $400 discount off the regular list price.",

The company's own AR/VR platform, Windows Holographic , has headsets like Oculus Rift, and the minimum spec for connected PCs is slowly starting to emerge. \nAs noted by the Verge, the latest insider builds of Windows 10 include a Windows Holographic First Run app that gives you the chance to test your computer to see if it is compatible with Windows Holographic. The minimum specs are surprisingly low. \nWhile it is certainly not going to be possible to connect a Windows Holographic headset to just any computer running Windows 10, it appears that you will not necessarily need an absolute powerhouse to try out mixed reality for yourself. The Verge's tests show that all that's required is as follows: 4GB RAM A DirectX 12 graphics card A CPU with at least four cores \nThe Windows Holographic First Run app advises that a computer meeting these minimum specs is \"good to play more experiences\" -- but of course the better the hardware is, the better the experience is going to be.",

      "text": "Microsoft warned all Windows 10 users who have installed the Windows Subsystem for Linux recently that they should not modify Linux files on Windows using apps, tools, scripts or other means.\nThe Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is part of Microsoft's new Windows 10 operating system. It is not installed by default however and needs to be enabled by a user or administrator before it becomes available.\nTo enable Bash on Windows 10 , a user would have to enable the Developer Mode first in the Settings app under Update & Security > For Developers. Once done, it is necessary to open the \"Turn Windows features on or off\" option in the classic Control Panel, and select Windows Subsystem for Linux to enable the feature.\nWindows 10 downloads Bash then from the Store. Once that operation completes, you may fire it up by writing bash on the command prompt.\nDon't edit Linux files on Windows \nMicrosoft warns users of Windows 10 not to edit any Linux files that are part of the Linux subsystem using Windows apps, scripts, console commands or other means.\nDO NOT, under ANY circumstances, create and/or modify Linux files using Windows apps, tools, scripts, consoles, etc.\nThe reason given is that creating or changing Linux files from Windows may result in data corruption or even a damaged Linux system.\nCreating/changing Linux files from Windows will likely result in data corruption and/or damage your Linux environment requiring you to uninstall & reinstall your distro!\nMicrosoft refers to all Linux files that are part of WLS, and those are all stored under %localappdata%\\lxss on the system drive.\nThe reason for this is that file metadata is handled differently on Linux than it is on Windows. Since WSL is stored in a NTFS folder, it is necessary that it \"calculates and persists each Linux file's metadata in its NTFS extended attributes\".\nWhile WSL is capable of that, Windows apps, scripts, tools or programs are not. This means that create or modify events won't store any Linux file metadata.\nFiles without proper metadata may not open, write or read at all because of this.\nMicrosoft's solution is to store files that you need to use on Windows and Bash in separate directories.\nWhen you access files on your Windows filesystem from within Bash, WSL honors the NT filesystem behaviors (e.g. case-insensitivity), permissions, etc. so you can easily access the same files using both Windows tools and Bash tools without having to copy files back and forth between filesystems.\nClosing Words While you might say that this is inconvenient if you use WSL regularly, it would be the same if you'd copy a NTFS file to a Linux partition, edit it, and copy it back.\nNow You: Do you use Bash on Windows 10?\nGhacks needs you.

      "text": "Microsoft is done with researching quantum computers; moves on to build them 4 minutes ago By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nEver since physicists like Richard Feynman began imagining the possibilities of a quantum computer, the world of technology has dreamed of the day when such a machine would be made real. Now Microsoft, one of many companies and institutions that’s been researching this field, says it’s time to stop researching and actually build one. \nFor years Microsoft has been investing alongside numerous higher-education institutions into research in the field of quantum computing. Predicted to revolutionize many existing industries, not to mention people’s quality of life through the discovery of new drugs and materials, quantum computing is still very much in its infancy. But that doesn’t mean progress isn’t being made. \nMicrosoft has recruited Todd Holmdahl, an engineer previously in the Kinect, Xbox and HoloLens teams, to head the company’s efforts to actually build its first quantum computer. Holmdahl explained that the company’s research into this field has proven to be robust and conclusive enough that it’s time to take the next step. He elaborated: \nI think we’re at an inflection point in which we are ready to go from research to engineering. None of these things are a given. But you have to take some amount of risk in order to make a big impact in the world, and I think we’re at the point now that we have the opportunity to do that. \nQuantum computing works by utilizing what are called quantum bits, or qubits, that together perform operations. Unlike traditional bits in our day-to-day computers, qubits can take a number of different values simultaneously, producing a result to a problem exponentially faster than normal processors. Todd Holmdahl, formerly of HoloLens, will lead Microsoft's quantum computer engineering efforts \nUnfortunately, qubits are quite hard to work with , because every single interference, a wave of light, vibration from heat, or cosmic waves passing by, can destabilize the delicate quantum state that the cubits need to be in. This is the main reason that quantum computers have so far been quite elusive and mainly only relied on a very small number of qubits. \nWith this new initiative, Microsoft joins others in this field, like Google, NASA, and dozens of research laboratories and other companies that are racing to create the first scalable quantum computer. The company didn’t set a public timeline for itself but a breakthrough in this field could allow the Windows-maker to achieve and create new cloud and artificial intelligence services far more powerful than today. It would likely also allow Microsoft to “solve cancer within 10 years” , as it has promised to do. Tags",

      "text": "\nFollowing the release of Visual Studio 2017 Preview from last week, Microsoft is releasing a new SDK in preview for Windows 10 developers. The software giant today released Windows 10 SDK Preview Build 14965 with updated debugging tools and more. The new SDK introduces a handful of new APIs and removes one API. Additionally, it also brings JavaScript scripting and some other new debugging tool:\nThis Windows SDK includes updates and additions to the Windows namespace. Debugging Tools for Windows has been updated with a few new features, including JavaScript scripting and extensibility. As you may have already guessed, the latest preview SDK of Windows 10 requires Visual Studio 2017 preview, which you can download here . After that, you can download the latest SDK from here. Keep in mind that you can’t release apps build with the preview SDK to consumers via the Windows Store.\nIf you are interested, you can find the full list of new APIs introduced with the latest preview SDK here. \n",

      "text": "Microsoft Joins the #MannequinChallenge Fun Redmond creates its Mannequin Challenge video with HoloLens Nov 21, 2016 13:59 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: The #MannequinChallenge is becoming more and more popular these days and pretty much everyone is doing it, be they artists, celebrities, or Presidential candidates who were so close of becoming the next United States President. And just like expected, Microsoft just couldn’t stay away from all this fun, so the Redmond-based tech giant created its own #MannequinChallenge video and posted it online. The software giant, however, did the whole thing in its own way, using the HoloLens to create a video that imagines a completely static environment. Virtual objects are all standing still in Microsoft’s own interpretation of the #MannequinChallenge, which you can watch at the end of the article. “#MannequinChallege accepted! We couldn't pass up an opportunity to do this fun challenge with holograms,” Microsoft says in the description of the video which comes without one very important thing: the background song that everybody is using for Mannequin Challenge videos. Leaving this minor mistake aside, Microsoft is one of the companies that seem to like getting involved in this kind of fun, as the company’s executives previously participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge as well. For the moment, Microsoft appears to be one of the first tech giants to roll out its Mannequin Challenge video, so it’s probably just a matter of time until Google, Facebook, and the others publish theirs.",

      "title": "Microsoft Starts the SHA-1 Deprecation Countdown for Edge and IE11 Browsers",
      "text": "Microsoft Starts the SHA-1 Deprecation Countdown for Edge and IE11 Browsers GO Browsers will no longer load SHA-1-based websites Nov 21, 2016 13:26 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has pledged to improve browsing security with Edge and Internet Explorer, and part of this plan is giving up on the SHA-1 hash algorithm, which has been around for so long and is no longer secure. The Redmond-based software giant has already announced earlier this year that it plans to abandon this has algorithm and in a blog post recently, the company reveals that site admins have until February 14, 2017 to update their websites. Otherwise, both Edge and IE11 will no longer load them and instead display a notification informing of an invalid certificate. Users will also be allowed to ignore the warning and continue to the website, but the company clearly states that this is not a recommended option. “This will only impact SHA-1 certificates that chain to a Microsoft Trusted Root CA. Manually-installed enterprise or self-signed SHA-1 certificates will not be impacted, although we recommend for all customers to quickly migrate to SHA-256,” Microsoft explains. Older versions of IE not impacted The software firm also explains that other Windows applications using older versions of Internet Explorer or a previous release of the browser itself won’t be affected. “Third party Windows applications that use the Windows cryptographic API set and older versions of Internet Explorer will not be impacted by the February 2017 changes by-default,” the company said, adding that it “will not prevent a client using a SHA-1 signed certificate from being used in client authentication.” Microsoft Edge is currently a Windows 10-exclusive app and Redmond has no plans to bring it on other platforms or on previous versions of the operating system. Internet Explorer, on the other hand, is available as default browser on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7, so this change is impacting pretty much every Windows user that runs a version of the operating system that’s still supported. Webmasters are strongly recommended to give up on the SHA-1 has algorithm as soon as possible and they still have approximately three months to do it.",

The next big challenge will be getting all the various bots that are being developed for various platforms to interoperate with one another. \nWith that goal in mind, Message.io has announced a partnership with Microsoft under which bots created for other platforms will be able to run on top of Microsoft Teams , the collaboration platform that Microsoft is now layering on top of Microsoft Office 365. \nMessage.io CEO Tom Hadfield says the alliance with Microsoft is the first of several instances where Message.io expects to enable bots to be deployed across multiple collaboration frameworks. \n“The idea is to build once and be able to deliver everywhere,” says Hadfield. \nAs bot technologies continue to evolve, Hadfield says it’s now only a matter of time when we’ll see the relationship between humans and machines fundamentally change. Today, a machine waits to be engaged by a human. In the near future, bots will have advanced to the point where they can deliver relevant information to an end user without having to be prompted. \nThe degree to which individual end users will be comfortable with that idea may vary. But the one thing that is clear is that bots will soon be part of the conversation regardless of how much anybody may want to listen to what they have to say about the subject at hand. Save",

      "text": "  4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft has released a new Windows 10 SDK Preview, following a series of developer-focused announcements at its Connect() conference last week. \nCuriously, the blog post detailing today's release refers to \"a new Windows 10 Anniversary SDK Preview\", despite then stating that it \"must be used in conjunction with Windows 10 Insider Preview (Build 14965 or greater)\". Build 14965 is part of the Redstone 2 development branch, now known as the Windows 10 Creators Update , while the Anniversary Update SDK is based on build 14393 . Oddly, the blog post also links to another post regarding build 14388 , so it looks like Microsoft simply copied and pasted text from its earlier announcement of SDK Preview build 14388 . \nAs with other previews, Windows 10 SDK Preview build 14965 is intended solely for testing purposes, and is not intended to be used in a production environment. Microsoft warns that \"if you are working on an application that you need to submit to the store, you should not install the preview\". \nIn addition to running one of the latest Windows 10 Creators Preview builds - the latest release is 14971 - you must also install the Visual Studio 2017 Preview, which Microsoft announced last week . You can download the VS 2017 Release Candidate here , and SDK Preview build 14965 can be found here . \nThe new SDK Preview includes a range of new API updates and additions, details of which you can find in today's blog post , along with a list of known issues in the SDK and in the Microsoft Emulator Preview. Details about improvements and new features in the Debugging Tools for Windows are available here .",

      "title": "What to Know about Microsoft OneNote",
      "text": "Share By James Marshall \nMicrosoft dubs OneNote a note-taking and management program, a rather bland description considering all the cool things the software can do.Those of you who are still scratching your heads wondering what exactly OneNote is, you're not alone; I'm assuming that Microsoft hasn't done enough to market the software or has focused its marketing on the tablet pc niche market, which is a shame.Although tablet pc users will probably get more use out of OneNote's extra features, like the ability to incorporate hand-written notes, it would be a mistake to assume that OneNote holds no benefits for desktop or laptop users.In fact, I will be so bold as to venture that it is best suited for use on laptop computers: One can harness the portability factor (I'm guessing most people will want to take notes while they're in the \"field,\" whether that's on the job, at the library, or hanging out at a coffee shop) and bypass the temptation to rely on the handwriting and opt for the keyboard instead. \ncontinue reading below our video Cool Tablet Hacks You Haven't Thought Of After all, the purpose of the program is to help one organize notes one intends to incorporate into a lengthier document -- we have PDA's to handle our to-do lists and other notes to ourselves that never need to make it into print.That said, the ability to incorporate and prioritize to-do lists is beneficial when one is working on a lengthy research project.For those who are relatively comfortable in Word but who are wary of new programs, you can relax: OneNote's appearance and controls resemble a trimmed-down version of Word.This is deliberate, as the program is designed to complement Office and integrate seamlessly with its components -- think of it as a go-between for Word and Outlook.There are, of course, features not represented in Outlook or Word, but these are easily learned.The one thing that may trip new users up is the handling of files. OneNote is clearly intended to be used by one person, and one person only, as the program creates a single Notebook in which all notes are saved (I've tried to create additional notebooks but haven't been able to find a way yet).Within the notebook, there are folders, sections, pages, and sub-pages. Navigating through the notebook is easy enough, but one can become confused until comfortable with the controls.While it is difficult enough to explain what OneNote is, it is even more difficult trying to explain fully the features of the program and how they work.Users can move pages of notes or portions of notes around as one sees fit, and this is one of its greatest strengths; one can use OneNote to plan a project, conduct research for the project (yes, there are built in features to help you with online research, as well as integration with an encyclopedia and thesaurus), and then arrange the research notes to come up with a structure for written materials related to the project.No longer is one constricted by the structure imposed by Word, yet it is easy enough to send information to Word when one is ready to produce a complete, polished document.Other nifty features include flagged notes that are readily accessible via a task pane (great for to-do items), prioritized lists, the ability to share notes with others via net meetings, the ability to incorporate handwriting and audio clips, and an outstanding screen-clip feature. Verdict: OneNote is an excellent, easy to use tool for students, writers, people looking for a way to organize notes, or anyone who needs more flexibility than Word provides in the creation of documents.Those who are tempted to use OneNote as an inexpensive alternative to Word or Outlook, don't be fooled: OneNote is intended to be used in conjunction with either -- or preferably both -- Outlook and Word, and you will not reap the full rewards if you try to use OneNote as a stand-alone application.Further, don't listen to anyone who tells you OneNote is only for tablet pc's -- this is either a ploy to get you to buy a tablet or a side effect of Microsoft's niche marketing of the product; in actuality, it performs well on any Windows machine. If you remain unconvinced, try a free, limited-use OneNote download and prepare to be wowed!",

      "title": "Here Are Microsoft’s Minimum PC Requirements For Windows 10 VR Headsets",
      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Monday, November 21, 2016 Here Are Microsoft’s Minimum PC Requirements For Windows 10 VR Headsets Microsoft recently announced a collaboration with several third-party hardware makers to bring affordable virtual reality (VR) headsets to Windows 10 starting at $299. These new VR headsets will be compatible with Windows Holographic, a VR shell for Windows 10 that will be included in the Creator's Update (Redstone 2) , shipping to Windows 10 PCs in Spring. Microsoft plans to offer up more specifics in December, though we now know what the minimum system requirements for these headsets will look like courtesy of the company's Windows Insider program. Windows Insiders subscribed to the Fast ring can download and install build 14971, a new version that includes a \"Windows Holographic First Run\" app that examines PCs for compatibility with the upcoming VR headsets. It doesn't actually detect unreleased headsets yet, but it does look for the following minimum system requirements in order to use them: 4GB RAM DirectX 12 compatible GPU Four CPU processing cores A certain amount of storage space is also required, though that isn't made clear by the app—it just tells users if they have enough storage or not. In addition, Windows Holographic may work with dual-core chips that have Hyperthreading. Some have noticed that their dual-core CPUs with Hyper Threading pass the test because Task Manager shows four cores. Either way it doesn't look like Windows Holographic is going to be all that demanding from a resource standpoint. That's good news for consumes, especially since the headsets themselves will cost several hundred dollars less than the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. That's sort of an apples to oranges comparison, but the point is that getting into VR is about to become much more accessible, and that in turn could propel the category forward for all involved.",

      "title": "Microsoft's x86 on ARM64 emulation: A Windows 10 'Redstone 3' Fall 2017 feature | ZDNet",
      "text": "| Topic: Windows 10 \nSince January 2016 (and maybe before), there's been talk that Microsoft was working on bringing x86 emulation to ARM processors . Sources of mine are now saying that this capability is coming to Windows 10, though not until \"Redstone 3\" in the Fall of 2017. \nHere's why this matters: Microsoft officials continue to claim that Continuum -- the capability that will allow Windows 10 Mobile devices to connect to external displays and keyboards -- is going to be a key for the company, its partners and its customers. There's been one very big limitation to Continuum so far, however: It only allows users to run Universal Windows Platform (UWP), and not full-fledged x86 apps. \nWhat if an ARM64-based device could run x86 apps via emulation, the same way that the WOW (Windows on Windows) emulator allowed 32-bit apps to run on 64-bit Windows? That would make Windows 10 Mobile, which as of now, continues to support ARM only, and Continuum a lot more interesting, especially to business users who need certain Win32/line-of-business apps. \nLast night, @h0x0d, WalkingCat on Twitter, found a reference to what he termed \"Windows's hybrid x86-on-ARM64 tech.\" He noted that this technology seemingly has a new name, \"CHPE.\" \nMy sources say the \"C\" in this stands for \"Cobalt,\" which is the codename for x86 emulation on ARM. ( Cobalt also is a codename with Minecraft origins , as is Redstone.) \nMy guess is the HP here is HP, as HP has been working increasingly closely with Microsoft on its Windows 10 PCs and the HP Elite x3 Windows Phone . (Maybe the \"E\" is for emulation?) \nHP officials told me a month or so ago that the majority of enterprise users of its Elite x3 who wanted to run x86 apps via Continuum already had some kind of remote-desktop capabilities , primarily via Citrix, that enabled them to access their x86/line-of-business apps. HP reworked its HP Workspace viruatization service so that it targeted smaller business customers who didn't have x86 app access but lacked corporate remote-desktop access to be able to tap into their x86 apps. \nA solid emulation capability included in the operating system would lessen, if not obviate completely, the need for these kinds of virtualization services, at least in theory. \nThe \"Cobalt\" x86 emulation on ARM is currently on the list of features that Microsoft is planning to make part of \"Redstone 3,\" the version of Windows 10 that sources have said will be available in the Fall of 2017 , my sources say. That date lines up with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 chip , which would have the kind of virtualization capabilities that a robust emulator in Windows 10 would require. \nI'm hearing this Cobalt technology is aimed at phone and possibly tablet/desktop devices, not servers. I'd expect the initial target audience for devices with the x86 emulator on ARM64 would be aimed at business users, as they're the ones who most need x86/line-of-business apps. \nDoes this mean those persistent rumors of a Surface Phone coming in late 2017 or 2018 might be more than wishful thinking? I don't know, but I've continued to hear Microsoft still hasn't completely thrown in the towel on some kind of a Windows 10 Mobile device targeted at business users. And the head of Windows and Devices did tell me recently that \"both cellular connectivity and ARM processors have a role in the technical landscape of the future.\" So make of that what you will. \nI've asked both Microsoft and HP for comment on CHPE/Cobalt. I'll update this post with whatever responses, if any, I eventually get. More Windows 10 ",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft has often times boasted that its Xbox One console is a device for the whole family. As far as the Xbox account options are concerned, the company has really gone the extra mile. Parents have direct control over the privacy and security settings of their children’s Xbox One accounts. In other words, if some settings need to be changed on the child account, parents can do that at any moment. \nThis is a great way of implementing parent supervision and making sure that parents stay connected and know what’s going on with their kids even when they’re engaged in their own distant virtual worlds. \nThis guide will list the necessary steps to change the security and privacy options of an Xbox One child account, straight from your own account. The process is fast and there is no hassle involved, so in just a few simple steps, it should all be done. How to change the settings of an Xbox One child account The first thing you have to do is log into your Microsoft account , presuming you are the parent. Once the parent Microsoft account is accessed, go to the Xbox settings section. Select the gamertag for the child account you want to view or change. You can now see all the different settings available. Select either the Privacy tab , or the Online safety tab, depending on which setting you want to change. Change the settings, and when you are ready to confirm all the changes you’ve made, simply go to the bottom of the page and click Save . Have the child sign in and then sign out of their own account for the changes to take effect. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Introducing Microsoft single sign on",
      "text": "Please use a valid email Introducing Microsoft single sign on by Julie Barbezat Zendesk Products \nOver the past 12 months, we’ve achieved several important milestones with Microsoft. In November last year, we announced the release of an integration between Outlook and Zendesk , allowing users to transform an email in Outlook into a new support ticket in Zendesk that goes right to the customer support team. \nEarlier this year we launched an integration between Zendesk and Office 365 Groups (called Office 365 Connectors) that empowers customer service reps, sales teams, product, finance, and engineering departments to easily collaborate around customer inquiries with a new streamlined workflow, without ever leaving Office 365. \nTwo weeks ago, we announced an integration of Zendesk Support and the newest addition to Office 365: Microsoft Teams . The integration helps any team across an organization communicate and collaborate more effectively in real time, increasing productivity and enabling faster, more efficient problem solving for the customer. The integration will be available early 2017. \nBetter customer relationships are a click away We’re happy to announce that we recently launched the ability for users to sign up to Zendesk Support with their Microsoft account (work, school, or personal) to simplify the registration process and login experience. Office 365 has more than 85 million monthly active commercial users and we want to make it easy as possible for them to sign up for Zendesk. Now, users no longer need to have a password on Zendesk Support. This feature is available on all Support plans.",

      "text": "Rumor: Microsoft and HP developing consumer Windows Phone together Posted 21 November 2016 18:01 CET by Jan Willem Aldershoff \nThe German website Dr. Windows reports that HP and Microsoft are working together on a new Windows Phone for consumers. The information comes from two different sources and indicate that Microsoft is providing significant budget to HP for development of the phone. \nThe German website claims that HP and Microsoft have entered into a development partnership to jointly develop a Windows 10 Mobile Phone. In the partnership HP is responsible for marketing and selling the device. Microsoft is allegedly a silent partner that contributes to a significant part of the development budget. This would especially be beneficial to HP, according to Dr. Windows, as they save money and don’t have to care whether the device will be profitable. Another reason would be that a lot of Lumia features will be added to the device which they don’t have to develop themselves. \nDr. Windows has no detailed information on the new phone but expects it to feature typical Lumia features like Glance, a camera button, double tap to wake and a high quality camera. The website stresses the information is a rumor but that it comes from two different sources and adds that Microsoft reportedly announced a new Windows 10 Mobile Phone for February 2017 this week. This was during an event in Redmond and the announced phone might be the device Microsoft is developing with HP. \nThis means the new device could be revealed during the Mobile World Congress 2017 which is held in February and where also the HP Elite X3 was first announced. \nDr. Windows concludes his article with, “As I said, this is unofficial and can be completely wrong, but the puzzle pieces seem to fit together well. I thought it was too exciting in any case to withhold it from you. I hope it comes. Not only because I first reported about it, but because it would be immensely important for the platform.” Related Forum:",

      "text": "A \nBRUSSELS: Microsoft will still allow LinkedIn's rivals access to its software and give hardware makers the option of installing other services to try to win EU approval for its takeover of the U.S. firm, people familiar with the matter said. \nThe U.S. software company submitted its LinkedIn concessions to the European Commission last week after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the US$26 billion deal, Microsoft's biggest ever acquisition. \nThe offer aims to show that Microsoft will not favor LinkedIn at the expense of rivals, the people said, in an attempt to address a key concern for regulators. \nBoth the Commission and Microsoft, which have not provided details of the offer, declined to comment on Monday. \nThe EU is now seeking feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open an investigation which can take up to five months. They have until Tuesday to do so. The Commission is scheduled to rule on the deal by Dec. 6. \nProfessional social networks which have access to Microsoft's API (application program interface) will continue to have this facility once LinkedIn becomes part of the company, the people said. \nThe other key element of the company's concessions is the option for computer hardware makers to install either LinkedIn or rival networks on computers, indicating that the company is keen to avoid any suggestion of packaging products to crush competitors. \nMicrosoft's website shows it has software deals with hardware makers such as Dell, HP , Lenovo , Acer and Huawei , among others. \nThe Commission has fined Microsoft more than 2.2 billion euros (US$2.3 billion) over the past decade for various infringements, one of them being the tying of some products to its Windows operating system to stifle competition. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its US$3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \n(Editing by Alexander Smith)",

      "title": "Windows 10 VR Headset Minimum PC Specs Revealed | News & Opinion | PCMag.com",
      "text": "Microsoft announced in August that every Windows 10 PC will support mixed reality as part of its Creator's Update, slated to launch next year. The company also tipped a new set of VR headsets from companies including HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, designed to work with Windows 10.\nMicrosoft stated those headsets will start at $299, and now we have some info about the PC specs required to power your Windows 10 virtual reality adventures.\nAccording to the folks over at The Verge , Microsoft has included a new \"Windows Holographic Fast Run\" app in the latest builds of Windows 10 that lets you test whether your machine makes the cut. Fortunately, you won't need a super-expensive PC.\nAccording to the report, you'll need a PC with 4GB of RAM, a UBS 3.0 port, a graphics card with DirecX 12 support, and a quad-core CPU (which means most Core i5 and Core i7 processors should suffice). If your machine meets those minimum requirements, you should be all set to play most experiences.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nAndy Patrizio is a freelance technology writer based in Orange County, California. He's written for a variety of publications, ranging from Tom's Guide to Wired to Dr. Dobbs Journal. Microsoft is replacing the CMD prompt with PowerShell The latest build of Windows 10 replaces the venerable with the versatile Network World | Nov 21, 2016 8:55 AM PT Email   Related The top 5 features of Windows 10 \nOne of the last vestiges of the old MS-DOS days, the Command Prompt, is looking like an endangered species. The latest Windows 10 preview build puts the Windows PowerShell, first introduced on Windows Server, front and center. \nBuild 14791, believed to be the basis for the Redstone 2 upgrade coming early next year, replaces the Command Prompt window in many key areas of the operating system. Command Prompt is still there, just not as accessible. Microsoft is putting the emphasis on PowerShell as the main command shell going forward. \nDona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider Program, mentioned this change in her blog post discussing Build 14791 . She notes that it is still possible to stick with Command Prompt if you wish: \n“For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, and turning ‘Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X’ to Off.” \nPowerShell replaces Command Prompt (aka, “cmd.exe”) in the WIN + X menu, in File Explorer’s File menu, and in the context menu that appears when you shift-right-click the whitespace in File Explorer. Typing “cmd” or “powershell” in File Explorer’s address bar is still the quick way to launch the command shell at that location. \nOverall, the changes in Build 14791 are pretty modest: reading EPUB books in Edge, a preview of the 3D version of the Pain app, improved input for Chinese and Japanese characters, and an update to the Get Office app. Redstone 2 is rumored to ship around April of next year. \nThis continues a pattern we've been seeing in Windows 10 where old features are diminished in prominence but not necessarily removed. Internet Explorer 11 remains, but you have to run it manually. The IE icon on the Task Bar launches the new Edge browser. \nLikewise, Microsoft is changing the Control Panel . A few builds back, it changed what you got when using the Power Menu. Instead of the Control Panel shortcut, there is now a full menu of options that match the Control Panel's set of applets.

Amazon Web Services offers guidance on how to create bots using an open-source bot builder and AWS’s Lambda service. It even created a competition this fall to create bots, with nine winners that, among other things, translate for multi-lingual Slack teams, promote classroom engagement and ease Slack teams’ travel arrangements. Similarly, Google Cloud offers online help to build a Slack bot with the help of open-source package Botkit .\nFacebook in April released guidance and services to help developers build bots for Messenger. As of this summer, 11,000 bots had reportedly been added to Messenger, some of which can send videos, audio clips, GIFs, and other files.",

      "title": "PowerShell Replaces Command Prompt",
      "text": "Written by Mike James Monday, 21 November 2016 \nMicrosoft has replaced the long standing command prompt with PowerShell, which puts .NET at the top of the agenda even though it is as loved elsewhere in Windows. \n\nWindows has long had a problem with its command prompt because the language it implemented was weak, to say the least. You could do things with it if you really tried but, compared to almost any shell program under Linux or Unix, it really didn't have the features needed to make it powerful and easy to use. The most obvious thing to do would have been to improve it incrementally - a better for loop, a full conditional and better expression evaluation say. This isn't what Microsoft did however. Instead, about ten years ago, they introduced PowerShell, which could be considered overkill. \nPowerShell is a complete object-oriented shell based on .NET. The programmer can write scripts that make use of .NET objects, both their methods and ad their properties. This makes PowerShell very powerful, but it also makes is potentially as complicated as full .NET programming, perhaps more so because scripting in it is mostly using objects that other programmers have created. It also can make use of COM and WMI, which are also complex systems in their own right. You could say that whereas the command prompt was reduced and simple to the point where it was unusable, PowerShell was too complex for casual use. \nWith the release of Windows 10 build 14971, Microsoft has decided to make PowerShell the default, replacing the long familiar command prompt aka the last trace of MS-DOS still in Windows: \"PowerShell in the Shell: In an effort to bring the best command line experiences to the forefront for all power users, PowerShell is now the defacto command shell from File Explorer. It replaces Command Prompt (aka, “cmd.exe”) in the WIN + X menu, in File Explorer’s File menu, and in the context menu that appears when you shift-right-click the whitespace in File Explorer. Typing “cmd” (or “powershell”) in File Explorer’s address bar will remain a quick way to launch the command shell at that location. For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings > Personalization > Taskbar, and turning “Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows key+X” to “Off”.\" \nAt the moment there is a switch in the control panel that will put things back as they were, but this move to PowerShell might become even more permanent in the future. In most cases this won't matter much in that PowerShell supports most of the common MS-DOS commands and as a bonus there are aliases for most common Linux/Unix commands. \nPowerShell was open sourced earlier in the year and extended to work on OS X, CentOS and Ubuntu. \nIt is difficult to know what impact the move will have in the wider world. Help desks are going to have to modify their scripts once they get past \"switch the machine off and on\" to make use of PowerShell and less technical users might be confused by the change, but overall it doesn't seem like a bad move.

(Red Box Pictures via Microsoft / Scott Eklund) Microsoft says it’s moving ahead from just talking about quantum computing to building an actual quantum computer, based on the physics that won a Nobel Prize this year.\nThe project will be headed by longtime Microsoft executive Todd Holmdahl, who previously played key roles in developing the Xbox gaming console, the Kinect motion sensor and the HoloLens augmented-reality system. Now he’s corporate vice president of Microsoft’s quantum program.\n“I think we’re at an inflection point in which we are ready to go from research to engineering,” Holmdahl said in Sunday’s Microsoft blog posting about the project.\nMicrosoft isn’t alone in the field: For several years, Google has been working with NASA and a Vancouver-area company called D-Wave to evaluate quantum computer designs .\nBut Microsoft isn’t a newcomer in the field, either: The Redmond-based software giant has had researchers exploring the quantum computing frontier for more than 15 years .\nQuantum computing has the potential to solve “big data” problems faster than classical computing, affecting areas ranging from cryptography and super-secure communications to climate modeling and the search for dark matter.\nThe key to the technology is the concept of qubits. In classical computing, each digital bit is either on or off, zero or 1. In contrast, quantum bits that can represent zeros and 1’s simultaneously as they’re manipulated. Thus, multiple states can be processed in parallel.\nThe trick is in figuring out how to create qubits, keep them stable and connected during computation, and then read out the results. Typically, the process involves supercooled ions and atoms. Microsoft has been looking in a somewhat different direction, focusing on two-dimensional quasiparticles known as anyons .\nTheorists say that anyons could form the basis of a topological quantum computer , which takes advantage of braids in spacetime to conduct computation.\n“A topological design is less impacted by changes in its environment,” Holmdahl said.\nThe concept may sound bizarre, but this year’s Nobel Prize in physics went to researchers who have been studying the weird topological properties of exotic materials for decades. One of the laureates is David Thouless, a professor emeritus at the University of Washington.\nFor Microsoft’s quantum computing campaign, Holmdahl has recruited four pioneers in the field:\nDelft University of Technology’s Leo Kouwenhoven, founding director of QuTech, the Advanced Research Center on Quantum Technologies. Charles Marcus from the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute, director of Denmark’s Center for Quantum Devices. Matthias Troyer, a professor of computational physics at ETH Zurich. David Reilly, director of the Center for Quantum Machines at the University of Sydney. The team will be working on the hardware for quantum computers as well as the software to run on them , under the aegis of the recently formed Microsoft AI and Research Group . “Similar to classical high-performance computing, we need not just hardware but also optimized software,” Troyer said.\nMicrosoft hasn’t publicly laid out a development timeline, but Holmdahl said Microsoft’s research has finally reached the point where there’s a clear roadmap leading to quantum leaps.\n“None of these things are a given,” Holmdahl said. “But you have to take some amount of risk in order to make a big impact in the world, and I think we’re at the point now that we have the opportunity to do that.”\nTip o’ the hat to Microsoft’s Allison Linn and The New York Times’ John Markoff .

      "text": "\nNot a day goes by that we don’t hear more about Microsoft’s upcoming Xbox Scorpio, their planned upgrade to the Xbox One, that will be the most powerful console ever made. Microsoft are planning on pushing the best, most high end specs into the console market ever- in fact, that seems to be the very point of the Scorpio.\n‘Here we are, three years into the generation, and we also have gamers saying, “Hey, I want the most power, I want the best experience possible,” and that’s what Project Scorpio is all about,’ Microsoft’s Aaron Greenberg said in an interview with IGN . ‘It will be the most powerful console ever made. It will deliver 4K gaming to people in the living room on their TVs that they have not experienced before. So today, a lot of people who are spending thousands of dollars on high end PCs are able to experience 4K gaming, sure, but to be able to bring that at scale to the living room, to the console market, is what Scorpio is all about.’\nOf course, while 6 TFLOPs is a whole lot, it will be interesting to see wether or not it is enough to truly deliver the kind of native 4K gaming that Microsoft are promising, or if it will end up being more like the kind of upscaled 4K the PS4 Pro pushes.",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Book vs Surface Pro 5: Weighing in on the difference By Brian Ang Nov 21, 2016 05:54 AM EST Customers view laptop computers during the opening of the first Microsoft Corp. store in New York, U.S., on Monday, Oct. 26, 2015. In the making for more than six years, the five-floor, 22,369 square-foot store features products and in-store services familiar at Microsoft's more than 110 retail locations. Photographer: Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images Advertisement \nWhen it comes to laptops, Microsoft will always have an edge in terms of adaptability. Considering that the Redmond-based tech giant has been able to provide new units based on a user's need, it will be essential to evaluate two of its upcoming products. \nThe entry of the new Surface Book introduces a convenient machine that is known to be one of the most powerful ones in the market today. However, the perceived release of the Surface Pro 5 unveils an item that is equally efficient if not better. Advertisement \nEquipped with a formidable Core i7 processor , the Surface Book provides a flexible frame. Both the tablet and the clipboard can function independently. \nWith the incorporation of the Nvidia GTX 965M into the Intel HD graphics unit, battery life is highly-sustainable. The power cell is anticipated to last from 12 to 16 hours. \nIn contrast, the Pro 5 will be spearheaded by the new Kaby Lake chip. A 4K display feature is integrated into this product. \nIt is no secret that Microsoft has positioned the Pro among its 2-in-1 devices that carry Windows 10 in the market. In addition, a solid keyboard base supports the unit's surface screen. A unique styles pen is also provided. Advertisement \nFor many tech observers, it is astounding to note that the Surface Book has been priced a bit high during its launching. Although the Core i7 makes its system faster and efficient, the exclusion of the Kaby Lake processor is intriguing. \nHowever, Microsoft has made the Surface Book a great buy with the inclusion of key components. Its PixelSense display presents a sharp resolution of 3200 x 2400 pixels. The SSD accommodates a system memory between 256GB to 1TB. Moreover, LPDDR3 capability ranges from 8GB to 16GB. \nFor the soon-to-released Surface Pro 5 item, the integration of the Kaby Lake processor will definitely be its most effective feature. With a potent chip, battery backup will be extended to around seven hours with an improved surface panel to boot. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. ",

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Stars at the American Music Awards are still thinking about the \"Hamilton\" cast's statement to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, for which President-elect Donald Trump is demanding an apology. \nBroadway star Idina Menzel said the theater is the perfect place to provoke thought, as the \"Hamilton\" cast did when they told Pence after a recent show that they hoped it would inspire him to work for all Americans. \n\"It's the right place and it's beautiful and that's what theater's all about: It's about being thought-provoking,\" Menzel said Sunday on her way into the American Music Awards, where she was set to take the stage as a presenter. \"And it's just unfortunate that someone who's going to be our president doesn't embrace that as a freedom of speech and the arts, and sort of celebrate that moment... I'm really proud of all my friends in Hamilton and I thought it took a lot of courage.\" \nFrom the stage, she declared, \"I love you 'Hamilton!'\" \nProducer Diplo echoed her support for free speech. \n\"People can say whatever they want. That's what's great about America,\" he said. \"That's awesome those guys took a second to speak, and they made a story about it, so that's even better. It breeds awareness.\" \nActress Keke Palmer said the presidential nominees ushered in \"a new age\" with their disrespectful tone during the campaign. \n\"People should have a certain amount of respect for the government and the president and the vice president, but the president and the vice president and all those people should have a certain amount of respect for the people that they're catering to,\" she said. \"You can't create a disrespectful atmosphere and then not expect the people to disrespect you back.\" \nDonnie Wahlberg, who came to the AMAs with wife Jenny McCarthy, said he thought the \"Hamilton\" cast remarks were \"more appropriate than many other ways people have been speaking out.\" \n\"They were respectful! I thought they were very respectful,\" Wahlberg said. \"Maybe something like that's never happened before, but I think the proper response was the one Mike Pence gave, which is, 'We hear you.' \" \nThe American Music Awards are being broadcast live on ABC.

      "title": "Microsoft 'doubles down' on quantum computing",
      "text": "By James Walker 37 mins ago in Technology Microsoft has announced it is progressing from simply researching quantum computing to actually building machines that run on \"qubits.\" Quantum computing could open up new avenues of scientific research by offering vastly greater performance. Traditional computers are based on binary digits which can be \"off\" or \"on\" at any given time. From this principle, the rest of computing logic can be built, using transistors as simple gateways. Each transistor can either be on or off, but never both at the same time. Quantum computing changes this idea in a way that may appear profound. Unlike classical processors, quantum chips hold their bits in a superposition. In effect, this means the bit is zero and one simultaneously, which can lead to dramatic speed increases when computing certain kinds of problem. It's still very early in the path to mainstream quantum computing. Much remains unknown about exactly how quantum computers will operate or how they should be built. Microsoft has announced it intends to begin creating an early quantum system, informing the world in a blog post that an \"inflection point\" in development has been reached. \"I think we're at an inflection point in which we are ready to go from research to engineering,\" said Microsoft corporate vice president of quantum computing Todd Holmdahl. \"None of these things are a given. But you have to take some amount of risk in order to make a big impact in the world, and I think we're at the point now that we have the opportunity to do that.\" Holmdahl has been instrumental to some of Microsoft's most successful public creations. He played a key role in the development of the original Xbox and later went on to build Kinect and HoloLens. More recently, he's been developing a roadmap to take Microsoft's research into quantum computing turn it into a scalable machine. The aim is to create a quantum computer which could feasibly be used for problem solving. Microsoft has hired four leaders in the quantum computing field to assist with the challenge ahead, including Leo Kouwenhoven and Charles Marcus. Kouwenhover, of the Delft University of Technogy in the Netherlands, was the founding director of QuTech, the Advanced Research Center on Quantum Technologies. Marcus is the Villum Kann Rasmussen Professor at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and director of the Danish National Research Foundation-sponsored Center for Quantum Devices. Microsoft recognised the two as leading much of quantum computing research to date. The pair have already collaborated with the company's quantum team on multiple occasions of the span of several years. They will now be joining Microsoft full time while retaining their university affiliations. Marcus and Kouwenhoven will be joined by Matthias Troyer and David Reilly, two other established quantum computing leaders. Companies are viewing quantum computing so optimistically because of the range of problems it could help to solve. They could be used to emulate physical systems and accelerate the development of new drugs or human understanding of life. Microsoft noted it could make intelligent cloud systems \"exponentially more powerful,\" likening it to the evolution of cell phones into smartphones. \"There is a real opportunity to apply these computers to things that I’ll call material sciences of physical systems,\" said Holmdahl . \"A lot of these problems are intractable on a classical computer, but on a quantum computer we believe that they are tractable in a reasonable period of time.\" The company is also aware there's a \"vast unknown\" ahead, noting that the scientists who invented the transistor could never have conceived the smartphone era. The introduction of quantum systems might pave the way for a similar technology revolution in the decades ahead. In the shorter term, Microsoft's work to create a scalable quantum computer will help to push research in the field further ahead, driving both computer science and quantum theory forward.",

      "text": "Tweet \nDespite being the default browser in Windows 10 , Edge really hasn’t taken off in the way that Microsoft would have hoped. According to the latest usage figures from NetMarketShare , the new browser currently has just 5.26 percent share. \nIn a bid to improve matters, the software giant has started using pop-up notifications to push Edge in Windows 10, and bash its \"rival\" Chrome on both security and battery life. But if those arguments aren't enough to persuade you to switch, maybe the lure of 4K content from Netflix being exclusive to Edge will do the trick. \nSEE ALSO: Microsoft Edge is way more secure than Chrome and Firefox \nProvided you have a PC or 2-in-1 device with a 4K-capable screen and a 7th Gen Intel Core Processor (plus the relevant Netflix subscription), you’ll be able to enjoy Netflix’s 4K content exclusively on Edge in Windows 10. \nAnd, in addition to crowing about that , Microsoft would also like you to know that Edge is the perfect browser for Netflix content, because (here comes the Chrome bashing again) it will give you significantly longer battery life than Google’s browser. \n\"When streaming Netflix on Microsoft Edge you can get through at least one more full episode of Gilmore Girls than when streaming on Chrome on battery\", Microsoft claims, before admitting in the small print that \"battery life varies significantly with settings and other factors\".",

According to the latest usage figures from NetMarketShare, the new browser currently has just 5.26 percent share. In a bid to improve matters, the software giant has started using pop-up notifications to push Edge in Windows 10, and bash its \"rival\" Chrome on both security and battery life.

      "text": "Sagem 4K (Totalplay in Mexico) \nTiVo Bolt \nVirgin Media - V6 powered by TiVo \nXbox One S \nThere are also a number of smart TVs and Blu-ray players that support it: \nHisense TV or streaming media player \nInsignia TV or Blu-ray player \nLG TV, Blu-ray player or set-top box \nPanasonic TV or Blu-ray player \nPhilips TV or Blu-ray player \nRoku TV \nSamsung TV or Blu-ray player \nSharp TV or Blu-ray player \nSony TV or Blu-ray player \nTatung TV \nToshiba TV or Blu-ray player \nVestel TV \nVizio TV or Blu-ray player \nThe inclusion of the Xbox One S is interesting, although not surprising. But the Windows Store lists Netflix as being available on PCs, phones, and Xbox. In theory, if you have a 4K PC that doesn't have Kaby Lake, you should be able to use the app to stream, even though it's not listed on Netflix's official list . We've reached out to the company for confirmation of this. \nIt does put one over on Mac users though, as even someone with a 4K or 5K iMac won't be able to stream Netflix, as there isn't even a downloadable app for macOS. Edge users will maintain bragging rights in that area. \nBack in July, Microsoft ran a test among four browsers , claiming that Edge offers the best battery life while streaming video. Not only that, but other than Internet Explorer and Safari, it was the only one that could stream 1080p. Tags",

Black Friday 2016 Virtual reality Black Friday 2016 deals spill from HTC, Microsoft $100 being chopped off usual HTC Vive virtual reality gaming system price Network World | Nov 21, 2016 10:36 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nHTC Vive, powered by Steam VR, in action Credit: Bob Brown/NetworkWorld Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Blowout... Show More \nWith virtual reality systems like HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR being the latest cool gaming gear around, it's not surprising that consumers haven't been offered a ton of Black Friday 2016 bargains. But some deals have started to trickle out. \nHTC itself has announced Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions , offering $100 off Vive hardware platforms, which usually start at $800. HTC Vive provides an immersive full-room VR experience, as you don goggles and hold a couple of controllers to navigate your way undersea, through space or through other worlds. \nMORE: 50+ Black Friday 2016 tech deals \nHTC is also offering breaks on VR non-game apps through its online store, with bundle deals, in-store cash back offers and 50% off some of its titles. \nThe deals are available online as well as in stores via retailers such as Amazon.com, GameStop, Microsoft, Newegg, Micro-center and Fry's. \nMicrosoft has been touting (starting on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 24) $100 gift codes with the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, which usually starts at $600 (keep in mind you need a good gaming PC to use Oculus Rift). \nThe HTC Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals start at 11:59pm PST on Nov. 24 and run through Nov. 28. BEYOND VIVE \nThe gaming bundles that most retailers are really pushing this holiday season are for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 Slim, which can generally be had for $250, which is $50 off the regular price of the console, a controller and a game. Some deals are better than others, with extra games, controllers or gift cards thrown in, as you can see here. \nIf you're really looking to get a taste of VR for less, you also have a few other options. You can snag Gear VR goggles from Samsung bundled with smartphones this holiday season (or Samsung itself will sell you the 1-pound headset for seeing things in 360 degrees for $70 instead of the usual $100). Bundled deals include: \nBest Buy: Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge bundled with VR kit \nBest Buy will sweeten the purchase of a new Android phone, which costs about $28 per month for 24 months under an installment plan, by tossing in a $250 store gift card PLUS A Samsung Gear VR viewer. \nTarget: Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 edge \nLike Best Buy, Target is offering a $250 store gift card, plus a Samsung Gear VR headset. In addition, Target includes a $50 Oculus content pack to supplement the VR headset. \nAlso, numerous retailers have real cheap VR goggles (i.e., JCPenney is offering the Tzumi Dream Vision Virtual Reality Headset for half price at $10 and Michael's is selling the Sharper Image Virtual Reality viewer for $20 instead of the usual $50).

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nOver the last several weeks, a viral challenge has appeared on Twitter in the form of “ #MannequinChallenge ,” pushing users to create short clips of humans pretending to be mannequins. So far, these clips have ranged from a Walking Dead -inspired scene, to a dog watching a movie and eating Cheetos on the couch, to the Sesame Street crew frozen on the set, and to a huge crowd frozen in place as they cheer Marshmello . Naturally, Microsoft’s HoloLens team couldn’t refuse. \nThe video embedded above uses Actiongram , a tool provided for HoloLens users to create experiences without the need for visual effects experience or 3D skills. The video showcases Microsoft’s dedicated studio for converting real-world creatures, objects, characters, and actors into holograms. In turn, these holograms are inserted into video content, mixing real and virtual together into a fun experience. \nMore: HoloMaps hits Microsoft’s HoloLens headset with 3D maps and remote collaboration \n“Creators are able to develop their own unique holographic stories, in their world, to express their thoughts, ideas, and delight people,” Kudo Tsunoda , Microsoft’s CVP of Next Gen Experiences in the Windows and Devices group, said in March. “Actiongram allows people to create videos with holograms and advanced visual effects that would normally require expensive software and years of experience to do.” \nAccording to Tsunoda, the Actiongram app was created by a team of five individuals during a six-month time frame. The team set out to create a tool enabling HoloLens owners the ability to create high quality content with virtually no skills, opening the HoloLens doors to storytellers to unfold their experiences using holograms. Additional examples outside the current Mannequin Challenge include an astronaut walking in a bathtub full of bubbles, a thumb war pitting a giant hand against a soldier, and more. \nAs seen in the Mannequin Challenge video above, the team created a hologram that includes George Takei as he watches one of the Actiongram monitors. Just like the knight and the dragon, the rendering of the Takei hologram isn’t 100-percent smooth as the camera pans the scene. Pause the video and you’ll see his true artificial nature sporting flattened hands and a not-so-natural outline. \nActiongram is currently provided to all HoloLens owners as a beta in the Windows Store. Microsoft opened the doors to its Development Edition version of HoloLens earlier this year, essentially allowing anyone with $3,000 to purchase and use the augmented reality headset. The company has no clue as to when or even if a consumer version will hit the market, but the upcoming VR/AR headsets offered by third-party manufacturers for the Windows 10 Creators Edition is likely what Microsoft had in mind for the general market. \nThat said, there’s a good chance Actiongram will be one of the apps served up to consumers when the third-party VR/AR headsets go live next spring. Until then, check out all the cool holographic experiences made by owners of the HoloLens Development Edition and Actiongram thus far! ",

      "text": "Learn More \nBy far the most exciting new PC to hit the stage in 2016 has been Microsoft’s Surface Studio. The all-in-one desktop aimed at creative professionals took the stage at Microsoft October hardware event and stole the thunder from Apple’s event just a day later. \nEven though it’s incredibly expensive, starting at $3,000 for the version with 8GB of RAM and a 1TB hybrid drive, Microsoft sold out of its likely limited initial production run almost immediately. That’s arguably a remarkable achievement for such a new machine that’s priced so high, and now those early adopters can expect their orders to arrive soon, as Thurrott reports. \nMore: Microsoft’s Surface Studio is the all-in-one PC that every artist will want \nThose quick enough to have pulled the trigger on the initial run have been informed by Microsoft that their credit cards are being run through the virtual swipe machine and their orders will be shipping the week of November 21. That should be good news for anyone who’s waiting with bated breath to place that Surface Dial hockey puck accessory on the screen and start creating. Brad Sams/Thurrott.com \nReviews of the Surface Studio have been generally good, remarking on the incredible screen, the responsiveness of the Surface Pen, and the unique nature of the Surface Dial. Digital Trend’s Matt Smith summarized the Surface Studio by saying, “For its target audience, though, the Studio is a revolution. No major PC manufacturer has ever focused on the needs of creative professionals with the dedication Microsoft displays with the Studio. Until now, these users have made do with expensive add-on displays that, while certainly effective, lack any sense of elegance.” \nIt’s entirely likely the most of the early buyers are creative professionals such as artists, photographers, and designers of all stripes who will make use of the machine’s color accuracy, pen precision, and flexibility in moving from a vertical orientation to the standard drafting angle. Others may very well wait for Microsoft’s OEMs to come out with their own less expensive versions. \nNevertheless, for those who’ve already made their investment, some lucky few will be receiving their Surface Studios soon. Everyone else will have to wait until “early 2017” to set theirs up in their studios. ",

      "text": "November 22, 2016 0 Microsoft may be have finally found a way to make X86 apps to run on ARM64 Windows 10 Mobile devices. Here we are not talking about next version of Continuum however. Microsoft is planning to bring lots of improvements in Continuum with Creators update aka Redstone 2. But now it seems Microsoft is already working to bring a X86 Emulator on ARM64. This should theoretically allow Windows 10 Mobile devices with ARM64 chips to run Win32 apps. There are ample hints in the Code base of Windows 10 Mobile latest Insider builds, as discovered by Microsoft enthusiast Walking Cat. it looks like Windows's hybrid x86-on-ARM64 tech has a new name \"CHPE\", whatever it means đ maybe something like Compound Hybrid PE ? pic.twitter.com/aW1RLYU3dM \n— WalkingCat (@h0x0d) November 21, 2016 As per the tweet posted by Walking Cat this X86-on-ARM64 emulator is called CHPE. Now this name may or may not have any particular significance. We have shared via our sources earlier that Redstone 3 will be Mobile-focused iteration of Windows 10 unlike Redstone 1 and 2. Surface Phone will come out running Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3 out of the box. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. We have reasons to believe that upcoming Snapdragon 830 / 835 processor will haveÂ capability to support such level of virtualization. So, it all makes sense. Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3 will not only bring 64-Bit architecture for Windows 10 Mobile, but will also enable X86-on-ARM64 -Emulator.

      "text": "Not so long ago, the discussion of whether businesses should use Amazon, Microsoft, or Google data centers instead of their own, centered mostly around pricing. The conventional wisdom was that cloud computing equaled inexpensive while using internal data centers was pricey.\nIt was a very simplistic--some would say inaccurate--description. But with the big three cloud providers cutting prices of their computing power seemingly every other day, the perception was reinforced.\nWhat was lost in the debate was that while computing and storage prices often fell, the price of other cloud services including networking and things like workflow and data analytics did not. And, the price of moving data out of a given cloud is downright breathtaking, not to mention time-consuming, for a company.\nSo price is a factor--but not the only factor in the cloud computing decision, a notion that new Deutsch Bank db research published Monday seems to bear out. The broad lessons from the bank’s cloud pricing “primer” are that the frequent price cuts peaked in early 2014 have slowed. And that’s because cloud leader Amazon Web Services is being “rational” in its approach, the researchers said.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nBasically, they found that Amazon Web Services (AWS) pricing on basic services declined 10% to 20% annually since 2014. Not bad, but hardly surprising.\nThis is not to say that big corporate customers can’t score far better terms in negotiating large contracts (the same held true in negotiating traditional software license agreements in the old world). Savvy Fortune 500 companies can get significant discounts in the course of cutting enterprise contracts with Microsoft or Amazon amzn , if they play their cards right. That’s particularly true as Microsoft msft , Amazon, Google , IBM ibm goog , and others fight hard for big whale accounts they can point at to show that their respective clouds are ready for the biggest of businesses.\nAWS, which was first into the public cloud computing pool ten years ago, rose to prominence by getting startups aboard early. Now it’s in year five or so of a massive enterprise push that it will likely burnish build upon next week at its annual AWS Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.\nFor more on cloud, watch \nSo price cuts are stabilizing while the big three cloud vendors keep reducing costs from their infrastructure. That means that profit margins for the cloud providers should improve, which is good news for investors. And, the report’s authors conclude that the total market for public cloud is so huge and that cloud adoption rates are still so low, that there is room for all of the big cloud providers to grow--and profit--going forward.",

      "text": "Microsoft Shows Searches Can Boost Early Detection of Lung Cancer Patients may reveal early symptoms by looking on web for medical terms and treatments Dina Bass @dinabass More stories by Dina Bass November 10, 2016 — 10:45 AM EST \nMicrosoft Corp. researchers want to give patients and doctors a new tool in the quest to find cancers earlier: web searches. \nLung cancer can be detected a year prior to current methods of diagnosis in more than one-third of cases by analyzing a patient's internet searches for symptoms and demographic data that put them at higher risk, according to research from Microsoft published Thursday in the journal JAMA Oncology. The study shows it's possible to use search data to give patients or doctors enough reason to seek cancer screenings earlier, improving the prospects for treatment for lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. \nTo train their algorithms, researchers Ryen White and Eric Horvitz scanned anonymous queries in Bing, the company's search engine. They took searchers who had asked Bing something that indicated a recent lung cancer diagnosis, such as questions about specific treatments or the phrase \"I was just diagnosed with lung cancer.\" \nEric Horvitz Microsoft \nThen they went back over the user's previous searches to see if there were other queries that might have indicated the possibility of cancer prior to diagnosis. They looked for searches such as those related to symptoms, including bronchitis, chest pain and blood in sputum. The researchers reviewed other risk factors such as gender, age, race and whether searchers lived in areas with high levels of asbestos and radon, both of which increase the risk of lung cancer. And they looked for indications the user was a smoker, such as people searching for smoking cessation products like Nicorette gum. Ryen White Microsoft \n\nHow effective this method can be depends on how many false positives -- people who don't end up having cancer but are told they may -- you are willing to tolerate, the researchers said. More false positives also mean catching more cases early. With one false positive in 1,000, 39 percent of cases can be caught a year earlier, according to the study. Dropping to one false positive per 100,000 still could allow researchers to catch 3 percent of cases a year earlier, Horvitz said. The company published similar research on pancreatic cancer in June. \nMicrosoft's research arm is working on a variety of different technological approaches to improving cancer care and diagnosis. In September, the company published research on using machine learning algorithms to better tailor customized combinations of cancer drugs to a particular tumor and an effort to one day allow scientists to program cells to fight disease. \n\"These are diseases that present with very general symptoms and so they often take some time for a physician to route a patient with those symptoms to a lung cancer diagnosis or a pancreatic cancer diagnosis,\" said Trever Bivona, an associate professor of hematology and oncology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"While this would need to be rigorously tested I could envision how this could be a useful adjunct to the current paradigm of diagnosis.\" \nIn many cases, these cancers are found late, when treatment is unlikely to be successful, or even an option. That's why the team is searching for new ways to increase early detection, said Horvitz, who has a medical degree and is a long-time artificial intelligence researcher. \n\"I have very stark memories of my first lung cancer patient as a medical student. I remember saying is this operable? He had just come in, but the lung cancer was already in his brain,\" Horvitz said. \"The prospect we could save patients' lives' with one or more methods of pre-screening is intriguing.\" \n\"This is a very powerful tool,\" said Joe Gray, a professor of biomedical engineering at Oregon Health & Science University. \"We are interested in identifying cohorts of patients that might be at risk of cancer. One of the difficulties we have in the general community is if we really want to focus on developing better screening, how do you find them?\" \nThe work may also be able to identify new, previously unknown risk factors for lung cancer and correlations with environmental issues, Horvitz said. The search data showed a possible association between lung cancer and older homes, which may not have been constructed to avoid the build-up of radon gas, and with frequent air travel, he said. It would be worth further study on whether these factors do increase the risk of developing lung cancer, Horvitz added.

      "text": "See all Insider \nMicrosoft's digital assistant Cortana is one of the major additions to Windows 10 -- and it's a winner. Turn it on and Cortana alerts you to upcoming meetings; searches your PC and the Web; tells you about the weather, news and sports; and a lot more. \nTo help you get the most out of Cortana, I've put together some of my favorite tips for using it -- including using Cortana to manage your Google Calendar, identify the music you're listening to and track packages and flights. \nNote: This article assumes that you're already familiar with the basics of Cortana. If you want help getting started, see the Say \"Hey Cortana\" section of Computerworld's Windows 10 Cheat Sheet. Get a direct answer to your question \nWhen you ask Cortana a question, it will typically show you the answer via a listing of Web links; you then open the search results in your browser. That's what happened, for example, when I asked, \"What was the coldest day of the year in 2015 in Boston?\" \nThat's a useful but time-consuming process, because you have to browse through the search results, click one and then look for information from the Web page that appears. \nBut there are plenty of questions that Cortana can answer directly, without first sending you out to the Web. Instead, you get your answers right in Cortana's pane. Following is just a partial list -- try experimenting on your own to see what else it knows. To continue reading this article register now",

      "text": "\nWith next year's Windows 10 Creators Update , Microsoft is integrating 3D capabilities for virtual reality and augmented reality headsets into the standard Windows operating system. Along with this, companies including Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, and Acer will be shipping a range of VR headsets starting at just $299.\nThis will bring down the price of PC-based VR, but the headset isn't the only expense: both the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive have relatively steep hardware requirements. In particular, they need relatively fast, discrete GPUs, with the Nvidia GTX 960 (Oculus) or 970 (Vive) being listed as minimum requirements. If Valve's hardware survey of Steam users is anything to judge by, even many PC gamers will need to upgrade in order to meet the minimum VR requirements.\nRead 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "on Nov 21, 2016, 2:00 PM TechSpot \nMicrosoft’s upcoming Creators Update for Windows 10 will, among other things, add native support for virtual and augmented reality headsets. The update is still several months out although details are starting to trickle in. \nAccording to The Verge , the latest test builds of Windows 10 include a Windows Holographic First Run app intended to gauge a machine’s compatibility and readiness as it relates to virtual reality. Having run the app on a variety of machines, it appears as though the minimum requirements are as follows: A processor with at least four cores (including dual-core chips with four threads) At least 4GB of system RAM A graphics card compatible with DirectX 12 An undisclosed amount of free disk space USB 3.0 support \nWhile the requirements are a touch vague at this point, it would appear as though Microsoft’s platform is a bit less demanding than the proprietary software used by the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, respectively. Then again, it’s also not clear as to the level complexity of apps and games that these minimum specs encompass. \nAt its Surface Studio event in New York City last month, Microsoft said it was partnering with a number of tech firms including Asus, Dell, HP, Acer and Lenovo on the development of virtual reality headsets that utilize six-degree-of-freedom head tracking. \nMore information regarding that collaboration – and perhaps a comprehensive list of minimum and recommended Windows Holographic specs – is expected sometime in December .

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: IDG The Windows 8.1 user's guide to navigating Windows 10 \nIt appears that last week Microsoft added a new and largely unheralded capability to the Office 365 checker tool. \nA change to Microsoft’s main troubleshooting article for OneDrive for Business, KB 3125202 , added a reference to an option in the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365 tool that can be used to scan for files that are too big, file and folder names that have invalid characters, for path names that exceed the length limit, and several other headache-inducing problems. This appears to be a new capability for the Office 365 checker tool. \nThe KB article was changed last week ( Google cache here ), to add the reference. @teroalhonen tweeted this morning. \nHere’s what the new information says: \nMicrosoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365 \nThe Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365 is a tool that can diagnose and fix many common Office 365 problems. The OneDrive for Business option “I’m having a problem with OneDrive for Business” now scans for the following issues: Checks the option to manually or automatically update the NGSC+B to its latest version. Reports all files that have sizes exceeding the limit. Reports all files that have invalid characters in the names. Reports all folders that have invalid characters or strings in the names. Reports all paths exceeding the limit and provides a link to this KB article. \nThe tool is available from http://diagnostics.outlook.com . When you run this tool, the initial page will display several options, including the new option for OneDrive for Business: “I’m having a problem with OneDrive for Business.” \nThis looks like an excellent tool for anyone troubleshooting OneDrive for Business problems.

Credit: Julian Kelly/Google 10 tablets for under $500 \nMicrosoft is accelerating its efforts to make a quantum computer as it looks to a future of computing beyond today's PCs and servers. \nMicrosoft has researched quantum computing for more than a decade. Now the company's goal is to put the theory to work and create actual hardware and software. \nTo that effect, Microsoft has put Todd Holmdahl -- who was involved in the development of Kinect, HoloLens, and Xbox -- to lead the effort to create quantum hardware and software. The company has also hired four prominent university professors to contribute to the company's research. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nQuantum computers, in theory, can significantly outperform today's supercomputers. The ultimate goal is to create universal quantum computers that can run all existing programs and conduct a wide range of calculations, much like today's computers. Early quantum computers can be used to run only a limited number of applications. \nCompanies like IBM, D-Wave, and Google are researching quantum computing. IBM researchers have said a universal quantum computer is still decades out, so their focus is on creating hardware targeted at solving specific problems. \nD-Wave and IBM have created quantum computers based on different theories, and the companies have bashed each other's designs. D-Wave is trying to get more programmers to test its hardware so it can be used for more applications. \nIt's not known when Microsoft's quantum hardware will come out. Like others, Microsoft will have to make quantum circuits on which it can test applications and tackle issues like error correction, fault tolerance, and gating. Practical hardware will be released only after a number of quantum computing issues are resolved. But Microsoft is already offering a simulation of quantum computers via a software toolkit . \nConventional computers represent data in the forms of 1s and 0s, but quantum computers are far more complex. At the center of quantum computers are qubits, which can harness the laws of quantum mechanics to achieve various states. A qubit can hold a one and zero simultaneously and expand to states beyond that. \nQubits allow quantum computers to calculate in parallel, making them more powerful than today's fastest computers. But qubits can be fragile, and interference from matter or electromagnetic radiation can wreck a calculation. \nResearchers at Microsoft are working on an entirely new topological quantum computer, which uses exotic materials to limit errors. There are still questions about the viability of such materials and outcomes, so it could take a long time for Microsoft to make practical quantum circuits. \nInterest in quantum computing is growing as it becomes difficult to manufacture smaller chips to speed up PCs and servers. Neuromorphic chips and quantum circuits represent a way to move computing into the future. \nMicrosoft's new hires include Leo Kouwenhoven, a professor at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands; Charles Marcus, a professor at the University of Copenhagen; Matthias Troyer, a professor at ETH Zurich; and David Reilly, a professor at the University of Sydney in Australia. All of them are retaining their professor titles.  ",

      "text": "11/21/16 AT 3:07 PM Close \nCapcom’s next zombie game Dead Rising 4 was announced during Microsoft’s E3 press conference. Dead Rising 4’s release date is Dec. 6 on Xbox One and PC. You can watch the original announcement trailer below: \nDead Rising 4 marks the return of the original game’s protagonist - as you’ll get to play as Frank West as he revisits Willamette, Colorado. \nDead Rising 4 will eventually come to PS4 \nDead Rising 4 was originally set to release exclusively on Xbox One and Windows 10 PC in December, but Microsoft recently told GameSpot that the upcoming game will eventually makes its way to PS4 and Steam. \n\" Dead Rising 4 on Xbox One is developed by Capcom and will be published in partnership with Microsoft. Fans will be able to play ' Dead Rising 4 ' first on Xbox One and Windows 10 PC this December. It will remain a Windows 10 exclusive for the first 90 days and console exclusive on Xbox One for one year,” Microsoft said in a statement “We’ve had a close and longstanding relationship with Capcom including the launch of Dead Rising as an Xbox 360 exclusive and Dead Rising 3 as an Xbox One exclusive. We’re thrilled to partner with Capcom once again to help bring their ambitious vision for Dead Rising 4 to life.\" \nDead Rising 4 : Why Capcom went with a different actor for Frank West \nIn a fan Q&A from September , Dead Rising 4 sees the franchise returning to its roots, as the game brings main character Frank West and the Willamette setting. However, Frank West voice actor TJ Rotolo was not brought back for Dead Rising 4 . \n“Dead Rising 4 takes place sixteen years after the events from the first game,” Capcom said in a statement. Capcom went with a new actor for the role so that he “reflected his age while still retaining the charm and humor that made him such a hit with fans.” \nDead Rising 4 ’s campaign won’t feature multiplayer \nDead Rising 4 is already getting rid of the series’ trademark campaign time limit, and now it's confirmed to ditch another feature Dead Rising 4 fans are going to miss. In a Twitch stream , gameplay producer David McAnerin said they decided to go with a different co-op mode. \"We want to make sure we really focus on telling Frank's story,\" McAnerin said. \"We think he's a really interesting character. It's really exciting to bring him back.” \nThough the campaign won’t feature multiplayer, McAnerin detailed a separate four-player co-op mode. McAnerin said it’s inspired by the game’s original Infinity mode, which gets players to see how long they can survive for. The game’s new co-op mode lets players learn the backstories of the four characters, who star in the mode. \nPre-Order Dead Rising 4 \nIf you pre-order the Dead Rising 4 Standard Edition from the Microsoft Store you will receive the exclusive X-Fists DLC, which allows you to smash and bash your way through the zombie mayhem while equipped in an EXO Suit.

The gameplay video is called “Return to the Mall,” which goes back to the first game where Frank West was stuck in a mall fighting zombies. It’s the same thing in Dead Rising 4, but West has a mech suit and even more incredible weapons. As you’ll see in the trailer, the mech suit makes West look powerful, as he can rip zombies in half and push over cars. \nWatch the official Dead Rising 4 trailer Join the Discussion Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology. \nThe IBTech Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

      "text": "Computer software company, Microsoft is partnering with networking equipment manufacturer D-Link to deliver speedier Wi-Fi to rural communities around the world, D-Link chairman John Hsuan announced in Taipei on Monday.\nAdvertisement Dubbed \"Super Wi-Fi\", the wireless infrastructure is set to be based on the 802.11af protocol, and will take advantage of unused bandwidth in the lower-frequency white spaces between television channel frequencies where signals travel further than at higher frequencies.\nA pilot of the first phase is commencing in an unnamed American state, with trials also slated to run in three other countries.\nThis is not the first time Microsoft has used white spaces to take advantage of local mesh networks with low-cost radios; in 2015, Microsoft used white spaces radio to help with disaster recovery in the Philippines .\nIn the same year, students at a remote Ghanaian college became the first people in Africa able to buy internet connectivity delivered using Microsoft-backed TV white spaces, after the Ghanaian regulator granted the first licence to operate a commercial white spaces network on the continent.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft's plan to connect 1 billion people in India using white spaces ran into trouble, however. Microsoft had requested that the Indian government allot unused spectrum so that it could provide last-mile connectivity in the remote regions of the country, but the government rejected the plea upon pressure from local telecommunications firms, which demanded unused spectrum to not be given for free to any organisation.\nA few months later, the Indian government decided to conduct experiments using TV white space technology, allotting 127MHz of spectrum to eight local organisations.\nMicrosoft is not the only company looking at ways to expand internet availability, with Google's Project Loon taking a different approach by releasing balloons that act as extenders for broadband penetration. In February, Google started testing its air-balloon beamed internet service in Sri Lanka, after striking a deal for spectrum with the government.\nSky and Space Global earlier this year also announced plans to provide mobile coverage for remote regions globally by launching 200 nano-satellites into space off the back of Virgin Galactic's LauncherOne vehicle.\nAustralian Securities Exchange-listed Sky and Space aims to build a wholesale narrowband low-cost voice and data network through the provision of satellite services that it will sell to telecommunications providers throughout equatorial Asia, South America, Central America, and Africa, as well as to shipping companies and airliners operating in those areas.\nRemote coverage in Australia is also being expanded by the federal government's mobile blackspot program. The first round of funding was opened in December 2014, with Telstra and Vodafone Australia securing AU$185 million in government funding to build or upgrade 499 mobile towers across Australia.\nThe Australian government then announced the second round of the program in early December last year, providing a further AU$60 million to those participating, and the Coalition in May pledged to spend an additional AU$60 million to fund a third round of the mobile blackspot program to build or upgrade a further 900 mobile towers.\nAdvertisement\n© 2016 VCPOST, All rights reserved.

      "text": "  \nIt’s a good week for open source, Google has joined the .NET steering group inside the independent .NET Foundation and Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member. The list of open announcements this week emanating from Microsoft is so expansive that we will break it out into a number of individual stories — and the Computer Weekly Open Source Inside blog has already detailed how Microsoft is driving open Artificial Intelligence and upping open Azure cloud layers.   \nMicrosoft has also just announced its public preview of the next release of SQL Server and so Canonical has also now come forward and announced that this preview is available for Ubuntu. SQL Server on Ubuntu \nWhat we have here in SQL Server on Ubuntu providing choice for developers on premises or in the cloud. SQL Server enables choice of development languages and data types delivering one of the most innovative and flexible platforms to the market. \nAccording to Canonical, “With the next version of SQL Server, Microsoft brings the power of SQL Server on Linux and Windows including support for Docker containers. Moreover, with SQL Server on Ubuntu, there are significant cost savings, performance improvements, and the ability to scale & deploy additional storage and compute resources easier without adding more hardware.” \nThere are operational improvement here… in the cloud, resources are optimised to manage database workloads as needed. By using process containers like Docker, and service modeling solutions like Canonical’s Juju, organisations can improve the performance of their workloads and improve the speed and efficiency of how data-centric solutions are deployed. Scalability \nThe promise of the next version of SQL Server is it allows DBAs to build Microsoft Azure-based databases without having to add more hardware. \nBy including support for Linux containers, like Docker process or Canonical’s LXD machine containers, organisations are said to be able to can benefit beyond traditional efficiencies. The combination of Canonical & SQL Server brings a consistent Linux cloud experience from: Ubuntu, SQL Server, Containers, and the Azure cloud platform. \nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced SQL Server on Linux and so Canonical continues its journey with Microsoft to bring the best of Linux to its platforms… according to Dustin Kirkland, Canonical’s technical lead for Microsoft, Ubuntu development.
