      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Share \nStarbucks gets all the glory when it comes to its red holiday cups , but there's another beverage in town that also deserves a little more seasonal recognition. To ring in the 140th year of selling to the American public during the holiday season, Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser has unveiled brand new, limited edition seasonal packaging — just in time for the start of 2016 Christmas festivities. \nInspired by the tradition of decorating the 12 U.S. Budweiser breweries for the holidays, the lager company has decked out their twist-off beer bottles in a tonal Christmas red, making this a must-have collector's item for the Budweiser superfan in your life. \nDesigned in part with the New York-based design agency Jones Knowles Ritche , this year's seasonal packaging continues Budweiser's history of being a leader in beer design and packaging innovation. In 2013 Budweiser introduced its \" World's Most Unique Beer Can ,\" a bow tie-shaped beer can that mimicked the company's iconic bowtie logo. Earlier this year the company launched its \" Twist-Off \" beer bottles in the U.K., making it the first major beer brand to bring the twist-off style beer bottle overseas. \nBudweiser's \" America \" campaign that was featured on beer cans and packaging during this past summer ends in November, making room for the brand new holiday packaging. While there's no official word yet from the Budweiser camp on whether the festive packaging will become a yearly tradition, the bottles will be available throughout this year's holiday season. \nRejoice, American beer lovers.",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy Monday Nov 28, 2016 at 4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy Monday Nov 28, 2016 at 4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president.

People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

(Carlo Allegri/Reuters) Starbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols , such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street . Starbucks said it was a coincidence.\nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple ( ! ) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup .\nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released elaborate but secular designs — birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh.\n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said.\nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger — a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change.\n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!”\nStarbucks’s 2016 holiday cups on display at a store in New York. (Joseph Pisani/AP) The idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato.\nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte.\n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker , a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.”\nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where “open carry” is permitted. He launched “ Race Together ,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president . And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line — “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued . Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish.\nOne week before Election Day, Starbucks unveiled a new cup in the United States that it described as “a symbol of unity.” The green cup featured a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and a barista. (Mark Lennihan/AP) But other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’s history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators.\n“The stage has almost been set, for not only consumers, but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said.\nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand.\n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.”\nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup — except when it’s Trump’s name instead.\nKristine Guerra contributed to this report .\nRecipes\nMore from Food :\nHave questions about cooking?

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy Monday Nov 28, 2016 at 4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy Monday Nov 28, 2016 at 4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

Then it was the green cups this year and the idea of promoting togetherness. And then, as if cup controversy wasn’t enough, a Trump supporter reported being discriminated against by a barista, triggering a shop-in where Trump supporters bought more coffee and told baristas to write “Trump” as their names on their cups.\nYes, #TrumpCup was a hashtag for this anti-boycott.\nMeanwhile, Starbucks stock is up from a slump in early November, but still down overall this year.",

      "title": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy",
      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy Monday Nov 28, 2016 at 4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "title": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy",
      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   3:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

The sausage turned out much better with a juicy, soft, slightly-spongy texture.\n\nThe stuffing contributed a nice herbiness and flavor but was soggy and paste-like with fairly little to go around.\n\nI really liked the bun. It's basically an over-sized, crusty, buttery dinner roll. I could easily see myself enjoying it with some butter and/or jam.\n\nOverall, I half-liked Starbucks' All the Trimmings Breakfast Sandwich. I liked the bun and sausage patty but didn't care the ham, the texture of the stuffing, and the excessive maple sweetness. Between the sausage and the ham, there was already enough sweetness that they could have gone with some gravy to balance it out.\n\nNutritional Info - Starbucks All the Trimmings Breakfast Sandwich (161g) \nCalories - 450 (from Fat - 180) \nFat - 20g (Saturated Fat - 6g) \nSodium - 780mg \nCarbs - 48g (Sugar - 8g) \nProtein - 17g Read more at Brand Eating !

      "text": "\nChristian Brown November 27 at 7:36pm · Starbucks Location: 8868 Bond Rd, Elk Grove, CA 95758 \nHello friends, \nSo...I was fighting the urge to be petty, but I just found out that I lost a little over $1000 in stocks from my Starbucks position because I was fired. \nNow...I've never been fired before and, had I been fired because I was a bad employee I would man up and move on, but I wasn't. I was fired because my manager can't, well, manage. I would have expected Starbucks to demand more of their managing staff. \nHere's my dirt on Starbucks, and let it be known, I can't speak for all Starbucks', just the one on Elk-Grove Florin and Bond, in Elk Grove, California. \nBathrooms seem dirty? That's probably because they don't clean the bathrooms all the time. In fact, there was a 4 day period where, despite me letting them know multiple times that the bathroom wasn't being cleaned, it remained filthy. I mean filthy. The soap dispenser had been empty for 3 days straight. Think about that next time you touch anything in that Starbucks. That means none of those customers were washing their hands. \nLike I said, cleanliness standards are a joke. I'll be uploading some photos for your visual pleasure. Despite my attempts on multiple occasions coach people to Starbucks \"Standards\" of cleanliness, things rarely improved, because the management just didn't care. (Unless their bosses were coming for a visit). \nHere's a horror story for you, on 2 separate occasions, a barista used the bathroom toilet brush to clean dishes. Yeah, you read that right. \nDoes your drink taste off? It was probably made wrong. Since the new manager took over that store, drink quality has gotten consistently worse. Due to the fact that the manager herself is horrible at making drinks and doesn't monitor quality at all. My girlfriend has yet to have her drink made correctly, unless it was by myself or someone there who knows her. Its an ice coffee with sweetener and cream. Its not that hard. And don't ask them to remake your drink. Half the time, your going to get a little attitude and I can promise there's going to be some shit talking. \nIf your drink tastes weird it may just be that it was made with different ingredients. Sometimes, they are out of a regular ingredient. Now, some would think you would as the customer if it was okay to substitute this for that, and some do, but some don't. They just make your drink with different stuff, so it tastes different, hand you the drink, and close the window. \nIs your order taking forever? I'm not surprised. Since the new manager took over the stores wait times have skyrocketed. Simply because there is no sense of urgency for the customer. She doesn't care that you've waited 13 minutes for a single latte. \nDid you order decaf? I'd bet money its not. \nDid you order non-fat milk? Sugar free? Whatever other customizations? I'd bet its not. \nBack to cleanliness. The milk wands used for steaming your lattes and what nots, are not cleaned nearly as often as they should be. To the point where the milk underneath has turned brown and hard. \nSome baristas put there fingers inside of your cops all the time. No matter how many times I ask them not too. They simply don't care. \nAre there a ridiculous amount of flies around you at the store? That's because almost no one turns on the fly fan at the window. Want to know why? Because its a little loud for some. For others its because it messes up their hair. Yeah. There have even been fly traps in the back of the house. Against health codes by the way, because of the amount of flies. Now this wouldn't be too crazy of an issue has it not been myself who would remind everyone every single day almost every single hour to please keep the damn fan on because we are all tired of having flies land on us. \nDid you buy some food and it tasted weird. It may be expired. Its happened more than once. \nI'm sure there is more that has happened that I just can't think of right now, but there you go. \nI've never experienced such bad management. \nI've never had to fight so hard to get hours and keep a basic schedule. \nI've never had a worse working experience in my life. \nNow this doesn't apply to all of the baristas and supervisors there. Some of them are good and hardworking people, but when your management is garbage there isn't much that you can do. Especially when they put on an excellent front every time upper management comes in. \nAnyways, I feel a little guilty for being petty, but at the same time, the public should know the standards of the places they frequent. \nEdit: I got fired for a valid reason. I gave them an opening and they took it. Time and attendance. That's why I'm not fighting it. This post isn't about getting my job back, its about exposing the quality of this Starbucks, and hopefully, with a little public incentive, they'll step their game up.You can say whatever you want about me, but you can't deny these photos, the store's reviews, and past/current baristas inputs. \nPS: how or where Can I add the pictures this guy have uploaded?

      "text": "Why Starbucks Cups Always Stir Up Controversy Why Starbucks Cups Always Stir Up Controversy The Washington Post | Updated: November 29, 2016 13:58 IST Tweeter The culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas.No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\"Religion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops.The company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\"Two days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup.\"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name.\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\"The First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names.The movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College.#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths.\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email.In a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said.The movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray.\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\"Ironically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\"As many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag.\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said.Starbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence.And it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup.The Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh.\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said.Maybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change.\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\"The idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato.Today, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte.\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\"Part of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores.He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish.But other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators.\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said.It may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand.\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\"Coffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead.(c) 2016, The Washington Post (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

      "text": "Tracking Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital Portfolio - Q3 2016 Update (Seeking Alpha) \nJim Cramer said on CNBC's Mad Money that he would wait for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) to drop to $110 before buying the stock. \nAnheuser Busch Inbev SA NV (ADR) (NYSE: BUD ) traded lower because of the strong U.S. dollar. Cramer added that Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ ) is a better buy because the President-elect won't target beer in relations with Mexico. Cramer explained that people expect that Modelo and Corona are going to be taxed and he thinks it won't happen. \nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is a buy, believes Cramer. He thinks the company has to work more on its mobile pay. Starbucks is a huge position in his charitable trust.  ",

      "text": "Starbucks enlists in No Child Sleeps Outside campaign   4:00 am Updated November 28, 2016 at 9:11 pm During December, Starbucks is “lighting up” 200 King County stores asking for donations to the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign benefiting Mary’s Place. The company will match those donations up to $1 million. Share story \nNot long after delivering a sobering report on homelessness for Seattle Mayor Ed Murray earlier this year, consultant Barbara Poppe was invited to speak at Starbucks headquarters. \nThe room was packed with about 500 employees, or “partners,” who showed up with just a day’s notice. Employee surveys had shown that homelessness was a huge concern for them. \nPoppe went through the numbers that many had already sensed, or seen for themselves: There are 4,000 homeless people in Seattle, and some 500 families — parents and children — living in cars on the streets of the suburbs, or finding shelter everywhere from port-a-potties to Sea-Tac Airport. \nThen Poppe looked around the room and asked: “What’s wrong with you people? How can you permit this to happen?” Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nIn response, Starbucks is joining with the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign benefiting Mary’s Place, which operates two day centers and six crisis-response family shelters in Seattle. \nThe campaign was started three years ago by the Dick’s Drive-In chain. In its first two years, the campaign raised $750,000 through 40 corporate and 1,500 individual donors — including Dick’s customers who drop change into the jars on the counters. \nDuring the month of December, Starbucks is “lighting up” 200 King County stores asking for donations, said John Kelly, senior vice president for global responsibility, community and public policy. The company will match those donations up to $1 million. \nThe Starbucks Foundation has pledged another $1 million, as has the Schultz Family Foundation, for a total $3 million from the coffee giant. \nThe money primarily will be used to expand shelter capacity but also to help with client expenses such as rental assistance, car repairs and license renewals for those working in the trades — the small, yet expensive setbacks that get in the way of gaining stability and safety. \n“Regardless of the choices parents make, children are out there by no fault of their own,” said Marty Hartman, executive director of Mary’s Place. \nThe shelter, which serves about 120 families per night, has seen an increase in newborns (44 in the past 10 months) and special-needs children, as well as parents with disabled adult children, Hartman said. Many families spend all they have on health care, and then can’t afford housing once their children are well. \n“There are kids in cars on chemo and dialysis,” Hartman said. “We can end this. There are enough buildings and enough vacant space.” \nSaid Kelly: “We want to be part of the solution.” Nicole Brodeur : 206-464-2334 or ; on Twitter: @nicolebrodeur .

      "title": "Apple, Starbucks and Tiffany & Co get their Tin supply from a rebel army-held Myanmar mine",
      "text": "From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world’s largest consumer companies. More than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar’s border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid “direct or indirect” dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement. Several sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions “generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities” on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex. Following a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones. Apple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfil those regulations they looked to an audit programme designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI programme director said the group was “aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar”. The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include “a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas”. Tin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n“Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,” she said.\nCivil War \nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating. The Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organisation to do so. Interviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar’s peace process. “There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,” the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. “Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It’s the biggest source of income.”\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nPeter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence. “The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,” Kucik said. Two companies in Apple’s supply chain, the world’s No. 1 tin producer Yunnan Tin Co Ltd and leading Taiwan-based solder maker Shenmao Technology, told Reuters that some tin they bought was from the Wa mine.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China’s leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters’ findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSupply Chain \nThe chain connecting some of the world’s best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. One key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys “a long-term, stable strategic partnership” with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests. YCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world’s top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan. Yunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co and, indirectly, Pegatron Corp, whose clients include Apple. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, also a supplier to Pegatron.\n“Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI…As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that’s acceptable for us,” said Tim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, who said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva. More than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin’s board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a “portion” of the company’s tin came from the UWSA-operated mine. “We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,” Pan told Reuters. “We don’t specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.”\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste. That means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin’s purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, “and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain”. “While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we’ll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,” it said. Foxconn said it “enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers”.\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a “single, non-U.S.-based customer”. Pegatron Corp said it carried out “annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains”. “Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,” the company added.\nFrom Jewellery to appliances \nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals. Among the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a “very small amount of tin” from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewellery and hollowware. The company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, “use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy”.\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures. A GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had “noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners”. A spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was “committed to responsible business conduct”. “We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,” the statement said.\nReuters \nThe post Apple, Starbucks and Tiffany & Co get their Tin supply from a rebel army-held Myanmar mine appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Posted By: News BioNovelus Inc. Meets Starbucks’ Officer and Agronomic Engineers, and Intrigues World’s Coffee Industry at ‘Sintercafe’s 30th Annual Coffee Industry Meeting, in Costa Rica \nPhoenix, Nov. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jean Ekobo, CEO of BioNovelus Inc. recently attended the ‘Sintercafe - International Coffee Week,’ the largest coffee convention in Central America. This year, Sintercafé celebrated its 30 th anniversary in San Jose, Costa Rica, with an attendance of approximately 500 participants, from 25 countries including both coffee producers and consumers. \nThe coffee industry is the second largest commodity market in the world to the oil industry (Source: Business Insider). Since the late 19 th century, the coffee industry has been plagued by Coffee Rust or \"Roya\" (Hemileia vastatrix) a devastating fungus that attacks the Arabica plant. Billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of industry jobs have been lost throughout Central America since 2012 to this Coffee Rust epidemic. (Source: ICafé). The entire coffee belt from Indonesia to Africa, to Central and South America to Vietnam and Asia is seeking a remedy to this Coffee Rust epidemic. \n‘Sintercafé - International Coffee Week’ presented the perfect occasion for BioNovelus Inc. to introduce its organic coffee rust killer, biofungicide, CR-10 , following 9 months of highly successful testing in coffee plantations throughout Costa Rica and Guatemala. CR-10’s biodegradable solution as well as its organic, non-toxic yet highly effective coffee rust killing agent, is captivating coffee professionals from around the world. \nAt Sintercafé, BioNovelus’ CEO, Jean Ekobo met Craig Russell, the Executive Vice President of Starbucks Global Coffee, along with Starbucks’s team of agronomic engineers at ‘ Hacienda Alsacia ,’ Starbucks’ 240-hectare coffee farming research and development center. Always open to new solutions, the Starbucks Team asked to test CR-10 at Hacienda Alsacia. \nEkobo also met again with Costa Rican National Coffee Association, ICafé , to present an update and summary of all the CR-10 testing ongoing in 12 farms in Costa Rica and Guatemala. In support of BioNovelus, ICafé requested an opportunity to conduct a phase II testing. One of the objectives of a phase II testing is to prove that the organic product CR-10 can be as effective (if not more so) as its toxic chemical competitors in eradicating coffee rust. ICafé believes that there is no other organic product on the coffee-rust-killing-market, therefore, research on CR-10 has moved to the next level. \nAbout Biofungicide CR-10 CR-10 is a proven, biodegradable, non-toxic solution that kills bacteria, fungi and spores rapidly, safely and effectively. It is a new generation of biofungicide with a unique mode of action. BioNovelus management believes that CR-10 has a broad range of uses in agricultural applications. \nAbout BioNovelus Inc. BioNovelus, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: ONOV) is a bioscience company that honors the environment with an innovative, cost effective and disruptive technology-based solution to agricultural and water problems. \nWe are determined to help coffee growers keep the better tasting strain of the Arabica plant by fighting coffee rust through our “green” CR-10 instead of being forced to change to “hybrid” type plants. We feel very strongly that our “green”, biodegradable product is not only better for our environment but for people who enjoy the rich flavor that comes from Arabica coffee beans, whether organic or not. \nBioNovelus’ primary target market is the $100Billion* plus, annual, worldwide, coffee industry.

      "text": "A family inside the Mary’s Place Family Center in North Seattle. (Starbucks Photo / Joshua Trujillo) Starbucks, Microsoft, Alaska Airlines, Expedia, Nordstrom and other businesses in the Seattle region announced contributions totaling more than $3 million to shelter homeless families in King County through the annual “No Child Sleeps Outside” campaign by the nonprofit Mary’s Place.\nThe initiative, described as “an unprecedented effort to mobilize the community,” will support an immediate expansion of Mary’s Place to shelter more homeless families, the companies said in their announcement this morning. They cited a 20 percent increase in the homeless count last year in the city.\n“The 500 families with small children who are sleeping outside in King County cannot wait for the promised reforms and housing that will take a year or more,” said Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz in a statement. “We need to treat this daily tragedy with the same urgency that would follow any natural disaster. This is a short-term but urgent humanitarian need, and we are proud to join other Seattle employers in the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign.”\nThe Starbucks Foundation and the Schultz Family Foundation (co-founded by Howard and Sheri Schultz) will contribute $1 million each to the initiative. In addition, the Starbucks Foundation will match customer donations at 200 stores in the county up to an additional $1 million. Microsoft says it’s also pledging $1 million to address homelessness in King County, including a $250,000 contribution to Mary’s Place.\n“We will support partners throughout the area to pursue both short- and long-term systemic solutions, including permanent housing,” said Microsoft president Brad Smith in a statement.\nOthers listed as taking part include Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, Seattle Mariners, the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Seattle Association.\nAmazon isn’t listed as taking part in the effort, but the company and its founder Jeff Bezos have separately supported Mary’s Place financially and provided the organization with a temporary shelter facility on an Amazon-owned property in Seattle.\nIn addition to funding additional emergency announcement, the companies voiced support for Seattle Mayor Ed Murray’s Pathways Home initiative , a longer-term strategy to address the homeless crisis.",

      "text": "By: BioNovelus Inc. via GlobeNewswire News Releases  00 AM EST BioNovelus Inc. Meets Starbucks’ Officer and Agronomic Engineers, and Intrigues World’s Coffee Industry at ‘Sintercafe’s 30th Annual Coffee Industry Meeting, in Costa Rica \nPhoenix,   Jean Ekobo, CEO of BioNovelus Inc. recently attended the ‘Sintercafe - International Coffee Week,’ the largest coffee convention in Central America. This year, Sintercafé celebrated its 30 th anniversary in San Jose, Costa Rica, with an attendance of approximately 500 participants, from 25 countries including both coffee producers and consumers. \nThe coffee industry is the second largest commodity market in the world to the oil industry (Source: Business Insider). Since the late 19 th century, the coffee industry has been plagued by Coffee Rust or \"Roya\" (Hemileia vastatrix) a devastating fungus that attacks the Arabica plant. Billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of industry jobs have been lost throughout Central America since 2012 to this Coffee Rust epidemic. (Source: ICafé). The entire coffee belt from Indonesia to Africa, to Central and South America to Vietnam and Asia is seeking a remedy to this Coffee Rust epidemic. \n‘Sintercafé - International Coffee Week’ presented the perfect occasion for BioNovelus Inc. to introduce its organic coffee rust killer, biofungicide, CR-10 , following 9 months of highly successful testing in coffee plantations throughout Costa Rica and Guatemala. CR-10’s biodegradable solution as well as its organic, non-toxic yet highly effective coffee rust killing agent, is captivating coffee professionals from around the world. \nAt Sintercafé, BioNovelus’ CEO, Jean Ekobo met Craig Russell, the Executive Vice President of Starbucks Global Coffee, along with Starbucks’s team of agronomic engineers at ‘ Hacienda Alsacia ,’ Starbucks’ 240-hectare coffee farming research and development center. Always open to new solutions, the Starbucks Team asked to test CR-10 at Hacienda Alsacia. \nEkobo also met again with Costa Rican National Coffee Association, ICafé , to present an update and summary of all the CR-10 testing ongoing in 12 farms in Costa Rica and Guatemala. In support of BioNovelus, ICafé requested an opportunity to conduct a phase II testing. One of the objectives of a phase II testing is to prove that the organic product CR-10 can be as effective (if not more so) as its toxic chemical competitors in eradicating coffee rust. ICafé believes that there is no other organic product on the coffee-rust-killing-market, therefore, research on CR-10 has moved to the next level. \nAbout Biofungicide CR-10 CR-10 is a proven, biodegradable, non-toxic solution that kills bacteria, fungi and spores rapidly, safely and effectively. It is a new generation of biofungicide with a unique mode of action. BioNovelus management believes that CR-10 has a broad range of uses in agricultural applications. \nAbout BioNovelus Inc. BioNovelus, Inc. ( PINKSHEETS: ONOV ) is a bioscience company that honors the environment with an innovative, cost effective and disruptive technology-based solution to agricultural and water problems. \nWe are determined to help coffee growers keep the better tasting strain of the Arabica plant by fighting coffee rust through our “green” CR-10 instead of being forced to change to “hybrid” type plants. We feel very strongly that our “green”, biodegradable product is not only better for our environment but for people who enjoy the rich flavor that comes from Arabica coffee beans, whether organic or not. \nBioNovelus’ primary target market is the $100Billion* plus, annual, worldwide, coffee industry.

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy   4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

Meets Starbucks’ Officer and Agronomic Engineers, and Intrigues World’s Coffee Industry at ‘Sintercafe’s 30th Annual Coffee Industry Meeting, in Costa Rica BioNovelus, Inc. developed two important connections during a recent visit to Costa Rica. November 29, 2016 08:00 ET | Source: BioNovelus Inc. \nPhoenix,   Jean Ekobo, CEO of BioNovelus Inc. recently attended the ‘Sintercafe - International Coffee Week,’ the largest coffee convention in Central America. This year, Sintercafé celebrated its 30 th anniversary in San Jose, Costa Rica, with an attendance of approximately 500 participants, from 25 countries including both coffee producers and consumers. \nThe coffee industry is the second largest commodity market in the world to the oil industry (Source: Business Insider). Since the late 19 th century, the coffee industry has been plagued by Coffee Rust or \"Roya\" (Hemileia vastatrix) a devastating fungus that attacks the Arabica plant. Billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of industry jobs have been lost throughout Central America since 2012 to this Coffee Rust epidemic. (Source: ICafé). The entire coffee belt from Indonesia to Africa, to Central and South America to Vietnam and Asia is seeking a remedy to this Coffee Rust epidemic. \n‘Sintercafé - International Coffee Week’ presented the perfect occasion for BioNovelus Inc. to introduce its organic coffee rust killer, biofungicide, CR-10 , following 9 months of highly successful testing in coffee plantations throughout Costa Rica and Guatemala. CR-10’s biodegradable solution as well as its organic, non-toxic yet highly effective coffee rust killing agent, is captivating coffee professionals from around the world. \nAt Sintercafé, BioNovelus’ CEO, Jean Ekobo met Craig Russell, the Executive Vice President of Starbucks Global Coffee, along with Starbucks’s team of agronomic engineers at ‘ Hacienda Alsacia ,’ Starbucks’ 240-hectare coffee farming research and development center. Always open to new solutions, the Starbucks Team asked to test CR-10 at Hacienda Alsacia. \nEkobo also met again with Costa Rican National Coffee Association, ICafé , to present an update and summary of all the CR-10 testing ongoing in 12 farms in Costa Rica and Guatemala. In support of BioNovelus, ICafé requested an opportunity to conduct a phase II testing. One of the objectives of a phase II testing is to prove that the organic product CR-10 can be as effective (if not more so) as its toxic chemical competitors in eradicating coffee rust. ICafé believes that there is no other organic product on the coffee-rust-killing-market, therefore, research on CR-10 has moved to the next level. \nAbout Biofungicide CR-10 CR-10 is a proven, biodegradable, non-toxic solution that kills bacteria, fungi and spores rapidly, safely and effectively. It is a new generation of biofungicide with a unique mode of action. BioNovelus management believes that CR-10 has a broad range of uses in agricultural applications. \nAbout BioNovelus Inc. BioNovelus, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: ONOV) is a bioscience company that honors the environment with an innovative, cost effective and disruptive technology-based solution to agricultural and water problems. \nWe are determined to help coffee growers keep the better tasting strain of the Arabica plant by fighting coffee rust through our “green” CR-10 instead of being forced to change to “hybrid” type plants. We feel very strongly that our “green”, biodegradable product is not only better for our environment but for people who enjoy the rich flavor that comes from Arabica coffee beans, whether organic or not. \nBioNovelus’ primary target market is the $100Billion* plus, annual, worldwide, coffee industry.

      "text": "BioNovelus Inc. Meets Starbucks' Officer and Agronomic Engineers, and Intrigues World's Coffee Industry at 'Sintercafe's 30th Annual Coffee Industry Meeting, in Costa Rica [November 29, 2016] BioNovelus Inc. Meets Starbucks' Officer and Agronomic Engineers, and Intrigues World's Coffee Industry at 'Sintercafe's 30th Annual Coffee Industry Meeting, in Costa Rica Tweet \nPhoenix, Nov. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jean Ekobo, CEO of BioNovelus Inc. recently attended the ‘Sintercafe - International Coffee Week,’ the largest coffee convention in Central America. This year, Sintercafé celebrated its 30 th anniversary in San Jose, Costa Rica, with an attendance of approximately 500 participants, from 25 countries including both coffee producers and consumers. \nThe coffee industry is the second largest commodity market in the world to the oil industry (Source: Business Insider). Since the late 19 th century, the coffee industry has been plagued by Coffee Rust or \"Roya\" (Hemileia vastatrix) a devastating fungus that attacks the Arabica plant. Billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of industry jobs have been lost throughout Central America since 2012 to this Coffee Rust epidemic. (Source: ICafé). The entire coffee belt from Indonesia to Africa, to Central and South America to Vietnam and Asia is seeking a remedy to this Coffee Rust epidemic. \n‘Sintercafé - International Coffee Week’ presented the perfect occasion for BioNovelus Inc. to introduce its organic coffee rust killer, biofungicide, CR-10 , following 9 months of highly successful testing in coffee plantations throughout Costa Rica and Guatemala. CR-10’s biodegradable solution as well as its organic, non-toxic yet highly effective coffee rust killing agent, is captivating coffee professionals from around the world. \nAt Sintercafé, BioNovelus’ CEO, Jean Ekobo met Craig Russell, the Executive Vice President of Starbucks Global Coffee, along with Starbucks’s team of agronomic engineers at ‘ Hacienda Alsacia ,’ Starbucks’ 240-hectare coffee farming research and development center. Always open to new solutions, the Starbucks Team asked to test CR-10 at Hacienda Alsacia. \nEkobo also met again with Costa Rican National Coffee Association, ICafé , to present an update and summary of all the CR-10 testig ongoing in 12 farms in Costa Rica and Guatemala. In support of BioNovelus, ICafé requested an opportunity to conduct a phase II testing. One of the objectives of a phase II testing is to prove that the organic product CR-10 can be as effective (if not more so) as its toxic chemical competitors in eradicating coffee rust. ICafé believes that there is no other organic product on the coffee-rust-killing-market, therefore, research on CR-10 has moved to the next level. \nAbout Biofungicide CR-10 CR-10 is a proven, biodegradable, non-toxic solution that kills bacteria, fungi and spores rapidly, safely and effectively. It is a new generation of biofungicide with a unique mode of action. BioNovelus management believes that CR-10 has a broad range of uses in agricultural applications. \nAbout BioNovelus Inc. BioNovelus, Inc. (PINKSHEETS: ONOV) is a bioscience company that honors the environment with an innovative, cost effective and disruptive technology-based solution to agricultural and water problems. \nWe are determined to help coffee growers keep the better tasting strain of the Arabica plant by fighting coffee rust through our “green” CR-10 instead of being forced to change to “hybrid” type plants. We feel very strongly that our “green”, biodegradable product is not only better for our environment but for people who enjoy the rich flavor that comes from Arabica coffee beans, whether organic or not. \nBioNovelus’ primary target market is the $100Billion* plus, annual, worldwide, coffee industry.

      "text": "Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy Monday Nov 28, 2016 at 4:00 PM Maura Judkis - The Washington Post \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It's always Starbucks, isn't it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the \"Christ\" out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is \"Trump\" so that she will have to call out \"Trump, party of three!\" \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company's current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) \"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\" \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write \"Trump\" on his cup. \"Operation #TrumpCup\" was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n\"We have a culture war to win. I'm a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn't,\" Treadstone told The Washington Post. \"Obviously, a lot of people aren't happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.\" \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers' names is not even official company policy. It's \"a fun ritual in our stores,\" said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an \"attempt to troll [Starbucks's] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,\" said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n\"I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),\" Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein's video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say \"Merry Christmas.\" Borges denied that: \"Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,\" he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n\"That's the end of that lease,\" he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again, that I can tell you.\" \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers \"flooded Starbucks to participate\" in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company's potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: \"This was never meant to be a boycott,\" he told The Post of his call to arms. \"I love Starbucks.\" \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n\"It's a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,\" Owens said. \nStarbucks's holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year's McDonald's cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase \"Welcome home.\" This year's design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin' Donuts cup. \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year's plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n\"It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,\" Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n\"Looks like the American people have been heard,\" Feuerstein said. \"And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!\" \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company's history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n\"Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,\" said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. \"With that broader target, you're more likely to get difference of opinion.\" \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched \"Race Together,\" a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - \"a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks' history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n\"The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,\" Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers' relationship with the brand. \n\"Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there's a violation, it's not so easily overlooked,\" Rucker said. Potentially, customers are \"more vested in their experience there.\" \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it's Trump's name instead. Author Information: Maura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts.@MauraJudkis About Us",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It’s always Starbucks, isn’t it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the “Christ” out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is “Trump” so that she will have to call out “Trump, party of three!” \nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops. \nThe company’s current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee whom he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) “We want nothing to do with you,” he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. “You’re trash.” \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "The culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It’s always Starbucks, isn’t it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the “Christ” out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is “ Trump ” so that she will have to call out “Trump, party of three!”\nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops.\nThe company’s current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee who he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) “We want nothing to do with you,” he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. “You’re trash.”\nTwo days later, 29-year-old Timothy Treadstone, whose Twitter handle is @bakedalaska, posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. Operation #TrumpCup was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name.\n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.”\nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names.\nSnowflakes, Santa, Starbucks: Coffee chain turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs Tribune news services Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.\nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about...\nInstead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.\nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about...\n(Tribune news services) The movement is an “attempt to troll (Starbucks’) famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College.\n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social-media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain — a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths.\n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email.\nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said.\nStarbucks rolls out 'unity' cup ahead of Election Day Tribune news services One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it says is meant to be \"a symbol of unity.\"\nThe green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz calls it \"a divisive time in our country\" and...\nOne week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it says is meant to be \"a symbol of unity.\"\nThe green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz calls it \"a divisive time in our country\" and...\n(Tribune news services) The movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray.\n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.”\nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social-media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Washington Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.”\nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag.\n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said.\nStarbucks’ holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street . Starbucks said it was a coincidence.\nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup.\nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released elaborate but secular designs — birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh.\n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said.\nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger — a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change.\n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!”\nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato.\nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte.\n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.”\nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz , is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where “open carry” is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line — “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish.\nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the cross hairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators.\n“The stage has almost been set, for not only consumers, but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said.\nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand.\n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.”\nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup — except when it’s Trump’s name instead.\nWashington Post \nMaura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts for The Washington Post.

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "We all know the power of Instagram. Huge companies like Coca Cola, Starbucks and Nike dominate the space. Companies with established followings seems to have no problems getting engagement and results. But how can you use Instagram for small business?\nYou don’t have to be an enterprise-sized company to get value from Instagram. In fact, the mobile app allows small businesses to compete with the “big guys.” If you’re not using Instagram for small business yet, you’re missing out on a potential gold mine of opportunities.\nWhy Instagram for Small Businesses Is Great Out of all of the newer social networks, Instagram does a lot to set itself apart. With over 500 million monthly active users, Instagram is the fourth-most downloaded app in the US.\nBut here’s the problem. Since Instagram marketing is still fairly new, some small businesses struggle to gain traction. You don’t have clickable links in your posts, it’s a mobile-first app, which relies a lot more on visuals than text. As a result, we’re seeing a lot of small businesses sign up, get confused about how to actually use it and then give up.\nHowever, with social media management tools like Sprout that integrate with Instagram , it’s a lot easier to get started, no matter what size your business is.\nSo how do you cross over from being just another company on the app to achieving the level of success companies like Bon Puf , Simple Green Smoothies ? Here are 12 strategies and tips on how to get the most out of Instagram for small business and build a loyal following:\n1. Get Set Up the Right Way It’s a good idea to connect your company’s social accounts. This is particularly true if you already have social media profiles with a strong following. You can push your followers on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and other sites to your new Instagram account.\nInstagram lets you connect your other profiles so that your new posts can get published to those accounts automatically.\nDon’t forget to add your website and write a bio for your profile that explains what your company is all about without being boring. Fallen Industry’s profile does a great job of letting users know what they do while making it intriguing at the same time.\nAnother good way to use your bio is to add in additional contact information. By default you can only have one clickable URL in your profile. But what you can do to get around that is include URLs in your bio.\nPro tip: Shorten any URLs you use in your bio using a service like Bitly . It’ll take up less characters and make it easier to track your traffic from Instagram. Check out our post on how to write Instagram bios for businesses to learn more about crafting your Instagram bio and putting your best foot forward.\n2. Start Using Instagram Stories Instagram Stories have been a controversial feature to say the least. In case you haven’t heard, Instagram Stories lets you string together multiple pictures and videos into a “story” that disappears after 24 hours, similar to Snapchat stories.\nSmall businesses have been slow to use Instagram Stories while they try to figure out how to best weave the feature into their own strategies. But there’s a lot of potential you shouldn’t pass up. Like with any big change, the companies that adopt and figure it out first tend to reap the biggest benefits.\nFollow in the footsteps of brands like Taco Bell that have gone all-in on Instagram Stories. Start experimenting and get creative to see what you can come up with.\n\n3. Monitor What’s Working Are you paying attention to which Instagram posts get the most engagement? Do you know which hashtags perform the best? Using an Instagram analytics tool can help you see all of this information from a single dashboard and track it over time.\nBy looking through data, you’ll get an idea of what type of content resonates with your audience the best. Whether it’s a certain style of photo, a particular filter or a popular hashtag. The more info you have about the content your audience resonates with, the more you can improve your future posts.\n4. Dive Into Your Comments Do you publish Instagram posts and never look at them again? You’re not alone. A lot of small businesses spend little to no time monitoring their comments , partially because it’s not the easiest thing to do within the Instagram app. It’s also difficult because most brands look for publishing and not Instagram engagement .\nIn order to make responding to Instagram comments easier, use Sprout Social to reply to comments across multiple Instagram accounts and all your other social media profiles.\n5. Use Influencer Marketing Influencer marketing is one of the best ways to quickly build up your Instagram following, particularly when you’re starting from scratch. Through influencer marketing , you can connect with people with an established following and get exposed to their audience.\nIn the past (pre-social media) influencer marketing required huge budgets to get athletes and actors to endorse your products. But social media has changed the game. Now non-celebs can be influencers and have hundreds of thousands or even millions of engaged followers. Not only has this made it easier for brands to connect with influencers, but it also made influencer marketing a lot more affordable.\nYou may not be able to afford to have a Hollywood A-lister post about your products on Instagram. But you can probably link up with a popular Instagram influencer with a nice-sized following.\nCalming therapy with @organique_polska 🌴🙌🏼 #aloe #organiquepolska więcej na blogu: JEMERCED.com \nA photo posted by Jessica Mercedes Kirschner © (@jemerced) on Nov 27, 2016 at 12:09pm PST \n\nStart by making a list of the top influencers in your industry. Look for them on Instagram to make sure they have an engaged audience. It’s not just about how many followers they have, it’s about how much engagement they get. Check out how many Likes and comments they get on their posts and how often they post.\nThen reach out and let them know you’re interested in working together. It’s best to have some ideas for what you’d like to do before approaching them. Two common options are contests and sponsored posts. Also, the influencer might have some ideas on how you can work together as well.\n6. Get Familiar With Hashtags Instagram’s search feature looks for hashtags instead of keywords. On platforms like Twitter or Facebook, you can do a search for “hamburgers” and see all the Tweets and Facebook posts containing that keyword. But with Instagram, you have to search #hamburgers.\nIf you want your posts to show up in the app’s search, you need to start using hashtags for Instagram . It’s a quick way to increase your visibility and reach people who aren’t already aware of your brand.\nThe trick is to use the right hashtags. A common mistake some businesses make is using random hashtags they made up. Unfortunately, nobody is searching for those random hashtags so they’re not helping you grow your following.\nThe real value comes from finding ways to post pictures related to popular or trending hashtags. When you do this, your images have a chance to show up in the Trending Tags section of Instagram.\nWhat’s trending at the moment might not always be relevant to your business or the images you post though. In those cases, you can use Websta to see a huge list of popular hashtags that might not be trending, but are still being used heavily. Websta will show you more generic and broad hashtags that are easier to fit into your non-themed Instagram posts.\nSomething unique to Instagram that you don’t see on many other social networks is using a lot of hashtags can actually get your images more likes. On Twitter, having 10 hashtags in a Tweet would be crazy. But on Instagram it’s pretty much the norm.\nIn a case study from Max Woolf , over 120,000 Instagram photos were analyzed and he found that photos with the maximum allowable hashtags (30) received three times the amount of likes as photos with just a few hashtags.\nThis doesn’t mean every Instagram post needs 30 hashtags. Using hashtags just for the sake of having them isn’t recommended. But the point is photos with hashtags will get a lot more attention than those that don’t.\nOnce you start using hashtags in your post, you can use Sprout to see which of your hashtags are performing the best through our hashtag performance report .\n7. Create More Videos I’m sure we don’t have to tell you about how important video has become for small businesses. Even though photos currently generate more engagement, video is on the rise. Instead of waiting for other brands to dominate while you play catchup, get started right now.\nWith Instagram Stories and live videos, the app is making a clear push toward video content. The great thing about using Instagram videos is they don’t require a ton of production. All you really need is your phone and some creativity. Plus the videos are served in bite-size pieces with a time limit of one minute.\nFollow in the footsteps of small businesses like Wahl , which generated a 4,307% spike in engagement within a year by focusing on more engagement and building a better Instagram strategy.\nMaintenance is 🔑. Follow these simple steps on how to properly clean, disinfect, oil, and store your Finale cutter bars and foils. #wahl #wahlpro #finale #maintenance #foils #cutterbars #shaver #shavermaintenance #barber #video #stylist #🔑 \nA video posted by Wahl Professional (USA) (@wahlpro) on Nov 18, 2016 at 10:02am PST \n\n8. Start Regramming Sharing other people’s content is one of the best ways to start building connections. When you’re just getting started with using Instagram for small business, building up your initial audience should be your top priority. You need to start getting eyes on your profile to get some initial shares and engagement.\nRegramming is a quick and easy way to start getting some momentum. Unlike other networks, Instagram doesn’t have a native way to share other people’s content. You can either Like or comment. But there are third party apps that give you the ability to regram. Check out our guide on how to regram for more info and some different apps you can use.\n#Repost @happymundane with @repostapp ・・・ #ad Had fun creating a spacey little adventure for @tictacusa Hope your weekend is out of this world! 🌌🚀👽 #littleadventures #golittle \nA photo posted by TicTacUSA (@tictacusa) on Sep 9, 2016 at 12:15pm PDT \n\n9. Capitalize on Instagram Ads One of the biggest obstacles that stops small businesses from trying social media advertising is costs. When you don’t have a big budget, it’s a little more difficult to justify spending money on advertising. But Instagram Ads present a great opportunity for small businesses because it’s extremely affordable.\nGetting started is simple, particularly if you already have a Facebook Advertising account because it’s built into the same platform. However, we recommend creating custom image assets specifically for Instagram Ads instead of reusing the same ones you would for Facebook because of how it’s displayed in the feed.\n10. Host An Instagram Contest There’s no denying the fact that people absolutely love free stuff. Instagram contests give your company an interesting way to engage with current and potential fans.\nThere are certain elements that you’ll want to include in your contest to maximize your results:\nMake a theme for your contest instead of the generic “follow us to win a free product” approach. Create a custom hashtag for your contest. Make people tag a friend and comment to enter the contest. This will help your contest spread a lot quicker. Start promoting the contest at least a week before it starts to build anticipation. Consider collaborating with other companies or influencers to get even more reach. Before you start, read through Instagram’s promotion guidelines to make sure you’re doing everything above board. Since the goal is to get loyal followers, whatever you’re giving away should be somewhat related to your industry. That way you’re not just attracting freebie seekers, but people that are legitimately interested in your brand.\nIt's #GIVEAWAY TIME! THANK YOU Team Quest for making this such an awesome year!

Collaborate One of the quickest ways to get a surge of new followers is to get a shout out or mention from someone that already has a large following. The great thing about Instagram is that a lot of popular accounts aren’t owned by huge corporations. They’re owned by regular people and lifestyle entrepreneurs who have done a lot of the leg work to build their own audience already.\nWhen these people give a brand a shout out, their followers instantly go to check out the account and will more than likely give you a follow. This is one of the techniques Neil Patel used in his infamous $57,000 Instagram case study .\nThe two most common ways to get mentioned by established accounts are:\nPay for a sponsored post (this can cost you anywhere from $20-$100+ per post) Establish a relationship or partner up with them Obviously the second method is ideal, but let’s start out with the first option.\nA lot of small businesses aren’t aware that paying for sponsored Instagram posts is even an option, but it’s a very popular way to start get the ball rolling on your account. The male accessory brand Bachelr used sponsored Instagram posts to promote its website when it first launched, and saw great results .\nThe brand generated over 20,000 new visitors in just two weeks.\nBachelr credits a huge chunk of the success to influencer marketing.\nOne of our most successful posts was a model holding one of our products in a natural setting, no logo anywhere. This got 10k likes and 100+ comments.\nMake a list of the top influencers related to your industry on Instagram. Focus on individuals rather than businesses. Most users who accept sponsored posts will have their contact information in their profile so it’s easy to reach them.\nWhen you’re looking for influencers, choose people who are a good match for your brand. Otherwise the new followers you’ll gain won’t be very likely to engage with your content.\nThe second technique is simply good old fashion networking. Start following companies who are complementary to your brand and engage with their content. Leave comments, like their photos and even reach out to them via email. As these relationships start to grow, look for opportunities to promote each other on Instagram . Maybe you can team up on a joint venture or host an event together. Post photos on your Instagram pages and tag each other in them. There are plenty of possibilities.\nOne company putting an interesting twist on both of these techniques is Gym Shark. The active wear company caters to athletes, bodybuilders and people who live all-around active lives. One of Gym Shark’s techniques for growing its following is sponsoring influencers in the fitness niche. Its sponsored athletes post pictures on their own Instagram pages wearing Gym Shark’s products, and Gym Shark posts images of them on its page as well.\nAll black everything.

Engage With Your Competitor’s Followers Two of the most important characteristics of an engaged Instagram follower are:\nThey’re interested in your niche/industry They like the content you post With this strategy, the first part is already taken care of. If a user is following one of your competitors, they’re more than likely already interested in your industry. That makes it easier to win them over and get them to follow you too. From that point, it’s all about keeping them engaged through the content you post.\nMake a list of your top competitors who are active on Instagram. You may want to put them all into a spreadsheet to make it easier to track. Start with the first competitor and follow about 50-100 of their followers. This step alone will get you a few new followers. But we’re not just after followers, we want engaged followers who will help spread the word about our brand. In order to attract those users, you’ll need to communicate with them. On Instagram, there are three basic ways to engage with people:\nFollow them Like their photos Comment on their photos You’ve already followed them, so now you just have to like some of their photos, comment or both. This will increase the likelihood of people following you back, and also reciprocating your engagement. The more you engage with your audience, the bigger your return will be.\n\nAre You on Instagram Yet? Growing a dedicated following on Instagram won’t happen overnight. But the bright side is that Instagram users are very active and love to engage. So once you get the ball rolling, you’ll notice that your brand will start to build organically. Start putting these techniques into action and you’ll see how powerful Instagram can be for your business.\nSign up for a free 30 day trial of Sprout to give our Instagram features a test drive. \nThis post 12 Ways to Use Instagram for Small Business originally appeared on Sprout Social .\n",

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "title": "[Deal Alert] Get $10 of free Starbucks credit when you add $10 to the app via Visa Checkout",
      "text": "News \nDear Starbucks: thank you for existing. Not for your overpriced smoothie-coffee or your approachable yuppie atmosphere. No, thank you for being a Wi-Fi-soaked escape from my rural family's home during the holidays - T-Mobile service is still crappy out there. And while I'm extending some holiday thanks, I might as well give a shout-out to Visa, which is giving Starbucks customers $10 of free credit via the Starbucks app . That's approximately 2.5 Frappuccinos. \nTo get your ten bucks of free coffee, you'll need three things: some flavor of Visa debit or credit card, a working Visa Checkout account (it's like PayPal), and the Starbucks app with an associated Starbucks reward account. Load up $10 worth of credit into the Starbucks app with your card using Visa Checkout, and you'll get $10 on the house. The promotion starts today and ends at midnight Pacific on November the 22nd. The credit should show up in your Starbucks app (which is also what you use to check out at the counter) within a day. \nCustomers can put in as much money as they like via Visa Checkout, but $10 is necessary for the bonus credit and it doesn't get any bigger with any extra money. After that you can go back to paying for coffee with cash or a card swipe, like some kind of shuffling Neanderthal in a Christmas sweater. Source:",

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "Modern Nativity\nHow you ever have wondered how the story of the Nativity would be told in modern life? Modern Nativity has imagined how the birth of Jesus may have gone had it occurred in 2016 in their Hipster Nativity Set, putting an overly trendy and stereotype-laden twist on the classic Nativity scene.\nThe Hipster Nativity Set features seven-inch, hand-painted figurines, including segway-riding Wisemen with Amazon Prime packages in tow; a man bun-wearing, selfie-taking Joseph, with Mary, Starbucks cup in hand, doing a duck face with Jesus, lying in a manger wearing his handmade beanie. There is also an organic cow eating gluten-free feed, in addition to a sheep donning a Christmas sweater and a shepherd documenting the whole thing on his iPhone—complete with hashtags.\n\nAccording to the product description, the stable “may not be the Ritz Carlton, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have some cool amenities. Actually, all it has is a solar powered roof, but at least they’re helping to solve global warming.” Now all that’s missing is a GoPro to capture those sweet solar panels on the roof of the stable and maybe a vintage Polaroid camera for good measure.\nThe set costs $129 and is available in limited quantities.\nSocial Media Reacts to Hipster Nativity Set for the Holidays Your nativity is too mainstream bruh. pic.twitter.com/n4NLlozATo \n— Calvinist Hipster (@CalvinHipster) November 24, 2016 \n\nBehold the \"Hipster Nativity Set\".

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nThe suspect’s name has not been released …..\nOne commenter opined, “ISIS must not like over-priced coffee served by safe-space, leftist wussies either.”\nOr perhaps it is because Starbucks has said if you are not for gay marriage, don’t bother being their customers. FBI Nabs Latest Starbucks Bombing Suspect; ISIS Linked to Previous Attacks Craig Bannister | MRC, November 28, 2016:\nA suspect in the bombing of three Albuquerque, N.M. Starbucks is now in federal custody, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced Monday . While the suspect’s name has not been released, two other Starbucks bombings this year have been linked to the Islamic State (ISIS).\nJAKARTA, INDONESIA – JANUARY 14: A view of the blast site outside Starbucks after a series of explosions hit the Indonesia capital on January 14, 2016 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Reports of explosions and gunshots in the centre of the Indonesian capital, including outside the United Nations building and in the front of the Sarinah shopping mall, an area with many luxury hotels, embassies and offices. (Photo by Oscar Siagian/Getty Images) The explosive devices were detonated at three Starbucks coffee shops – located at 3400 Central Ave. SE; 4407 Lomas Blvd. NE; and 5401 Gibson Blvd. SE – last Friday, and police found evidence of gun shots at two of the locations. According to the FBI’s original release:\n“Federal and Albuquerque law enforcement and fire officials are investigating the vandalism of three Albuquerque coffee shops that occurred after midnight on November 25, 2016.\n“Suspicious devices were placed at three closed Starbucks coffee shops, and one caused minimal damage.”\nA bombing that left 34 people dead in March of this year at a Brussels airport, which included a Starbucks target, was claimed by ISIS :\n“In its claim of responsibility, the Islamic State group said its members detonated suicide vests both at the airport and in the subway, where many passengers fled to safety down dark tunnels filled with hazy smoke from the explosion. A small child wailed, and commuters used cell phones to light their way out. IS warned of further attacks, issuing a communique promising “dark days” for countries taking part in the anti-IS coalition, warning\n“The government said at least 11 people were killed at the airport and 20 on the subway, where the bomb hit an enclosed train car. Later, a security official said the overall death toll had risen to 34, without providing a breakdown of where.”\nAnd, in January, Indonesian officials declared ISIS responsible for an explosion and gun fight at a Starbucks café in Jakarta :\n“Indonesia’s capital Jakarta was hit by a series of bombings today (Jan. 14) that killed two civilians, including one Canadian. Officials blamed the attack on Islamic State militants , some of whom have allegedly been captured.\n“A number of explosions rocked the city’s Sarinah neighborhood starting at around 10:45am local time, followed by a gun battle between attackers and police outside a Starbucks cafe that was one of the targets.”\nThe targeting of Starbucks cafes is nothing new, though. In December of last year, a bomb threat was made against a Starbucks on the grounds of Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and, as far back as 2009, a Starbucks on the upper East Side of New York was victimized by a bombing.",

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "\nThe suspect’s name has not been released ….. One commenter opined, “ISIS must not like over-priced coffee served by safe-space, leftist wussies either.” Or perhaps it is because Starbucks has said if you are not for gay marriage, don’t bother being their customers. FBI Nabs Latest Starbucks Bombing Suspect; ISIS Linked to Previous Attacks \nCraig Bannister | MRC, November 28, 2016: \nA suspect in the bombing of three Albuquerque, N.M. Starbucks is now in federal custody, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced Monday . While the suspect’s name has not been released, two other Starbucks bombings this year have been linked to the Islamic State (ISIS). JAKARTA, INDONESIA – JANUARY 14: A view of the blast site outside Starbucks after a series of explosions hit the Indonesia capital on January 14, 2016 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Reports of explosions and gunshots in the centre of the Indonesian capital, including outside the United Nations building and in the front of the Sarinah shopping mall, an area with many luxury hotels, embassies and offices. (Photo by Oscar Siagian/Getty Images) \nThe explosive devices were detonated at three Starbucks coffee shops – located at 3400 Central Ave. SE; 4407 Lomas Blvd. NE; and 5401 Gibson Blvd. SE – last Friday, and police found evidence of gun shots at two of the locations. According to the FBI’s original release: \n“Federal and Albuquerque law enforcement and fire officials are investigating the vandalism of three Albuquerque coffee shops that occurred after midnight on November 25, 2016. \n“Suspicious devices were placed at three closed Starbucks coffee shops, and one caused minimal damage.” \nA bombing that left 34 people dead in March of this year at a Brussels airport, which included a Starbucks target, was claimed by ISIS : \n“In its claim of responsibility, the Islamic State group said its members detonated suicide vests both at the airport and in the subway, where many passengers fled to safety down dark tunnels filled with hazy smoke from the explosion. A small child wailed, and commuters used cell phones to light their way out. IS warned of further attacks, issuing a communique promising “dark days” for countries taking part in the anti-IS coalition, warning \n“The government said at least 11 people were killed at the airport and 20 on the subway, where the bomb hit an enclosed train car. Later, a security official said the overall death toll had risen to 34, without providing a breakdown of where.” \nAnd, in January, Indonesian officials declared ISIS responsible for an explosion and gun fight at a Starbucks café in Jakarta : \n“Indonesia’s capital Jakarta was hit by a series of bombings today (Jan. 14) that killed two civilians, including one Canadian. Officials blamed the attack on Islamic State militants , some of whom have allegedly been captured. \n“A number of explosions rocked the city’s Sarinah neighborhood starting at around 10:45am local time, followed by a gun battle between attackers and police outside a Starbucks cafe that was one of the targets.” \nThe targeting of Starbucks cafes is nothing new, though. In December of last year, a bomb threat was made against a Starbucks on the grounds of Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and, as far back as 2009, a Starbucks on the upper East Side of New York was victimized by a bombing.

      "text": "Tabitha Shiflett \nIn wake of Starbucks’ protests, #TrumpCups, and the political mess America has gotten itself into, we finally have something to be excited about – flowering marshmallows. \nThanks to mad pastry genius, Dominique Ansel, who introduced us to Cronuts in 2013, you can now grow a tiny, white flower of a marshmallow in what Ansel calls “Blossoming Hot Chocolate.” Flowering marshmallows for your hot chocolate by @DominiqueAnsel pic.twitter.com/as28fwpLpt \n— Emma Cooke (@PetiteBlondine) November 16, 2016 \nAnsel’s magical hot chocolate is topped with a beautiful marshmallow flower that’s held closed by a small, thin ring of white chocolate. Once the marshmallow is dropped into your mug of warm, chocolatey goodness, the white chocolate ring melts, and voila! A flower appears. A photo posted by ℃YNTHIA | Adventurer | ⓃⓎⒸ ???? (@lycynthialy) on Nov 20, 2016 at 7:28am PST \nAnsel is the chef and owner of SoHo’s Dominique Ansel Bakery. Since Ansel’s opening in 2011, the bakery has won multiple awards including Time Out New York ‘s “Best New Bakery of 2012,” and Metromix ‘s “Best Bakery of 2012.” \nAccording to AM New York , this sweet treat was created in celebration of Ansel’s five-year anniversary. \nFollowing his first dessert masterpiece – the cronut – Chef Ansel won the James Beard Award for “Outstanding Pastry Chef” of the nation and was one of Crain ‘s “40 Under 40.” \nAccording to Ansel’s website, the Cronut Pastry took two months and more than 10 recipes to prefect. Made with a laminated dough, similar to that of a croissant, the Cronut Pastry is first proofed and then fried in grapeseed oil at a specific temperature. Once cooked, the pastry is flavored in three ways – it is rolled in sugar, filled with cream, and topped with glaze. \nEach month, Ansel features a different flavor. \nPrevious Cronut Pastry flavors include: \n2013",

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

      "text": "A man, allegedly upset about how long his order is taking at a Miami Starbucks, yells \"Trump\" at an employee on Nov. 16, 2016. jorge de cárdenas via Twitter @Jbdcl \nTwo days later, political consultant Tim Treadstone posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. “Operation #TrumpCup” was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name. \n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.” \nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names. \nThe movement is an “attempt to troll [Starbucks’s] famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. \n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain - a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths. \n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email. \nIn a video , he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said. \nThe movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray. \n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.” \nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.” \nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag. \n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said. \nStarbucks’s holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized, too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask , then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street. Starbucks said it was a coincidence. \nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup . \nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year, too. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released a series of elaborate but secular designs - birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh. \n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said. \nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger - a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change. \n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!” \nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato. \nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte. \n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.” \nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz, is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where open carry is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line - “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish. \nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the crosshairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators. \n“The stage has almost been set for not only consumers but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said. \nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand. \n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.” \nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup - except when it’s Trump’s name instead. Starbucks’ new cup is displayed, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in New York. One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it said is meant to be “a symbol of unity.” The green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.

(Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 7:31 PM. CST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

(Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 8:31 PM. EST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "Instagram Downloads With family homelessness at a crisis point, King County’s business leaders, including The Starbucks Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft Corp., Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Group Health Cooperative, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, and the Seattle Mariners, are joining an unprecedented employer-led effort to raise more than $3 million to ensure “No Child Sleeps Outside” Campaign benefitting Mary’s Place arrives in more than 200 Starbucks stores across King County, where Starbucks will raise awareness and match customer donations (up to an additional $1 million) throughout the month of December \nVideo and photo downloads for media use here or click the buttons above to share to social platforms \n\nSEATTLE (November 29, 2016) – The Starbucks Foundation and Schultz Family Foundation announced today their support of the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign by Mary’s Place . Together with other businesses, they are joining an unprecedented effort to mobilize the community, and contributing over $3 million to provide safe emergency shelter for the estimated 500 unsheltered families in King County, including hundreds of children. The campaign also has the support of companies like Microsoft Corp., Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Group Health Cooperative, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, Seattle Mariners, as well as the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Seattle Association which together represent thousands of Seattle businesses. \nFollowing a nearly 20 percent jump in the homeless count last year , families with young children are waiting months for emergency shelter, leaving many sleeping on the streets, in cars and parks across the community. This move by The Starbucks Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft, and others supports an immediate expansion of Mary’s Place and responds to the critical, short-term need to bring unsheltered families inside. Separately, the organizations also expressed support for the mayor’s Pathways Home strategy, which addresses some of the systemic problems contributing to the homeless crisis. It includes a shift towards rapid rehousing, funding for expanded shelter hours at several shelters, and the creation of lockers for the homeless. Recognizing that city and county reforms to provide affordable housing will take months or years, supporters of the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign believe it is critical to provide immediate emergency shelter for hundreds of children. \n“The 500 families with small children who are sleeping outside in King County cannot wait for the promised reforms and housing that will take a year or more,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer of Starbucks and cofounder of the Schultz Family Foundation. “We need to treat this daily tragedy with the same urgency that would follow any natural disaster. This is a short-term but urgent humanitarian need, and we are proud to join other Seattle employers in the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign.” \nMary’s Place is a 17-year-old emergency shelter organization with six locations throughout the county that operates primarily with private funding. Mary’s Place provides emergency shelter to nearly 40 percent of families experiencing homelessness across King County by serving 115-120 families per night, and 400 families throughout the year. However, 20 families a day are still turned away because there is not enough capacity at these shelters. \n“King County is facing an unprecedented homelessness crisis and more than 500 families are sleeping outside each night in places unfit for habitation,” said Marty Hartman, executive director of Mary’s Place. “It breaks our hearts to have to turn them away each day. We are so incredibly grateful for the support of our business partners like Starbucks, Microsoft, the Schultz Family Foundation and so many others who are making it possible for us to expand our services and bring more families inside to warmth, safety, and stability.” \n“No child should have to sleep outside at night. We must come together as a community to address this vital need as a local imperative,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft president. “We are pledging $1 million, including $250,000 to Mary’s Place, to address homelessness across King County. We will support partners throughout the area to pursue both short- and long-term systemic solutions, including permanent housing.” The Starbucks Foundation to Match Customer Donations in more than 200 King County Stores in December \nIn addition to a $1 million financial contribution to the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, The Starbucks Foundation will match every dollar donated by customers in participating King County Starbucks® stores between December 1-31, up to an additional $1 million dollars to help shelter local families. The Starbucks Foundation will also allocate an additional $250,000 to other local nonprofits, including the United Way, YWCA, and Youth Care, that connect homeless families and youth to job placement programs, and other critical services. \nHoward and Sheri Schultz, cofounders of the Schultz Family Foundation, are also personally contributing $1 million to Mary’s Place through the Schultz Family Foundation to expand both shelter capacity and the organization’s ability to move families into permanent housing. In addition, the Schultz Family Foundation will continue to support other Seattle homelessness organizations to reduce the number of unsheltered youth and young adults. \nAbout Mary’s Place \nMary’s Place empowers homeless women, children and families to reclaim their lives by providing shelter, nourishment, resources, healing and hope in a safe community. Mary’s Place operates six crisis response family shelters providing refuge and community for 400 family members experiencing homelessness. The organization focuses on an innovative strategy of combining prevention, emergency shelter and resources for transition into housing to bring families out of homelessness. At their Family Center, Mary’s Place provides shelter, services and resources in the same building. This allows families, together with their assigned Housing & Wellness Advocates, to focus on individualized plans for overcoming barriers and finding employment and stable housing. It does all this cost effectively in loaned buildings that are empty and awaiting development, for just dollars per night.

The foundation supports programs around the globe through Starbucks Opportunity for Youth Grants as well as other grant programs. The Starbucks Foundation is a separate 501(c)(3) charitable organization that receives funding primarily from Starbucks Corporation and private donations. \nAbout Schultz Family Foundation \nThe Schultz Family Foundation was cofounded in 1996 by Sheri Kersch Schultz and her husband Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo of Starbucks Coffee Company. Guided by a belief that an “inequality of opportunity” is stifling America’s potential, the foundation invests in innovative programs and partnerships that unlock human potential, remove barriers to success and create new pathways to opportunity. The Schultz Family Foundation currently supports two signature national initiatives: Onward Youth and Onward Veterans. For more information, visit http://schultzfamilyfoundation.org , \nFor  ",

      "text": "Close Fired Starbucks barista's tell-all confession goes viral Photos taken by a barista at a Starbucks in Elk Grove showing trash and a dirty steam wand goes viral. (Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 5:31 PM. PST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "Why Starbucks Remains in Investors' Good Favor PART 2 OF 5 Why Are Analysts Expecting Starbucks’s Revenue to Rise? By Ralph Nathan | Nov 29, 2016 4:23 pm EST Revenue sources \nStarbucks ( SBUX ) has classified its operations into five categories: Americas, China and Asia-Pacific (or CAP), EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa), Channel Development, and all other segments. \nIn fiscal 4Q16, Starbucks’s Americas revenue formed 69.5% of its total revenue, while CAP, Channel Development, and EMEA formed 14.7%, 9.1%, and 4.7%, respectively. Revenue estimates \nAnalysts expect Starbucks to post overall revenue of $23.1 billion in fiscal 2017, representing a rise of 8.5% over fiscal 2016. The company’s revenue growth is expected to be driven by positive same-store sales growth (or SSSG) and the addition of new restaurants in the next 12 months. \nThe company’s management has set its same-store sales guidance for fiscal 2017 in the mid-single-digit range, with fiscal 1H17 being on the lower side. Starbucks also expects to add 2,100 new stores in fiscal 2017, 60% of these additions being outside the United States. \nIn the United States, the company plans to add 800 units split equally among company-owned and franchised stores. In the CAP region, Starbucks plans to add 1,000 stores, with 60% being franchised stores. The EMEA regions are expected to add 300 new franchised stores. \nStarbucks’s SSSG is expected to be driven by menu innovations and the enhancement of the customer experience through the implementation of Mobile Order & Pay and other technological advancements. In partnership with Anheuser-Busch InBev ( BUD ), SBUX is expected to bring premium Teavana ready-to-drink teas into the United States in 1H17. Peer comparisons \nDuring the same period, Dunkin’ Brands ( DNKN ), Domino’s Pizza ( DPZ ), and McDonald’s ( MCD ) are expected to post revenue rises of 4.3%, 8.7%, and -6.2%, respectively. \nNext, we’ll look at analysts’ EPS estimates for the next four quarters.

      "text": "PHOTO: \nStarbucks \nNext to hot cocoa and mulled wine, there's no beverage that's more quintessentially \"holiday\" than those served in Starbucks's signature red (or green ?) cups. The experience may not scream warm, fuzzy holidays—long lines, misspelled Sharpie names, and disgruntled customers—but ahh, that first sip of a hot and foamy gingerbread latte: Christmas in a cup. \nBut with these sweet, seasonal beverages comes a lot of concern about their nutritional value: a Grande Eggnog Latte has as much fat as 2.5 glazed donuts . Drinking all that fat just seems wrong, doesn't it? Fortunately, not all of the Starbucks's holiday drinks are off-limits, and according to a few top nutritionists, one drink reigns supreme above all others (nutritionally speaking). Keep scrolling to find out which drink causes the least guilt! 1 / 1 \nWhile it's newer to the holiday drink roster, the Gingerbread Tea Latte won't tip the scale as much as the coffee company's other beverages. However, don't just order it flat-out—you'll need to rehearse that comedically long Starbucks drink order to make sure you're cutting out unnecessary calories and sugar. \nSays Lauren O'Connor, RD, CCN, an 8 oz. cup of the Gingerbread Tea Latte with no whipped topping and 2% milk comes in at 100 calories, 2g of fat, and 16g of sugar. \"It appears to be the least processed—mainly tea and whipped milk with perhaps a teaspoon or so of sugar or spice blend.\" \nAdds Alissa Rumsey, RD, \"Ask for just one or two pumps of syrup to keep the sugar content in check.\" As for milk, she actually doesn't recommend skim milk. \"I recommend 2% or whole milk in order to add some fat to the drink, which will help with satiety.\" Almond milk has fewer calories, but you may feel more compelled to order another cup because it's less filling. \nAnd while we get that it's getting much, much chillier out, ordering your Gingerbread Tea Latte iced instead of hot means fewer calories solely because there's less volume. Says Maria Bella, RD, and the owner of Top Balance Nutrition, \"An iced beverage generally contains fewer calories because of the added ice, thus less of the actual drink.\" So if you can trick your brain into drinking less beverage out of the same size cup you'd normally order a hot beverage in, go for it. \nBella also notes that the 8 oz. cup (a \"short\" in Starbucks language) isn't outright advertised on the menu. (For reference, a \"tall\" cup is 12 oz.) So here's your new order: \"One short Gingerbread Tea Latte, 2 pumps of syrup, 2% milk, and no whipped cream.\" Big name, little calories. \nWhat's your favorite Starbucks holiday drink?

      "text": "Close Fired Starbucks barista's tell-all confession goes viral Photos taken by a barista at a Starbucks in Elk Grove showing trash and a dirty steam wand goes viral. (Nov. 29, 2016) Gabrielle Karol, KXTV 9:03 PM. EST November 29, 2016 (Photo: Karol, Gabrielle) \nA Facebook post from a fired Elk Grove Starbucks barista is going viral. \nSince Christian Brown posted his rant on Nov. 27, his photos and confessions have been shared 3,400 times, with the post receiving 1,600 comments. \n“I’ve worked a shift or two at other Starbucks, and I’ve never seen anything this bad,” Brown explained. \nIn the post, Brown's pictures show trash and food littering the floor behind the counter, a fly trap covered in flies and a dirty milk steamer that had turned brown. Brown made other claims about the cleanliness at the Bond Rd. location in Elk Grove, adding that the standards had taken a turn for the worse since new management had taken over. \n“For five bucks for a cup of coffee, you deserve more than this,” Starbucks customer Luis Espinoza said, after seeing the pictures. \nBrown said the photos were taken roughly three months ago, when he was about to start cleaning the facility during his shift. \n“The problem is with them being that dirty,” Brown said, adding that a little bit of clutter is to be expected. \nThe Bond Rd. Starbucks passed state health inspections as recently as Oct. 26, 2016. Starbucks spokesman Reggie Borges said the company was aware of Brown’s claims but had done a thorough investigation of the store. \n“We’re disappointed that this former partner was interested in portraying this store in a bad light. We’ve made several visits and are confident this is not a regular issue,” Borges added. \nThe Facebook post has led many commenters to say they’ll be quitting Starbucks for good. But Brown said from what he’s seen, most Starbucks are run well. \n“It was really when new management went in that things started being bad,” he said. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",
