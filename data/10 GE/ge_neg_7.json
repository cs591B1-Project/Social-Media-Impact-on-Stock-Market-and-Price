      "text": "Enlarge Picture GE Advanced Materials Boron Nitride coatings provide the benefits of BNexcellent lubricity, non-wetting, and high temperature stabilityin an easy-to-apply medium for a wide range of applications. Release Agents, Lubricants, and Protective Coatings- Boron nitride remains lubricious and inert even at extremely high temperatures. Coatings made with BN prevent sticking to increase the life of dies/molds, improve product surface finishes, and reduce production times. Metal Processing- In molten metal processing and metal forming applications, BN coatings protect surfaces which come into contact with hot and molten metals. BN inhibits corrosion and chemical attack and provides easier release and longer mold/die life. Applications include casting, stamping, forging, extrusion, and powder metallurgy. Glass Making- Boron nitrides high temperature lubricating properties make it ideal in glass making, where it helps to minimize surface defects, improves mold/die life and release, and reduces clean-up time. Most glass formulations will not stick to BN. Plastic/Rubber- Producers of injection-molded plastics and elastomers benefit from BN in die and molding applications. Boron nitride improves die release and increases production speeds. Sintering- Sintering of metallic and ceramic powders is typically done on graphite plates. A coating of BN can essentially eliminate carbon contamination, reactivity, and sticking all of which can occur at sintering temperatures. Welding and Brazing- Boron nitride coatings are ideal for welding and furnace brazing. They protect surfaces from weld spatter and provide superior stop-off protection. BN coatings also protect MIG/MAG welding nozzles from weld spatter.

      "text": "Enlarge Picture GE Advanced Materials Boron Nitride coatings provide the benefits of BNexcellent lubricity, non-wetting, and high temperature stabilityin an easy-to-apply medium for a wide range of applications. Release Agents, Lubricants, and Protective Coatings- Boron nitride remains lubricious and inert even at extremely high temperatures. Coatings made with BN prevent sticking to increase the life of dies/molds, improve product surface finishes, and reduce production times. Metal Processing- In molten metal processing and metal forming applications, BN coatings protect surfaces which come into contact with hot and molten metals. BN inhibits corrosion and chemical attack and provides easier release and longer mold/die life. Applications include casting, stamping, forging, extrusion, and powder metallurgy. Glass Making- Boron nitrides high temperature lubricating properties make it ideal in glass making, where it helps to minimize surface defects, improves mold/die life and release, and reduces clean-up time. Most glass formulations will not stick to BN. Plastic/Rubber- Producers of injection-molded plastics and elastomers benefit from BN in die and molding applications. Boron nitride improves die release and increases production speeds. Sintering- Sintering of metallic and ceramic powders is typically done on graphite plates. A coating of BN can essentially eliminate carbon contamination, reactivity, and sticking all of which can occur at sintering temperatures. Welding and Brazing- Boron nitride coatings are ideal for welding and furnace brazing. They protect surfaces from weld spatter and provide superior stop-off protection. BN coatings also protect MIG/MAG welding nozzles from weld spatter.

The combined company would be the world's second-largest oilfield services provider.\nThe report said the new company would be well positioned even if oil prices do not rise significantly. It said that Evercore analyst James West believes the stock could be worth $69 a share, more than 10 percent above its closing price of $61.88 on Friday.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Peter Cooney)",

      "text": "A \nNEW YORK: Shares of oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc could rise significantly if it completes its merger with General Electric Co's oil and gas division, according to a report in Barron's. \nThe companies announced the deal last month, just as competition in the sector started to heat up after several years of low crude prices. The combined company would be the world's second-largest oilfield services provider. \nThe report said the new company would be well positioned even if oil prices do not rise significantly. It said that Evercore analyst James West believes the stock could be worth US$69 a share, more than 10 percent above its closing price of US$61.88 on Friday. \n(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Peter Cooney) - Reuters",

      "text": "Summary \nDivestiture of the GE Capital business is making major impacts on GE's cash flows. \nInvestors are closely weighing the possible outcomes and need to keep a close eye on the company's dividend forecast. \nOver $193B worth of deals have been inked since 2014 and CEO Jimmy Immelt is now turning his attention to transforming the conglomerate's constituency of industrial businesses. In this article, I take a look at how General Electric's (NYSE: GE ) business transformation is affecting cash flows. You may be shocked to learn the sheer magnitude of change in dollar volume GE has accomplished during the last two years. We'll also be looking at the latest and biggest non-GE Capital related transaction CEO Jimmy Immelt is leading the company through. Twelve Month's Trailing Free Cash Flow Collapses This graph charts the trailing twelve month's free cash flow at GE. Witness the startling picture as the cash flows related to $193 billion worth of divestitures relating to GE Capital fall off the books. Graph of the trailing twelve months free cash flow at GE: Click to enlarge (Source: Faloh Investment) Cash generated through regular operations shrinks to quarterly levels not seen at the company since 1991: Graph of cash generated by operations at GE: Click to enlarge (Source: Faloh Investment) Not all of these divested cash flows were profits, however the magnitude of change in cash flows warrants your attention. GE Capital Divestiture Come next year, GE Capital -- a very complicated business to evaluate -- will finally stop giving analysts headaches. The company expects to be completely divested of GE Capital by the end of this year . Thanks to exiting the Capital business, GE has shed tons of liabilities and is better positioned to avoid burdensome regulations. It will likely take one to two years for the accounting and cash flow affects of the divestitures to shake-out of the reported books. In the meantime, investors need to focus on the following fundamental factors at the company. General Electric's Resources To Make It Through Liquidity issues can stop a company in its tracks despite profitable operations or soon to be realized opportunities. When cash balances at a company are stressed the common stock dividend is among the first place to take cuts. Investors typically respond to dividend cuts with sell-offs, and a drop in the security's trading price often results. Investors want to avoid holding a security through dividend cuts whenever possible because the investment takes a double-whammy to its value: The loss of dividend income and capital value. Dividend Check GE is a wide spanning company with international operations. Nonetheless, nearly all the cash for investor's dividend payments is generated through the operations section of the cash flow statement. To maintain a stable dividend throughout the coming year cash payments amounting to $8.93B will have to be made. As noted in the graph above, a substantial drop in cash from operations associated with the business transformation resulted in just $4.87B of cash generation at the company for the trailing twelve months. While I'm not sounding the alarm on incoming cuts for GE's dividend, you will do well to track the imbalance between GE's cash generation and dividend payments. If cash from operations continues to lag behind the company's dividend payments it may pose a problem for the company's dividend. Clearly the company made the right decision when announcing 2016's dividend freeze. Another year of frozen dividends at GE appears to be forthcoming. Summary: GE paid out $4.06B more cash than it earned from operations, and money invested in capital expenditures as part of regular business operations came from balance sheet resources. Going forward, investors need to pay close attention to the firm's cash from operations. GE needs to grow its regular cash generation in order to sustain the dividend over the long-term. Liquidity GE's short-term asset position -- primarily constituted by cash, marketable securities, and inventory -- is three times larger than its short-term liabilities. Due to their ample cash and sufficient credibility, the company is positioned with the capability to survive hell or high water during the next two years as the transformation resolves. Bulletin: GE's Oil & Gas Business Spin Off GE is spinning off its Oil & Gas Business into a merger with $26.16B oil services giant Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI ). Holders of BHI will receive a $17.50 cash dividend and stock in the newly formed entity. The resulting GE-BHI Oil & Gas Business will trade on the public market as a new entity. The new business will supposedly offer an enhanced value propostion to the oil patch says GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt. The plan is simple. A combined entity will aim to provide a greater degree of service in the oil patch by leveraging the combination of the Oil & Gas businesses each respective company contributes, plus tapping into the rest of GE's portfolio of services (such as on-site power generation and big data) wherever appropriate. GE will retain an equity interest in the newly formed company. A portion of cash earned in the Oil & Gas Business will continue to flow into GE's coffers and contribute to offsetting the loss of cash brought in by the present Oil & Gas subsidiary. Takeaway Anticipated dividends from GE aren't covered by operating cash flows. Cash generation at the company for a trailing twelve month period was recently reported negative for the first time since 1998. Yet there's no reason to panic. Liquidity and dividend payment concerns are alleviated by ample short-term resources and loads of cash coming in through the sale of the GE Capital business. Nonetheless, there is a lot of uncertainty as to how the marketplace will value GE in one to two year's time as the accounting catches up to the transformed operations. The work going on at GE makes for the largest scale business transformation of all time. GE's entry into the Capital business during CEO Jack Welch's time was a time of enormous expansion and value creation for shareholders. Will CEO Jeffrey Immelt's reconstitution of the conglomerate be viewed similarly? In my opinion, GE is a sell because the ongoing transformation has instigated a large amount of uncertainty as to the likely business results over the next twenty four months.

      "text": " Google+\nBoston Children’s Hospital\nDoctors say MRIs of children’s brains are easily misread.\nBy Priyanka Dayal McCluskey Globe Staff November 28, 2016\nBoston Children’s Hospital is teaming up with General Electric Co. to produce software that will help doctors more accurately interpret brain scans of young patients.\nUnder a deal set to be announced Monday, Children’s and Boston-based GE’s health care division will develop the system over the next 18 months, then market it to hospitals around the world.\nAdvertisement\nThe effort is part of GE’s Health Cloud, which is launching this week and is expected, over the next three to five years, to house hundreds of different “apps” that doctors can use to sort through medical data.\nTerms of the Children’s-GE deal were not disclosed.\nMost MRIs of children’s brains are done in community hospitals, and most of those hospitals do not employ radiologists who specialize in children’s brains, said Dr. Richard Robertson, radiologist-in-chief at Children’s. As a result, doctors can misinterpret the scans — either missing a sign of trouble or diagnosing a problem when there is none.\nBrain images can help detect metabolic problems, genetic abnormalities, tumors, development issues, and more.\n“If you look at the brain, it changes pretty rapidly in the first two to three years [of life],” Robertson said. “It can be really hard to decide whether what you’re seeing is the process of normal development or if something has gone wrong.”\nAdvertisement\nWith the new software, a radiologist sitting in any hospital will be able to compare his or her patient’s brain scan with that of other patients of the same age.\n“If I’m a generalist radiologist in the middle of anywhere, USA . . . I can see what a normal 5-year-old brain should look like,” said David Hale, a senior vice president at GE Healthcare who oversees imaging software. “Or, here are three images of potential diseased brains of children that look very similar to the one you just scanned.”\nFor Children’s, the partnership with GE represents a strategy that other premier hospitals are following: leveraging their expertise into products that can highlight their brand while bringing in new revenues. The hospital also works with IBM, Apple, and startups.\nAnother local nonprofit hospital company, Partners HealthCare, which owns Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s hospitals, has tapped into the digital software market. Partners developed software to help doctors make sense of genetic data , then commercialized the program last year.\n“Digital health . . . gives us the opportunity to download our expertise into software in a way that makes it more accessible to clinicians around the globe,” said Jean Mixer, vice president of strategy and digital health at Children’s.\nThe market for medical software, especially programs that analyze large amounts of data, is growing. It has been a focus for Governor Charlie Baker and other political and business leaders in Massachusetts. The digital health market is expected to grow to $32 billion over the next decade, Baker’s office said last week, after convening a new digital health care advisory council comprised of several business leaders.\nPriyanka Dayal McCluskey can be reached at priyanka.mccluskey@ globe.com .

      "text": "Date: November 28, 2016 \nNearly half of the wind energy in the United States comes from wind turbines built by General Electric, which has dominated the turbine industry for nearly 15 years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. \nGE is part of a triumvirate of companies whose turbines account for 75 percent of the wind energy produced annually in the U.S., the Energy Department said. Turbines from GE, Siemens, a German engineering company, and Vestas, a Danish wind-turbine manufacturer, generate most of the country’s wind energy. \nTurbines from the three companies also accounted for 92 percent of all wind turbines installed in 2015. Last year, 42 percent of turbines installed were built by GE, while 34 percent were built by Vestas and 16 percent by Siemens, according to the EIA data. \nGE has been the dominant manufacturer of wind turbines in the U.S. since it bought Enron’s wind business in 2002.

      "text": "Facebook \n– Northern governors have signed a deal that will see construction of solar power plants in Borno, Kebbi, Nassarawa, Niger and Taraba states \n– The power plants will generate 500 megawatts of electricity together and help the states to improve economic and social activities of their people Governor Shettima signing the MoU on behalf of the northern governors \nThe Northern States Governors’ Forum has announced the signing of a MoU with General Electric ‎International on Monday, November 28 for the construction of five solar plants that aim at generating 500 megawatts of electricity in some parts of Northern Nigeria. \nBorno State Governor and Chairman of the Northern States Governors’ Forum, Kashim Shettima, who signed the agreement on behalf of the ‎Governors, made the announcement on Monday. \nREAD ALSO: Trouble in the Niger Delta: Ex-militant commanders reject N/Delta leaders’ presentations to Buhari \nGeneral Electric’s Senior Executive, Western Europe and Africa, Armand Pineda and the President/Chief Executive Officer, ‎General Electric, Nigeria, Dr Lazarus Angbazo signed on behalf of their company in a brief ceremony which held at Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja. \nBased on the agreement, GE will build five solar power plants in Borno, Kebbi, Nassarawa, Niger and Taraba states and each of the plants expected to generate 100 megawatts of electricity, totaling 500 megawatts across the 5 States. \nShettima noted that the electricity is meant to stimulate economic activities and social services in the affected States through boosting agricultural food processing, small scale businesses in addition to supplying electricity to schools and hospitals. Shettima signing the documents \nThe project which is a pilot phase, is being coordinated by the Northern Nigeria Global Economic Re-integrationProgramme, newly created by the Northern Governors to serve as vehicle for the economic recovery of northern States through international relations on infrastructure, manufacturing, stimulate agricultural value chain and trade and make the region a global payer agricultural export in line with the vision of late Premier of the Region. \nThe Governors Forum led by Governor Kashim Shettima also employed Malam Tanimu Yakubu Kurfi as Chief Executive Officer of the Programme. Kurfi was Chief Economic Adviser to late President Umaru Musa Yar’adua and he has wide contact with leading development companies and financial institutions across the world. \nREAD ALSO: Awesome photos of amazing homes built specially for military men in Maiduguri \n“The 19 Governors of the north jointly created this approach. We want to go beyond lamentation to provide solutions and we all know that power is key to industrial development. With power, we can create jobs, stimulate our economies and make life better for our people. Cross-section of those at the signing of the MoU \nThe General Electric has over 120 years experience in energy solutions and they have been operating in Nigeria for over 50 years, we cannot have a better partner than GE. \n“We shall do our part as Governors, this I will assure you. We are deeply committed to this agreement” Governor Kashim Shettima said at the MOU signing ceremony. \nIt is believed that stable electricity in the country is being hampered by poor foreign exchange. \nEngr. Abiodun Akindele, the regional technical manager, Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC), on Thursday, November 24, attributed the high foreign exchange rate to the recent poor electricity supply in the region, Daily Trust reports. \nAkindele made this known when he appeared before the Ogun state House of Assembly.",

      "text": "GE Healthcare is teaming up with Boston Children’s Hospital to develop digital tools for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood diseases with an initial focus on diagnostic imaging for brain disease.\nIn this first project, GE will contribute its software and cloud computing prowess, while Boston Children’s radiologists will pitch in their clinical knowledge. The goal will be to create a decision-support tool to help radiologists interpret pediatric MRI scans of the brain, according to a statement. This has the potential to save money, time and stress associated with misdiagnosis and unnecessary testing.\nBecause the brain changes so quickly during early childhood, a disorder may be misinterpreted as normal brain maturation, while normal development may be mistaken for abnormal changes and lead to unnecessary testing, according to the statement. While some image databases exist against which to compare pediatric images, they tend to be restricted to the pediatric units of major academic institutions. The partners will build a platform with scans from children of varying ages to be used worldwide as a reference when interpreting pediatric brain images.\n\"Pediatric brain scans of children under the age of four can be particularly tricky to read because the brain is rapidly developing during this period of childhood,\" said Dr. Sanjay Prabhu, a pediatric neuroradiologist at Boston Children’s, in the statement. \"Since pediatric neuroradiologists are very scarce, we approached GE Healthcare to collaborate on the development of digital tools to help physicians of varying expertise read the scans.\"\nWhile this initial project focuses on brain imaging, GE plans to flesh out its stable of deep learning tools, aiming for a “hundreds of apps” in the GE Health Cloud by 2020, said Charles Koontz, GE Healthcare’s chief digital officer, in the statement.\nGE’s other cloud-based solutions include a handful of radiology-based apps launched a year ago, such as apps for collaborative care planning for radiologists and pathologists, image and report sharing and storing and analyzing a patient’s imaging data over time. Additionally, the company added a new software application to its Health Cloud in March: Imbio’s Lung Density Analysis. The app is an automated, biomarker-based quantitative lung imaging analysis tool to provide clinicians with more insights into lung CT data.",

      "text": "On Demand Webcasts Advertisement Home > Managed Services Providers and Software Solutions > Trying to Gain a Foothold in the Profitable Healthcare Vertical? Philips Now Offers a GE Alternative Trying to Gain a Foothold in the Profitable Healthcare Vertical? Philips Now Offers a GE Alternative Nov 28, 2016 Bloomberg | The VAR Guy Comments 0 \nChannel partners are scrambling to establish portfolios in the healthcare market. Gartner predicts that worldwide enterprise IT spending in the healthcare vertical will reach nearly $3.8 billion by 2020, providing huge opportunities for partners. Traditional VARs that supply tablets, scanners and other hardware for the industry had better start looking to transition to services as the market is almost at capacity for equipment, but software providers are still in somewhat short supply. To now, GE and, to a lesser extent, Siemens have provided most of the options utilized by the channel, but Philips is now making a big investment in software to help doctors and facilities harness data, the 'holy grail' of future revenue streams. Related Media Understanding Healthcare Data Security and Privacy Obligations Advertisement Royal Philips NV plans to roll out software designed to help doctors improve the diagnoses of diseases such as cancer as it challenges General Electric Co. and Siemens AG for a bigger share of the lucrative health-care solutions market. The apps will improve interpretation of data such as a sequence of scans, with different colors showing up minor differences easily be missed with the naked eye, Chief Executive Officer Frans van Houten said in a media briefing. It’s a market that could potentially grow twice as fast as Philips’ traditional business supplying scanners and other big-ticket medical gear. Software currently accounts for about 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of the 17 billion euros in sales generated by Philips. “The world does not need much more capacity in scanners, but is especially in need of better interpretation of data,” Van Houten said, adding that currently about half of diagnoses given to patients are incorrect. “This is the holy grail that we all are after.” Van Houten earlier this month told investors at a capital markets day in London that they should increasingly consider Philips a provider of software, as opposed to the iconic lightbulbs, TVs and CD players that have been core products during the company’s 125-year history. Philips has exited traditional businesses to focus on health care, and is streamlining its factory network and increasing spending on research to close the gap on its rivals. The Dutch company’s 12-month trailing 8.9 percent operating margin in healthcare sales lags behind GE Healthcare’s 16.9 percent and Siemens’ 15.7 percent, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. GE is bundling software apps on its health-care cloud platform capable of linking imaging machines and patient devices. Siemens also made the first steps in the area of ​​computer-assisted detection with software that analyzes pictures for typical patterns and irregularities and support radiologists in their analysis, including in mammography and lung screening. For Philips, the diagnosis software is just one product to come out of a 300 million-euro pool of cash that’s ring-fenced for developing breakthrough products. In total, Philips spends about 1.7 billion euros on R&D annually, as Van Houten aims to expand its product base internally rather than by buying companies to become bigger in the informatics business.",

      "text": "\nFreshman forward Jonathan Isaac drives in for a basket in his team's win over Minnesota on Monday. USA Today Images BOX SCORE: Florida State 75, Minnesota 67\nIt's been a while. As in nearly a decade. But with a 75-67 win over Minnesota, the Florida State men's basketball team ended its drought Monday in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge at the Tucker Center.\nThe last time FSU (6-1) won a ACC/Big Ten Challenge game came Nov. 27, 2007 when it beat Minnesota (6-1). It's a slightly odd statistic considering FSU picked up a 72-61 win over Illinois in its most recent game last weekend.\n\"Thought Minnesota did a good job of controlling the tempo in the first half,\" Seminoles coach Leonard Hamilton said. \"We were not able to get out and get involved in the transition game even though we held them to a low field goal percentage.\"\nPoor shooting and fouls slowed both teams early yet the Seminoles eventually wore down the Gophers. FSU opened the second half on an 11-3 run and parlayed it into a 23-9 start for a 54-42 lead.\nYet what may have been the game's most defining play came with the Seminoles already well ahead. Dwayne Bacon, who led all scorers with 18 points, lost his footing and then the ball.\nFreshman Trent Forrest was quick to grab the ball and had the wherewithal to make a no-look, behind-the-back pass to a wide open Jonathan Isaac for an easy slam dunk. Isaac's dunk gave FSU a 58-47 lead with 8:29 left in the half.\nIsaac finished with 14 points, 13 rebounds, two blocks and two steals while going 5 of 10 from the floor.\n\"I was definitely going to pass it anyways,\" Bacon said. \"So I mean once I slipped and I was on the ground, I didn't even know Trent passed it. I saw Jonathan dunking and I was like, 'Wow. This is crazy' because the crowd got involved. Everybody got intense and we just bought in on defense.\"\nThe Gophers were held to 32.2 percent from the floor yet the Seminoles went about it in different ways. First-half foul troubles slowed both teams and no one could really get into a rhythm.\nHamilton said pressuring Gophers guard Nate Mason became the focal point. Mason, who scored 11 points and three assists, was no longer controlling the offense and it forced the Gophers to find another facilitator.\nFinding that rhythm broke the doldrums from a first half when FSU and Minnesota combined for 28 first half fouls. The constant disruptions prevented either team from sustaining anything close to a run. Minnesota had two stretches when it scored seven unanswered points.\n\"I got a lot of respect for that team,\" Gophers coach Richard Pitino said. \"Coach Hamilton does a good job of just forcing you to make plays and taking you out of your offense.\"\nThe Seminoles had a 5-0 run to open the game and another 5-0 spot for a 17-12 edge with 11:02 remaining.\nNeither team really capitalized when they did have chances. FSU shot 34.6 percent from the field and were 1 of 9 for 11.7 percent from 3. Minnesota was no better. The Gophers shot 29.2 percent from 24 shots and were 33 percent from 12 3-pointers.\n\"We just wanted someone else to run the offense other than Mason,\" Hamilton said. \"He was doing such a great job. He's an excellent ballhandler and he's a very good scorer. We followed him through his career in high school.\n\"He was determined that he was going to keep the game at the pace that was best for them. Once we started rotating and creating some situations where someone else had to initiate the offense, we got into a different rhythm.\"",

      "text": "Northern Governors Sign MOU With GE On Construction Of 5 Power Stations Northern Governors Sign MOU With GE On Construction Of 5 Power Stations 0 Borno State Goverbor, Kashim Shettima, addressing a press conference The Northern States Governors’ Forum and General Electric ‎International, on Monday, November 28, 2916 signed a memorandum of understanding for the construction of five solar plants with a target of generating 500 megawatts of electricity in some parts of Northern Nigeria. Kashim Shettima, Borno State’s governor and chairman of the Northern States Governors’ Forum, signed the agreement on behalf of the ‎governors while Armand Pineda, General Electric’s senior executive, Western Europe and Africa, andDr. Lazarus Angbazo, president/chief executive officer, ‎General Electric, Nigeria, signed on behalf of their company in a brief ceremony which held at Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja. Based on the MOU, the General Electric which has 120 years experience in power generation, is to build five solar power plants to be located in Borno, Kebbi, Nassarawa, Niger and Taraba States which each of the plants expected to generate 100 megawatts of electricity totaling 500 megawatts across the 5 States. The electricity is meant to stimulate economic activities and social services in the affected States through boosting agricultural food processing, small scale businesses in addition to supplying electricity to schools and hospitals. The project which is a pilot phase, is being coordinated by the Northern Nigeria Global Economic Re-integration Programme, newly created by the northern governors to serve as vehicle for the economic recovery of northern States through international relations on infrastructure, manufacturing, stimulate agricultural value chain and trade and make the region a global player agricultural export in line with the vision of late Premier of the Region. The Northern governor’s forum engaged the services of Tanimu Kurfi as chief executive officer of the programme. Kurfi was chief economic adviser to late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua and he has wide contact with leading development companies and financial institutions across the world. “The 19 governors of the north jointly created this approach. We want to go beyond lamentation to provide solutions and we all know that power is key to industrial development. With power, we can create jobs, stimulate our economies and make life better for our people,” Shettima said at the MOU signing ceremony. “The General Electric has over 120 years experience in energy solutions and they have been operating in Nigeria for over 50 years, we cannot have a better partner than GE. We shall do our part as governors, this I will assure you. We are deeply committed to this agreement,” he said. The Northern Governors chairman enumerated challenges of poverty, unemployment, poor access to education, poor healthcare amongst other underdevelopment indications threatening the north while concluding that the power can provide a vehicle for the north to reposition itself for a better future. The CEO, Northern Nigeria Global Economic Re-Integration Programme, Tanimu Yakubu Kurfi said he took up the challenge ‎put forward by the Northern Governors as a result of strong passion and commitment to the aggressive development of the north as so far shown by the Northern Governors since Governor Shettima became the forum’s chairman in 2015. Reaffirming their commitment to the MOU, General Electric’s Senior Executive, Western Europe and Africa, Mr. Armand Pineda and the President/Chief Executive Officer, ‎General Electric, Nigeria, Dr. Lazarus Angbazo both pledged that they would work round the clock to realize the project for the benefits of citizens of the five States.

      "text": "Lauren Hepler Tuesday, November 29, 2016 - 1:30am Clockwise from top left: Geisha Williams, PG&E; Kevin McAllister, Boeing; Jan Dell, Wood Group; Emma Stewart, Impact Infrastructure; Stephanie Stuckey Benfield, City of Atlanta. \nThe year may be winding down, but there's plenty to report in this month's Names in the News wrap up of big hires, promotions and other job news in sustainable business. \nThis month we cover career changes from green design to green cities, Atlanta's first resilience chief and the executive swapping one industrial titan for another. \nHave a tip for our next installment? Shoot us an e-mail at [email protected] . Who's news \nGeisha Williams, PG&E \nCalifornia mega utility PG&E has tapped an in-house clean energy expert to serve as its next president and chief executive. Geisha Williams, currently president of the company's electric utility and responsible for growing renewable power capacity, will take the reigns of the entire company from current CEO Tony Earley Jr. \nIn addition to an uncertain national landscape for climate and energy policy, Williams — who reports cite as instrumental in the utility's recent decision to close the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant — also takes the job as PG&E looks to rebuild after a conviction this summer for safety violations related to a 2010 pipeline explosion. A native of Cuba, Williams will also be the first female Latina CEO for a Fortune 200 company. \nEmma Stewart, Impact Infrastructure \nEmma Stewart, former head of sustainability solutions for design software provider Autodesk, is diving deeper into the way we build infrastructure. \nStewart has been named chief business development officer of four-year-old Impact Infrastructure, which builds cost-benefit analysis tools for green building and infrastructure projects. \nKevin McAllister, Boeing \nBoeing has poached Kevin McAllister, former head of General Electric's aviation division, to head its flagship commercial aviation business. \nThe move comes as the aviation industry embarks on early stage joint emissions-reduction efforts, though the Wall Street Journal reports that McAllister will primarily be tasked with cutting production costs as the company looks to grow high-margin businesses like part replacement. \nStephanie Stuckey Benfield, City of Atlanta \nAtlanta is the latest city to name its first-ever chief resilience officer, selecting former 14-year Georgia state Rep. Stephanie Stuckey Benfield for the job. \nPrior to her appointment, Stuckey Benfield was director of the Mayor's Office of Sustainability for Atlanta. On the move \n— Veteran science and environmental reporter Andrew Revkin , most recently of the New York Times, has joined investigative reporting nonprofit ProPublica as a senior correspondent covering how countries and companies are (or aren't) working to combat climate change. \n— Veteran corporate sustainability executive Jan Dell has been tapped to lead the clean energy team for energy services company Wood Group. \n— The former managing director of the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, Owain Johnson , has signed on to run research and product development in London for U.S.-based energy development giant CME.

The company said it will also nominate at least “one new, international, independent board member” and create a separate governance committee. \nThe proposal has reported won support from several investors and would give back more control to the founding Lee family. \nThe review comes after US hedge fund Elliott Management proposed in October 2016 that Samsung split into a holding company and an operating company to fix its “excessive and inefficient capital structure”. \nThe fund said a split would simplify the company structure, making it easier to get a clear valuation of the firm’s assets and what each individual Samsung company is worth.

Samsung reports that its mobile payments app, which will soon be available in the UK , has transacted 100 million payments in its first year of availability. Samsung reports a 27% rise in operating profit for its mobile division in the second quarter, driven by strong demand for Galaxy smartphones , which the company expects to continue. \nCurrently, companies in the Samsung Group are linked through a complicated web of cross shareholding , linking Samsung Electronics to many other Samsung’s firms and affiliates ranging from shipping, to heavy industries to insurance business, according to Sigma Live . \nSamsung has also come under pressure from foreign investors to improve its corporate governance as it tries to limit the damage from the global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 after failing to resolve battery problems leading to overheating and the devices catching fire. \n“We are committed to enhancing sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and to remaining good stewards of capital,” Oh-Hyun Kwon, CEO of Samsung, said in the statement. \nSamsung has also announced that it will increase per-share dividends by 36% this year to 28,500 won (US$24.38). ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

According to HPE, the cost of memory is the limiting factor in the von Neumann architecture. \nSpeaking at the start of HPE Discovery in London, Kirk Bresniker, CTO for HPE’s enterprise group, said: “There are billions of devices coming online. There has to be a better way to think about an architecture than one that is six decades old. Moore’s Law is starting to slow down, and at the same time we are seeing a massive rise in the amount of data.” \nBresniker said HPE had set out to investigate how to design a computer system to cope with the coming growth in data. \n“Rather than isolating data and the CPU, we want to make insight to data central and allow algorithms to run in a way that is not possible today,” he said. \nHPE proposes that a modern computing architecture should no longer be processor-centric, but memory-driven. \nIts architecture has been developed as part of “The Machine” research programme, HPE’s proof-of-concept prototype, which the company claims is a major milestone in its efforts to transform the fundamental architecture on which all computers have been built for the past 60 years. \n“We have achieved a major milestone with The Machine research project, one of the largest and most complex research projects in our company’s history,” said Antonio Neri, executive vice-president of HPE’s enterprise group. \n“With this prototype, we have demonstrated the potential of memory-driven computing and also opened the door to immediate innovation. Our customers and the industry as a whole can expect to benefit from these advancements as we continue our pursuit of game-changing technologies.” Read more about next-generation hardware JP Morgan has gone live with a supercomputer for fixed income trading operations. The investment bank is using a Maxeler dataflow supercomputer to analyse and profile intra-day trading risk. The Blazegraph database runs on graphics processing units to speed graph traversals. Machine learning in the form of Google TensorFlow is also a GPU target. \nBresniker added: “Memory is distributed throughout the system.” \nThis memory is connected with photonics to reduce latency. The idea is that applications are engineered to run in-memory. The processing part can run on the CPU, a system on a chip, an application specific integrated circuit (Asic) or, in the future, field programmable gate arrays or a yet-to-be-invented quantum computer. \nHPE is collaborating with SanDisk, now owned by Western Digital , to provide low-cost, highly scalable resistive memory capable of offering the capacity of Flash storage, which runs at the speed of computer memory (dynamic RAM). \nThrough the collaboration, the pair hope to develop memory for the same price as storage, which effectively means applications could be engineered to use vast amounts of memory on tap. In doing so, the applications gain the performance boost available from direct memory access, rather than needing to rely on far slower block storage protocols, typically used on flash storage products such as solid-state discs. \nThe proof of concept blade server uses 1TByte of memory. HPE claims it can accelerate big data processing on Apache Spark 15-fold and will run large-scale graph queries 100 times faster. CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

      "text": "[ - ] Text [ + ] \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N: Quote ) could rise significantly if it completes its merger with General Electric Co's (GE.N: Quote ) oil and gas division, according to a report in Barron's. \nThe companies announced the deal last month, just as competition in the sector started to heat up after several years of low crude prices. The combined company would be the world's second-largest oilfield services provider. \nThe report said the new company would be well positioned even if oil prices do not rise significantly. It said that Evercore analyst James West believes the stock could be worth $69 a share, more than 10 percent above its closing price of $61.88 on Friday. \n(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Peter Cooney) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "title": "LifeAfter: Creators of GE’s New Audio Drama Podcast Talk Reviving a Dead Art | | Observer",
      "text": "By Joshua Dudley • 11/29/16 9:10am Artwork for the new fictional podcast, LifeAfter. Photo via GE Podcast Theater \n( elderly male voice) Have you listened to it yet? \n(female voice) Not Yet. We’re having a discussion about that. But if I offered you a chance to listen to it right now? \n(elderly male voice) Well we don’t really know what it is. Voices? Music? Breathing? But you know. I’m not going to mess with that thing. \n(female voice) To sum it up: Extraterrestrials. \n— Teaser for The Message \nPodcasting is associated with the commercial content that the hosts cheerfully pitch from Naturebox.com to Blue Apron almost as much as the podcast itself. In addition, they’re almost exclusively news, comedy or otherwise factual information based. That’s why it’s so unusual to listen to a podcast that’s set in an immersive fiction-based world with no commercial interruption. \nOn October 4, 2015, The Message arrived, heralded by an eerie teaser that made it seem like the audio equivalent of all those History channel investigations into aliens that you just know are going to be filled with goofy re-enactments and Fox Mulder–like declarations of those that “want to believe.” The show is about a young female narrator’s audio recordings of a group of elite cryptographers attempts to translate an alien broadcast from the 1940s that may or may not have killed nearly everyone that listened to it. \nThe commercially uninterrupted first-person narrative format, along with a fantastic story, produced a fly-on-the-wall effect and got listeners hooked. Garnering nearly 5 million downloads, The Message was a hit and an equal parts collaboration between GE, the Panoply Network of Podcasts and its partner agencies BBDO and Giant Spoon. \nGE was one of the early pioneers of radio content beginning in 1912 with experimental radio station 2XI . In the 1920s, GE was partnering with an early pre-NBC affiliate to make several hour long variety shows. Finally and most famously, CBS produced General Electric Theater in 1953 filled with popular stars of the time, like Cary Grant and Judy Garland. \nBut it wasn’t until 2014 that the massive popularity of Serial , the podcast that followed the twisting and turning story of a murder of a high school student over an entire season, led GE to the realization that “ podcasting could be entertainment .” \nThe ultimate goal of GE Podcast Theater may be to get you to buy more GE appliances and embrace science and technology as a way of life, but their branding is very subtle in this endeavor. In the entire eight-episode series run of The Message, you don’t hear any product names that aren’t relevant to the story, and there isn’t even a “brought to you by” voiceover like in serialized radio dramas from the 1930s to 1950s. \nThe three episodes so far of LifeAfter , GE’s latest scripted podcast, follow the same pattern: no breaks, pauses or trace of interruption. LifeAfter follows a low level FBI employee named Ross Barnes who, while at work, can’t stop listening to voice recordings of his deceased wife Charlie on an app called Voicetree. All of a sudden she starts talking to him through the app. How could this be possible? How can he keep talking to her and not get fired? \n\nIn an audio drama, the sound is the most important element. John Dryden, executive producer and series director of LifeAfter, discussed with me the process of creating a believable soundscape. \nObserver: How important was it to try and capture authentic sound effects and not produce them in the studio? \nJohn Dryden : Recording a drama outside of the studio is less about capturing “authentic” sounds—which can always be added later in post-production—and more about tapping into the physicality of everything we do in life. In a studio the microphones are in fixed positions and it becomes only about the words. Recording outside the studio allows us to block out scenes if it were real life and have the microphone constantly on the move following the action. Doing it in this way is really about getting more authentic and interesting performances from the actors. Audio dramas recorded in studio often have a strange stilted quality. We wanted ours to feel like it is firmly set in the real world, to have an almost documentary feel, especially as the science in the drama is really not so farfetched. \nWere there any particularly difficult challenges in getting a certain sound? \nIt’s always difficult making an audio drama on location because you give up much of the control you have when working in a studio. Sounds you don’t even notice in your everyday life suddenly become major issues as soon as you hit the record button. New York is a tricky city to record in in the summer months because there is the constant hum of air-conditioning units everywhere. It’s very difficult to escape from. On the whole though, recording on location gave us much more than we had to sacrifice. We could have characters, running up stairwells, through live office spaces, getting in and out of cars etc. which gives the drama very dynamic energy. \nBut there is also a lot of constructed sound design in LifeAfter and one of the biggest challenges was making the “angels”—humans who have effectively become living, moving extensions of the LifeAfter program—sound convincing. As the digital program connects with their nerves and muscles and voice-box, it’s like they are having to relearn how to speak. They need to glitch a lot and it was a challenge to find a way of doing this. In the end it was partly performance and partly post-production. Another big sound design challenge was creating the world of the hereafter—the sounds that followers of LifeAfter hear in their headphones as they prepare to be rejoined with their digital loved-ones in digital heaven. Sounds confusing? It will all become clear as the series progresses! \nIs there any chance the talented cast would perform live in the future ? \nA live show of LifeAfter would be truly awesome! \n\nI also spoke to Mac Rogers, a playwright and writer for both LifeAfter and The Message , about how he approaches making viable long-form storytelling without visuals . \nObserver: How do you maintain an ominous mood while still leaving the audience feeling hopeful and wanting to come back? \nMac Rogers : Well to some degree I think the ominous mood is part of what makes the audience want to come back: they want to figure out what’s happening, what all the seemingly unconnected early details portend—and they want to see if a character they like who is caught up in that ominous situation is going to be okay. But in terms of finding that balance between ominousness and hope, that all comes down to the audience experience of watching our main character fight back—and get better at fighting back. In LifeAfter , I wanted to create a sense that our protagonist Ross is in deep, way over his head, caught between forces much larger than himself, but that over the course of the story he gets braver about standing up to these forces and savvier about how to do so effectively. Watching Ross learn and improve will hopefully add an element of optimism to a suspenseful and frightening story. \nAre there any other shows (TV or podcast) that you like that are pushing boundaries of imagination? \nIn terms of podcasts, I’ve been blown away by Alice Isn’t Dead and its explorations into a sort of shadow-world along America’s long, lonely stretches of highway. On television (or streaming, I guess) I’ve really been quite taken by Sense8 ’s vision of global interconnectedness, of a sort of human internet that treats the sharing of information as an act of profound generosity. \nLong-form storytelling is the opposite of short viral videos where millions of people watch someone slam a basketball or fall over while squishing grapes. How do you keep the audience hooked and or entertained against that kind of competition? \nI think its two things. One, I think that podcasts—and audio drama in general—have a unique advantage in delivering stories to people simply because people don’t have to watch them to take in the storytelling. People can enjoy a podcast drama while washing dishes, commuting, running errands, folding clothes. They’re stories that fit comfortably into the busywork interstices of our lives. The second thing comes down to the number one rule of storytelling: You’ve got to make your audience be worried about your main character. You’ve got to have them wondering between episodes if their hero’s going to be okay. The way I’ve approached this with LifeAfter is to make it essentially an espionage thriller—but without a Bond or a Bourne at the center, with an ordinary person instead. We don’t have the comfort of knowing he has a Liam Neeson-esque “particular set of skills.” He’s way out of his depth, and might very well not make it alive to the end of part 10. If listeners like Ross and empathize with him to any degree, they’ll take a break from the viral videos and check in on him every Sunday. \nWhat inspires you? \nIn terms of storytelling, it’s the force that keeps the hero in the story. A friend once told me, “I tried to write a play, but I couldn’t finish it because I couldn’t figure out why the characters wouldn’t all just leave the stage.” This became a huge guideline for me in script-writing. Because a story is, after all, an unpleasant place to be. There’s all that conflict, all those stakes. In real life, we frequently try to opt out of excitement because excitement is stressful, maybe even dangerous. So what keeps the characters in a fictional story right in the middle of the conflict? It’s usually the discovery that they care about something more than their personal safety. And that this thing they care about has given them unexpected reservoirs of courage. LifeAfter is at its heart a deeply unconventional love story about a man who finds that getting a second chance to be with his wife—a chance to be a better husband than he was before, to care for her better than he did before—is more important to him than his safety. That’s what inspires me: characters who surprise themselves with their capacity for courage. \nThe Message and LifeAfter are a free download on iTunes . New episodes are posted on Sundays.

      "text": "Forget Baker Hughes, General Electric Company (GE) Stock’s Best Buy-Outs Were a LOT Smaller GE stock is quietly building out a monster IoT software suite By Aaron Levitt , InvestorPlace Contributor | Nov 29, 2016, 11:56 am EST View All Posts \nThe news dominating the General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) is undoubtedly its proposed tied-up with oil services firm Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI ). Certainly, that deal is transformative and deserve plenty of attention. In the end, that will make GE a very different company — or two after it splits. Source: Anthony Quintano via Flickr \nIt very much warrants coverage. \nBut while the investment world fawns over GE and BHI tying the knot, General Electric was busy making other deals — much smaller deals outside of the world of industrial manufacturing. \nGE is quickly becoming one of the strongest and biggest technology stocks out there. Dubbed the industrial internet or smart factories, the company is rapidly becoming one of the biggest players in the burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT) market. \nIn the end, the concept of smart factories, appliances and other industrial products is really what’s going to drive growth across throughout GE’s future. And that includes anything that happens with Baker Hughes. GE Creates the Factory of the Future \nThe last few years have been about transformation at GE. After shedding billions of dollars’ worth of GE Capital and other financial assets, General Electric has gone back to its roots as major industrial manufacturer. Except, there’s a hefty dose of code and programming going along with that focus on industrial manufacturing. The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World \nDuring this whole shuffling of businesses lines, asset sales and transformation, General Electric quietly launched GE Digital. Taking tools that it used during its own internal processes, General Electric created the blueprints for the smart factory of the future. Using its new Predix platform, GE stock now offers a whole suite of products built to combine machines and technology in one hand. \nInitially, the suite of products used complex sensor across various pieces of machinery — say a jet engine or conveyor belt — and then software to analyze the billions of bytes worth of data. Looking at all the data generated, it was done to help with maintenance time, operational efficiencies and other cost-saving strategies. \nBut GE hasn’t stopped there. It has a gone on an IoT buying spree designed to make Predix THE one-stop shop for the industrial internet. \nWhile the market was focused on the BHI merger, it quietly added ShipXpress and asset performance management software firm Meridium . It also purchased Arcam and Concept Laser . It took out Bit Stew — which handles efficient data integration. Wise.io and its machine leaning AI “natural selection” software is now part of the GE Digital family. Industrial cyber security firm Wurldtech was added. \nThe latest was a $915 million buyout of ServiceMax . The addition to GE Digital will allow field workers access to data, contracts and other information from anywhere on any device. It brings software as a service (SaaS) into the Predix cloud suite. \nNone of these acquisitions were big in terms of dollar amounts, but all allow GE to really utilize everything that Predix potentially could offer. Machines and factories, thinking and learning while running more efficiently.",

      "text": "Gambia: Presidential Election Must Be Free and Fair, Says Opposition Candidate The Northern States Governors' Forum and the General Electric (GE) International yesterday signed a memoranda of understanding (MoU) for the construction of five solar plants which would generate 500 megawatts of electricity in some parts of Northern Nigeria. Borno State Governor and Chairman of the Northern States Governors' Forum, Kashim Shettima, signed the agreement on behalf of the other governors while General Electric's Senior Executive, Western Europe and Africa, Mr. Armand Pineda, and the President/Chief Executive Officer, General Electric, Nigeria, Dr. Lazarus Angbazo, signed on behalf of their company at a brief ceremony held at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja. Based on the MoU, the General Electric which has 120 years experience in power generation, is to build five solar power plants to be located in Borno, Kebbi, Nassarawa, Niger and Taraba States which each of the plants expected to generate 100 megawatts of electricity totalling 500 megawatts across the five states. The electricity is meant to stimulate economic activities and social services in the affected states as well as boost agricultural food processing, small scale businesses, in addition to supplying electricity to schools and hospitals. The project which is a pilot phase, is being coordinated by the Northern Nigeria Global Economic Re-integration Programme, newly created by the northern governors to serve as vehicle for the economic recovery of northern states through international relations on infrastructure, manufacturing, stimulate agricultural value chain and trade as well as make the region a global player in agricultural export in line with the vision of late Premier of the region, Sir Ahmadu Bello. The governors' forum led by Shettima had engaged the services of Malam Tanimu Yakubu Kurfi as the Chief Executive Officer of the programme. Kurfi was Chief Economic Adviser to late President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, and has wide contact with leading development companies and financial institutions across the world. \"The 19 governors of the North jointly created this approach. We want to go beyond lamentation to provide solutions and we all know that power is key to industrial development. With power, we can create jobs, stimulate our economies and make life better for our people. The General Electric has over 120 years experience in energy solutions, and they have been operating in Nigeria for over 50 years. We cannot have a better partner than GE. We shall do our part as governors, this I will assure you. We are deeply committed to this agreement,\" Shettima said at the MoU signing ceremony. The northern governors' chairman enumerated the challenges of poverty, unemployment, poor access to education, poor healthcare among other underdevelopment indices threatening the North while concluding that power can provide a vehicle for the region to reposition itself for a better future. The CEO, Northern Nigeria Global Economic Re-Integration Programme, Kurfi, said he took up the challenge put forward by the northern governors as a result of strong passion and commitment to aggressive development of the North as so far shown by the northern governors since Shettima became the forum's chairman in 2015. Reaffirming their commitment to the MoU, General Electric's Senior Executive, Western Europe and Africa, Pineda, and the President/Chief Executive Officer, General Electric, Nigeria, Angbazo, both pledged that they would work round the clock to realise the project for the benefits of citizens of the five states.

      "text": "GE Capital will close Billings location Posted: BILLINGS - \nGE says it plans to be entirely out of Billings by the end of 2017. Company officials said they expect about 60 layoffs between now and then, with the remaining employees transferring either to Wells Fargo or the Bank of Montreal. Those banks moved in after GE decided to sell most of GE Capital in April 2015 to focus on transforming into a digital industrial company. Billings employees were notified of GE's specific timetable this afternoon. When GE Capital first opened its Billings Operations Center in the Trans Tech Center in September of 2010, Montana Senator Max Baucus was on hand for the official ribbon cutting along with GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt..The new facility brought in 150 new jobs with an estimated $95 million dollar economic impact for Billings. At its peak the facility had as many as 200 workers.The Big Sky Economic Development Authority built the 40-thousand square foot building in the Trans Tech Center - then leased the facility back to GE.The company announced today it will continue its lease payments to 2021 - giving local officials valuable time to find a new tenant.

      "text": "FMT Reporters | November 30, 2016 Umno Youth leader calls on members to prepare for the GE and praises the PM as he moots a paradigm shift in the Malay indentity. \nKUALA LUMPUR: Sounding the general election war drum, Umno Youth leader Khairy Jamaluddin today flayed his former president by using Mahathir Mohamad’s own favourite phrase against him. \nThe former Umno president is known to have used the phrase “Melayu muda lupa” (the Malays forget easily) to bring their attention back to Umno’s sacrifices and struggles. \nToday, in a deft move, Khairy used that same phrase to remind Umno members of what Mahathir had said and done in the past and what he was saying and doing today. \nAfter each example, he repeated: “Melayu muda lupa. Melayu muda lupa.” \nHe even provided evidence in the form of videos displayed on the screens at the Umno Youth delegates conference in the Putra World Trade Centre. \nBut even as he slammed Mahathir, he praised Umno president Najib Razak. He thanked the prime minister no less than 11 times. \nTalking about the Bersih 5 rally, Khairy said the motive was power and there was no greater proof than the fact that the disparate group accepted the very person who had opposed them and banned street demonstrations while in office. \n“This individual was a lightning rod of criticism for the yellow group, the one called Mahazalim, Mahafiraun but now is welcomed with open arms. \n“For Mahathir, the street demonstration that he once crushed with FRU, ISA and with an iron fist, is today supported and upheld as the people’s voice.” \nHe told Umno members to never forget that the “noble” struggle of these groups was deceitful and sheer hypocrisy in their quest for power, to build their own legacy and empire. \nHe then went on to relate instances of this hypocrisy on the part of Mahathir. \nWith the videos to back him, he said, Mahathir had at one time dismissed the Bersih organisers but today he implored people to join the rallies. \nIn the past, Mahathir attacked billionaire George Soros but now he joined a rally funded, Khairy claimed, by Soros. \n“Then, he accuses Anwar of various allegations Now, they shake hands and exchange pleasantries, whether sincere or not. \n“Then, he mocks Mat Sabu. Now, they laugh together. \n“Then, he was his “people’s” fighter. Now, he is together with the enemy. \n“Then, he questions the legitimacy of Keadilan. Now, he sits in comfort with its leadership, calling to Free Anwar. \nThen, Pakatan’s legitimacy was questioned. Now, they are together, chasing power.” \nHe then recited a poem for Mahathir, saying those in the hall would not easily forget his sacrifices and remembered defending him against criticism but today they also remember his hypocrisy, dictatorship, weaknesses, and betrayal of Umno’s struggle. \nWhile he attacked “the rag tag bunch who were at the (Bersih) rally”, he praised Umno Youth members who had protested against the Bersih rally, the Selangor government and the Penang government. \nKhairy told the delegates they were entering war mode and it was time to “ring the alarm bells, beat the war drums and fire the starting gun to signal to our machinery and all members of the party to get ready to fight, to face our opponents and to ensure Barisan Nasional’s victory in the upcoming election for our community’s future”. \nHe went on to outline the achievements of Umno Youth, specifically naming 11 areas where their suggestions or actions had been accepted and implemented. And after each example, he said: “Thank you Prime Minister.” \nHe added: “We are grateful to our Prime Minister, Najib Razak, for not only being open and receptive to young people’s views, but also supportive of many of our ideas that ultimately became government policies and programmes. \n“This is why Umno Youth continues to support him to remain at the helm of the party and the government – because he is a leader who always listens to voices of the youths, and more importantly, a leader who has delivered much of the youths’ aspirations.” \nKhairy called for a “paradigm shift in the Malay identity in line with the zeitgeist of the times” to ensure progress for the community. \nHe said for decades, Umno’s political identity had been dominated by two matters: to defend the special rights of Malay-Islam; and the need to improve the lagging economic status of Malays. \n“The only question now is this – are these the only meaning of the Malay struggle? \n“Why are we so defensive? Does the Malay polemic need to be viewed as weak and maligned, as needing constant help for us to stand up? \n“I do not think so. Our mindset is already ready to be shaped so that we do not become people who are merely reactive and defensive. People who will only constantly make demands, people who are anti-intellectual, people who are anti-competition, and people looking for crutches. \n“The time has come for us to be a race that can change the tone and set the agenda.”",

      "text": "It's no secret that General Electric Company ( NYSE:GE ) intends to take a leadership position within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT), but what's less discussed is how integral it all is to the company's acquisition strategy. In a nutshell, the Baker Hughes Incorporated ( NYSE:BHI ) and Alstom energy assets deals were much more than mere industry consolidations. They actually represent a strategic deployment with IIOT at its heart. Here's how and why.\nGeneral Electric needs self-help Whichever way you look at it, we are in a moderate growth environment. Forecasts for U.S. GDP growth of 1.6% in 2016 and 2.2% in 2017 are hardly inspiring, and it's not enough for companies like General Electric -- whose size and diversification make it hard to truly escape broad-based economic conditions -- to rely on end-market growth. Indeed, CEO Jeff Immelt cut the company's organic revenue growth forecast to just 0%-2% for 2016.\nThe chart below shows that it's really nothing new. In fact, GDP growth has been variable, but moderate, ever since the last recession. What's a mega-cap company supposed to do when top-line growth prospects look limited?\nUS Real GDP Growth data by YCharts .\nThe industrial internet Having decided to pivot back toward its industrial roots by selling its GE Capital assets, the next option ahead of GE was to try to \"pick winners\" -- to invest in certain sectors of the economy that might win out over others. Unfortunately, the raft of oil and gas businesses GE bought between 2010 and 2014 -- which would surely be cheaper had the company bought them this year -- is a testimony to how difficult picking winners is.\nNo matter, Immelt has other ideas. General Electric is generating its own growth drivers, and the industrial internet is at the heart of it. For example, at GE's recent Minds + Machines event, Immelt outlined expectations for $15 billion worth of digital orders by 2020 alongside $1 billion of additive manufacturing orders. (The latter is a manufacturing technology utilizing 3D modeling and printing.) For reference, the company's revenue over the last four quarters is around $124 billion.\nHowever, the company's acquisition strategy is also a key part of its IIOT plans.\nAlstom General Electric is hoping to profit from IIOT in general , but IIOT is also very important to the rationale behind the Alstom and Baker Hughes deals.\nThe Alstom deal is certainly about industry consolidation, and creating cost synergies as a consequence. And it's about adding Alstom's steam power solutions to GE's gas power offerings in order to create a powerful combined-cycle solution. However, it's also about digitizing Alstom's existing installed base with GE's IIOT solutions. In a sense, GE is buying the opportunity to expand its IIOT business.\nGeneral Electric's digital solutions help customers optimize assets. Image source: General Electric Company.\nMoreover, the benefits are tangible. For example, at the Minds + Machines event, GE Power CEO Steve Bolze outlined how the 25 power plant customers he'd signed up from last year had generated 3% more plant efficiency, 5% more reliability, and a 25% reduction in operation and maintenance costs.\nBaker Hughes There are also significant cost synergies to be generated from the Baker Hughes deal: $1.4 billion by 2020. In addition, revenue synergies ($400 million by 2020) are expected through the integration of GE's oil and gas technology with Baker Hughes' service technology solutions: The plan is to create a fully integrated offering.\nTurning to the point of our inquiry, integrating GE's digital solutions into Baker Hughes's solutions is also a major rationale for the deal. As Immelt said in the initial press release:\n[T]his transaction accelerates our capability to extend the digital framework to the oil and gas industry. An oilfield service platform is essential to deliver digitally enabled offerings to our customers. We expect Predix to become an industry standard and synonymous with improved customer outcomes.\nCreating a digital twin helps optimize asset performance management. Image source: General Electric Company.\nWhat it means to investors Ultimately, the Alstom and Baker Hughes deals amount to more than just investments in complementary businesses in order to generate cost synergies. While those aims are worthy in themselves, the deals also represent a key part of GE's expansion of its digital capability.\nIn a low-growth world, Immelt is finding a way to increase the company's long-term earnings potential while claiming first-mover advantage in the IIOT space. It's a strategic development that investors should welcome.",

Part 23: Ref.[1] Abstract \nGroup 14 elements (Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb) were applied as spacers to construct new dinuclear organometallic [5]trovacenyl derivatives [(η 7 -C 7 H 7 )V(η 5 -C 5 H 4 )] 2 MR 2 ( 2 ·· , 3 ·· , 4 ·· , and 5 ·· ; M = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; R = Me or Ph), which have been characterized by mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and/or X-ray diffraction analysis. A systematic electrochemical study by cyclic voltammetry indicates weak intramolecular electronic communication between two vanadium centers in the order of Si ( 2 ·· ) < Ge ( 3 ·· ) < Sn ( 4 ·· ) < Pb ( 5 ·· ). The impact of the substituents and the solvents on the electrochemical behavior of [(η 7 -C 7 H 7 )V(η 5 -C 5 H 4 )] 2 SnMe 2 ( 5 ·· ) and [(η 7 -C 7 H 7 )V(η 5 -C 5 H 4 )] 2 SnPh 2 ( 9 ·· ) was evaluated.",

      "text": "SHARES Reuters Cuban citizen Armando (L) and U.S tourist Lisa Fragoso wave U.S flag while passing the U.S. Interests Section, in Havana July 20, 2015. \nA new batch of companies may soon be able to operate in Cuba if the Obama administration can persuade Havana to finalize agreements , The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions. \nIf the White House succeeds, Google , General Electric , Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings , Royal Caribbean and Pearl Seas Cruises could all announce the deals in the upcoming weeks, the newspaper said. \nThe Journal said the deals aim to more firmly secure President Barack Obama 's endeavors to thaw U.S.-Cuba relations. Obama was the first American president to visit the isolated island nation in nearly 90 years and has pushed for normalizing relations with Cuba. \nThe president forged the effort by exercising his executive power, something President-elect Donald Trump could undo once he takes office. On Monday, Trump threatened to \"terminate\" the Cuba agreement if the country is \"unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people.\" \nLongtime Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who preserved communism on the island for decades, died last week. His brother Raul became president in 2008.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON — General Electric GE, -0.93% and Google GOOGL, -1.72% are among firms U.S. officials believe will secure agreements to operate in Cuba as the Obama administration presses Havana to complete pending deals before Donald Trump takes office, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nIn addition, three American cruise lines are expected to announce deals to start service to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Royal Caribbean and Pearl Seas Cruises.\n'Neruda' star Gael García Bernal on Trump, Mexico (1:41) Mexican movie star Gael García Bernal stops by the WSJ Cafe to talk about his new movie \"Neruda\" and what it was like to discuss Donald Trump with his children after election night. Photo: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\nThe new business agreements are expected to be announced over the next few weeks, those familiar with the discussions said. For the White House, which ramped up an effort before the election to prod Havana, the deals are aimed at cementing President Barack Obama’s policy of advancing U.S.-Cuba relations.\nWhite House officials are unsure how Trump, the president-elect, will approach Obama’s Cuba policy. He has said he would reverse the effort to build relations, and this week wrote on Twitter that “if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate the deal.”\nWhile there is no formal deal between the U.S. and Cuba that can be undone, there has been a broad effort to expand economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries since Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced in December 2014 that they would re-establish diplomatic relations.\nAsked about the possible agreement, a GE spokesman said: “We continue to talk to Cuba and we’re in the middle of negotiations.”\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nTop stories from WSJ.com U.S. to forgive at least $108 billion in student debt in coming year Donald Trump’s vow to exit his businesses draws questions",

      "text": "GE Poised on Strategic Organic Growth with Healthcare Focus by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 30, 2016 Trades from $ 3 General Electric Company ( GE - Free Report ) marginally outperformed the Zacks categorized Diversified Operations industry with an average return of 6.7% compared with 5.9% for the latter, over a period of 30 days. In addition, over the same time frame, earnings estimates for the current year have been in line. This estimate trend was been impacted by the company’s organic growth, which look promising. GENL ELECTRIC Price GENL ELECTRIC Price | GENL ELECTRIC Quote The growing helium crisis, which is a primary component in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, has been adversely impacting hospitals and patients worldwide. Despite the shortage, the demand for the gas remains unchanged. Addressing this growing crisis, GE Healthcare unveiled Freelium at Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 2016. This system uses highly advanced magnet technology, which has been designed to use minimal helium in comparison to the conventional MRI magnets. Freelium is designed to use about 20 liters of the gas in comparison with the conventional 2,000 liters usage, and is eco friendly. RSNA is an international society of radiologists, medical physicists and other medical professionals. The society consists of over 54,000 members, across 136 countries worldwide. RSNA hosts the world’s premier radiology forum, bringing together around 55,000 attendees annually at McCormick Place in Chicago. The Freelium technology will be incorporated into commercialized products in the future. This will make MRI more accessible and less costly to site and operate. Such advancement will be useful in developing regions that lack the necessary infrastructure. GE Healthcare is looking forward to improving the healthcare industry with its new innovative products and partnerships, designed to address major challenges faced by the industry. This will provide enhanced patient experience, better clinical confidence and improve productivity. The launch of such innovative products and services will help the company set itself apart from its peers in the healthcare industry. In turn, such innovations will augment its top line, going forward. We continue to be bullish on the strategic expansions in the healthcare ecosystem of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in this industry include Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. ( MIC - Free Report ) , AO Smith Corp. ( AOS - Free Report ) and Danaher Corp. ( DHR - Free Report ) .

      "title": "White House Pushing Cuba on Deals for GE, Google -- Update",
      "text": "By Carol E. Lee and Felicia Schwartz\nWASHINGTON -- General Electric and Google are among firms U.S. officials believe will secure agreements to operate in Cuba as the Obama administration presses Havana to complete pending deals before Donald Trump takes office, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nIn addition, three American cruise lines are expected to announce deals to start service to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Royal Caribbean and Pearl Seas Cruises.\nThe new business agreements are expected to be announced over the next few weeks, those familiar with the discussions said. For the White House, which ramped up an effort before the election to prod Havana, the deals are aimed at cementing President Barack Obama's policy of advancing U.S.-Cuba relations.\nWhite House officials are unsure how Mr. Trump, the president-elect, will approach Mr. Obama's Cuba policy. He has said he would reverse the effort to build relations, and this week wrote on Twitter that \"if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate the deal.\"\nWhile there is no formal deal between the U.S. and Cuba that can be undone, there has been a broad effort to expand economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries since Mr. Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced in December 2014 that they would re-establish diplomatic relations.\nAsked about the possible agreement, a GE spokesman said: \"We continue to talk to Cuba and we're in the middle of negotiations.\"\nA Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman, Vanessa Picariello, said the firm is \"in continued talks with appropriate authorities in Cuba on behalf of all three of its brands: Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.\"\nShe added: \"We remain optimistic that we will receive approval for one or more of our brands and be able to offer our guests Caribbean cruises including Cuba in the near future.\"\nCharles B. Robertson, Pearl Seas Cruises' director of marketing, said: \"We are very excited and optimistic about the prospect of going to Cuba and we have a number of trips planned in 2017 that we hope to be able to run.\"\nOfficials from Google and Royal Caribbean didn't respond to requests for comment.\nA number of companies have been granted licenses by the Obama administration to do business in Cuba, but are awaiting approval by Havana. The move at the White House to accelerate the process for U.S. companies holding U.S. licenses became a renewed focus late this summer.\nOfficials reviewed deals pending before the Cuban government and brought in a U.S. government official, Angela Mariana Freyre, formerly senior vice president and general counsel of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, to focus solely on this issue.\nMs. Freyre was dispatched to Havana shortly after the presidential election to meet with officials about the White House's desire for deals awaiting Cuban government action to move forward.\nGoogle and General Electric made limited forays into Cuba this year. Google in March opened a technology center in the Havana studio of one of Cuba's most famous artists. Cubans at the site can access the internet at speeds 70 times faster than those available to the Cuban public. Google has been trying to offer other services to try to improve internet access on the island.\nGE in March signaled its intent to provide power, aviation and medical equipment to the Cuban government by signing a series of memorandums of understanding with the Cuban government.\nAnother American firm, Caterpillar, signed a distribution deal in February with Puerto Rican-based Rimco to begin selling its products in Cuba, once trade restrictions are eased.\nThe move to normalize relations has prompted a flurry of deals. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., now owned by Marriott International Inc., signed a deal to run three hotels in Cuba earlier this year. The properties are still government owned but will be run by Starwood. The company began operating a Four Points Sheraton in Havana in June, with the others to follow.\nMeanwhile, American carriers Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. have all reached deals to offer service in Cuba.\nU.S. airlines resumed commercial flights to Cuba earlier this year. This week, eight airlines, including American Airlines Inc. and JetBlue Airways, began commercial service to Havana. By the end of 2016, U.S. airlines are expected to conduct more than 500 round-trip flights to Cuba, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nBen Rhodes, Mr. Obama's adviser who led the effort to re-establish relations with Cuba, traveled to Havana this week. Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, also was supposed to travel to Havana this week but canceled the trip following the death of Fidel Castro on Friday.\nWrite to Carol E.

      "text": "FAIRFIELD, Conn. (CBSNewYork) — A suburban town is preparing for life after one of its biggest taxpayers picks up and leaves.\nAs CBS2’s Lou Young reported, it was a grey day in Fairfield after the departure of General Electric.\n“We need it here. They pay a lot of taxes,” Janis Torres said.\nThe now shuttered headquarters of the multi-national conglomerate already bears the name of non-profit Sacred Heart University as GE shifts jobs to Boston and other parts of Connecticut, and cashes a $31.5-million check for property that is now off the tax rolls.\nThe first selectman — Connecticut’s version of a mayor — is annoyed.\n“We met with GE; they were very private. It’s their sale, the town was not involved, however we did ask them please keep the property on the tax roles when they sell it. GE didn’t do that. They chose to make a deal in the best interests of GE, not the best interests of the town,” Michael Tetreas said.\nFairfield’s annual town budget is $290-million. GE paid $1.5-million, not a disaster, but an inconvenience.\nSacred Heart University, which is already in Fairfield and expanding into GE’s space said the long-term benefits will outweigh the short-term pain.\n“Our people, whether students or employees spend money in Fairfield. GE employees were going there, working there, eating there, and mostly getting on the parkway to get home,” Sacred Heart University, President John Petillo said.\nTown and company have had a kind of marriage for the last 42 years. You can even find a GE logo on the fancy electric car charging station in the center of town, but like any relationship that’s based partially on money, when there’s a breakup, there’s hard feelings.\n“When you take a million dollars in taxes away from me, I still have to make payroll. That’s a real challenge for the town and the taxpayers,” Tetreas said.\nFairfield can get some of the lost revenue from the state. It’s preparing to cut some town jobs and may have to raise taxes.\nPlanners say in the long run the attractive power of a growing Sacred Heart University and nearby Fairfield University will help the town more.\n“Knowledge based economy, and I think having two universities locally will work in terms of making that new economy,” Fairfield Economic Development Director, Mark Barnhart said.\nIt’s a possible silver lining in the shape of things to come.\nThe university said it plans to open up 400 additional undergraduate slots and hire 60 staff when it expands onto the new campus.\n",

      "text": "White House Pushing Cuba on Deals for GE, Google -- Update November 30, 2016, 07:01:  By Carol E. Lee and Felicia Schwartz \nWASHINGTON -- General Electric Co. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit are among firms U.S. officials believe will secure agreements to operate in Cuba as the Obama administration presses Havana to complete pending deals before Donald Trump takes office, according to people familiar with the discussions. \nIn addition, three American cruise lines are expected to announce deals to start service to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Pearl Seas Cruises. \nFor the White House, which ramped up an effort before the election to prod Havana, the deals are aimed at cementing President Barack Obama's policy of advancing U.S.-Cuba relations. \nWhite House officials are unsure how Mr. Trump, the president-elect, will approach Mr. Obama's Cuba policy. He has said he would reverse the effort to build relations, and this week wrote on Twitter that \"if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate the deal.\" \nWhile there is no formal deal between the U.S. and Cuba that can be undone, there has been a broad effort to expand economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries since Mr. Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced in December 2014 that they would re-establish diplomatic relations. \nAsked about the possible agreement, a GE spokesman said: \"We continue to talk to Cuba and we're in the middle of negotiations.\" \nA Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman, Vanessa Picariello, said the firm is \"in continued talks with appropriate authorities in Cuba on behalf of all three of its brands: Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.\" \nShe added: \"We remain optimistic that we will receive approval for one or more of our brands and be able to offer our guests Caribbean cruises including Cuba in the near future.\" \nCynthia Martinez, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean., said, \"We've expressed our belief that the market holds promise for the cruise industry, and remain interested in exploring its potential.\" \nCharles B. Robertson, Pearl Seas Cruises' director of marketing, said: \"We are very excited and optimistic about the prospect of going to Cuba and we have a number of trips planned in 2017 that we hope to be able to run.\" \nOfficials from Google didn't respond to requests for comment. \nA number of companies have been granted licenses by the Obama administration to do business in Cuba, but are awaiting approval by Havana. The move at the White House to accelerate the process for U.S. companies holding U.S. licenses became a renewed focus late this summer. \nOfficials reviewed deals pending before the Cuban government and brought in a U.S. government official, Angela Mariana Freyre, formerly senior vice president and general counsel of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, to focus solely on this issue. \nMs. Freyre was dispatched to Havana shortly after the presidential election to meet with officials about the White House's desire for deals awaiting Cuban government action to move forward. \nGoogle and General Electric made limited forays into Cuba this year. Google in March opened a technology center in the Havana studio of one of Cuba's most famous artists. Cubans at the site can access the internet at speeds 70 times faster than those available to the Cuban public. Google has been trying to offer other services to try to improve internet access on the island. \nGE in March signaled its intent to provide power, aviation and medical equipment to the Cuban government by signing a series of memorandums of understanding with the Cuban government. \nAnother American firm, Caterpillar, signed a distribution deal in February with Puerto Rican-based Rimco to begin selling its products in Cuba, once trade restrictions are eased. \nThe move to normalize relations has prompted a flurry of deals. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., now owned by Marriott International Inc., signed a deal to run three hotels in Cuba earlier this year. The properties are still government owned but will be run by Starwood. The company began operating a Four Points Sheraton in Havana in June, with the others to follow. \nMeanwhile, American carriers Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. have all reached deals to offer service in Cuba. \nU.S. airlines resumed commercial flights to Cuba earlier this year. This week, eight airlines, including American Airlines Inc. and JetBlue Airways, began commercial service to Havana. By the end of 2016, U.S. airlines are expected to conduct more than 500 round-trip flights to Cuba, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. \nBen Rhodes, Mr. Obama's adviser who led the effort to re-establish relations with Cuba, traveled to Havana this week. Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, also was supposed to travel to Havana this week but canceled the trip following the death of Fidel Castro on Friday. \nWrite to Carol E.

      "text": "By Carol E. Lee and Felicia Schwartz\nWASHINGTON -- General Electric Co. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit are among firms U.S. officials believe will secure agreements to operate in Cuba as the Obama administration presses Havana to complete pending deals before Donald Trump takes office, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nIn addition, three American cruise lines are expected to announce deals to start service to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Pearl Seas Cruises.\nThe new business agreements are expected to be announced over the next few weeks, those familiar with the discussions said.\nFor the White House, which ramped up an effort before the election to prod Havana, the deals are aimed at cementing President Barack Obama's policy of advancing U.S.-Cuba relations.\nWhite House officials are unsure how Mr. Trump, the president-elect, will approach Mr. Obama's Cuba policy. He has said he would reverse the effort to build relations, and this week wrote on Twitter that \"if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate the deal.\"\nWhile there is no formal deal between the U.S. and Cuba that can be undone, there has been a broad effort to expand economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries since Mr. Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced in December 2014 that they would re-establish diplomatic relations.\nAsked about the possible agreement, a GE spokesman said: \"We continue to talk to Cuba and we're in the middle of negotiations.\"\nA Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman, Vanessa Picariello, said the firm is \"in continued talks with appropriate authorities in Cuba on behalf of all three of its brands: Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.\"\nShe added: \"We remain optimistic that we will receive approval for one or more of our brands and be able to offer our guests Caribbean cruises including Cuba in the near future.\"\nCynthia Martinez, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean., said, \"We've expressed our belief that the market holds promise for the cruise industry, and remain interested in exploring its potential.\"\nCharles B. Robertson, Pearl Seas Cruises' director of marketing, said: \"We are very excited and optimistic about the prospect of going to Cuba and we have a number of trips planned in 2017 that we hope to be able to run.\"\nOfficials from Google didn't respond to requests for comment.\nA number of companies have been granted licenses by the Obama administration to do business in Cuba, but are awaiting approval by Havana. The move at the White House to accelerate the process for U.S. companies holding U.S. licenses became a renewed focus late this summer.\nOfficials reviewed deals pending before the Cuban government and brought in a U.S. government official, Angela Mariana Freyre, formerly senior vice president and general counsel of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, to focus solely on this issue.\nMs. Freyre was dispatched to Havana shortly after the presidential election to meet with officials about the White House's desire for deals awaiting Cuban government action to move forward.\nGoogle and General Electric made limited forays into Cuba this year. Google in March opened a technology center in the Havana studio of one of Cuba's most famous artists. Cubans at the site can access the internet at speeds 70 times faster than those available to the Cuban public. Google has been trying to offer other services to try to improve internet access on the island.\nGE in March signaled its intent to provide power, aviation and medical equipment to the Cuban government by signing a series of memorandums of understanding with the Cuban government.\nAnother American firm, Caterpillar, signed a distribution deal in February with Puerto Rican-based Rimco to begin selling its products in Cuba, once trade restrictions are eased.\nThe move to normalize relations has prompted a flurry of deals. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., now owned by Marriott International Inc., signed a deal to run three hotels in Cuba earlier this year. The properties are still government owned but will be run by Starwood. The company began operating a Four Points Sheraton in Havana in June, with the others to follow.\nMeanwhile, American carriers Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. have all reached deals to offer service in Cuba.\nU.S. airlines resumed commercial flights to Cuba earlier this year. This week, eight airlines, including American Airlines Inc. and JetBlue Airways, began commercial service to Havana. By the end of 2016, U.S. airlines are expected to conduct more than 500 round-trip flights to Cuba, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nBen Rhodes, Mr. Obama's adviser who led the effort to re-establish relations with Cuba, traveled to Havana this week. Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, also was supposed to travel to Havana this week but canceled the trip following the death of Fidel Castro on Friday.\nWrite to Carol E.

By the end of 2016, U.S. airlines are expected to conduct more than 500 round-trip flights to Cuba, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nBen Rhodes, Mr. Obama's adviser who led the effort to re-establish relations with Cuba, traveled to Havana this week. Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, also was supposed to travel to Havana this week but canceled the trip following the death of Fidel Castro on Friday.\nWrite to Carol E.

      "text": "White House Pushing Cuba on Deals for GE, Google November 30, 2016, 08:55:  \nWASHINGTON—General Electric Co. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit are among firms U.S. officials believe will secure agreements to operate in Cuba as the Obama administration presses Havana to complete pending deals before Donald Trump takes office, according to people familiar with the discussions. \nIn addition, three American cruise lines are expected to announce deals to start service to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Pearl Seas Cruises. \nThe new business agreements are expected to be announced over the next few weeks, those familiar with the discussions said. \nWhite House officials are unsure how Mr. Trump, the president-elect, will approach Mr. Obama's Cuba policy. He has said he would reverse the effort to build relations, and this week wrote on Twitter that \"if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate the deal.\" \nWhile there is no formal deal between the U.S. and Cuba that can be undone, there has been a broad effort to expand economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries since Mr. Obama and Cuban President Raú l Castro announced in December 2014 that they would re-establish diplomatic relations. \nAsked about the possible agreement, a GE spokesman said: \"We continue to talk to Cuba and we're in the middle of negotiations.\" \nA Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman, Vanessa Picariello, said the firm is \"in continued talks with appropriate authorities in Cuba on behalf of all three of its brands: Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.\" \nShe added: \"We remain optimistic that we will receive approval for one or more of our brands and be able to offer our guests Caribbean cruises including Cuba in the near future.\" \nCynthia Martinez, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean., said, \"We've expressed our belief that the market holds promise for the cruise industry, and remain interested in exploring its potential.\" \nCharles B. Robertson, Pearl Seas Cruises' director of marketing, said: \"We are very excited and optimistic about the prospect of going to Cuba and we have a number of trips planned in 2017 that we hope to be able to run.\" \nOfficials from Google didn't respond to requests for comment. \nA number of companies have been granted licenses by the Obama administration to do business in Cuba, but are awaiting approval by Havana. The move at the White House to accelerate the process for U.S. companies holding U.S. licenses became a renewed focus late this summer. \nOfficials reviewed deals pending before the Cuban government and brought in a U.S. government official, Angela Mariana Freyre, formerly senior vice president and general counsel of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, to focus solely on this issue. \nMs. Freyre was dispatched to Havana shortly after the presidential election to meet with officials about the White House's desire for deals awaiting Cuban government action to move forward. \nGoogle and General Electric made limited forays into Cuba this year. Google in March opened a technology center in the Havana studio of one of Cuba's most famous artists. Cubans at the site can access the internet at speeds 70 times faster than those available to the Cuban public. Google has been trying to offer other services to try to improve internet access on the island. \nGE in March signaled its intent to provide power, aviation and medical equipment to the Cuban government by signing a series of memorandums of understanding with the Cuban government. \nAnother American firm, Caterpillar, signed a distribution deal in February with Puerto Rican-based Rimco to begin selling its products in Cuba, once trade restrictions are eased. \nThe move to normalize relations has prompted a flurry of deals. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., now owned by Marriott International Inc., signed a deal to run three hotels in Cuba earlier this year. The properties are still government owned but will be run by Starwood. The company began operating a Four Points Sheraton in Havana in June, with the others to follow. \nMeanwhile, American carriers Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. have all reached deals to offer service in Cuba. \nU.S. airlines resumed commercial flights to Cuba earlier this year. This week, eight airlines, including American Airlines Inc. and JetBlue Airways, began commercial service to Havana. By the end of 2016, U.S. airlines are expected to conduct more than 500 round-trip flights to Cuba, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. \nBen Rhodes, Mr. Obama's adviser who led the effort to re-establish relations with Cuba, traveled to Havana this week. Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, also was supposed to travel to Havana this week but canceled the trip following the death of Fidel Castro on Friday. \nWrite to Carol E.

      "text": "By Carol E. Lee and Felicia Schwartz\nWASHINGTON -- General Electric Co. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit are among firms U.S. officials believe will secure agreements to operate in Cuba as the Obama administration presses Havana to complete pending deals before Donald Trump takes office, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nIn addition, three American cruise lines are expected to announce deals to start service to Cuba, including Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Pearl Seas Cruises.\nThe new business agreements are expected to be announced over the next few weeks, those familiar with the discussions said.\nFor the White House, which ramped up an effort before the election to prod Havana, the deals are aimed at cementing President Barack Obama's policy of advancing U.S.-Cuba relations.\nWhite House officials are unsure how Mr. Trump, the president-elect, will approach Mr. Obama's Cuba policy. He has said he would reverse the effort to build relations, and this week wrote on Twitter that \"if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate the deal.\"\nWhile there is no formal deal between the U.S. and Cuba that can be undone, there has been a broad effort to expand economic, trade and cultural ties between the two countries since Mr. Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced in December 2014 that they would re-establish diplomatic relations.\nAsked about the possible agreement, a GE spokesman said: \"We continue to talk to Cuba and we're in the middle of negotiations.\"\nA Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman, Vanessa Picariello, said the firm is \"in continued talks with appropriate authorities in Cuba on behalf of all three of its brands: Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.\"\nShe added: \"We remain optimistic that we will receive approval for one or more of our brands and be able to offer our guests Caribbean cruises including Cuba in the near future.\"\nCynthia Martinez, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean., said, \"We've expressed our belief that the market holds promise for the cruise industry, and remain interested in exploring its potential.\"\nCharles B. Robertson, Pearl Seas Cruises' director of marketing, said: \"We are very excited and optimistic about the prospect of going to Cuba and we have a number of trips planned in 2017 that we hope to be able to run.\"\nOfficials from Google didn't respond to requests for comment.\nA number of companies have been granted licenses by the Obama administration to do business in Cuba, but are awaiting approval by Havana. The move at the White House to accelerate the process for U.S. companies holding U.S. licenses became a renewed focus late this summer.\nOfficials reviewed deals pending before the Cuban government and brought in a U.S. government official, Angela Mariana Freyre, formerly senior vice president and general counsel of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, to focus solely on this issue.\nMs. Freyre was dispatched to Havana shortly after the presidential election to meet with officials about the White House's desire for deals awaiting Cuban government action to move forward.\nGoogle and General Electric made limited forays into Cuba this year. Google in March opened a technology center in the Havana studio of one of Cuba's most famous artists. Cubans at the site can access the internet at speeds 70 times faster than those available to the Cuban public. Google has been trying to offer other services to try to improve internet access on the island.\nGE in March signaled its intent to provide power, aviation and medical equipment to the Cuban government by signing a series of memorandums of understanding with the Cuban government.\nAnother American firm, Caterpillar, signed a distribution deal in February with Puerto Rican-based Rimco to begin selling its products in Cuba, once trade restrictions are eased.\nThe move to normalize relations has prompted a flurry of deals. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., now owned by Marriott International Inc., signed a deal to run three hotels in Cuba earlier this year. The properties are still government owned but will be run by Starwood. The company began operating a Four Points Sheraton in Havana in June, with the others to follow.\nMeanwhile, American carriers Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp. and T-Mobile US Inc. have all reached deals to offer service in Cuba.\nU.S. airlines resumed commercial flights to Cuba earlier this year. This week, eight airlines, including American Airlines Inc. and JetBlue Airways, began commercial service to Havana. By the end of 2016, U.S. airlines are expected to conduct more than 500 round-trip flights to Cuba, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nBen Rhodes, Mr. Obama's adviser who led the effort to re-establish relations with Cuba, traveled to Havana this week. Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, also was supposed to travel to Havana this week but canceled the trip following the death of Fidel Castro on Friday.\nWrite to Carol E.

We will bring the best and brightest into our new facility to help us in our journey, said Jim Fowler, GE’s Chief Information Officer, on the occasion.\nFor the US-based behemoth, Bengaluru is one of the six key locations the world over, as the tech city is in line with its business strategy. “As talent is our priority in advancing outcomes, we are keen to harness more of it, specialised in data sciences, analytics product development space,” noted Fowler. Admitting that GE was looking to hire talent to fit into its lean and agile culture, GE’s Group CIO Anthony Thomas said for the people willing to make an impact in technology intensive industries, the 124-year-old astart-up’ was the place to be.\nThe India hub is part of GE’s network of global locations at San Ramon in California; Detroit in Michigan; New Orleans in Louisiana; at Glen Allen in Virginia (all in the US), at Riyadh in Saudi Arabia and at Budapest in Hungary.\nBy pairing digital technology with domain expertise across industries like aviation, energy, healthcare and transportation, GE is transforming the industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive,” added the statement.
