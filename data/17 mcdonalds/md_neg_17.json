      "text": "Volvo picks McDonald's exec as first chief digital officer Automotive News Europe December 1, 2016 19:33 CET \nVolvo Cars has named Atif Rafiq its first chief digital officer, luring the longtime Silicon Valley executive from the McDonald's, where he built the fast food giant's digital unit from scratch. \nVolvo is looking for Rafiq to lead the company's continued digital transformation. That includes \"helping to evolve how consumers interact with Volvo cars across the buying, driving, entertainment and service experience,\" Volvo said in a statement. \nRafiq will oversee the \"consumer-facing applications, digital touchpoints and enterprise systems supporting the company's products, processes and services,\" Volvo said. \nRafiq, 43, will succeed Klas Bendrik, who has been Volvo's senior vice president for group IT and chief information officer since 2010. Bendrik, 47, will help Rafiq transition into his new job, which he starts Jan. 2, and will then leave Volvo for a new position, the automaker said. \nSpeeding up development \nVolvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson said in the statement Thursday that Volvo chose Rafiq because the company needs to rethink how customers buy its cars and how the automaker interacts with its customers after the purchase. Rafiq“is \"ideally qualified\" to speed up our development in this area, Samuelsson said. \nRafiq set up McDonald's Silicon Valley outpost in 2014 to better train and recruit digital talent. Projects he has overseen include tests of mobile ordering and payment, as well as McDonald's World Cup effort, which included an augmented reality game. Before joining McDonald's he held general management roles at Amazon, Yahoo, and AOL. Representatives for McDonald's did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Rafiq's departure. \nVolvo's pending tech initiatives include implementing what it describes as \"the world's largest autonomous driving experiment\" starting next year. The automaker's Drive Me pilot will put 100 families in autonomously driven XC90 on roads around Gothenburg, Sweden. Volvo also has a deal in the U.S. with Uber to develop cars for autonomous driving. \n\"In many ways, the development of cars that are autonomous, electrified and connected overlap,\" Samuelsson said. Rafiq will help ensure that all of these developments are pursued in a \"cohesive, strategic and technologically advanced way, the CEO said. \nThe auto industry is facing \"its biggest inflection point in literally 100 years,\" Rafiq said in the statement. \"Whether it's new technologies like computer vision and machine learning, or changing consumer behaviors around sharing and mobility, the scope for leveraging digitization is huge. I see in Volvo a company that has fully embraced these challenges and can lead the industry into the future.\" \nRafiq's LinkedIn profile says he has built his career within the Internet over 18 years. He calls himself a \"digital native senior executive\" and says his background is steeped in e-commerce, mobile, digital media, social media and retail. \nBefore joining McDonald's as its first chief digital officer in 2013, Rafiq was at Amazon, where he says he helped to give shape to the future of content and books, through my work in Kindle. Prior to that he says he helped AOL pioneer the idea of an Internet portal and helped the company dominate web 1.0. \nLots of changes \nRafiq's arrival pending arrival is the latest in a series of personnel changes at the top of Volvo's organizational chart. When Bendrik departs in 2017 he will be the third member of Volvo executive management team to exit the company in less than a year. \nLast week Audi said Volvo r&d boss Peter Mertens would become its board member for technical development \"as soon as possible\" while Lars Wrebo stepped down as head of manufacturing and logistics in September. \nVolvo has not named Mertens' replacement yet, while Wrebo was succeeded by former PSA Group executive Javier Varela on Nov. 2. Varela spent 26 years at PSA, where he last served as executive vice president of the French automaker's joint venture with Toyota Motor in the Czech Republic. \nJessica Wohl of Ad Age contributed to this report \nYou can reach Douglas A.

      "text": "By Beh Lih Yi\nKUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labor supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions.\nAn investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald's was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 U.S. cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports.\nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald's restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur.\nMcDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a \"top priority\", with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation.\n\"Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,\" spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement.\n\"As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.\"\nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald's. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon.\nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labor agency.\n\"Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,\" he said.\nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for \"a number of years\", Christianson added.\nHe said the company's suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker's rights.\nMcDonald's hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 percent are foreign workers.\nMalaysia, which is Southeast Asia's third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses.\nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labor exploitation happens \"almost everyday\" among multinational firms in the country.\nShe urged McDonald's to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery.\n\"They can't run away because they are the main company,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"No matter if you're in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.\"\n(Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights and climate change.

      "text": "Behold. (Picture: McDonald’s/Instagram) A key part of the greatness of McDonald’s is uniformity.\nWe can't get enough of this mum who snuck corn on the cob into the cinema When you order a Big Mac, you know what it’s going to look like (apart from the times when the cheese isn’t placed perfectly in the centre, which is a damn travesty).\nThe same rule applies to McNuggets.\nIf you’ve ever taken a moment to stare at your nuggets before shovelling them in your mouth (unlikely, we know), you may have noticed that McDonald’s chicken nuggets only come in four distinct shapes.\n(Picture: Nelson Ching/Bloomberg via Getty Images) And this week, we’ve had it confirmed that we’re not imagining things and seeing patterns in our junk food that don’t exist.\nThis week, a post from 2012 resurfaced on the internet in which McDonald’s Canada answered a question about the McNuggets’ shape – thus not only confirming that the four shapes are indeed a thing, but also explaining why they’re a thing.\nFirst off, the shapes themselves. McDonald’s explains that the nuggets come in four shapes and four shapes only: the ball, the boot, the bow-tie, and the bell.\n(Picture: Carlos Osorio/Toronto Star via Getty Images) As to why there are only these four shapes, McDonald’s says that having four shapes is ‘the perfect equilibrium of dipability and fun.’\n‘Three would have been too few,’ they write. ‘Five would’ve been, like, wacky.\nMore: Food London now has a Ferrero Rocher themed pop-up \nHere's how to make sweet treats from your favourite Roald Dahl stories \nTesco is delivering 18,000 free mince pies to people's doorsteps \n‘We also make them similar in size to ensure consistent cooking times for food safety.’\nSuch chicken-y wisdom.\n(Picture: McDonald’s/Instagram) Of course, this makes absolutely no difference to our lives in any way, other than a jazzy conversation starter on a first date (always take a first date to eat chicken nuggets. Always) and the reassurance that there’s order in the world of fast food.\nGood to know.\nMORE: In defence of McDonald’s: 17 reasons why Maccy’s should never, ever change \nMORE: It turns out dogs can do maths \nMORE: You’ll soon be able to get McDonald’s coffee on flights \n ",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald’s flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By Associated Press | November 30, 2016 @ 12:11 pm \nFILE - In this Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, Big Mac creator Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti attends his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) Tweet \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township. \nCopyright © The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo: Courtesy of Schanock Investments) 1 CONNECT 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nGREEN BAY – Green Bay metro area McDonald's restaurants might install self-order kiosks during 2017. In the meantime, restaurants continue to be modernized in other ways. \nMcDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook, the originator of the popular all-day breakfast service, announced earlier in November that the company was planning kiosks and table service for its 14,000 restaurants by the end of next year. The technology upgrade would have happened anyway, but is no doubt accelerated by efforts across the nation to increase minimum wages. \nDavid Schanock of Schanock Investments, which owns most of the local McDonald's, said an installation timeline has not been set. \n\"They are still testing it,\" he said of the kiosk system. \nMcDonald's is doing trial runs in 500 restaurants in California, New York and Florida and plans more roll outs. Franchisees, who own more than 80 percent of McDonald's restaurants, are responsible for installing kiosks in their stores. How fast they do so could depend on their individual finances and construction and training schedules. \nRecent restaurant upgrades in the metro area were made with kiosks in mind, Schanock said. The rebuilt restaurant on South Oneida Street in Ashwaubenon and the remodeling project at the Radisson Street site include wiring for the automated system. \nSpeaking of which, the restaurant at 2340 S. Oneida St., reopened a couple of weeks ago after closing in July for a complete rebuild. The updated version includes a double drive-thru lane, a rock-and-brick exterior, indoor seating for about 100 and parking for 59 vehicles. \nAnd yes, it still has a football theme. The previous building included a green-and-gold interior, photographs and other Packers-related accessories. If customers had any comments to make about the new store, they usually included a hope that the Packers theme would remain. \n\"It turned out very neat,\" Schanock said of the new building. \"It's very modern with a little bit of a Packers feel to it.\" \nThe restaurant at 1125 Radisson St., Green Bay, is the latest to get a face lift. That McDonald's remains open during construction, which they hope to finish before the end of the year. \nNo other restaurants are scheduled for work at present. \n\"We still have a couple of others out there that the outside needs to be redone,\" Schanock said. \nThe Schanock family's partnership with McDonald's started in 1959 when Romaine Schanock joined Ray Kroc's fledgling organization. Schanock built a franchise that grew to 16 McDonald's restaurants owned by four of his six children. \nEasterbook's efforts to keep McDonald's viable have shown some success. The all-day breakfast decision, among other innovations, has proven a good move. McDonald's stock remains a solid investment, as it was even during the recession. Shares traded at $44.24 each on Jan. 1, 2007. They are in the $120 range now. \nAn interesting aside: The Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago died last week. Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti was 98. \nBuffalo Wild Wings opens \nBELLEVUE – Buffalo Wild Wings opens its second Green Bay metro location at 11 a.m. Monday in Bellevue, immediately southwest of Costco Wholesale on Country Road GV. \nThe first 100 people through the door will receive free chicken wings for a year. A ribbon cutting is scheduled for 9 a.m., doors open at 10 a.m., and food service starts at 11 a.m. \nManager Shelby Price is moving to the Bellevue location from the Ashwaubenon restaurant. \n\"We are just really excited to be on the East side now,\" said Price, who was raised in southern Door County and understands the potential for an east-side location to draw from Door, Kewaunee and eastern Brown counties. \nThe restaurant has about 130 employees. Occupancy is 214. \nHours are 11 a.m. to midnight Sundays through Thursdays and 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The telephone number is (920) 468-5251. \nTitletown Brewing 20th \nTitletown Brewing Co. will celebrate its 20th anniversary beginning at 6 p.m. on Dec. 9 in its Tap Room, 320 N. Broadway, Green Bay. The observance will include 1996 prices, 1996 music, 20th anniversary craft beer, cake and more. \nThe brewery and restaurant, in the renovated Chicago & North Western train station on Dousman Street, survived years of rebuilding of major streets and the construction of the Ray Nitschke Bridge in addition to all the normal challenges restaurants face. It has since expanded to include a brewery and tap room separate from the train station restaurant. \nContact rryman@greenbaypressgazette.com and follow him on Twitter @RichRymanPG , on Instagram at rrymanpg or on Facebook at Richard Ryman-Press-Gazette.

McDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford reportedly confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family late Monday. As one of the company’s first franchisees, Delligatti started offering the Big Mac — for 45 cents — at his store in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, spreading to 47 of his other McDonald’s outlets across the country. In an interview with the Associated Press in 2006, Delligatti said the company was initially averse to the idea of the new burger as their existing menu of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was doing reasonable well.

      "text": "McDonald's Sandwiches From Around The World /   McDonald's Egypt offers a falafel sandwich that rivals a Big Mac any day. The falafel patties are shaped to look like burgers and drenched in the ever-present secret sauce that seems to pop up everywhere, from Europe to NYC halal carts. After inquiring, I found out the sauce was a not-so-mysterious but delicious tahini-garlic dressing. With the secret reveled, why not whip up some quick, homemade falafel and proceed to drench in sauce? Bulgogi, literally fire meat in Korean, is a traditional marinated barbecue beef that is simply put, absolute mouth-watering deliciousness. McDonald's put their spin on the Korean favorite by sandwiching two pork patties in a hamburger bun, slathering it with bulgogi sauce, and calling it a day. I'll take two. McDonald's version of the classic croque monsieur, the Croque McDo is a favorite amongst francophiles. Two slices of Emmental cheese and a slice of ham are squashed between toast and pressed in a sandwich maker, creating a gooey, fondue-like ham and cheese. Why not make it a meal with a beer? Yep, that's right, McDonald's in France offers beer. Even McDonald's in France is better. Damn. These Middle Eastern favorites are fixtures all over the globe. McDonald's in Israel features barbecued beef on a lafa and pita. Both are served with a small Middle Eastern-style salad. Check out this hilarious McShawarma advertisement inspired by Pulp Fiction. Fun Fact: India is the only country in the world where McDonald's does not serve beef. That means no Big Mac, and no Quarter Pounder. A moment of silence, if you please. Instead, vegetarian favorites like the McCurry Pan, a rectangular-shaped crust topped with curry, broccoli, baby corn, mushrooms and bell peppers and baked till crisp are common fare. Other favorites include the Chicken Maharaja Mac, Big Spicy Paneer Wrap (which should be the only kind of paneer wrap) and McAloo Tikki. We're all about the carb-on-carb sandwiches. Recently we've waxed poetic on the virtues of the underexposed Turkish cuisine, and told you about our love affair with Turkey's Wet Burger. Although McDonalds' McTurco and Kofteburger (meatball) don't come close to our beloved Islak burger, we'll choose them over a Big Mac any day. Besides, it's been many moons since any of us were able to make a kofte without stuffing it with mozzarella. Satay Friday is a sacred holiday here at Food Republic Headquarters. If only we could head down to the McDonalds below our office and pick up a McSatay. We're considering moving operations to Jakarta or maybe Bali for the sake of the food. It's unfortunate that McDonald's Japan doesn't make one of our favorite Japanese treats, the carb-bomb yakisoba sandwich. I guess we'll have to settle for the creatively-named McPork -- a basic hamburger with a pork instead of beef patty -- and then maybe some green tea and a red bean ice cream sundae, which is not such a bad thing. Cousin to the Japanese McPork, the Samurai is Thailand's answer to population that leans swine-wise and favors pork to beef any day. Maybe I was Thai in a previous life seeing as though my dedication to all things pork goes as far as wearing a small gold pig around my neck. McDonalds goes Dutch in the Netherlands with the McKroket, a deep fried roll stuffed with chili. Think deep-fried sloppy joe. Perfect if you happen to find yourself with an increased appetite in Amsterdam. Our assistant editor, Jess, just got back from reporting for Lufthansa in Nuremburg, Germany where the specialty on a roll is Drei im Weggla, a trio of small, spiced sausages. McDonald's take also includes a sausage trio with a smear of mustard. The idea of McDonald's serving shellfish makes us a little quesy, but why not give the Canadians a shot with the McLobster -- eh? It may not be up to the standards of lobster purists, but it should tide you over until summer in the Hamptons. Snob. Traditional Australian hamburgers usually include cheese, beetroot, pineapple, a fried egg (usually with a runny yolk) and bacon. McDonald's down under created a fusion between the classic Americano and the Aussie with their McOz by including beetroot in an otherwise classic Big Mac. In New Zealand the McOz is taken up a notch by throwing in a fried egg. Voila: the Kiwiburger. During the holiday season, McDonald's all over the UK offer the traditional British favorite. The savory pies are made with fruit-based mincemeat and classic holiday flavors: cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. In 2010, McDonald's Mexico added the Flaming Hot Doritos Quarter Pounder, basically a quarter pounder souped up with layer of Flaming Hot Doritos and a healthy smear of guacamole. Taco Bell followed suit, and has recently come up with Doritos Tacos Locos. Not a fan? We don't blame you, why not opt for some spicy homemade guac on your burger instead? The Greek Mac swaps out the original Big Mac's secret sauce and famed sesame seed bun for a pita and yogurt. We can't wait till McDolmas start popping up in Athens locations. I wonder what Yiayia would have to say about that. McCriollo is Latin America's answer to the Egg McMuffin. Almost exactly the same, the only difference is a beefed-up bun in place of the classic English muffin. We've heard that the homemade variety make women fall macly in love. In Chile, fries can be subbed with empanadas. The Chileans are onto something, and the Colombians seem to agree. Spam is often referred to as the \"Hawaiian Steak.\" Not by us, though. McDonald's in Hawaii offers a Spam breakfast in an attempt to offer authentic Hawaiian fare. Try all they want, nothing beats a great loco moco.  シェア",

      "text": "Market News | Fri Dec 2, 2016 | 8:47am EST McDonald's sells Singapore, Malaysian franchise to Saudi group \nDec 2 McDonald's Corp said on Friday it had sold the franchise rights for its restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia to Saudi Arabia's Lionhorn Pte Ltd as part of a plan to move away from direct ownership in Asia. \nThe fast-food chain said it transferred its ownership interest in 390 restaurants, more than 80 percent of which were company-owned, on Dec. 1 to Lionhorn. \nLionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who are franchisees for nearly 100 McDonald's restaurants in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nMcDonald's did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. \nReuters reported in October that McDonald's was nearing a deal worth up to $400 million to franchise the outlets to Reza group, which also owns and operates McDonald's outlets in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nThe Lionhorn deal is in line with McDonald's plans to bring in partners in Asia as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nThe company said it has now franchised about 1,300 outlets as a part of its target to become 95 percent franchised by the end of 2018.

(Photo: AFP / JIMIN LAI) A \nSINGAPORE: McDonald's Corp said on Friday (Dec 2) it had sold the franchise rights for its restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia to Saudi Arabia's Lionhorn Pte Ltd as part of a plan to move away from direct ownership in Asia. \nThe fast-food chain said it transferred its ownership interest in 390 restaurants, more than 80 per cent of which were company-owned, on Dec. 1 to Lionhorn. \nLionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who are franchisees for nearly 100 McDonald's restaurants in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nMcDonald's did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. \nReuters reported in October that McDonald's was nearing a deal worth up to $400 million to franchise the outlets to Reza group, which also owns and operates McDonald's outlets in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nThe Lionhorn deal is in line with McDonald's plans to bring in partners in Asia as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nThe company said it has now franchised about 1,300 outlets as a part of its target to become 95 per cent franchised by the end of 2018. - Reuters/mn",

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters   10:21   \n(Dec 2): McDonald's Corp said on Friday it had sold the franchise rights for its restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia to Saudi Arabia's Lionhorn Pte Ltd as part of a plan to move away from direct ownership in Asia. \nThe fast-food chain said it transferred its ownership interest in 390 restaurants, more than 80% of which were company-owned, on Dec 1 to Lionhorn. \nLionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who are franchisees for nearly 100 McDonald's restaurants in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nMcDonald's did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. \nReuters reported in October that McDonald's was nearing a deal worth up to US$400 million to franchise the outlets to Reza group, which also owns and operates McDonald's outlets in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nThe Lionhorn deal is in line with McDonald's plans to bring in partners in Asia as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nThe company said it has now franchised about 1,300 outlets as a part of its target to become 95% franchised by the end of 2018.",

      "text": "McDonald's Reports Developmental Licensee For Business In Malaysia, Singapore December 02, 2016, 08:14:  McDonald's Corp. ( MCD ) said it has selected Lionhorn Pte. Ltd. as the Developmental Licensee or DL for its Malaysia and Singapore markets. Lionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who bring 20 years of experience as the DL for the nearly 100 McDonald's restaurants in the Western and Southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nThe new DL assumed ownership of the McDonald's business in Malaysia and Singapore on December 1, 2016, which includes a total of 390 restaurants, more than 80% of which were Company-owned. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. \nUnder the DL structure, McDonald's transferred its ownership interest in McDonald's Malaysia and Singapore and granted a license to the DL to run McDonald's restaurant operations in these markets. The DL partner will provide the capital necessary to support and grow the business and will pay an initial franchise fee and an ongoing royalty to McDonald's. \nAs part of its turnaround plan announced in May of 2015, McDonald's committed to refranchising 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018 with the long-term goal of becoming 95 percent franchised. With this transaction, McDonald's has now refranchised approximately 1,300 restaurants. \n ",

      "text": "Associated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — The Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago has died. Michael “Jim” Delligatti was 98. \nMcDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family on Monday night. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, about 40 miles south of Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger with two all-beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes were selling well. \nBut Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti’s 47 stores, then went national in 1968. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "jannoon028 -- Shutterstock\n\nIf you prefer Chicken McNuggets at McDonald’s to the Big Mac (I do!) then you’ve probably taken notice of the nugget shapes over the years.\nThere are four distinct shapes, McDonald’s refers to them as the ball, the boot, the bell, and the bow-tie. If you’d have presented me those four words and asked ‘Cass, what do these 4 names have in connection with a popular fast food item?’ I’d have been fucking clueless. All I see when I look at McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets is deliciously fried tan chicken, and I prefer not to spend too much time analyzing what it is I’m eating. Though Chicken McNuggets really aren’t that bad at all and this video showing how they’re made proves that the horror stories are all urban legend.\nVia Instagram / McDonald's \n\nAnyways, this is one of those news stories that makes the rounds every few years and for whatever reason we’re amidst another upswing in the viral news cycle of why McDonald’s has 4 distinct shapes of Chicken McNuggets. Here’s the answer, via Metro UK :\nAs to why there are only these four shapes, McDonald’s says that having four shapes is ‘the perfect equilibrium of dipability and fun.’\n‘Three would have been too few,’ they write. ‘Five would’ve been, like, wacky.\n‘We also make them similar in size to ensure consistent cooking times for food safety.’\nThe fuck did I just read? ‘The perfect equilibrium of dipability and fun’. That…that is not a way to describe eating chicken nuggets. And I don’t see why five is too many?! This seems like total nonsense.\nVia Instagram / New Fork City \n\nMaybe in this instance ‘fun’ is actually an acronym for ‘Fucked Up Notions’ and they’re secretly trolling us for believing their asinine explanation. Or maybe they really think that 4 shapes are actually fun, who knows?\n(h/t Metro UK ) \nShare This\n",

      "text": "Bernama | December 2, 2016 Lionhorn Pte Ltd assume ownership of the McDonald’s business of 390 restaurants in Malaysia and Singapore from Dec 1. \nKUALA LUMPUR: McDonald’s Corporation today announced Lionhorn Pte Ltd as the developmental licensee (DL) for its Malaysia and Singapore markets. \nIn a statement, McDonald’s said Lionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who bring 20 years’ of experience as the DL for the nearly 100 McDonald’s restaurants in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \n“This transaction marks another milestone in our company’s ongoing efforts to identify strategic partners, who share our values, vision to accelerate growth and scale across diverse markets as well as drive innovation. \n“It places us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,” said McDonald’s president and chief executive officer, Steve Easterbrook. \nThe new DL assumed ownership of the McDonald’s business in Malaysia and Singapore on Dec 1, 2016, which includes a total of 390 restaurants, more than 80% of which were company-owned. \nFinancial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. \nUnder the DL structure, McDonald’s transferred its ownership interest in McDonald’s Malaysia and Singapore and granted a license to the DL to run McDonald’s restaurant operations in these markets. \nThe DL partner will provide the capital necessary to support and grow the business and will pay an initial franchise fee and an ongoing royalty to McDonald’s. \nLeading the day-to-day management of the Malaysian and Singaporean markets respectively will be local operating partners Azmir Jaafar and Kenneth Chan, both of whom previously held senior leadership positions at McDonald’s and together possess over 40 years of experience. \n“Local leadership and market knowledge will be key to driving business success in Malaysia and Singapore,” said Azmir , operating partner and managing director McDonald’s Malaysia. \nThis announcement, McDonald’s said, follows a rigorous evaluation and selection process over the past year. \nAs part of its turnaround plan announced in May of 2015, McDonald’s said it is committed to refranchising 4,000 restaurants by end-2018 with the long-term goal of becoming 95% franchised. \nWith this transaction, McDonald’s has now refranchised about 1,300 restaurants.",

      "text": "By Dylan Kickham 42 minutes ago \nOne Kansas police officer got a not-so-sweet surprise in the soda that he ordered at a McDonalds drive-through recently. The fast food working waiting on the officer added mustard into his Dr. Pepper , and is now facing the repercussions of that decision. \nOfficer Safety Alert **Updated *** to add link to news story in post. Please take the time to read the news articles... Posted by Kansas GOING BLUE on Sunday, November 27, 2016 \nPublic outrage targeted at the McDonalds employee began after a photo of the mustard-mixed drink that the police officer received went viral recently. A Facebook group called Kansas GOING BLUE , which describes itself as a localized effort to support law enforcement officers, posted the unappetizing photograph on Sunday, and noted in the caption that the McDonalds' manager had said that a similar incident had happened before at the Topeka location to a highway trooper. \nMcDonalds representatives have confirmed that the anonymous employee at the Topeka location in question has been fired following the incident, local station KSNT reports. But it doesn't just stop with the employee's termination, the District Attorney's Office is also opening a criminal investigation into the incident, which McDonalds is reportedly complying with. \nThis mustard incident is similar to another high-profile case of animosity between a fast food worker and a police officer that also occurred in Kansas last year. In the relatively nearby town of Newton, Kansas, a Taco Bell worker delivered a cop's order of burritos with the word \"pig\" written on the wrappers. That employee was also fired by the fast food franchise, but it appears not much has changed in the year since it made headlines. \nTom and Marilyn Dobski, McDonalds franchise owners in Topeka, reaffirmed to KSNT that their restaurants support law enforcement and that they were shocked to learn about the mustard debacle. \nAll customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas. \nIt sounds like the whole situation is being taken care of already, but it's not a terrible idea to always lift the lid of your drinks and see what's in there before you start slurping away at it --- you shouldn't have to do it, but you never really know what's going on back in those fast food kitchens. Better safe than inhaling a mouthful of mustard. Subscribe To Topics You're Interested In close \nSubscribe To Topics You're Interested In I've already subscribed",

      "title": "McDonald&apos;s in China Is a Tall Order - Bloomberg Gadfly",
      "text": "118.13 USD \nMcDonald's Corp. looks like it's gotten itself a happy meal in China. The consortium purchasing the assets, however, risks a bout of indigestion. \nThe world's biggest fast-food chain couldn't have done much better than locking up Citic Group Corp. and Carlyle Group LP as buyers of its franchise in Asia's largest economy. The $3 billion price tag that's being bandied about isn't insignificant either given McDonald's high-growth markets business -- which includes its China stores -- reported operating income of just $841.1 million last year and $320.1 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Junior Meal Third-quarter operating income in high-growth markets, which includes China, was a small portion of overall earnings Source: Bloomberg Note: McDonald's high-growth markets include China and Russia. \nWith the sale, McDonald's gets out of running a difficult business in a country where tainted food scandals are par for the course and politics can hobble income. McDonald's blamed \"temporary protests related to events surrounding the South China Sea\" for denting its sales in the nation last quarter. Like rival Yum China Holdings Inc., it was an early entrant to China's fast-food scene but has seen its market share slip. \nCitic's revenue from financial services 53% \nOffloading its some 2,800 restaurants in China and Hong Kong means the issues of growing competition from local players and how to appeal to digital-savvy, and increasingly health-conscious, consumers become someone else's problem. With a franchise model, McDonald's also stands to gain generous royalty fees. \nThe path ahead for Citic and its private-equity partner is less clear. \nIn theory, Citic, being Chinese, can help with menu changes that should appeal to local tastes. The financial-services firm is also extremely well connected -- the conglomerate was set up by Deng Xiaoping to attract foreign capital in the late 1970s, after all. \nThose connections matter for McDonald's, which plans to add more than 1,000 stores over the next five years, particularly in second- and third-tier cities where its brand and hygienic-looking restaurants still have some cache. \nBut beyond a stake in car dealer Dah Chong Hong Holdings Ltd., Citic has very little in the way of retail, and its experience in food is limited. Banking on Banking Citic's first-half revenue shows financial services are still the major money spinner Source: Bloomberg Note: Figures are for Citic's Hong Kong-listed entity. \nJapan's Itochu Corp. and Charoen Pokphand Group Co., the agribusiness firm owned by Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont, did take a 20 percent stake in Citic last year. Itochu has some retail presence in China through its part-owned FamilyMart convenience stores, while Charoen Pokphand has a handful of consumer assets, including hypermarket chain CP Lotus . Leveraging that experience to run and expand McDonald's in China may be a stretch, though. \nCarlyle, meanwhile, owns some Chinese consumer plays, including Tenwow International Holdings Ltd., which produces and distributes packaged food and beverages throughout the mainland. But after selling Babela, a chain of Italian-style outlets in Shanghai in 2012, it doesn't have a restaurant presence. \nTaking on McDonald's in China, a business whose reputation is yet to fully recover from an expired meat repackaging scandal, won't be easy. For both Citic and Carlyle, it's a tall order.

      "text": "jannoon028 -- Shutterstock\n\nIf you prefer Chicken McNuggets at McDonald’s to the Big Mac (I do!) then you’ve probably taken notice of the nugget shapes over the years.\nThere are four distinct shapes, McDonald’s refers to them as the ball, the boot, the bell, and the bow-tie. If you’d have presented me those four words and asked ‘Cass, what do these 4 names have in connection with a popular fast food item?’ I’d have been fucking clueless. All I see when I look at McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets is deliciously fried tan chicken, and I prefer not to spend too much time analyzing what it is I’m eating. Though Chicken McNuggets really aren’t that bad at all and this video showing how they’re made proves that the horror stories are all urban legend.\nVia Instagram / McDonald's \n\nAnyways, this is one of those news stories that makes the rounds every few years and for whatever reason we’re amidst another upswing in the viral news cycle of why McDonald’s has 4 distinct shapes of Chicken McNuggets. Here’s the answer, via Metro UK :\nAs to why there are only these four shapes, McDonald’s says that having four shapes is ‘the perfect equilibrium of dipability and fun.’\n‘Three would have been too few,’ they write. ‘Five would’ve been, like, wacky.\n‘We also make them similar in size to ensure consistent cooking times for food safety.’\nThe fuck did I just read? ‘The perfect equilibrium of dipability and fun’. That…that is not a way to describe eating chicken nuggets. And I don’t see why five is too many?! This seems like total nonsense.\nVia Instagram / New Fork City \n\nMaybe in this instance ‘fun’ is actually an acronym for ‘Fucked Up Notions’ and they’re secretly trolling us for believing their asinine explanation. Or maybe they really think that 4 shapes are actually fun, who knows?\n(h/t Metro UK ) \n\n",

      "text": "McDonald's sells Singapore, Malaysian franchise to Saudi group AP file photo Tweet Published: 10:06 PM, December 2, 2016 \nSINGAPORE — McDonald's Corp said on Friday (Dec 2) it had sold the franchise rights for its restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia to Saudi Arabia's Lionhorn Pte Ltd as part of a plan to move away from direct ownership in Asia. \nThe fast-food chain said it transferred its ownership interest in 390 restaurants, more than 80 per cent of which were company-owned, on Dec 1 to Lionhorn. \nLionhorn is led by Mr Sheik Fahd and Mr Abdulrahman Alireza, who are franchisees for nearly 100 McDonald's restaurants in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nMcDonald's did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. \nReuters reported in October that McDonald's was nearing a deal worth up to US$400 million (S$569.2 million) to franchise the outlets to Reza group, which also owns and operates McDonald's outlets in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nThe Lionhorn deal is in line with McDonald's plans to bring in partners in Asia as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nThe company said it has now franchised about 1,300 outlets as a part of its target to become 95 per cent franchised by the end of 2018.

      "text": "Here's the deal with the secret gold card that gets you unlimited McDonald's 2016-12-02T15:39:00.000Z comment () \nImagine walking into a McDonald's, plunking down a special card and never having to pay for anything. \nIt turns out that can actually happen. Just ask Rob Lowe, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, who all reportedly have card a \"McGold Card\" that gets them unlimited free food at their local Micky D's. Jimmy Kimmel Live As Rob Lowe shows, the \"McGold Card\" is real, and it's spectacular. \nLowe showed off his on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" last year, noting how he got it from a friend. As it notes on the card, his buddy is McDonald's franchisee David Peterson, whose father, Herb, invented the Egg McMuffin in 1972 at one of his California McDonald's locations, according to The New York Times . \nRELATED: McDonald's Chicken McNuggets come in 4 shapes — and they have names! \nThe card Lowe flashed says that it's good for unlimited food for a year, and only at locations in Santa Barbara and Goleta, California. That's because it was issued by Peterson and not the McDonald's corporation. It's up to the franchise owner to decide if the card is good for a limited amount of time or for life. \nPeterson also gave a gold card to local Santa Barbara philanthropist Larry Crandell for his 90th birthday in 2013, entitling the man known as \"Mr. Santa Barbara\" to free food for life, according to SantaBarbara.com . Crandell died in August at 93. \nBuffett showed off his McGold Card in a 2007 interview with CNBC while also mentioning that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has one that is accepted at locations across the world.

But over the years, in videos and statements, the company has used the term \"bow tie\" more often than \"bone\" (though to us, the shape looks a bit like a blob).\n\"The 4 shapes we make Chicken McNuggets in was the equilibrium of dipability and fun,\" one McDonald's website wrote . \"3 would've been too few. 5 would've been, like, wacky. For now, our McNugget shapes are: the 'ball,' the 'boot' the 'bow tie' and the 'bell.' We also make them similar in size to ensure consistent cooking times for food safety.\"\nBut boot, ball, bell or bow tie (or bone), the important thing is that each shape begins with the letter B.\n\"Because, bud,\" the company wrote in reply to one customer . \"Beautifully built 'B' bites boost bliss, bypassing boredom.\"\nFollow Ree Hines on Twitter .\nNow Watch McDonald's Big Mac creator dies:\nClick to expand Replay Video Every Look From The Victoria’s Secret After-Party From Adriana to Elsa to Gigi, check out all the sexy after-party looks from each of the VS models.

He was very skinny, had puffy eyes and his shell, which should have been hard, was soft like putty and he was also covered in algae.\nBut the RSPCA, called to rescue the reptiles, were able to save the musk turtle.\nThey named him Ronald after the fast food clown.\nThe terrapin was very unwell (Picture: SWNS) MORE: Schoolchildren just recreated Martin Shkreli’s HIV drug for £1.60 a dose \nInspector Liz Wheeler said: ‘I can’t imagine what went through someone’s mind to walk into McDonald’s and think: ‘This is a good place to leave two of my pets.’\n‘It is not just that these animals were dumped which upsets me, but they had clearly not been given proper care.\n‘(The terrapin) had a short life and I imagine was miserable for most of it.\n‘Ronald the turtle is in a lot better shape but still had a soft shell and clearly has not been looked after properly.’\nThey were dumped in an ice cream tub (Picture: SWNS) A man was seen dumping the animals at the fast food outlet in Brighton Marina Leisure Centre at around 1pm on November 30.\nNewly elected Lib Dem MP rescued from 'embarassing' interview on Brexit Ronald is now being treated by a vet and will be moved to a specialist home when he is well enough.\nLiz added: “We urge anyone with any information about who may have dumped them in this way to call us on 0300 123 8018.\n‘We would also be extremely keen to hear from anyone with specialist knowledge and experience of musk turtles who might be able to offer Ronald a home.’",

      "text": "More articles by Steve Palec Published Dec. 2, 2016 at 2:01 p.m. Tweet \nI spent Thanksgiving with family in Colorado. It was a trip I ruined. I enter that confession into the record in case you run into any of my family and mention Thanksgiving. They will roll their eyes. Now you know why. \nThey roll their eyes whenever the subject of my eating habits comes up. It isn't pretty and often involves copious amounts of fast food (anyone who knows me knows I love Taco Bell and McDonalds). \nMaybe I was in a sad state of mind leaving the State of Wisconsin right before Thanksgiving, but that fact coincided with the return of McDonalds brats and their foray into the wonderful world of cheese curds. \nIndeed, the morning I got back to town and began my habit of waking up to the news, I was immediately besieged by back-to-back commercials featuring the voice of the Green Bay Packers, Wayne Larrivee. \nI like Wayne. I once served on a charitable board with his lovely wife, Julie. And who doesn't love his declaration of conclusion, \"And there is your dagger.\" \nOf course, like anything (except fast food) it is enjoyable in moderation. The last thing I need is to hear Wayne's dagger comment out of context. \nMake a wrong turn the GPS voice says \"And there is your dagger?\" No thanks. \nHave the angel on one shoulder tell you to do something good. And the little devil on the other says, \"And there is your dagger?\" No thanks. \nWalk through a haunted house at Halloween time and have a zombie pop out from behind a wall screaming \"And here is your dagger?\" Again, pass. \nBut following the first of the two back-to-back commercials extolling a car, there was Wayne on my TV reminding me that I was back in Wisconsin and not far from those curds and brats at McDonalds. \nI have had the McDonalds brats in the past. And they are very good. In a way, it is a surprise. I have always thought of the key to the addictive aspect of McDonalds items was due to the sauce. In fact, I have espoused that theory before in Onmilwaukee blogs. The Big Mac, the McRib, the tartar sauce on the Filet-O-Fish and the sugary goodness of their ketchup on crisp fries are all sauce-based successes…not based on the savory status of the ingredients. You don't buy a McRib for it's resemblance to Kobe beef. \nThe brat goes against the grain. No sauce is necessary. You start with a quality Johnsonville brat, and you are hard pressed to mess it up. I am a fan. Not only that, but at two for $5, it's a true bargain. \nI recently tweeted that I hit up the McDonalds Pick Two menu and had trouble editing my order. I had two burgers, two fish sandwiches and two orders of nuggets…all for $15! Then I fell asleep and got a $22 parking ticket. \nSo, the cheese curds? Just like there is a time and place for Wayne Larrivee's signature tag line, the key to McDonald's cheese curds is based on timing. \nThey must…I repeat... MUST be hot. \nMy first try was through the drive-thru was when I was hungry and in a hurry and excited to try the curds. When they were handed to me they barely made it out of the bag and onto my driver's side seat before I was carefully pulling out of the lot and putting a curd in my mouth. When served hot, they are pretty good. Breading is decent. Not great, but pretty good. \nMy understanding is that the cheese is real Wisconsin cheese. But unlike the accurate description of our Midwest warmth and generosity, the amount of cheese isn't generous and --unlike the name brand brats -- there seems to be a generic aspect to the actual cheese. It wasn't as bad as McDonald's controversial 2015 mozzarella stick experiment. But it's just pretty good. There's none of the squeaky specialness associated with the kind of curds we are blessed to find almost anywhere in the dairy state. \nWhen McDonalds cheese curds sit around for a few minutes and lose the warmth, they lose all luster. Pretty good goes to meh. \nTheir heart is in the right place and the price is right too. I wouldn't give up perfecting it. Especially since they nail the brat. \nAnd on the bright side….if you are hungry, in Wisconsin, and eat them with the quickness of a well-timed slant route in which the ball is out of the quarterbacks hands before you can blink…well, there is your dagger.",

The best moments of my life all happened right here in Minnesota! From marrying Stephanie from Elk River to bringing our two boys, Jameson and Landon into this world at Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park, Minnesota is our home and we are so happy to be back!

Maverick Originally from Cincinnati, I started my radio life at Ohio University. I began to make connections with radio personalities until the doors opened for me to start my on air career. I joined the staff of WUBE and WYGY in Cincinnati, in 1994 and flew over the city doing airborne traffic reports until I was asked to be in studio with a new guy named Chris Carr, who was coming from Minneapolis to be the morning show host. That's when the market became alive again with his personality and a I began a six year run with the guy I now call my best friend. I know, \"a little crazy\", but he makes me laugh. The Chris Carr and Company show incorporated the audience as well as my wife Paula who, as she would say, was born in the country and doesn't make excuses for it. I have two in the family I call my inspiration. My adopted son Brad who now travels the world and a daughter who is still with her husband serving the country at Ft. Hood, Texas. Thank you for welcoming me to one of the best places in the world to be and for allowing me to call Minneapolis my new home. Kia Minnesota born and raised, I wear sundresses, ripped jeans and always a pair of cowboy boots. I love camping, fishing, and country music. I don’t understand the separation between work and play.K102 has been my home since 2009an intern, then Promotions Assistant, progressed to Promotions Director, and now am furthering my responsibilities as a DJ and Music Director.I have an unshakeable belief in a world that holds hope and happiness for everyone. I am described as having an infectious laugh, loving heart, and a generous spirit.Family and friends keep me grounded- They are the inspiration for all my stories, they push me to be a better person and drive me to always try new things.

      "text": "\n\nOne of the humbler items on the menu at McDonald’s is the Chicken McNugget . It’s not as grand as the Big Mac , yet it’s a step above just ordering fries. The spiced and breaded ground chicken treasure has been a nationwide cornerstone of the menu since 1983. For a long while the nuggets were just slightly round clumps meant to be dipped in barbecue sauce, ketchup, honey mustard, or whatever sauce tickled your fancy (by all means, fight over what sauce is best among yourselves…even though we all know it’s barbecue, obviously). Over time, though, the McNugget shape became a cookie-cutter set of four shapes: the Ball, Boot, Bell, and Bone.\n\n\nUm, yeah. There’s an obvious slight difference, but we’re not seeing a lot of “bones.” Anyway, McDonald’s Canada has been answering customer’s questions online and posting them on their page. One such question was “why the four shapes?” Their response was …. interesting? “The 4 shapes we make Chicken McNuggets in was the perfect equilibrium of dipability and fun. 3 would’ve been too few. 5 would’ve been, like, wacky.” Five is known to be a wacky number . Also, dipability is fun (see sauces above). \nIn the end, fun and dipability are kind of an unsatisfactory and dippy answer to why there are four kinda-distinct shapes to the McNugget, but it’s not like we’re going to stop eating them because we’re suspicious of how they look. We’ve got love for every shape of McNugget out there. \n\n(Via Food Beast )\n",

Lionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who are franchisees for nearly 100 McDonald's restaurants in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia.McDonald's did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.Reuters reported in October that McDonald's was nearing a deal worth up to $400 million to franchise the outlets to Reza group, which also owns and operates McDonald's outlets in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia.The Lionhorn deal is in line with McDonald's plans to bring in partners in Asia as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model.The company said it has now franchised about 1,300 outlets as a part of its target to become 95 percent franchised by the end of 2018.

Unlike in its other major markets, including the United States, most of its outlets in Asia are company-owned. \nMcDonald's is also nearing a deal to sell its stores in China and Hong Kong to a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group and China's Citic Group for up to US$3 billion, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. \nREUTERS   'McDonald's sells franchise rights in S'pore, Malaysia'.

      "text": "Photo by Bloomberg A McDonald's in Shenzhen, China Opinion McDonald's in China is a tall order \nMcDonald's Corp. looks like it's gotten itself a happy meal in China. The consortium purchasing the assets, however, risks a bout of indigestion. \nThe world's biggest fast-food chain couldn't have done much better than locking up Citic Group Corp. and Carlyle Group LP as buyers of its franchise in Asia's largest economy. The $3 billion price tag that's being bandied about isn't insignificant either given McDonald's high-growth markets business -- which includes its China stores -- reported operating income of just $841.1 million last year and $320.1 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30. \nWith the sale, McDonald's gets out of running a difficult business in a country where tainted food scandals are par for the course and politics can hobble income. McDonald's blamed \"temporary protests related to events surrounding the South China Sea\" for denting its sales in the nation last quarter. Like rival Yum China Holdings Inc., it was an early entrant to China's fast-food scene but has seen its market share slip. \nOffloading its some 2,800 restaurants in China and Hong Kong means the issues of growing competition from local players and how to appeal to digital-savvy, and increasingly health-conscious, consumers become someone else's problem. \nWith a franchise model, McDonald's also stands to gain generous royalty fees. \nThe path ahead for Citic and its private-equity partner is less clear. \nIn theory, Citic, being Chinese, can help with menu changes that should appeal to local tastes. \nThe financial-services firm is also extremely well connected -- the conglomerate was set up by Deng Xiaoping to attract foreign capital in the late 1970s, after all. \nThose connections matter for McDonald's, which plans to add more than 1,000 stores over the next five years, particularly in second- and third-tier cities where its brand and hygienic-looking restaurants still have some cache. \nBut beyond a stake in car dealer Dah Chong Hong Holdings Ltd., Citic has very little in the way of retail, and its experience in food is limited. \nJapan's Itochu Corp. and Charoen Pokphand Group Co., the agribusiness firm owned by Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont, did take a 20 percent stake in Citic last year. Itochu has some retail presence in China through its part-owned FamilyMart convenience stores, while Charoen Pokphand has a handful of consumer assets, including hypermarket chain CP Lotus. \nLeveraging that experience to run and expand McDonald's in China may be a stretch, though.Carlyle, meanwhile, owns some Chinese consumer plays, including Tenwow International Holdings Ltd., which produces and distributes packaged food and beverages throughout the mainland. \nBut after selling Babela, a chain of Italian-style outlets in Shanghai in 2012, it doesn't have a restaurant presence.Taking on McDonald's in China, a business whose reputation is yet to fully recover from an expired meat repackaging scandal, won't be easy. For both Citic and Carlyle, it's a tall order. \nNisha Gopalan is a columnist for Bloomberg Gadfly.",

      "text": "  10:45pm McDonald’s franchise for Malaysia, Singapore sold to Saudis   McDonald’s Corp today said it had sold the franchise rights for its restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia to Saudi Arabia’s Lionhorn Pte Ltd as part of a plan to move away from direct ownership in Asia. The fast-food chain said it transferred its ownership interest in 390 restaurants, more than 80% of which were company-owned, on Dec 1 to Lionhorn. Lionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who are franchisees for nearly 100 McDonald’s restaurants in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. McDonald’s did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Reuters had reported in October that McDonald’s was nearing a deal worth up to US$400 million to franchise the outlets to Reza group – which also owns and operates McDonald’s outlets in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. The Lionhorn deal is in line with McDonald’s plans to bring in partners in Asia as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. The company said it has now franchised about 1,300 outlets as a part of its target to become 95% franchised by the end of 2018. In a statement, McDonald’s said Lionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who bring 20 years of experience as the DL for the nearly 100 McDonald’s restaurants in the Western and Southern regions of Saudi Arabia. “This transaction marks another milestone in our company’s ongoing efforts to identify strategic partners, who share our values, vision to accelerate growth and scale across diverse markets as well as drive innovation. “It places us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,” said McDonald’s president and chief executive officer Steve Easterbrook. Leading the day-to-day management of the Malaysia and Singapore markets, respectively, will be local operating partners Azmir Jaafar and Kenneth Chan – both of whom previously held senior leadership positions at McDonald’s and together possess over 40 years of experience. “Local leadership and market knowledge will be key to driving business success in Malaysia and Singapore,” said Azmir, operating partner and managing director at McDonald’s Malaysia. As part of its turnaround plan announced in May of 2015, McDonald’s said it is committed to refranchising 4,000 restaurants by end-2018 with the long-term goal of becoming 95% franchised. With this transaction, McDonald’s has now refranchised about 1,300 restaurants.",

      "title": "McDonald's Path Back To Fair Value",
      "text": "McDonald's Path Back To Fair Value Dec. 2.16 Founder: The Currency Of Time Summary \nThe performance of McDonald’s the business and security has been quite impressive during the past decade and a half. \nWhile growth is expected to continue, the valuation has increased in recent years. \nThis article details what a “path back to fair value” might look like. \nBack at the end of 2002 and beginning of 2003, shares of McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) were trading around 15 times earnings and indeed went well below this mark for a brief moment of time. Thereafter the company grew per share earnings by 11% annually and its dividend by north of 20% per year. The share price has also increased by about 14% per annum over this period. \nBack then McDonald's was paying out less than 20% of profits as dividends, had sales of $15 billion or so and was making $1.7 billion in profits. This year McDonald's is anticipated to pay out north of 60% of earnings as cash dividends, with sales of $25 billion and profits of around $4.7 billion. \nThat makes \"organic\" growth more difficult in a bunch of ways. For one thing, the much higher payout ratio leaves quite a bit less room for share repurchases and investing in new projects. Obviously these factors will remain, but it gets harder (for better or for worse) if you're committed to sending 60% of profits to investors rather than 20%. \nBeyond that, you have a net profit margin that has expanded from around 11% to an expectation of 20%. That's great for past investors, but seeing that same rate of improvement repeated over the next decade and a half becomes especially challenging. Moreover, you now have a much more saturated market that has to grow from a much larger base. Add on to that valuation which we'll talk about shortly. \nIn a phrase: McDonald's can certainly still grow, but there are many headwinds that work against the business and security performing anything like its past. \nAs I write this shares of McDonald's trade around $118 or thereabouts. The expectation for this year's earnings is near $5.70 per share, equating to a starting valuation of just under 21 times earnings. \nThat's been a bit above average, at least in historical terms. Here I'll show you: \nThe above table shows the average annual P/E ratio for the security during the past decade and a half. As you can see, aside from the last couple of years, something above 20 times earnings has been a bit irregular. As I'll mention later this doesn't mean that shares must come back to the \"typical\" range, but as a prudent view its important to at least consider this notion. \nOver the past two decades the average earnings multiple has been around 19. Since the recession it's been closer to 17 or so. Let's use that number to keep the illustration going. \nThis is just a baseline. In reality it ought to be thought about as a \"range of reasonableness.\" That is, instead of precisely 17.00 you might think about say 16 to 18 times earnings as a starting point or maybe even 15 to 20 as a long-term expectation. You're not going to get this perfect, but the psychological takeaway can nonetheless be instructive. \nFor argument sake, let's suppose that 17 times earnings is your baseline. Now let's think about some potential paths of getting to this number. \nInstant Drop \nIn practice this is highly unlikely, but for illustration it can help you think about a security. Suppose McDonald's earns $5.70 per share this year and trades at 17 times earnings. That equates to a price of ~$97 or a nearly 18% lower price. \nIf investors woke up to this news surely there would be a good deal of turmoil. Indeed, many might even suddenly want to rid themselves of a partnership that just the day before they were more than happy to hold onto at $118. Things like this can mess with your investor psychology. \nIn reality this drop occurring instantly is quite unlikely. Yet the probability of it occurring over say months is probably higher than many imagine. Take Nike (NYSE: NKE ) as an example. To start 2015 shares were exchanging hands around $62.50. Today the number is closer to $50.50 or a 19% decline. \nIt's not that Nike's business is now expected to meet doom and gloom. Indeed, earnings have been growing and are expected to continue growing by a double-digit pace . Instead, the valuation (in my view) became a bit \"extended\" and what has happened this year is well within the realm of possibility. \nThis is a very good investor psychology point. A lot of people see this sort of thing and think \" when will the bleeding stop? \" If you're not prepared for this possibility it can force some undesirable actions. \nSo when thinking about McDonald's valuation as it relates to the possibility of a short-term decline, I'd consider two ideas. One, a \"fair\" price to pay could very well be a wide range - say 15 to 20 times earnings. And even then, what happens in practice could go well beyond this - say 10 to 25 times earnings. (If you see a 5% or 15% higher or lower share price in the short-term, this is not a great triumph or tragedy in my book. It's well within what is to be expected.) All too many investors become fixated with the price without also considering the underlying business claim. \nSecond, a significant price drop in a short amount of time does not preclude an investment from being solid in the future. Indeed, it could actually make that security that much more compelling as the security once more captures business performance or better. \nGradual Glide \nThe second type of \"return to \"fair\" value\" could be over time. So instead of thinking about the possibility of a lower valuation next week or year, you could think about this occurring over say 5 or 10 years. \nAnalysts are presently anticipating intermediate-term earnings growth of nearly 10% for McDonald's. Personally I find that a bit ambitious. For the reasons stated above - higher payout ratio, higher valuation, greater earnings and sales, many more stores and much higher margins - growth is going to be a lot harder to formulate. \nMcDonald's grew per share earnings by 11% annually when it had nearly everything working in its favor. Now all of those components that helped in the past are a lot harder to come by. (Just think about margins improving by the same rate: you'd need to see a 36% net profit margin for this component to add the same type of growth as it did in the past.) \nSo instead of 10% annual growth, let's think about say 7% growth - still rather solid. \nAt that rate, per share earnings would grow to $8 and the dividend might reach $5 after five years. Should shares trade at 17 times earnings you'd be looking at a future price anticipation of about $136. With dividends included the total value might be around $158, good for an annualized return of about 6%. \nThis is what I meant by an above average valuation not precluding a security from providing reasonable returns. The share price appreciation would trail business performance if there were P/E compression, but this does not simultaneously indicate that the share price must decrease. Instead, it can grow at a slower rate and the valuation can drift downward. \nElevated Valuation Remains \nFinally, it's conceivable that the elevated historical valuation remains for any number of reasons. As Warren Buffett would have it, \"if history was all there was to the game, the richest people would be librarians.\" \nUnder this circumstance, you would anticipate share price appreciation to more or less track business results, plus the dividend income. So in continuing with the above example, an anticipated annual gain of 10%-plus instead of 6%. \nThis scenario also has an important psychological corollary. Just because you believe shares \"should\" or \"ought\" to trade at a lower valuation does not mean that it must occur. And it certainly does not mean that it must occur on your schedule. You could wait for years, only to see the price march higher and higher. \nIn short, in historical terms shares of McDonald's are probably a bit above what would be considered a \"fair\" valuation. While the anticipated growth rate is quite robust, personally I would want to bake in some prudence there for the reasons mentioned above. \nYet none of that is exactly the takeaway. Instead, I like to use this example as a primer on investor psychology. There is a wide variance of potential outcomes. If you're a long-term investor how you react to those outcomes is apt to be just as important as which one happens to occur. Disclosure: I am/we are long MCD.

Sign here to inform and ask BMW, Chipotle, Dell, Chase, Nissan, Amazon, and McDonald's to pull their ads from Breitbart News. Breitbart's content has been widely viewed as racist, white nationalist, sexist, anti-Semitic, and anti-LGBT. Steve Bannon, one of the site's founding members, is on record saying that it is \"the platform for the alt-right,\" which has been linked to many extremist views. Kellogg's, Allstate, and Warby Parker have recently decided to stop advertising on the site. We want to ask other companies to recognize the type of content their ads are being placed next to and decide for themselves what to do next. We strongly believe in free speech and recognize Breitbart News' rights to publish whatever type of content they would like. However, it is up to corporate America how they would like to spend their money and what they'd like to support. We are not at all advocating for boycotts. We are simply asking these companies to re-evaluate their media plans. This is not a political issue, either. It is a hate, tolerance, and responsibility issue. Due to the nature of online and programmatic advertising, some of these companies are likely not even be aware their ads are appearing on Breitbart. Please a) sign this petition to make them aware and ask them to pull their ads and b) join the movement on Twitter by following Sleeping Giants and sending us screenshots of companies that are advertising there. Thanks!",

Puskar, File) Posted: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 12:19 pm | Updated: 2:32 pm, Wed Nov 30, 2016. Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies Associated Press | 0 comments \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Discuss Print",

      "text": "Follow us Apparently there’s a secret McDonald’s gold card that gets you unlimited free food for life Ellen Scott for Metro.co.uk Friday 2 Dec 2016 1:47 pm (Picture: Jimmy Kimmel Live/metro.co.uk) This Aussie has completely won at Christmas with this incredible beer tree \nFast food loving sleuths have discovered that – much like the highly prized Nando’s Black Card – there’s a secret McDonald’s gold card, which gets you unlimited free Macca’s for either a year, or for the rest of your life. \n*Pause for freakout* \nRumours of such a card have existed for a while, but recently they’ve come back around with extra evidence. \nRob Lowe, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet all have their own, guaranteeing them either free food for one year or for life. \nBut it’s not just celebs who can get ’em. Here’s Rob Lowe’s card. (Picture: Jimmy Kimmel Live) \nMcDonald’s has also reportedly given gold cards to a 100-year-old McDonalds-loving woman, and a man who abandoned a Big Mac to help rescue three kidnapped women. \nSo you probably can’t get one by just telling McDonald’s that you really, really like McNuggets, sadly. (Picture: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \nWe reached out to McDonald’s to find out more about what we can do to get free fries for the rest of our days, and they told us: ‘The gold card does not exist in the UK and we have no plans of introducing it.’ \n…which is exactly what a brand that DOES have a secret gold card would say, we reckon.

(Tribune news services) \nThe chef created the dish in the 1950s in Taiwan, where he fled in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek after the communists took over, said Chuck Peng, speaking from his home in Taipei. \nIn Taiwan, the chef helped welcome the commander of the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet in the Pacific with a banquet that included the new culinary creation named after a 19th-century Chinese military leader from Peng's native Hunan Province. \nBy the 1970s, he was in New York running a restaurant named after himself near the United Nations on Manhattan's East Side. Kissinger was a frequent guest, said Chuck Peng. \n\"General Tso's Chicken is so famous because of Henry Kissinger, because he was among the first to eat it, and he liked it, so others followed,\" said Peng. \nAmericans quickly took to the deep-fried chunks of floured chicken, smothered in sweetness that usually includes soy sauce, sugar, ginger and other spices. \nThe story of the delicacy is told in a 2014 documentary called \"The Search for General Tso,\" which traces the roots of Chinese food in America through the iconic dish. \nPhoto gallery: Newsmakers and celebrities who died in 2016. \nChuck Peng now runs the family's chain of 10 restaurants in Taiwan, all called Peng's. \nUntil he was hospitalized a few months ago, his son said Peng was a daily presence at their flagship Taipei restaurant which opened after the chef left New York in 1983. The restaurant space on East 44th Street was later occupied by a steakhouse that also is gone. \n\"My father thought other people's cooking was no good,\" his son said, chuckling. \"The way he cooked was different, it was much better.\" \nWhile he was \"very good to other people, he was very hard on his family\"— seven children from three mothers. \"He was very demanding, he didn't want us to make any mistakes.\" \nSome of Peng's hundreds of students plan to attend his funeral on Dec. 15 in Taipei. \nAssociated Press",

      "text": "A consortium led by private equity firm Carlyle ( CG ) and Chinese conglomerate Citic is close to a deal to buy McDonald's ( MCD ) stores in Hong Kong and China for as much as $3 billion, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. An agreement will likely be signed before Christmas, the people said.\nYesterday, the Financial Times reported that TPG Capital and Bain Capital , which were originally involved in the deal for McDonald's stores in China, have dropped out of the race, according to two sources. This has left the team of Carlyle and Citic as the final bidder and the deal could be worth between $2 billion and $3 billion, the FT noted.\nMcDonald's did not immediately reply to a request for comment, and Carlyle declined to comment. Shares of McDonald's were down 0.47% to $117.91, while Carlyle stock was lower by 0.64% to $15.55 in mid-morning trading on Friday.\nThe fast-food chain has more than 2,800 restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea. In March, McDonald's said it would reorganize its operations in Asia and last year the company announced its overall goal to reduce the number of restaurants it owns and operates. McDonald's is looking to place more stores under local franchisees.\n\"The result of this will be to place more restaurants under local ownership, in the hands of local franchisees, with a long-term goal of being 95% franchised. The identification of strategic partners in Asia is consistent with this strategy,\" the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company said earlier this year.",

      "title": "How a Lawsuit Over Hot Coffee Helped Erode the 7th Amendment",
      "text": "Photo by Bruce Marlin In 1992, an elderly woman in New Mexico bought coffee at a McDonald's drive through, spilled it on herself, and successfully sued for nearly $3 million. This story is the poster child for the absurdity of the American legal system. Nearly every late night comic has a bit about suing over hot coffee. In a Seinfeld episode, Kramer burns himself while hiding coffee in his pants as he enters a movie theater. “You’re gonna walk out of [the courtroom] a rich man,” his lawyer tells him confidently as they prepare to sue the coffee shop. The anecdote is also popular with politicians. “We’re a litigious society,” George Bush told supporters while advocating for legislation to curtail frivolous lawsuits. “But there have to be limits.” There’s just one problem: the story is incredibly distorted. The elderly New Mexico resident, Stella Liebeck, was not greedy and her lawsuit was not frivolous. In fact, it’s an example of America’s civil justice system working as intended. The story of Stella Liebeck is one of rumors and assumptions. But it is also, arguably, part of a much larger story: the least publicized death of a constitutional right in the history of the United States—the right to a trial by jury. An Urban Legend After Mrs. Liebeck bought coffee and breakfast at a McDonald's drive-through, her grandson, who was driving, pulled over so she could add cream and sugar. Since his car had no cupholders, she placed the cup between her legs. When she fumbled with the lid and spilled the coffee on her sweatpants, she began to scream. “All I remember is trying to get out of the car,” Liebeck later explained . “I was in terrible pain.” She went into shock, and her grandson rushed her to the emergency room, where she underwent surgery and received skin grafts. She had third degree burns on 6% of her body; the pictures of her injuries are shocking. McDonald's served Mrs. Liebeck coffee at 180-190 degrees fahrenheit. According to her surgeon , “Any hot liquid, if it’s in the range of 180 degrees or hotter, if it’s in contact with your skin for more than just a few seconds… if you’re lucky it will produce second degree burns. If you’re not as lucky, you will get 3rd degree or full thickness burns requiring skin grafts and surgery.” Liebeck spent a week in the hospital, amassing hospital bills of $10,000. Still, Liebeck did not sue. Her family wrote a letter to McDonald's asking the company to pay her hospital bills and check whether its coffee machine was faulty. McDonald's rebuffed them, offering $800, so they found a lawyer. But even the outcome of the lawsuit—a $2.9 million verdict that people saw as Liebeck hitting the jackpot—was a fiction. During the course of the trial, McDonald's employees said that serving coffee at 180-190 degrees was standard policy. A McDonald's executive described it as an “industry standard” that responded to customers wishes for coffee that would still be hot after a car ride home. He also said that the 700 complaints McDonald's had received about the coffee causing burns did not concern him. It was not significant given the size of the McDonald's customer base. His response may have seemed reasonable given the huge scale of McDonald's. But to a jury looking at a grandmother dealing with terrible injuries—Liebeck required two years of additional medical attention that greatly increased her medical bills—it seemed callous. The jury decided to award Liebeck $200,000, which was less than the $300,000 recommended by a mediator in a settlement that McDonald's rejected before trial. The jury, however, decided Liebeck was 20% at fault since she spilled the coffee, so they gave her $160,000. In addition, they awarded her around $2.7 million (two days of McDonald's coffee revenue) in punitive damages. In civil cases, since there are no criminal sentences, punitive damages exist to ensure companies change their behavior. The judge reduced the punitive damages to $480,000, for a total of $640,000. McDonalds appealed and later settled out of court for an undisclosed amount believed to be between $400,000 and $600,000. But the media only noticed the initial multimillion dollar figure. Major news broadcasts and newspapers picked up the story from local New Mexico press, and then reporters all over the world repeated the story. But it was like a giant game of telephone, with the nuance never making it beyond local press. Retro Report describes how the word count went from 700 words in local press, to 349 in the first Associated Press story, to “as few as 48” even in major papers. As Liebeck’s lawyer relates, “‘Woman, coffee, millions’ sounds like a rip off, not the consequence of a thoughtful trial.” Mythbusters: Frivolous Lawsuits In a Reddit conversation that inspired this article, a user with a stated background as an attorney who defends medium and small businesses against liability suits described Liebeck’s case: Everybody now thinks it's easy as hell to sue and get big money. Lots of people think the court system and our laws are all fucked up… People sue over trivial stuff all the time hoping to cash in. Most of the time, they get their case dismissed or they get a nominal settlement after they've invested tons of time and effort in their case and… just want out of the case already. Susan Saladoff, a lawyer who made a documentary about the McDonald's coffee case called Hot Coffee , has called frivolous lawsuits a myth. In an appearance on the \"Colbert Report\" , she described all the checks that exist to prevent greedy people from suing for unreasonable amounts of money: judges can throw out frivolous cases and fine people for wasting the court’s resources, a jury deliberates on the right amount of damages to award, judges can reduce the compensation given, and defendants can appeal a ruling. Saladoff has represented clients in liability lawsuits, so she is not an objective observer. But we see some of these restraints at work in the McDonald's case. A jury deliberated and decided on an amount that was close to what a professional mediator had suggested, and the judge reduced the amount awarded. A different jury and judge could have found differently. (Coffee is often served commercially at temperatures approaching or equal to that served to Stella Liebeck, so finding Liebeck 80% or 100% responsible may have been reasonable.) But the result was not absurd. As designated in the constitution, a jury made the decision. When the result of a lawsuit make headlines, it is usually because of a multimillion dollar verdict. Those verdicts come from punitive damages, which are only awarded when a company seems unwilling to change its behavior. In this way, individual court cases can serve the public interest. Despite the rhetoric of businesses under attack by greedy Americans, the available evidence contradicts the perception of a frivolous lawsuit epidemic. As Priceonomics reported previously , rather than exploding, the number of tort (injury) cases in America decreased 25% from 1999 to 2008 and fell 9% in the nineties. Only five percent of civil cases result in punitive damages—for an average $50,000 to $60,000, not millions. Today, the full story of the McDonald's coffee case has gone viral. A quick Google search will reveal many media outlets that ran stories explaining that the verdict was justified. Recently, Upworthy posted a video produced for the New York Times about Liebeck’s story. That went viral too. The reason revealing the truth of Liebeck’s case finds such an interested audience is that the misinterpretation of Liebeck as a greedy woman taking advantage of a broken legal system is accepted as fact. And that has a lot to do with how it was used as a public relations prop by special interests. “Exhibit A” “The lady goes through a fast food restaurant, puts coffee in her lap, burns her legs, and sues and gets a big settlement. That in of itself is enough to tell you why we need to have tort reform.” ~ John Kasich , Governor of Ohio (then Member of the House) Tort law refers to lawsuits like the McDonald's case. In the mid 1990s, Republicans made a push for tort reform : reducing the risk of frivolous lawsuits through legislation that capped the damages that can be awarded in lawsuits. As shown in the above quote cited by Retro Report , the distorted version of Stella Liebeck’s case became “exhibit A” in the case for tort reform. The documentary Hot Coffee delves into the details of the push for tort reform. It’s a playbook that will be familiar to those following special interest lobbying. In broad strokes, the documentary charges that major corporations donated money to the US Chamber of Commerce, and individuals like Karl Rove directed that money to the election campaigns of politicians willing to support tort reform. Republicans enjoyed the backing of America’s largest corporations while getting to hammer opponents on supporting greedy parasites like Stella Liebeck. In 1995, Bill Clinton vetoed a tort reform bill that would have reduced the impact of lawsuits through caps on damages. Businesses then took tort reform to the state level, funding state political races and placing ads under the the names of associations that seemed like a group of concerned citizens. The ads hammered home the message of frivolous lawsuits, often citing the McDonalds case. Many states passed tort reform bills. When judges began overruling tort reform—finding that politicians placing caps on lawsuit damages contradicted the 7th Amendment’s guarantee to a trial by a jury—Rove and co. used the same strategy to influence campaigns for state supreme court seats. Susan Saladoff, a former trial lawyer and the producer and director of the Hot Coffee documentary, says that “everyone thinks a lawsuit is frivolous, until it’s your own.” A cap on damages of one or two million dollars seems reasonable in the abstract. But she insists that we let juries and judges decide because, in practice, a cap can be unjustly limiting. Hot Coffee features the example of Lisa and Mike Gourley, a couple in Nebraska who were once happily ignorant of the cap on damages (currently $1.75 million ) passed as part of the state’s tort reforms. When Lisa noticed less kicking from her twins one day during her pregnancy, she visited a doctor who listened to their heartbeats and reassured her that everything was fine. After noticing less and less activity from the twins, Lisa and her husband returned to the hospital. A different doctor performed an ultrasound, then ordered an emergency cesarean section. One of the twins came out healthy; the other, Colin, suffered extensive brain damage due to a lack of blood flow and oxygen depletion. Confused and given no information from the hospital, the Gourleys ultimately landed in court. They learned that the first doctor had twice been successfully sued for malpractice, and that the doctor should have ordered an ultrasound, which would have discovered the problem. Mike Gourley states in the documentary that they were told $6 million would pay for a lifetime of care for Colin, who needed serious therapy, a lifetime of care, and would never be able to work. A jury awarded $5.6 million, but due to a cap, they received only $1.25 million. To Saladoff and the opponents of tort reform she interviews, this is the tragedy of cases like Liebeck: They are used to convince people that businesses need protection from greedy lawsuits, when really tort reform protects businesses from paying for their mistakes. An Outsourced Legal System The cry of frivolous lawsuits, as noted in Hot Coffee , has also motivated the push for arbitration contracts—a private alternative to a court case. We have examined private arbitrations at length before. So we refer readers interested in several thousand words about legal history to our previous article . In brief, businesses have embraced arbitration as a way to avoid courtrooms. If companies in a legal dispute agree to it, they can choose arbitration as an alternative to a trial. They hire someone—often a retired judge who works for a private arbitration firm—to hear the merits of a case and make a decision that is enforceable in court. Without the need to wait months for a court date or hear lawyers argue endlessly about proper legal procedure, arbitration promises a swift and cheap resolution to legal disputes. Companies can also hire arbitrators with requisite expertise. When Apple and Samsung sued each other, they could have benefitted from arbitration by arguing their case before a judge familiar with patent law and engineering issues—instead of a jury of laypeople. American judges and lawyers have complained about the slow-moving, overburdened American court system since the early 1900s. Judges began advocating for alternative dispute resolutions, which they saw as a way to clear judicial backlogs. By 1985, Chief Justice Warren Burger had embraced arbitrations. Today, arbitration clauses are ubiquitous—and no longer just for companies wrangling over lawsuits. Watchdog group Public Citizen found that roughly 75% of companies in industries like banking and home building use them in all their contracts. It is generally acknowledged that almost every car dealership uses binding arbitration clauses when they sell cars. In the workforce, an estimated 20% of nonunion contracts include mandatory arbitration clauses. (It's in this author's contract too.) This is a problem. The legal basis for outsourcing legal proceedings is a 1925 law passed by Congress specifying arbitration as an option for “merchants” who agree to a private alternative. But the examples cited above are more secret coercion than informed choice. Most people don’t realize they give up the right to sue when they buy a car. Even if they did, they have no alternative given that every dealership requires that people agree to binding arbitration. Similarly, Mother Jones covered the story of the Baptist Health System's Princeton Medical Center in Birmingham, Alabama. One day, all the low level workers were gathered for a meeting about a new arbitration process: “Nurses, housekeepers, and lab techs crammed into a conference room where hospital administrators presented a form and told them to sign. Signing meant agreeing to submit any future employment-related complaints to an arbitrator hired by the hospital and waiving the right to sue in court. Refusing to sign meant they'd be fired.” If you are ever involved in arbitration, you should be skeptical that you'll get a fair hearing. Arbitrators are former judges or lawyers hired by large arbitration firms, and arbitration agreements generally include a clause allowing the company (and not the worker/customer/user) to choose an arbitrator. This means that arbitration firms have an incentive to side with the company every time in order to get repeat business. A number of credit card companies send customer disputes to arbitration firms already filled out with a decision in the credit card companies favor. All the arbitrator needs to do is sign and collect his or her paycheck. Like with tort reform, critics argue that this violates citizens’ 7th amendment right to a trial by jury, since workers and consumers have not truly chosen arbitration as an alternative. But the practice persists. Everyday, Americans unknowingly sign away their right to a trial. In 2000, car dealers successfully lobbied Congress to ban car makers from including mandatory arbitration clauses. It would “unilaterally deny small business automobile and truck dealers rights under state laws,\" they told Congress, \"that are designed to bring equity to the relationship between manufacturers and dealers.\" This is almost pure hypocrisy: lobbying for protection from a policy that they force onto every one of their customers. The Heroic Lawsuit? “When somebody goes to court, they’re doing something extraordinary that is hidden. To go to court and to sue is not a simple procedure. You have to go through a lot of trouble. It affects your life. You’re going to be attacked in all sorts of ways. Going to court to gain justice is heroic. That idea has to be out there. When you ‘win a case,’ you win it for other people as well as gaining justice for yourself.” ~Professor George Lakoff in Hot Coffee We encourage readers to watch the Hot Coffee documentary—and to do so with the knowledge that its producer, as a trial lawyer, is not an objective outsider. It’s reasonable to believe that small businesses and hospitals are burdened by unnecessary lawsuits. The medical community is full of debate about malpractice lawsuits, and Hot Coffee focuses on where its argument is strongest. To take just one example, a rebuttal in Forbes points out that the caps on damages that hurt the Gourley family exist in only two states, and that most tort reform focuses on vague and easily inflated “pain and suffering” damages. Other reasonable tort reform aims to make sure that lawyers can’t make tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees over a trial that awards a few hundred dollar in damages—a problem evident in New York City. The city faces some 1,500 federal lawsuits (and more in state courts), often over police conduct, that it generally settles quickly rather than bother with a court case. Stating that many weak cases were filed due to NYC’s settlement policy, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in 2011, directed the city to begin fighting more cases in court to “discourage lawyers from reflexively suing the city.” The Bloomberg Administration’s actions reflected the complaints of businesses that claim that too many people reflexively sue in hopes of winning easy money. (Although it’s worth asking whether all the PR about frivolous lawsuits helps create the illusion of easy money that leads people to sue.) But it also shows how suing for damages can be a public service, holding organizations accountable. When the Times reported on New York City beginning to fight more lawsuits in court, it reported on a case involving a man thrown to the ground and arrested after flashing a peace sign to his cousin, who was being driven in a police cruiser. (The police said he made a shooting gesture.) The man sued the city, and he may have been motivated by the $125,000 settlement offer his lawyers made to the city. (Once in court, his lawyers suggested $17,000 to a jury.) The city fought the lawsuit, and a jury awarded the man $600. “I can’t imagine the client was happy about receiving $600,” a city lawyer told The Times . That may be true. Then again, the jury did find that the police mistreated the client. After facing abuse by the police, the man could have stayed quiet. The man’s lawsuit, however, made the police acknowledge an abuse of their authority, and it took substantial time and effort to achieve. That is valuable, regardless of whether the man's motivation was money, accountability, or both. The question of whether Americans are too litigious is more complicated than a simple reading of any single case. But the assumption that Americans constantly sue for absurd reasons and receive millions of dollars warps the debate, and it has allowed the potentially dangerous (and unconstitutional) embrace of tort reform and mandatory arbitration to march forward without a clear understanding of the stakes. If you need one more reason to regard business complaints about the burden of lawsuits with a healthy dose of skepticism, consider this: We’ve cited how the number of tort cases decreased in the nineties and 2000s; meanwhile, from 1998 to 2008, the number of contract disputes between companies increased 63% . Businesses complaining about greedy Americans being overly litigious may want to look in a mirror.

      "text": "Just when protesters started ramping up their efforts to fight for $15/hour minimum wage (protests occurring in 340 cities now), McDonald's said, \"Bam!\" Well, kinda.\nThey unveiled plans to install “self-service kiosks” where customers could place their order essentially on digital cash registers. Some kiosks have already been implemented in more than 500 restaurants in Southern California, Florida, New York City and overseas locations, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nHere's the story:\nSelf-service kiosks? But now who will mess up my order? Who will put apple slices in my bag when I clearly ordered fries? Or a fish sandwich instead of a Quarter-Pounder? Eh, who am I kidding? I haven't eaten at McDonald's since they kicked me out of the McPlayground.\nI was born in Marianna, Florida and raised in Dothan, Alabama. My grandfather, Farley Taylor had a nationally-syndicated radio show called \"The Old Taylor Made Opry\". So I fell in love with classic country music and the magic of radio at a very young age.\nFrom as early as age 8, I would sit in my room with my turntable and listen intently to my records. I intently studied the music of George Jones, Hank Williams Sr. and Jr., Merle Haggard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Waylon, and Jimmie Rodgers. That love of country music has continued all the way down to today, and my early musical influences can be heard in my own musical style.\nYou can hear me every weekday afternoon from 3-7pm. I'm also heavily involved in serving our community, fundraising for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, serving on the board for the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Big Bend, and serving on the Executive Events Committee for the American Cancer Society.\nI'm also a musician, singer, songwriter, and I have an acoustic string band called Old Soul Revival that plays classic country and bluegrass.",

      "text": "McDonald’s Gilroy Garlic Fries by Kirbie \nEarlier this year, McDonald’s debuted Gilroy Garlic Fries to the Bay Area California. I was definitely curious and when I visited home a few months ago, I made sure to try them out. \nThe garlic fries use garlic from Gilroy, a city in Northern California that is most known for its garlic crop. They even hold a garlic festival every year. Since Gilroy is in Northern California, this menu item is limited to the Bay Area. My brother took me to his favorite McDonald’s location and we ordered the fries. The fries are mixed with Gilroy garlic, olive oil, parmesan cheese and parsley. I really enjoyed these. They were crunchy, garlicky and cheesy. I’ve always liked McDonald’s fries, but this preparation takes them to a whole new level and I barely recognized these as McDonald’s french fries. \nI had a friend who told me they tried the fries and found them oily, but we didn’t have that issue at the McDonald’s location we went to. We liked these so much that during Thanksgiving weekend, I asked to get them several times. I just couldn’t get enough! \nI hope that they expand this across California. If you’re in the Bay Area, I think they are worth checking out. \nYou can find out the stores that carry them here .",

      "text": "share The McDonald’s Tip-Off Classic at Zane Trace opened with two SVC teams facing uphill battles Friday. Both Westfall and Zane Trace got off to slow starts and dropped their games by 30 point margins. BISHOP READY 72, WESTFALL 42 The Westfall Mustangs fell behind early and had difficulty matching Bishop Ready’s length. The Knights created second and third chance opportunities around the basket, outrebounding Westfall 34-18. Dominck Lovini had his way in the paint tallying a game high 27 points. The Mustangs, were playing without Corey Wyman who may not be able to play until tournament season this spring. Austin Nunemaker paced the ZT with 13 points and Matt Jude had 10. Westfall plays at Logan Elm Saturday. LOGAN ELM 80, ZANE TRACE 50 The second game nearly mirrored the first. Logan Elm attacked the basket with regularity and jumped out to a 25-12 lead before the second period. Ridge Young was the difference with a 36-point effort for the Braves. The Pioneers managed to sink just 2 of 13 shots from beyond the arc. Young led all scorers and was one of only two Braves plyers in double figures. Kamry Wright added 11. The Tip-Off Continues Saturday Berne Union and Huntington Girls teams will get the day started Saturday at 10:15am. The Boys teams for the respective school will meet at noon. Then Amanda Clearcreek faces Adena at 1:45pm. Sheridan and Federal Hocking meet at 3:30pm followed by South Point faces Circleville at 5:15pm. Zane Trace Girls and Boys wrap up the day of basketball with a doubleheader featuring New Hope Christian Academy.",

(Picture: Nelson Ching/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \nAnd this week, we’ve had it confirmed that we’re not imagining things and seeing patterns in our junk food that don’t exist. \nThis week, a post from 2012 resurfaced on the internet in which McDonald’s Canada answered a question about the McNuggets’ shape – thus not only confirming that the four shapes are indeed a thing, but also explaining why they’re a thing. \nFirst off, the shapes themselves. McDonald’s explains that the nuggets come in four shapes and four shapes only: the ball, the boot, the bow-tie, and the bell. (Picture: Carlos Osorio/Toronto Star via Getty Images) \nAs to why there are only these four shapes, McDonald’s says that having four shapes is ‘the perfect equilibrium of dipability and fun.’ \n‘Three would have been too few,’ they write. ‘Five would’ve been, like, wacky.

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Tags",

      "text": "Not long ago, one of our prize chickens had just hatched some chicks and was strolling around the yard with the little ones in tow. Out of nowhere, a hawk descended from the sky and grabbed a chick, as momma hen squawked hysterically. In a few moments, we went from a scene from Norman Rockwell to one with Norman Bates .\nRELATED ARTICLES Can Egg Producers Recover from November's Great Fall? Baylen Linnekin | 12.03.16 \nMassachusetts Voters Could Have Egg on Their Faces Baylen Linnekin | 7.23.16 \nCop Shoots Barely Injured Cat He Says Was a Threat Ed Krayewski | 5.04.16 \nMORE ARTICLES BY Steven Greenhut Police Reform Spotlight Shines on the Local Level 12.02.16 12:01 am \nCalPERS Staff Nudges Board To Consider Lower Return Rates 11.25.16 12:01 am \nBail System Is Next Target of California Criminal Justice Reform Efforts 11.18.16 12:01 am \nAnimal Rights Free Markets The life of most animals, with our housecats possibly excepted, is \"nasty, brutish and short,\" to quote 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes (who was talking about mankind). My perspective on animal issues has changed considerably after moving to a few acres in the country and watching my kids raise their animals. It's often not a pretty sight.\nLast month, my wife came into the house bawling after coyotes had torn apart one of our baby Nubian goats. I bought two Great Pyrenees to protect the goats, which went well until the dogs broke into the hen house. Don't even ask. We named our newest turkey Darwin because he was the only one of 22 to survive to adolescence.\nYet the harshness of the natural world doesn't alleviate our nature, as human beings, to ponder how we treat animals. Americans give generously to animal-welfare causes and often back legislation meant to reduce animal suffering. A notable example is Proposition 2 , which was approved overwhelmingly by California voters in 2008 and went into effect last January.\nThe measure requires our state's farmers provide more \"elbow\" room for hens, veal calves and many pigs . There's little pork and veal production in California and meat chickens already are mostly cage free, so it mainly changes egg farms. A follow-up law applied the same standards to any eggs sold in California. The measure has survived legal challenges.\nSeveral months after implementation, the price of eggs has soared . Part of that is the result of avian flu that killed millions of birds, but California egg prices are now far above the national average. Some studies predict a small price difference after the market settles down, but there's no question these laws imposed enormous costs on egg farmers, who had to revamp their operations.\nThe really big recent news is the fast-food chain McDonald's announced it will only buy eggs from cage-free farms by 2020 . \"It will be increasingly hard to ignore a buyer of 2 billion eggs, especially given that McDonald's joined a flock of companies that already made similar supply-line switches,\" according to the Los Angeles Times .\nGovernment regulations are not cost free , and they often have unintended consequences. The marketplace usually does a better job sorting out difficult issues than government bean (or egg) counters, but animal suffering is a conundrum.\nMany economists argue government's proper role is to correct instances of \"market failure.\" That's when the marketplace doesn't act efficiently, such as in a monopoly situation. (The latter almost always is the result of some government favor or intervention, but that's a discussion for another day.)\nA similar concept comes into play regarding animals, as the market fails to factor the cost of animal suffering when it's more cost-effective to cram them into tiny cages. That perception may explain why so many Californians voted for Proposition 2. They couldn't think of another way to keep these creatures from spending their short lives in such an unpleasant situation.\nThen again, the decision by McDonald's, Burger King and other restaurants to adjust their purchasing shows how public attitudes can drive change. They can often do so more thoroughly than regulators. For instance, McDonald's wants cage-free eggs, whereas California's laws only require bigger cages. The new policy may be as good for business as it is for the hens.\nBy the way, it's mainly in wealthy countries , where most everyone is well fed, that people have enough time and money to worry about the plight of chickens.\nThose who argue that animals have \"rights\" are off the mark in a world of goat-killing coyotes . But there's nothing wrong with making confined animals' lives less brutish. The latest news from McDonald's reminds those who care about these creatures that they might want to spend less time lobbying for new laws and more time thinking about such voluntary solutions.\nPhoto Credit: vinctography/flickr",

      "title": "BREAKING: Texas Works On Getting Rid of Concealed Carry Fees",
      "text": "Staff Freak Out After Quiet Man Walks Into McDonald’s, Slips Cashier $100 Bill \nPerhaps those prohibitive fees will soon become something of the past. \nTexas legislature doesn’t convene until mid-January, but a form already presented by Patrick showed that all language referring to citizens paying a fee to obtain a license was removed. \nBedford Republican State Rep. Jonathan Stickland supported the idea.   \n“We do not believe that citizens in Texas should have to pay for the right to defend themselves,” Stickland told KDFW . \nThe National Rifle Association Institute of Legislative Action applauded the bill, stating on its website , “No hard-working, law-abiding Texan should be priced out of the ability to exercise his or her right to self-defense.” \nCitizens would still be required to undergo background checks as well as proper training before becoming certified, KFDA reported. \nSB 16 is definitely good news for Texans. If passed, it would help allow all citizens, regardless of income level, equal access to personal protection. The Second Amendment right to bear arms is one of our most basic freedoms , and it should be affordable for all who wish to exercise that right.  ",

      "text": "Editors' pick: Originally published Nov. 29.\nAmerican fast-food giant McDonald's ( MCD ) has fired another shot in the great burger battle.\nFacing increasing competition in the patty sphere, as well as attempting to combat the negative effects of a restaurant slowdown, the company has said that it is testing an innovation to its menu: fresh beef. Will this impress investors ?\nMcDonald's has long depended on a network of suppliers that provides frozen beef burger patties to its restaurants. However, the chain is testing fresh, never-frozen patties in 75 Oklahoma locations, after recently conducting the tests in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, as well.\nThe restaurant chain, led by relatively new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has undertaken an initiative to revamp its image amid trouble in the overall restaurant sector.\nMany analysts have said that the industry is on the cusp of or even in a \" restaurant recession ,\" fueled by a heady brew of election year malaise, fierce competition from new restaurant chains and low prices for groceries in supermarkets.\nSince Easterbrook took the reins of the company in March 2015, he has initiated a series of changes to the restaurant chain and its menu in an effort to revitalize both the business and its stock .\nOn the operations side, this has involved phasing in table service, as well as rolling out mobile application ordering, something that Starbucks has mastered.\nStarbucks is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "ARAB NEWS |   \nJEDDAH: McDonald’s Corporation has announced it has selected Lionhorn as the Developmental Licensee (DL) for its Malaysia and Singapore markets. Lionhorn is led by Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who bring 20 years of experience as the DL for the nearly 100 McDonald’s restaurants in the Western and Southern regions of Saudi Arabia.“This transaction marks another milestone in our company’s ongoing efforts to identify strategic partners who share our values and vision to accelerate our growth and scale across diverse markets, drive innovation and place us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,” McDonald’s President and CEO Steve Easterbrook was quoted as saying in a press release.The new DL assumed ownership of the McDonald’s business in Malaysia and Singapore on Dec. 1. It includes 390 restaurants, more than 80 percent of which were company-owned. Under the DL structure, McDonald’s transferred its ownership interest in McDonald’s Malaysia and Singapore and granted a license to the DL to run McDonald’s restaurant operations in these markets. The DL partner will provide the capital necessary to support and grow the business and will pay an initial franchise fee and an ongoing royalty to McDonald’s.“We are pleased to welcome Fahd as the Developmental Licensee for our business in Malaysia and Singapore,” said Simone Hoyle, head of McDonald’s Asia Foundational Markets. “Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza’s experience in running great restaurants will create brand excitement for our customers and new opportunities for our people as these markets continue to grow and develop.”Local operating partners Azmir Jaafar and Kenneth Chan will lead the day-to-day management of the Malaysia and Singapore markets. They have previously held senior leadership positions at McDonald’s and together possess over 40 years of experience.This announcement follows a rigorous evaluation and selection process over the past year. As part of its turnaround plan announced in May of 2015, McDonald’s committed to refranchising 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018 with the long-term goal of becoming 95 percent franchised. With this transaction, McDonald’s has now refranchised around 1,300 restaurants. Facebook",

      "text": "Labour supply agency revealed to have withheld salaries, underpaid wages, and confiscated passports of workers By Beh Lih Yi\nKUALA LUMPUR, Dec 1 Fast food giant McDonald's said it has dropped a labour supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions.\nAn investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald's was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 U.S. cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports.\nThe report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald's restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur.\nMcDonald's said it has ended its contract with the agency, Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a \"top priority\", with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation.\n\"Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,\" spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement.\n\"As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.\"\nThere was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald's. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon.\nChristianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labour agency.\n\"Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,\" he said.\nHuman Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald's in Malaysia for \"a number of years\", Christianson added.\nHe said the company's suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker's rights.\nMcDonald's hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 percent are foreign workers.\nMalaysia, which is Southeast Asia's third-largest economy, relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses.\nAegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labour exploitation happens \"almost everyday\" among multinational firms in the country.\nShe urged McDonald's to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery.\n\"They can't run away because they are the main company,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"No matter if you're in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.\" (Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; property rights http://news.trust.org)",

      "text": "Fletcher, McDonald on target as CC down STETHS to claim daCosta Cup \nBY PAUL A REID Observer writer \nSunday, December 04, 2016 Tweet \nCATHERINE HALL, St James — Cornwall College extended their record number of liens on the Inter-secondary Schools Sports Association (ISSA)/FLOW daCosta Cup to 12 after dethroning holders St Elizabeth Technical High School (STETHS) 2-1 in the final played at the Montego Bay Sports Complex last night. \nSecond-half goals from Jourdaine Fletcher, his 29th of the daCosta Cup season and 36th overall, and substitute Shavon McDonald helped the Dr Dean Weatherly-coached team snap their 15-year drought, since their last success in 2001, in front of a large crowd of predominantly red and gold clad Cornwall College fans. \nDemar James pulled one back for STETHS from a free kick deep into added time as they lost in their second final this season having lost to Lennon High in the Ben Francis knockout two weeks ago. \nAfter a slow start, Cornwall College dominated the second half as Fletcher, Peter-Lee Vassell and Howard Dent took the game to the STETHS defence, who were on their heels the entire time. \n\n’s loss in the FLOW Super Cup final, their coach Dr Dean Weatherly told the \nafterwards. \nIt’s a great feeling after a long, hard season, but it was worth it,” said Dr Weatherly, who was winning his fourth daCosta Cup title, adding to the those won in 1995, 2000 and 2001. \nI am feeling elated right now. The hard work has paid off, and there is not much more I can say,” he added. \nHe admitted that his team started tentatively but grew in confidence as the game went on. “We got more comfortable as the game went on, and they played to the instructions we gave them,” he said. “At half time we changed the formation and attacked the wing backs more, and that was what brought the goals.” \nRenorio Downswell, the STETHS assistant coach, said his team did not attack as they had hoped in the second half and allowed Cornwall College to take over. \n“In the second half we did not play the attacking game; we sat back and allowed Cornwall to come at us and we suffered as a consequence,” Downswell said. \nHe said his team had played well in the first half and “this was a good final; both teams played well, but Cornwall was given the space and they took advantage”. \nIn front of a jam-packed grand stand it was the more experienced STETHS team, with most players in their third-straight final, that took the initiative against a nervous-looking Cornwall College team, but goalkeeper Jamario Hines and the defence were equal to the task and kept the STETHS team at bay. \nCornwall College got into their own late in the first half and came close to scoring, but Kenroy Wallace in the STETHS goal blocked one shot in the 37th minute from Vassell, and Fletcher kicked just wide a few minutes later. \nAfter a few good chances by STEHS early in the second half it was all Cornwall College, as they took over the game and it was only a matter of time before the goal came. \nThey thought they had taken the lead in the 67th minute when Vassell powered home the ball from midway the 18-yard box, but the goal was disallowed for an infringement. \nFletcher, who had endured three games without scoring, finally broke lose when Vassell skipped around two defenders and served it up to him on a platter just outside the six-yard box and he struck it past Wallace — the crowd erupted. \nCornwall College missed the chance to put the game away in the 80th minute when Vassell again crossed the ball from the right side, but the ball eluded the onrushing Fletcher. \nMcDonald, who replaced Emmanuel Campbell in the 75th minute, put the game out of the reach of STETHS in the 91st minute when he rifled home a loose ball from about 20 yards out and the Cornwall College players started their celebrations. \nSTETHS got on the score sheet in the 95th minute when a STETHS player was fouled just on the edge of the box and James buried the free kick past a flat-footed Hines in the final play of the game.

      "text": "Fletcher, McDonald on target as CC down STETHS to claim daCosta Cup \nBY PAUL A REID Observer writer \n  \nCATHERINE HALL, St James — Cornwall College extended their record number of liens on the Inter-secondary Schools Sports Association (ISSA)/FLOW daCosta Cup to 12 after dethroning holders St Elizabeth Technical High School (STETHS) 2-1 in the final played at the Montego Bay Sports Complex last night. \nSecond-half goals from Jourdaine Fletcher, his 29th of the daCosta Cup season and 36th overall, and substitute Shavon McDonald helped the Dr Dean Weatherly-coached team snap their 15-year drought, since their last success in 2001, in front of a large crowd of predominantly red and gold clad Cornwall College fans. \nDemar James pulled one back for STETHS from a free kick deep into added time as they lost in their second final this season having lost to Lennon High in the Ben Francis knockout two weeks ago. \nAfter a slow start, Cornwall College dominated the second half as Fletcher, Peter-Lee Vassell and Howard Dent took the game to the STETHS defence, who were on their heels the entire time. \nThe victory made up for Cornwall College’s loss in the FLOW Super Cup final, their coach Dr Dean Weatherly told the \nJamaica Observer afterwards. \n“It’s a great feeling after a long, hard season, but it was worth it,” said Dr Weatherly, who was winning his fourth daCosta Cup title, adding to the those won in 1995, 2000 and 2001. \n“I am feeling elated right now. The hard work has paid off, and there is not much more I can say,” he added. \nHe admitted that his team started tentatively but grew in confidence as the game went on. “We got more comfortable as the game went on, and they played to the instructions we gave them,” he said. “At half time we changed the formation and attacked the wing backs more, and that was what brought the goals.” \nRenorio Downswell, the STETHS assistant coach, said his team did not attack as they had hoped in the second half and allowed Cornwall College to take over. \n“In the second half we did not play the attacking game; we sat back and allowed Cornwall to come at us and we suffered as a consequence,” Downswell said. \nHe said his team had played well in the first half and “this was a good final; both teams played well, but Cornwall was given the space and they took advantage”. \nIn front of a jam-packed grand stand it was the more experienced STETHS team, with most players in their third-straight final, that took the initiative against a nervous-looking Cornwall College team, but goalkeeper Jamario Hines and the defence were equal to the task and kept the STETHS team at bay. \nCornwall College got into their own late in the first half and came close to scoring, but Kenroy Wallace in the STETHS goal blocked one shot in the 37th minute from Vassell, and Fletcher kicked just wide a few minutes later. \nAfter a few good chances by STEHS early in the second half it was all Cornwall College, as they took over the game and it was only a matter of time before the goal came. \nThey thought they had taken the lead in the 67th minute when Vassell powered home the ball from midway the 18-yard box, but the goal was disallowed for an infringement. \nFletcher, who had endured three games without scoring, finally broke lose when Vassell skipped around two defenders and served it up to him on a platter just outside the six-yard box and he struck it past Wallace — the crowd erupted. \nCornwall College missed the chance to put the game away in the 80th minute when Vassell again crossed the ball from the right side, but the ball eluded the onrushing Fletcher. \nMcDonald, who replaced Emmanuel Campbell in the 75th minute, put the game out of the reach of STETHS in the 91st minute when he rifled home a loose ball from about 20 yards out and the Cornwall College players started their celebrations. \nSTETHS got on the score sheet in the 95th minute when a STETHS player was fouled just on the edge of the box and James buried the free kick past a flat-footed Hines in the final play of the game.

Just ask Rob Lowe, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, who all reportedly have card a \"McGold Card\" that gets them unlimited free food at their local Micky D's.\nLowe showed off his on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" last year, noting how he got it from a friend. As it notes on the card, his buddy is McDonald's franchisee David Peterson, whose father, Herb, invented the Egg McMuffin in 1972 at one of his California McDonald's locations, according to The New York Times .\nThe card Lowe flashed says that it's good for unlimited food for a year, and only at locations in Santa Barbara and Goleta, California. That's because it was issued by Peterson and not the McDonald's corporation. It's up to the franchise owner to decide if the card is good for a limited amount of time or for life.\n© Jimmy Kimmel Live Peterson also gave a gold card to local Santa Barbara philanthropist Larry Crandell for his 90th birthday in 2013, entitling the man known as \"Mr. Santa Barbara\" to free food for life, according to SantaBarbara.com . Crandell died in August at 93.\nBuffett showed off his McGold Card in a 2007 interview with CNBC while also mentioning that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has one that is accepted at locations across the world.\nRELATED: McDonald's Chicken McNuggets come in 4 shapes — and they have names!\nBuffett's card is only good at locations in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska.\n\"So that's why the Buffett family has Christmas dinner at McDonald's,'' Buffett joked.\nRELATED: McDonald's Chicken McGriddle, the syrup-infused chicken sandwich you never knew you needed\nAnother noted figure who had one was George Romney, the father of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The younger Romney mentioned on the campaign trail that his father had a certificate for free McDonald's for life that was signed by founder Ray Kroc, according to The Wall Street Journal. The elder Romney ate at McDonald's almost every day, according to Mitt.\nYou don't have to be a celebrity to get one, either. Charles Ramsey, who helped rescue three women kidnapped in Cleveland by Ariel Castro, was given free McDonald's for a year by the company and unlimited burgers for life by 14 local restaurants in 2013, according to CNN .\nFollow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Jeremy Hazan · December 2, 2016 For More Stories Like These \nNo matter where you live, chances are there is a McDonald’s nearby. But if you’re vegan, having a McDonald’s on every corner doesn’t really help at all. \nSo we started thinking that there must be at least a few things vegans can eat McDonald’s. \nAfter all , you might be stuck there for a kid’s birthday party, or perhaps you’re starving and there’s nothing else nearby. \nWhatever the reason, you’ll be glad to know there are vegan options at McDonald’s. \n(We have to point out that McDonald’s does not promote any of their menu items as vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free. But we checked out a few vegan blogs, and it turns out there are more McVegan options than we thought.) Fries A video posted by McDonald's (@mcdonalds) on Jul 13, 2016 at 9:57am PDT \nFirst, let me start with the fries, just to get that out of the way. When we started this article, we were convinced the fries might be the only vegan option on the menu. However vegan websites claim they aren’t, because they contain “natural beef flavor”. \nBut according to McDonald’s nutritional information , the fries no longer contain “natural beef flavor”, and instead contain “natural flavors” derived from a “vegetable source”. So at this point, it’s up to you to decide just how vegan you really are. Salads A photo posted by Sarah Stewart (@617s_stewart) on Mar 9, 2016 at 5:58am PST \nYou’d think salads were a safe bet, but think again. Only the side garden salad is vegan. But if you ask nicely and are willing to pay a little extra, you can ask them to add apple slices and grape tomatoes. Bagels and English Muffins A photo posted by McDonald's (@mcdonalds) on Jul 31, 2015 at 6:38am PDT \nWe’re just as surprised as you are, but this blog claims that the bagels and most of the other bread products at McDonald’s are vegan. Just make sure they don’t butter it. You can also ask them to add tomatoes and lettuce, and if you feel bad for asking, you can just order a regular breakfast bagel sandwich, without egg and meat. Oatmeal A photo posted by Alisha Mabe (@alishamabe) on Jul 9, 2015 at 10:17am PDT \nThe oatmeal is vegan as long as you tell them not to add cream. The oatmeal with fruit and maple also works without cream. Coffee A photo posted by McDonald's (@mcdonalds) on Feb 21, 2016 at 9:53am PST \nAs long as you don’t add milk, cream or sugar, all McDonald’s coffees are vegan. Drinks A video posted by McDonald's Canada (@mcdonaldscanada) on Jul 18, 2016 at 9:54am PDT \nMost of the sodas including coke aren’t vegan. However you can choose between: Apple Juice, Orange Juice, Bottled Water and Iced Tea. Miscellaneous A photo posted by McDonald's (@mcdonalds) on Jul 15, 2013 at 11:24am PDT \nThese items can’t be ordered on their own, but you can ask to add them onto whatever you maybe ordering: Buns, Pickle Slices, Flour Tortilla, Lettuce, Onion, Red Onion, Salsa, Mushrooms, and Tomatoes. Condiments A photo posted by McDonald's Canada (@mcdonaldscanada) on Oct 28, 2016 at 9:19am PDT \nIf you’re desperate to add flavor, this blog claims the following condiments are vegan: BBQ Sauce, Grape Jam, Strawberry Jam, Ketchup, Liquid Margarine, McRib Sauce, Mustard, Southwestern, Chipotle, Barbeque, Sauce, Strawberry Preserves, Sweet ‘N Sour Sauce",

Picture taken July 25, 2016. (Reuters/Edgar Su) \nMcDonald's has completed the sale of franchise rights for its restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia to Saudi Arabia's Lionhorn Pte Ltd as part of a plan to move away from direct ownership in Asia. \nThe fast-food chain said it transferred its ownership interest in 390 restaurants, more than 80 percent of which were company-owned, on Dec. 1 to Lionhorn. \nLionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who are franchisees for nearly 100 McDonald's restaurants in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nMcDonald's did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. \nReuters reported in October that McDonald's was nearing a deal worth up to $400 million to franchise the outlets to Reza group, which also owns and operates McDonald's outlets in the western and southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nThe Lionhorn deal is in line with McDonald's plans to bring in partners in Asia as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nThe company said it has now franchised about 1,300 outlets as a part of its target to become 95 percent franchised by the end of 2018.",

      "text": "Saudi Arabia's Lionhorn acquires franchise rights to McDonald's Singapore, Malaysia Saudi Arabia's Lionhorn acquires franchise rights to McDonald's Singapore, Malaysia 2.5 5 \nPublished December 4th, 2016 - 12:00 GMT via SyndiGate.info Rate Article:   Lionhorn boasts more than 20 years of experience as the Developmental Licensee (DL) for the nearly 100 McDonald's restaurants in the Western and Southern regions of Saudi Arabia. (Twitter) \nSaudi Arabia's Lionhorn Private Limited has bought the franchise rights for all the McDonald's restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia as part of its global expansion strategy.Lionhorn, led by Sheikh Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, boasts more than 20 years of experience as the Developmental Licensee (DL) for the nearly 100 McDonald's restaurants in the Western and Southern regions of Saudi Arabia.\"This transaction marks another milestone in our company's ongoing efforts to identify strategic partners who share our values and vision to accelerate our growth and scale across diverse markets, drive innovation and place us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,\" remarked McDonald's president and chief executive Steve Easterbrook.The new DL assumed ownership of the McDonald's business in Malaysia and Singapore on December 1, which includes a total of 390 restaurants, more than 80 per cent of which were company-owned.Under the DL structure, McDonald's transferred its ownership interest in McDonald's Malaysia and Singapore and granted a license to the DL to run McDonald's restaurant operations in these markets.The DL partner will provide the capital necessary to support and grow the business and will pay an initial franchise fee and an ongoing royalty to McDonald's.One of the world's leading global foodservice retailers, McDonald's boasts over 36,000 locations in over 100 countries. Of these, more than 80 per cent of the restaurants are owned and operated by independent local business men and women.Welcoming the takeover, Simone Hoyle, the head of McDonald's Asia Foundational Markets, said: \"Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza's experience in running great restaurants will create brand excitement for our customers and new opportunities for our people as these markets continue to grow and develop.\"Leading the day-to-day management of the Malaysia and Singapore markets, respectively, will be local operating partners Azmir Jaafar and Kenneth Chan, both of whom previously held senior leadership positions at McDonald's and together possess over 40 years of experience.This announcement follows a rigorous evaluation and selection process over the past year.As part of its turnaround plan announced in May last year, McDonald's said it is committed to refranchising 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018 with the long-term goal of becoming 95 per cent franchised.With this transaction, McDonald's has now refranchised approximately 1,300 restaurants, it added.",

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. \nIn an effort to debunk myths about their food, McDonald’s has released another promotional video showing how their food is made. \nThis time, they show you exactly what’s in their chicken nugget. \nFormer ‘MythBusters’ host Grant Imahara goes to a Tennessee Tyson food processing plant to investigate how McNuggets are made. \nMcDonald’s published the video to their YouTube channel on December 8. \nIt’s part of a video series called, “Our food. Your questions.” \nWith the video, they posted this statement: “Is it real Chicken? Is the whole chicken used? Those ‘pink slime’ pictures, is it really an ingredient of Chicken McNuggets? One of the biggest questions about McDonald’s food is about what goes into our Chicken McNuggets, so Grant Imahara visited Tyson Foods, one of our suppliers to get you answers. Watch to see what goes into our Chicken McNuggets.”",

      "text": "A worker at Salad and Go in Arizona. Salad and Go Legacy mega-brands like McDonald's, KFC, and Burger King have dominated the fast food industry for decades.\nBut within the last few years, many American consumers have shown a growing interest in healthier fast food that incorporates more low-calorie ingredients and fresh produce while remaining convenient and affordable. \nIn late November, top food executives from PepsiCo and Campbell Soup Company told Fortune that cleaner food is not just a trend, but a movement. And that shift is spilling over into the fast food market too, forcing legacy chains to try to keep up. In the last four years, Taco Bell has pledged to cut artificial ingredients and use cage-free eggs, and has introduced a lower-calorie menu. McDonald's has even worked with dietitians , removed antibiotics from its chicken, and added more salads to its menu. \nBut new healthy fast food chains are also seizing the opportunity to compete with legacy brands, creating low-calorie menus for around the same price. Though these new US chains are regional, they're growing in popularity, so they could spread nationwide in the coming years. \nCheck them out below. Salad and Go — A drive-thru salad chain Salad and Go/Facebook \nSalad and Go sells 48-ounce salads for around $6, as well as soups, smoothies, and breakfast items for around $4. \nSalad and Go is trying to rival more established drive-thru chains by making the ordering experience fast and convenient, cofounder Roushan Christofellis told BI. \nAlthough it just launched this fall , Salad and Go already has six locations in Arizona, with plans to open eight more by 2018 and to expand elsewhere in the US by 2020. Eatsa — An automated vegetarian chain Jillian D'Onfro/Business Insider \nAt the vegetarian chain Eatsa , customers place their orders on iPads and pick up their food from automated cubbies. Human workers, though, prepare everything in the back. \nSpecializing in quinoa bowls that cost around $7, the chain's meals range from 450 to 700 calories. \nCurrently, Eatsa (which debuted in 2015) has four locations in San Francisco and Los Angeles. In late November, it added a DC location and will open its first New York City on December 6. Dig Inn — A farm-to-table eatery Madeline Stone / Business Insider \nWith a menu that emphasizes locally sourced vegetables, Dig Inn offers things like maple and sriracha-glazed Brussels sprouts and poached wild salmon. Diners order pre-made mains and sides at a counter, which are placed in compostable boxes. \nSince its launch in 2011, the farm-to-table chain has opened 14 locations in New York City and one in Boston. By 2018, Dig Inn's CEO Adam Eskin told BI that the company plans to open more Massachusetts locations and add others in a third state as well. \nDig Inn forms partnerships with local farmers, which allows it to keep its prices relatively low, Eskin said . However, the chain removed its small meal size option in 2015 (which cost around $6), so a plate from Dig Inn generally costs between $8-$11, which is more expensive than most food from McDonald's or Burger King. But not by much — in New York City, where real estate prices are among the highest in the country, a McDonald's Big Mac meal costs around $8. The Kitchenette — A grab-and-go joint where most items cost $5 \nIn August, Kimbal Musk (yes, he's Elon Musk's brother) launched a fast food restaurant that serves sandwiches, soups, and salads — the majority of which cost $4.95. Called the Kitchenette, it's located inside the visitor's center at Shelby Farms Park , a 4,500-acre urban park and conservancy in Memphis, Tennessee. \nThe grab-and-go spot is part of Musk's larger chain of restaurants, called the Kitchen, which strives to use produce and meat from local purveyors. Musk hopes to launch more Kitchenette locations within Memphis and eventually nationwide, though there are no firm plans yet. Freshii — A plant-based chain that's 10 years strong Hollis Johnson \nFreshii, a Canadian fast food franchise founded in 2005, offers salads, wraps, and bowls , the majority of which are under 700 calories and cost $7. It boasts more than 300 locations worldwide and is one of America's most popular healthy fast food chains. In the past few years, new locations have opened inside airports, stadiums, and Target stores. \nIn 2015, after McDonald's announced its menu improvements, Freshii's CEO Matthew Corrin sent an open letter to McDonald's , offering to partner with the fast-food giant and pushing the chain to serve healthier food. Everytable — A fast food chain that changes its prices based on the average income in the neighborhood where it's located Everytable/Facebook \nEverytable, which launched two Los Angeles locations in 2016, adjusts its prices depending on what its local customers can afford. \nThe South LA location (where households earn a median salary of $30,882 ), for example, offers salads and bowls for less than $4.50, while the Everytable in downtown LA (where the median salary is $99,990 ) offers the same items for around $8. Both stores' ingredients are sourced from local purveyors, but the idea is for sales from locations in wealthier neighborhoods to partially subsidize operations in lower income areas. \nEverytable's cofounders, Sam Polk and David Foster, told BI they plan to expand the chain to more LA neighborhoods and eventually to other cities around the US. \nLocoL — A California eatery where everything costs $6 or less \nLocoL, a fast food concept spawned by famed chefs Roy Choi and Daniel Patterson, offers a new take on traditional fast food. \nIts dishes might contain more calories than, say, a salad, but everything is made with high-quality, locally sourced, whole ingredients. In LocoL's cheeseburgers, for example, cooked grains and tofu make up 30% of the beef patties. Its chicken nuggets also contain fermented barley. Instead of soda, there are fruity aguas frescas made in-house every day. \nThe chain, which launched in 2016, currently has two permanent locations and an array of food trucks in Los Angeles. By the end of 2017, Choi and Patterson hope to have nine locations nationwide, including a coffee shop and a kitchen where their staff can prepare the trucks' food off-site, according to Eater. \nIf you're in LA and are inkling for a Big Mac, LocoL's $4 burger — and served at the same speed as McDonald's— is better for the environment , slightly better for your body, and according to First We Feast, tastes great .",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald’s is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers.\nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn’t yet translated to a bump in customer visits.\nMcDonald’s Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald’s USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length.\nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn’t gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive?\n  A: Kempczinski: The trends we’re seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That’s what we’re working toward.\nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we’ve been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us.\nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn’t up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places?\nA: Kempczinski: I don’t think so. I’m very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we’ll have to see the trends. But everything we’re hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target.\nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald’s will eventually start expanding again domestically?\nA: Easterbrook: We’ve taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we’ve made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well.\nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald’s with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants?\nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there’s that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there’s plenty of growth, no doubt.\nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald’s food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that?\nA: Easterbrook: There’s no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what’s in it, where’s it come from, how’s it prepared. That’s not unique to the U.S. That’s a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they’re making.\nQ: You’ve introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the “better burgers” out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs?\nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.\nEasterbrook: There’s clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald’s, then I think that gives us a competitive edge.\nQ: Steve, you’re British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin’ Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds?\nA: Kempczinski: It’s a British invasion!\nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities.\nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan.\n___\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi\nCANDICE CHOI  ",

      "text": "By CANDICE CHOI - 12/4/16 12:04 PM \nNEW YORK — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald’s is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn’t yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald’s Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald’s USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn’t gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we’re seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That’s what we’re working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we’ve been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn’t up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don’t think so. I’m very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we’ll have to see the trends. But everything we’re hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald’s will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We’ve taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we’ve made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald’s with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there’s that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there’s plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald’s food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There’s no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what’s in it, where’s it come from, how’s it prepared. That’s not unique to the U.S. That’s a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they’re making. \nQ: You’ve introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the “better burgers” out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. \nEasterbrook: There’s clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald’s, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you’re British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin’ Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It’s a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. \nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nArtisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. \nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. Related content",

Artisan burger buns, ... more Photo: Richard Drew, AP McDonald's CEO: Chain still plans to expand in the US again 1 / 2 Back to Gallery NEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. The chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. McDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook , who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski , who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. Q: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? A: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Easterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. Q: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? A: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. Q: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? A: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. Q: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? A: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. Q: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? A: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That 's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. Q: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? A: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. Easterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. Q: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? A: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! Easterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. Kempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. ___",

      "title": "McDonald's CEO: Chain still plans to expand in the US again",
      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers.\nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits.\nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length.\nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive?\nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward.\nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us.\nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places?\nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target.\nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically?\nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well.\nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants?\nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt.\nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that?\nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making.\nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs?\nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.\nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge.\nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds?\nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion!\nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities.\nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan.\n___\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi",
