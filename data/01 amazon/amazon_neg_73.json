      "text": "Your passport to AWS re:Invent 2016 Reporting and analysis from IT events AWS enhancements beckon customers to Amazon cloud platform by Trevor Jones News Writer AWS intends to make it easier than ever for an enterprise to use its platform -- on or off premises. CONFERENCE COVERAGE: Conference Section you're in: News and analysis from AWS re:Invent 2016 More articles from this section: Share this item with your network: Sponsored News Modernize Your Microsoft Applications on Amazon Web Services –Amazon Web Services \nLAS VEGAS -- A slew of AWS enhancements unveiled by Amazon this week will likely resonate with enterprise customers that have invoked various excuses to avoid the platform -- but even if they have a hard time still saying no, many will need guidance to decide what's best for them. \nOfferings unveiled here at AWS re:Invent -- new instance types, PostgreSQL support in Amazon Relational Database Service , a further push into hybrid cloud and more machine learning options -- represent efforts to lower the bar for enterprise adoption and also catch up to emerging competition. Variety breeds opportunity and complexity \nPublic cloud detractors often cite limited instance types as a primary reason not to move to the cloud, but Amazon has countered by gradually adding more options for VMs. Amazon upped the number of instance families to 11, added a virtual private server option, expanded options within the T2 and R4 instances and said it will incorporate the next generation Intel processor in the C5 instances. \nThe new F1 instances offer customer-programmable FPGAs , while the I3 is targeted at I/O-intensive relational databases. Customers can also use Elastic GPUs to attach the graphic accelerators to an existing EC2 instance. \nAWS enhancements are generally a good thing, but the slew of options raises concerns of customer confusion . This could be addressed by system integrators, but it could present extra strain as less savvy enterprises start to move to AWS. \n\"The highly technical companies will love it and figure it out, but someone who's just looking to get some work done may have trouble figuring out which one to choose,\" said Mike Kavis, vice president and principal cloud architect at Cloud Technology Partners, an AWS consulting partner in Boston. \nWithin the next year he hopes to see a layer of abstraction that can help customers select the right instance for them. \nOne advantage for Amazon, however, is that customers in the cloud can test out the various instance types to figure out which is best for them, said Rich Sutton, vice president of engineering at Proofpoint Inc., a security and compliance provider in Sunnyvale, Calif. and AWS customer. \n\"I don't perceive there to be too many instance types,\" Sutton said. \"They all have their tradeoffs, but unlike the old hardware days where you had to lay out CapEx to figure out which is the best for you, you can just try stuff out.\" Hybrid cloud seeps into AWS strategy \nAmazon also made its biggest commitment yet to hybrid cloud. AWS Greengrass, unveiled at AWS re:Invent, embeds AWS Lambda compute and services into connected devices that can be run locally. While the latest version of the popular Snowball data transfer service , Snowball Edge, can store 100 TB of data and includes compute and storage capabilities inside the device. Snowball Edge includes Greengrass, too. \nSnowball Edge is a server-like device, and while Greengrass is currently focused on internet of things , this combination can be expanded to more general uses as customer demand increases, said John Rymer, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. \n\"It's not that Amazon is going into the private cloud business, but it's the most aggressive that they've ever been in inserting their technology into [customers'] data centers,\" Rymer said. Even though they have more feature function than anyone, those areas where they do have gaps they're starting to address … They're starting to remove the excuses for you to go other places. Mike Kavis VP and principal cloud architect, Cloud Technology Partners \nAmazon also literally rolled out another new data transfer service -- Snowmobile, a 45-foot-long semi-truck, which was driven onto the conference hall floor to close out its Wednesday keynote. The service will allow customers to transfer exabytes of data to AWS with a 10 gigabyte per second line. \nAmazon estimates it can speed up a transfer that would take more than a quarter century down to six months. It's unclear how many customers actually have enough on-premises data stores to require such a massive device, but the consensus among show attendees speaking with SearchAWS.com is that this likely will be a niche service, at least in the short term. AWS enhancements catch up to the competition \nAmazon continues to dominate the public cloud market with a platform viewed as more mature and with a wider breadth of features than any of its competitors. While some of the new AWS enhancements continue to extend the company's innovation lead over rivals, others attempt to play catch-up. \nAmazon Athena will allow customers to perform ad hoc SQL queries in Simple Storage Service without the need to spin up or manage any additional infrastructure. The service can provide results in milliseconds and works for either batch or real-time analytics . In many ways, Athena is Amazon's answer to Google BigQuery, which has been one of the biggest drivers of Google Cloud Platform adoption. \nThere are also improvements to AI capabilities on AWS, including machine learning services for speech and facial recognition. Those capabilities already can be found on IBM Watson , Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. \n\"When they were describing the machine learning updates Amazon kept hitting on quality, quality, quality,\" Rymer said.\" That's the kind of thing you say when you're behind and you've got to have an edge.\" \nOverall, the feature disclosures were seen as positives and help further AWS' strategy to remove reasons not use the platform, even if that means matching what other providers offer. \n\"Even though they have more feature function than anyone, those areas where they do have gaps they're starting to address,\" Kavis said. \"They're starting to remove the excuses for you to go other places.\" \nTrevor Jones is a news writer with SearchCloudComputing and SearchAWS.

      "title": "Amazon Cracks Down on Fake Products",
      "text": "Comment A fake iPhone charger advertised as \"official.\" The Verge. \nAmazon is now doing a global crackdown on counterfeit products sold on the site. The company says the problem is now getting out of control and Amazon is now paving a solid plan on how to conduct a check-and-balance on millions of products listed on the site. \nA recent lawsuit filed by Apple against Mobile Star LLC claims that 90% of branded \"official\" iPhone chargers posted on the site are indeed fake. Apple did its own surveillance having bought several chargers from Mobile Star's Amazon shopping page. \nOn the lawsuit, Apple says , \"Consumers, relying on Amazon.com's reputation, have no reason to suspect the power products they purchased from Amazon.com are anything but genuine. This is particularly true where, as here, the products are sold directly 'by Amazon.com' as genuine Apple products using Apple's own product marketing images.\" \nAmazon in a press statement, following the Apple lawsuit, says that the company has \"zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits.\" It has also confirmed that it is now working closely with manufacturers and suppliers on the site. \nFighting against the fakes is going to be Amazon's No. 1 goal for 2017. \nAmazon has been in touch with surveillance and investigating teams in the U.S. and Europe to build a list of supplier registry on the site. Once the list is complete, a global crackdown will be initiated. The easiest way to cope, Amazon says, is to get in touch with suppliers so they can confirm on products being sold and the validity of licenses given to online dealers. As it is known, it is unlawful for dealers to sell official products without a brand license, and unofficial products should never be branded as 'official' as this can be misleading. \nOther inventors and start-ups have also been victims of counterfeit items sold on Amazon. Randy Hetrick, founder of the TRX Training System, has produced a popular exercise kit that has seen the support of celebrities Jennifer Lopez, Ellen Pompeo, Jaime Pressly, and Mary J. Blige. He began selling his invention on Amazon since 2008 and found great success, but has since succumbed to counterfeits that offer the product at way more affordable prices. By 2014, he says his company lost $100 million due to consumers not able to tell the difference between counterfeits and the real thing. \nHetrick says, \"The depressing thing about it is, brands that invest the most to innovate and create new products are the ones that lose the most because they are the ones that counterfeits target.\" \nAmazon is now helping Hetrick file a lawsuit against three fake suppliers. The company is also encouraging official sellers to set up an online store apart from an Amazon store, so buyers are directed into knowing which sellers are real. It is hard work for Amazon, but 2017 is going to be a bigger and more arduous year for the biggest online marketplace.",

      "text": "From 9to5Toys : \nIn an attempt to simplify data backup, Seagate has announced the new Duet 1TB Hard Drive that automatically syncs all of its contents to Amazon’s cloud service . This partnership ensures that data is easily transferrable on-the-go while also taking the guesswork out of backing up your files. Setup is quite simple: plug the hard drive into your Mac or PC, sign into Amazon’s service and apply the included promotional code to claim your year’s worth of cloud storage (a $60 value). \nSeagate Duet uses a typical mechanical 1TB hard drive, so you can’t expect lightning speeds here. But the ability to automatically backup your data to Amazon’s cloud with minimal fuss is certainly noteworthy. With news that Apple is potentially leaving the router business, this has the potential to convert some Time Machine users in the long-term if all goes to plan. The Seagate Duet is available for pre-order on Amazon with a December 10th ship date for $99 . \nThe drive delivers 1TB of storage, quick local transfer speeds and offline access in a slim, lightweight design. In addition, new Amazon Drive customers will receive one free year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage 1 , providing them unlimited storage for photos, videos, files, documents, movies, and music. The Seagate Duet easily syncs all data on the drive to the cloud, giving customers dual backup along with access almost anywhere using Amazon Drive.",

      "text": "How Amazon is using market Personalization \nIt is no secret that Amazon is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to marketing personalization. Amazon dominates the e-commerce market because of its ability to personalize content to each individual across the entire customer journey. They have perfected the personalization of the shopping experience by connecting the dots between customer interests and creating customer-centric campaigns tailored to the right individual at the right time and place. \nWe all know that Amazon’s personalized marketing emails and use of big data create a truly unique experience. Let’s take a look at the other factors involved in Amazon’s perfectly personalized model. \n1.Seasonal Personalization \nAmazon becomes an e-commerce powerhouse during the holiday seasons. Why does Amazon see such a dramatic spike in sales during the holidays? Amazon’s personalization strategy focuses on analyzing browsing history and past behavior. Amazon uses this data to generate the most relevant recommendations for each individual. Amazon weaves seasons and holidays into their recommendation algorithms to maximize the effectiveness of these recommendations. \nFor example, Christmas holiday season is more about buying products to be given to other people. Customers tend to focus more on the interest of their friends and family, rather than their personal interests. Amazon recognizes this change in customer behavior. They shift their recommendations to feature more products based on past behavior during Christmas holidays and products that are popular during the holiday season. \n2. Wisdom of Crowds \nUse the wisdom of crowds for more effective personalization.\nThe wisdom of crowds refers to the concept that the many are smarter than the few. Essentially, the collective opinion of a group of people is more valuable the opinion or beliefs of a single expert. Amazon does a fantastic job of leveraging their massive user base to benefit the company and increase personalization. Amazon is driven by user opinions and reviews, focusing on what the customers want. It is that collective opinion on what is desirable, which allows Amazon to personalize products to each customer. Amazon applies this wisdom of crowds towards market segmentation, employing the power of “segments of one.” With this strategy, Amazon has been able to divide their large customer base into groups and categories based on shared characteristics. From there, Amazon uses the wisdom of crowds within each group to create a personalized user experience while involving popular products relevant to each customer. \n3. Recommendations \nAs a retailer, the goal is to provide relevant products to consumers. Amazon focuses on products they know customers will be interested in purchasing. Amazon’s personalization techniques have enabled them to understand each and every customer. They can then tailor their web pages towards each specific customer. This means that Amazon knows exactly what a customer has looked at, and what to recommend based on their behavior. Why is this a successful method? Once a customer has hit the checkout button , they are in the “buy now” state of mind. Amazon’s personalization has enabled them to recommend products to customers while they are still in that “buy now” mentality. The most important part of their process, though, is that Amazon recommends these products after purchasing items. They are careful not to break the buying mentality, so as to not risk a customer converting or returning products. \nThere are a plethora of lessons to be learned from Amazon’s successful personalization strategy! They key to their success and dominance in e-commerce lies heavily on the idea of a personalized shopping experience. Your company can implement these winning strategies by using a personalization solution. \n",

      "title": "Cable Without Cable: Amazon Prime Members Can Now Subscribe to HBO & Cinemax — Design News",
      "text": "Share (Image credit: HBO) \nWinter is coming, and here's another reason to stay in: Amazon announced today that Prime members can now subscribe to HBO and Cinemax, sans cable. \nThe subscriptions are available as a part of Amazon Channels , which aggregates a bunch of network and streaming services all in one place. HBO and Cinemax join Showtime, Starz, PBS Kids, Daily Burn, and even more niche options. \nAn HBO subscription is $14.99 per month after a free 30-day trial, and Cinemax is $9.99. Prime Video, which offered all seasons of no-longer-on-air HBO shows (like The Sopranos and The Wire) and older seasons of some current ones (like Veep) are still available without a subscription. \nThis continues the trend of premium channels uncoupling from cable packages; Last year, HBO Now —the cable-free version of HBO GO—was announced for Apple TV and its devices, and as an add-on for internet-based live TV service Sling .",

      "text": "Buy on Amazon - 4 In One Transition Strip \nDetails: Multifloor transition strips aim to please everybody. In one product, you get four different types of transitions. They transition from like level to like level, as well as different levels. \nThis is accomplished by supplying you with several molding parts that you use or leave out, as needed. \nThe problem is that you pay for unneeded materials. And with costs of multifloor transitions running about twice the cost of dedicated transitions, you pay for all of those parts . \nYou will often find multifloor transitions in smaller hardware or department stores, places that have little shelf space to carry many kinds of transitions. Check Amazon rating » Schluter Systems 1-in Satin Brass Aluminum Transition Trim. © Schluter Systems 3. From Any Hard Surface to Another Hard Surface \nWhat It Is: T-shaped transition strip that connects any like-height hard surfaces. \nDetails: T-shaped strips will work between any two hard surfaces (stone, ceramic, wood, laminate, etc.), where both are the same height . \nThe strip inserts in very narrow seams between floor coverings. The top \"reveal\" area lies low--closer to the floor coverings than any other type of transition strip. \nThe issue with this type of T-shaped strip is that being aluminum, it aesthetically matches neither of the two floors being connected. Tile to Laminate Transition. © TrafficMaster 4. Tile to Laminate \nWhat It Is: Transition strip that connects laminate floor to tile floor, with the appearance of the strip matching the laminate. \nDetails: Ceramic tile tends to be higher than laminate. Both rest on underlayments , but tile has the addition of thinset mortar , which raises it beyond laminate flooring. \nWith the model shown here, a gap must be left between the two floors for installation of the base track. Then, the visible, \"finish\" part of the transition strip is snapped into place. Wood to Wood Transition Seam Binder. © M-D Building Products 5. Wood Floor to Wood Floor \nWhat It Is: Called seam binders, these wide (about 5 inches) transition strips are flat and bridge two wood floors of equal heights. \nDetails: The screws drill in between the two floor coverings, so that the seam binder will be loose and not attached to the floor coverings--allowing expansion and contraction. Tile to Vinyl Transition Strip. © M-D Building Products 6. Vinyl to Tile \nWhat It Is: A strip that aesthetically matches your vinyl flooring, which transitioning upward to ceramic floor. \nDetails: Much like the tile-to-laminate strip, this one reduces from a higher (tile) covering to a lower (vinyl) covering. In almost every case, vinyl will be lower than laminate. Traffic Master Pewter Fluted 36 in. Carpet Gripper with Teeth. © TrafficMaster 7. Carpet Edge Gripper (Aluminum) \nWhat It Is: Carpet grippers hold the edge of the carpet with sharp metal teeth. They transition to any surface that is below the carpet. \nDetails: Another type of transition strip for carpet is the edge gripper. The gripper is tacked to the subfloor, and then the edge of the wall-to-wall carpet is forced into the gripper section.",

      "text": "Amazon to Roll Out Frontier Communications' Internet Plans by Zacks Equity Research Published on December 01, 2016 Trades from $ 3 According to a recent report by TechCrunch , an online publisher of technology industry news, Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN - Free Report ) will start offering Frontier Communications Corporation ’s ( FTR - Free Report ) Internet service plans on its product site. In Mar 2016, Amazon started selling cable TV behemoth Comcast Corp.’s ( CMCSA - Free Report ) Xfinity TV, Internet and landline services, ranging from pay-TV to broadband triple-play bundles, on its newly launched online ‘Amazon Cable Store’. It marked Amazon’s debut with respect to selling services from a pay-TV operator. Since the launch, there have been reports that Amazon is presently in talks to include Charter Communications Inc. ( CHTR - Free Report ) as well. Toward this end, Amazon recently added Frontier Communications to ‘Amazon Cable Store’, which is now rebranded as ‘Amazon Internet | TV | Phone’.Frontier Communications is a leading regional telecommunication company in the U.S.and is way smaller a company in comparison to Charter Communications, with roughly 4.4 million broadband customers and 1.5 billion video subscribers. While Frontier Communications sells video, Internet and phone plans in 29 states, Amazon customers can only order Internet services from Frontier Communications. Amazon also helps customers order Double Play (TV and Internet) and Triple Play plans from Comcast. Frontier Communications’ services were made available to new customers on Amazon.com starting Nov 15. The terms of the deal have been kept under wraps. Amazon.com’s Offers The Amazon online store offers customers a wide range of Internet plans and bundles from both Comcast Xfinity and Frontier Communications, ranging from starter plans for single device (10 Mbps+) to plans which support multiple devices (150 Mbps+). On the product site, Frontier Communications’ 12 Mbps (for a single device), 24 Mbps (for 2–4 devices), 75 Mbps (for 4–6 devices) and 150 Mbps (for 6–8 devices) broadband plans are being offered along with similar Comcast Xfinity services. Prices for both Frontier Communications and Comcast’s products on Amazon.com can be compared to prices if ordered from the operators directly. Moreover, Amazon is presently offering some lucrative offers to its customers. If a Frontier Communications’ product is purchased, then the customer gets a $50 Amazon gift card and remains a customer for at least 45 days and those who order Comcast’s products will get a $100 Amazon gift card. Winding Up We are impressed with Frontier Communications’ focus to rake in more profits through customer retention, market share gain, new product introductions, broadband expansion and improved sales and marketing initiatives. Both Frontier Communications and Comcast have assured that their products prices offered on Amazon’s site are similar to the individual packages sold by operators. From the business perspective, both Frontier Communications and Comcast can benefit from their online partnerships with Amazon from where millions of customers shop every day. Amazon is not only the biggest online retailer but it also excels in customer services. For Amazon, it seems that the retailer may next look to reselling a broader array of bundles, apart from Internet or TV services. \nFRONTIER COMMUN Price",

      "text": "Kindle to support e-books in five Indian languages New Delhi, Dec 2, 2016, PTI: Amazon’s e-book reader, Kindle, will now support content in five Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati and Malayalam, a move that will help the US-based firm tap into the niche but growing ‘digital regional content’ market in India.\n“We are adding thousands of digital books in Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati and Malayalam, including the largest digital selection of best sellers, hundreds of exclusive titles and free classics to the Kindle Book Store,” Amazon Kindle director (Content) Sanjeev Jha said.\nReaders can access these books on Kindle eReaders as well as the free Kindle apps for Android and iOS, he added.\n“Subscribers of Kindle Unlimited will also have access to the Indian language content. The new language selection is in addition to over three million books that are already available on the Kindle Book Store,” he said. Kindle already supports languages like Chinese, German, French and Japanese among others, apart from English.\nWhile Amazon does not share country specific growth numbers, Jha said India is among its fastest growing markets globally for Kindle.\nAmazon will make available bestseller titles like Ishq Mein Shahar Hona by Ravish Kumar (Hindi), Rajaraja Chozhan by Sa Na Kannan (Tamil), Mrutyunjay by Shivaji Sawant (Marathi), Ek Bija Ne Gamta Rahiye by Kaajal Oza Vaidya (Gujarati) and Aarachar by K R Meera (Malayalam).\nThe exclusive titles include Banaras Talkies by Satya Vyas, Ki.Mu.Ki.Pi by Madhanand, ‘Draupadi’ by Kaajal Oza Vaidya and titles like Mayapuri by Shivani will now be available in digital format for the first time.",

      "text": "BLOOMBERG — Amazon.com Inc. unveiled a new security tool for cloud customers, part of a slew of product announcements this week designed to fend off competition from Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and others in the fast-growing cloud computing market.\nChief Technology Officer Werner Vogels announced Amazon Shield, new layers of protection designed against service interruptions like the cyber attack that took down top websites and affected some Amazon Web Services customers in October.\n“This will really help you protect yourselves even against the largest and most sophisticated attacks we’ve seen,” he said on Thursday at AWS re:Invent, a conference in Las Vegas that drew 32,000 attendees.\nMaking the cloud secure is a major part of persuading companies to shift their data and computing workloads from on-premise servers they control to rented resources accessed via the internet.\nRenting servers through the cloud offers lower costs, greater speed and flexibility. AWS has clients in a broad range of sectors, including health care, financial services, retail and transportation, highlighting rapid adoption of this approach to computing. Public cloud spending is expected to increase almost 17 percent to $204 billion this year, according to researcher Gartner Inc.\nVogel’s announcement followed Wednesday’s unveiling of an image recognition program, a speech-to-text service dubbed Polly, and tools for building conversational apps that highlighted Amazon’s push to add artificial intelligence to its cloud-computer offerings.\nAmazon’s Web Services division is the Seattle-based company’s fastest-growing and most profitable source of revenue, offsetting regular quarterly losses from its e-commerce operation. Cloud computing revenue is projected to top $10 billion this year.\nThe security tool was reported earlier by TechCrunch.",

      "text": "Home | Awards and Points Programs | Skip Amazon to Maximize Holiday Shopping Points and Miles Skip Amazon to Maximize Holiday Shopping Points and Miles December 1, 2016 Joe Cortez \nAmazon is the world’s largest online shopping portal, and where most people do their virtual shopping. But does it offer the best deals and discounts for frugal travelers? When next years’ points and miles are as important as this years’ shopping, it may pay to do explore your options before going to Amazon to spend your holiday dollars. Here’s how: \nPrice Compare With Google Shopping \nIt’s natural to assume that Amazon has the best price, but Google Shopping allows shoppers to search for the best price on any item through multiple stores and make sure. \nFind the Shopping Portal Sweet Spot \nAs we have written about before, shopping portals available through your credit cards’ website will give you double, triple, or more points or miles multipliers for buying the items on your list through their website. \nThe “sweet spot” is when you find what you were already going to buy available through the portal. Go through that portal instead of directly to the product’s web page and buy the product and get lots of extra points and miles to use for traveling later. \nFor example: if a traveler wants to earn American AAdvantage miles on electronics at Best Buy, that traveler could go through the AAdvantage shopping website and pay for their item with the Citi/AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite MasterCard to earn two points per dollar spent. The possibilities are only limited by the brands available on the shopping portals. \n30,000 American Airlines AAdvantage® bonus miles After $1,000 in purchases in the first 3 months 30,000 American Airlines AAdvantage® bonus miles After $1,000 in purchases in the first 3 months Annual Fee \n\nLook for Targeted Offers to Maximize Your Bonus \nComparison shopping and shopping portals are not the only way to get big bonuses on spending this year. Several credit cards also come with either quarterly or targeted offers, depending on the card. \nWith the Chase Freedom Card , frugal travelers can earn five percent cash back on purchases at department stores, warehouse stores (like Costco) and drug stores, up to the first $1,500 of purchases. Furthermore, it’s not too late to take advantage of these deals: cardholders have until December 14 to activate their quarterly bonus. \nNot to be outdone, American Express also offers targeted deals towards frugal travelers with Amex Offers . By signing up through the American Express website, travelers can earn either discounts on purchases, or bonus points on purchases – even through Amazon. \nWhile Membership Rewards points earned with the Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express (among other American Express cards) have been questioned over the past year, there is a place for these points in the frugal travel world, especially when applied in concert with other cards. \nIf All Else Fails, Get Gift Cards \nEven with all this work, there may not necessarily be a better deal available out there. Furthermore, some people may not necessarily have time to search for the best deal, multiplied by the best program out there. When even our best laid schemes fail, there’s nothing wrong with purchasing gift cards as a backup resort. \nWhen purchasing gift cards for Amazon or other retailers, travelers can take advantage of specific card bonus categories, while still getting the best deal available for them. For instance, travelers making purchases with the no annual fee Citi Hilton HHonor Visa Signature Card can earn three points per dollar spent at all pharmacies or grocery stores. When purchasing gift cards at a grocery store, travelers can earn more points for their purchases. \nEven though shopping may be a hassle, it doesn’t have to be fruitless for the shopper. By understanding how to maximize points and miles shopping, everyone can turn the holiday season into the most wonderful time of the year for points earning! \nHow do you maximize your points and miles shopping during the holidays?

      "text": "Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cloud Insights newsletter \nMobile developers working in AWS will now have access to targeted push notifications with another new service called Amazon Pinpoint. This could also help businesses glean better data from their mobile apps as well. \nTo get a better look at applications once they are running in production, Amazon released AWS X-Ray, which Vogels said will help users analyze and debug distributed applications. Users will be able to see where performance bottlenecks are, or see what services may be slowing them down. \nFor a higher-level look at an AWS deployment, Vogels said that the AWS Personal Health Dashboard can provide a personalized view of AWS service health. For example, if a service fails over, it will alert you. Additionally, users can write Amazon Lambda functions to respond to system events that they are alerted to. \nEarlier this year, a DDoS attack from the Mirai botnet took down many major web companies. To protect AWS customers against DDoS attacks, Vogels announced AWS Shield. The Shield Standard protection will be turned on by default for all customers, he said, and will protect from volumetric and state exhaustion attacks. To add additional protection from large and sophisticated attacks, Vogels said, users can opt in to Shield Advanced. \nFor users looking for more control over their data and data quality, AWS Glue offers a fully-managed data catalog and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service. It integrates with S3, RDS, and Redshift, and it isn't a cloud-only product. This could make it easier for enterprises to build out their own data infrastructure, especially those with a hybrid strategy. \nAnother new data service announced at re:Invent was AWS Batch, which provides fully-managed batch processing at any scale, Vogels said. \nContainers also got their time in the spotlight. Vogels announced that AWS would soon be releasing a Task Placement Engine to help users determine scheduling policies based on certain parameters, as well Event Stream, which will provide real-time notifications of the current state of your containers. Vogels also announced Blox, a collection of open source projects for building container management systems where Amazon will work with other developers to build solutions. The first two Blox releases are a cluster-state-service and a daemon-scheduler. \nAdditionally, a new service available in preview is Lambda@Edge which will allow developers to run AWS Lambda functions at CloudFront locations. To better coordinate Lambda functions, Vogels announced AWS Step Functions, giving developers the ability to coordinate components of distributed applications through a visual editor. Vogels called it \"one of the coolest releases\" he announced during his presentation. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers At re:Invent 2016, AWS CTO Werner Vogels announced new tools to help with systems management pain points, like the Amazon EC2 Systems Manager. New developer tools include targeted mobile push notifications through Amazon Pinpoint and a new build service called AWS CodeBuild. AWS Shield is a new service that will protect against certain DDoS attacks by default, and can be upgraded with additional protection through AWS Shield Advanced.

      "text": "Seagate Duet is a portable hard drive that syncs with Amazon Cloud Drive 12/01/2016 by Brad Linder Leave a Comment \nBacking up your data is always a good idea. But you know what’s even better? Making two backups including one that’s stored remotely so that if your house or office burns down with your computer and backup drive in it, you won’t lose all your data. \nNow Amazon and Seagate have introduced a new portable hard drive that’s designed to do just that. Data you back up to the $100 Seagate Duet hard drive can be automatically uploaded to Amazon Cloud Drive for safe keeping. \nWhen you buy the drive you also get a 1-year Amazon Drive susbcription, which is worth $60… which means that when your year is up you’ll have to pony up some extra cash. But the annual price is about the same as you’d pay for an individual cloud backup plan with Carbonite or Crashplan . \nAmazon’s Cloud Drive apps also let you access backed up files using mobile or tablet apps or just about any device with a web browser. \nThe Seagate drive is up for pre-order and should begin shipping December 10th. It connects to your PC via a USB cable and works with PC or Mac.",

      "text": "Chris DeVille @chrisdeville | 9:48 am Share < br />this article: \nAmazon is bringing back its Indie For The Holidays playlist this season, with a new round of Christmas classics reimagined by underground stars. This year’s playlist goes live tomorrow, but we’ve got a couple previews today by two very different bands. \nFirst up are heavy-hitting Pac-NW veterans Melvins, who’ve delivered their version of arguably the spookiest Christmas song, “Carol Of The Bells.” Explains King Buzzo, “The song has scared us since we were children, that’s why we wanted to do it.” Hear it below. \nAlso premiering today is “When Christmas Comes (Boxing Day Version)” by Los Campesinos! You may or may not be surprised to learn that Gareth David is highly sentimental regarding the holidays, as he detailed via email: \nI’m someone who has absolutely zero scepticism towards Christmas, I wouldn’t complain if people started putting their decorations up in August. Christmas is a vacuum I could happily live inside the whole of the year, where my malaise is buried under 6 feet of metaphorical snow. This song is about that time being even better when you get to share it with someone else. \nHear it below. \nHere’s the full tracklist: \n01 “Sister Winter”– Joseph 02 “Baby, It’s Cold Outside”– Savoir Adore 03 “When Christmas Comes (Boxing Day Version)”– Los Campesinos! 04 “Carol Of The Bells”– Melvins 05 “Hard Candy Christmas”– Inger Loree & the Nymphs 06 “Christmas (The Way It Was Back Then)”– Chris Staples 07 “Azusa”– The Album Leaf 08 “Plastic Mistletoe”– Glint 09 Santa, Baby”– Red Rosamond 10 “Holiday Road”– Tennis 11 “Headphones For The Holidays”– Blake Hazard 12 “Silver Bells”– Dandy Warhols 13 “Ritmo De Vida”– Nortec Collective Presents Bostich + Fussible 14 “Snow”– Sam Evian 15 “Come On Home (It’s Christmas)”– PINS \nIndie For The Holidays is available 12/2 on Amazon Music Unlimited and Prime Music .

      "text": "Toys were an especially hot seller this year on Black Friday and Cyber Monday amid a wave of amazing discounts by retailers. Unfortunately for ailing discounter Kmart, deal-seeking parents likely bought toys for their children elsewhere due to the chain's mostly noncompetitive prices as compared to the largest toy sellers around.\nKmart, which is owned by Sears Holdings ( SHLD ) , had toy prices that were 6.5% more expensive than digital juggernaut Amazon.com  ( AMZN ) on Black Friday, and a whopping 11.9% pricier on Cyber Monday, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence . Kmart's price gap on toys with Walmart ( WMT ) during the two most critical shopping days of the year wasn't much better. Bloomberg Intelligence points out that Kmart's toys were 10.8% more expensive than Walmart on Black Friday, and 8% pricier on Cyber Monday. \nSo much for Kmart partaking in what looks to be a bumper holiday season thus far in toys.\n\"Our store checks indicate one of the better weekends for toys that we've experienced in the post-recession era, especially when we consider the shift to digital has pulled some shoppers out of the store,\" says BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson. \" Toys 'R' Us had the most foot traffic of the 'Big Three' U.S. toy retailers, likely because it had the broadest array of door-buster and Black Friday deals,\" Johnson said. Walmart has had a solid showing on toys as well since Thanksgiving Day, he added.\nTarget ( TGT ) had the least-trafficked toy department from Thanksgiving Day through the long weekend as shoppers likely took advantage of some stellar early deals from the retailer, says Johnson. The company held a promotion for 20% off all toys and games from Nov. 20 through Nov. 23. From Nov. 24 to Nov. 26, Target offered a deal to buy one and get one 50% off on brands such as Disney ( DIS ) Princess and Hot Wheels by Mattel ( MAT ) .\n\nPrev 0 of 2 Next",

      "text": "Adrian Liang About The Amazon Book Review Originally launched in 2007 as Omnivoracious (“Hungry for the next good book”), The Amazon Book Review has served as the place for the Amazon Books editors to talk about our passions for fiction, nonfiction, cookbooks, kids’ books, mysteries, romance, and science fiction. Here you’ll find interviews with your favorite authors, Best Books of the Month announcements, reviews, and occasional essays on books, reading, and quirky trends. Visit us often for new stories, or have the latest ABR articles delivered to your in-box via our daily digest email. Amazon's Best Books of December Erin Kodicek on December 01, 2016 Share \nOur Spotlight Pick for this month comes from bestselling author Michael Lewis ( Moneyball , The Blind Side , Flash Boys ...). If you're a fan of books like Thinking Fast and Slow , Grit , Freakonomics , and Outliers , The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds is about the duo who put behavioral economics on the map. \nLearn more about the rest of the top five below, and browse all of our best of the month selections for December here . Shop on Amazon Print Book | Kindle Book Normal by Warren Ellis Senior Editor Adrian Liang says Warren Ellis's slim but epic novel, Normal, is \"unpredictable and daringly written...a mind-blowing morsel of paranoia.\" Print Book | Kindle Book Against Empathy by Paul Bloom Employing empathy in our decision-making process is a good thing, right? Not so! says psychologist Paul Bloom. In Against Empathy he argues that such decisions come from an emotional place, rather than a logical one, which can result in us making incorrect, less moral conclusions. Print Book | Kindle Book Christmas Days by Jeanette Winterson Whether you celebrate Christmas or not, these twelve highly imaginative holiday tales with accompanying recipes will warm the cockles of your (cynical/terrified/hopeful) heart. Print Book | Kindle Book Game of Queens by Sarah Gristwood Reviewer Vannessa Cronin calls Game of Queens a \"lively, accessible, occasionally hilarious, absorbing account of an astonishing era.\"",

Netflix The end of the year is typically a harried time, what with all the social and financial obligations surrounding the holiday season — which means it’s also a perfect time to ignore all those obligations, stay in, and watch something great (and preferably not holiday-related) instead. December’s streaming additions offer plenty of options for doing just that, with a nice blend of new original content, some acclaimed movies from early 2016 you may have missed, and a few older classics that are the definition of cinematic comfort food. So when you need a break from the holiday hullabaloo, try cueing up one of the following movies or TV shows, all of which are perfect for helping you forget all the things you’re supposed to finish before the end of the year. New in December on Netflix White Girl (available December 1) Elizabeth Wood’s feature directorial debut received warm notices out of Sundance earlier in the year, particularly for its star, Morgan Saylor. (You might know her better as Dana Brody from Homeland — and that might not necessarily be a plus for this movie in your book.) It’s your classic “good girl meets bad boy, then leaves behind everything she previously was to keep him” narrative. But where lots of versions of that story demonize the characters for their bad choices, Wood has real empathy for her lead character’s screw-ups. Beverly Hills Cop (available December 1) Eddie Murphy’s groundbreaking turn as Axel Foley was one of the most successful comedies of all time, both financially and critically. But in 1984, a black cop from Detroit upending the expectations and norms of an all-white police squad wasn’t just excellent film fare — it was revelatory satire. Murphy oozes charm, confidence, a mastery of physical comedy and improvisation (including a whole ad-libbed monologue ), and a complete awareness of how unsettling his presence is to the upper-crust white society he’s invaded. Watching him gradually seduce one officer after another (especially a perpetually delighted Judge Reinhold ) into helping him take on a high-profile drug smuggler will restore your faith in comedy’s ability to serve as the most searing of all social commentaries. Fuller House , season two (available December 9) It’s entirely possible you’ve tried to forget Fuller House exists. We wouldn’t blame you. But there’s somewhat compelling evidence that when season one debuted back in February, it actually lowered traditional TV ratings . So of course Netflix was going to make more, and season two appears to feature the Fuller House gang celebrating every single holiday they can think of, to keep with the month’s festive mood. Also, Stephanie kisses Kimmy’s little brother, which can only end well. Barry (available December 16) One of the less expected trends of the 2016 movie year has been “films about young Barack Obama,” thanks to Southside With You (which follows Barack and Michelle Obama’s first date) and this, which follows his days at Columbia University in New York. Here, Devon Terrell plays the future 44th president as a young man who’s unsure of where he fits in — and worries the answer to that is “nowhere.” It’s a more subdued, internal film than you might expect, but it could be a good way to commemorate the last month of Obama’s presidency. Captain America: Civil War (available December 25) Given that the third Captain America entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of 2016’s highest-grossing films, chances are good that those interested in the Russo brothers’ second Cap sequel have already seen it. But it’s well worth revisiting, and not just because it sets up about 15 MCU movies to come. Civil War engages with some heady ideas regarding government oversight and wartime collateral damage, all wrapped up in the trappings of a sticky revenge thriller. Plus, the big airport showdown between feuding Avengers factions is one of the most purely grin-inducing superhero set pieces ever, one of the few compelling arguments for the ever-expanding bloat of the MCU. New in December on Hulu Pulp Fiction (available December 1) Quentin Tarantino’s 1994 neo-noir dark comedy classic bent a lot of moviegoers’ minds with its nonlinear storytelling about hit men, a gangster’s wife, bandits, and a boxer. The film won the prestigious Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and garnered an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and it manages to be both a cult favorite and one of the most important films of all time. The Legend of Drunken Master (available December 1) In 1978’s Drunken Master made a name for a then-unknown 24-year-old Jackie Chan thanks to its brilliant fight sequences and Chan’s ability to combine incredible martial arts with physical comedy. Years later, as an international star, Chan returned to tackle the story of 19th-century martial arts artist Wong Fei-hung with The Legend of Drunken Master , a reboot of the first film that repeats Wong’s journey from alcoholic wastrel son to a master of Zui Quan , or drunken fighting, but with a rollicking heist trajectory thrown in. As with the first film, what makes The Legend of Drunken Master stand out are the extended, intense fighting sequences — but with Chan at his peak and with a major studio budget at his disposal, these fight scenes are arguably even more entertaining. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (available December 1) If you’re ever in need of a warm and heartfelt distraction, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is a solid option. The adaptation of Ann Brashares’s hit novel follows its source’s splintering into four different teen girl perspectives as they spend a summer apart, connected only by the single pair of jeans that somehow fits them all. Also, the four women are played by America Ferrera, Blake Lively, Amber Tamblyn, and Alexis Bledel circa 2005, which can make for some excellent “aw, remember when?” moments. This I s Spinal Tap (available December 1) You can trace the rise of comedy’s “mockumentary” style right back to This I s Spinal Tap ’sruthlessly funny satire of outlandish rock star exploits and the people who indulge them. As written by and starring Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and Rob Reiner (who also directed), This I s Spinal Tap is packed with so many jokes that it’ll take at least a couple of viewings to catch them all. Might as well reserve an evening to settle in and crank this movie up to 11. Stories We Tell (available December 3) Director and actress Sarah Polley started out making a documentary about her parents, and especially about the life and loves of her mother. But in the course of making the film, she discovered something about herself that upended everything she thought she knew to be true. This deeply moving picture is a formally inventive, thoughtful documentary — and one that it’s best you know as little about as possible before watching. New in December on Amazon Prime Lars and the Real Girl (available December 1) For a whimsy-packed story about a reclusive loner and the sex doll he insists is his real live girlfriend, Lars and the Real Girl is a remarkably sincere movie. Much of the credit for that goes to Ryan Gosling’s performance as the titular Lars, but it’s also due to the script’s approach of treating Lars’s delusion with empathy and relative nuance. The people around Lars worry about the emotional connection he’s formed with “Bianca,” but they also indulge his fantasy because they believe it will help him in the long run. That Lars mostly sidesteps all the potential problems its wacky premise implies is a tiny miracle. The Lobster (available December 2) Set in a dystopian near future, The Lobster is a (very) dark comedy about how we expect people to form relationships — and their status when they don’t. Colin Farrell plays David, who is sent to the hotel to which all single people must go and find a mate within 45 days. If they don’t, they are transformed into beasts and sent into the wild for good. It’s stark, biting, and brutally funny. Mozart in the Jungle , season three (available December 9) Mozart in the Jungle won a Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy TV Series last year, along with one for Gael García Bernal as its lead. But don’t take it too seriously. In its first two seasons, Mozart in the Jungle was a perfect antidote for the era of Too Much TV, a lighthearted comedy about professional musicians and trying to make it in the big city. With Bernal and Lola Kirke leading the cast, it’s pure delight. Anomalisa (available December 17) Charlie Kaufman’s puppet-based dramedy is fairly light on the second part of that portmanteau; it’s an incredibly sad film at heart, and most of the laughs to be had are of the nervous and/or ironic variety. But nonetheless, it’s a movie experience like few others. The film’s stop-motion puppet animation is purposefully unsettling — especially during a weird and lovely sex scene — and thankfully humanized with soulful voice performances from David Thewlis (as a depressed sales rep at a bland convention) and especially Jennifer Jason Leigh (as an insecure young woman who catches his eye). Café Society (Available December 22) Woody Allen’s latest movie throws an all-star cast — from Kristen Stewart to Blake Lively to Steve Carell — into 1930s Hollywood, where screwball romances and foiled Oscar campaigns reign supreme. Jesse Eisenberg plays Allen’s requisite neurotic creative, who falls in love with Stewart’s character while accidentally-on-purpose romancing Lively’s. (All things considered, he could have it a whole lot worse.) Caf é Society didn’t make a huge splash when it debuted, but hey, it sure is pretty! New in December on HBO Now Singles (available December 1) The 1990s revival is still going strong, so join in on the cultural regression with a viewing of what might be the most ’90s movie ever: Singles, Cameron Crowe’s paean to the Seattle grunge scene and the Gen-Xers who inhabited it . Centering on the romantic entanglements of two central couples and their various associates, Singles is ostensibly a rom-com — and Crowe’s effervescent dialogue matches that tone well — but it’s more notable as a relatively authentic time capsule of a specific cultural milieu that’s since been appropriated and diluted by modern trends. They Live (available December 1) Director John Carpenter’s action-satire of 1980s yuppie America has become exemplary of anyone who can’t quite believe the out-of-whack priorities of all the idiots they’re forced to live near. In it, a man finds sunglasses that allow him to see that aliens have taken over the planet by disguising themselves as the rich and powerful — and he launches a one-man war to take it back. It’s also the movie that contains the famous line “I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I’m all out of bubblegum.” Keanu (available December 3) Keanu is a pretty stupid comedy, but one with great performers: Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele ( Key & Peele ) take their act to the big screen, playing buddies who pretend to be drug dealers in order to get back a kitten (named Keanu). In keeping with the pair’s usual themes, Keanu turns absurd situations into a way of exploring the nuances of code switching and how we expect people to “perform” race in America. (The kitten turns in a good performance too.) Midnight Special (available December 17) The first 2016 film from director Jeff Nichols (who also directed the new Loving ) is soulful science fiction at its best; those who’ve recently seen and dug Arrival should definitely check out Midnight Special , which has a similar tone, but with a more spiritual thematic bent, as well as a deep, complicated central story about parents and children. Blending elements of the heist film, the road movie, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Nichols’s film is a slow burn that metes out its set pieces frugally, but great performances from Michael Shannon, Kirsten Dunst, Adam Driver, and Joel Edgerton keep the flame bright throughout. Hail, Caesar! (available December 24) The Coen brothers’ homage to old Hollywood features Josh Brolin as a high-powered fixer experiencing both a crisis of faith and a crisis of vocation during a few particularly screwy days. There’s also synchronized swimming siren Scarlett Johansson, tap-dancing Channing Tatum, philandering centurion George Clooney, gossip columnist Tilda Swinton, and a shadowy cabal of communists. It’s pure confection with an ethical core. Was this article helpful?",

      "title": "Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker",
      "text": "Amazon Echo \nLike Rome and Carthage, Google and Amazon continue to try and seize footholds in each other’s territory. The drumbeats of war again resounded when Google revealed a new speaker during its Google I/O keynote in May. Google Home was seen as a direct response to the Amazon Echo, a smart speaker that can respond to users’ questions and commands. Amazon certainly had the head start in this competition, having launched the Echo in late 2014. The Echo was an impressive device at launch — as our review indicates — meaning the Home needed to make quite the splash to catch up with its worthy adversary. Now that the fateful day of digital assistant, smart-home reckoning is here, how do these two products stack up against one another in terms of design, features, and pricing? \nMore: Google Home review Design \nAs if to highlight the inherent differences between the Home and Echo, Google’s device features a plain white body, in contrast to the Echo’s dark chassis. \nThe Home features LED lights on the top to indicate when the device is working and a touch-sensitive top. It also touts a modular base, so you can swap out the default base for one that better matches your living space. The petite, curvy device certainly seems friendlier than Amazon’s tiny monolith. Of course, the Echo is beautiful in its own way, with a sturdy build and matte black (or all-white ) finish that conveys dependability. Judging purely by aesthetics, you will have to decide which device suits your decor better. \nLike the Echo — but unlike Amazon’s like-minded Tap speaker — the Home must be plugged in to function . This means you’ll have to consider its placement in your home and you won’t be carrying it around, but Google promises that tethering it to an outlet makes it a better speaker. When we first reviewed the Echo, we noted that while it won’t win any audiophiles’ hearts, it’s a full-sounding speaker with a respectable amount of bass. It’s also loud enough to fill up a fairly large room. Caleb Denison, a Digital Trends’ senior editor thinks the Echo outperforms the Home on sound, writing in our review, “While Amazon’s full-size Echo has a very large sound with full bass that doesn’t go overboard, Google’s Home over-juices the bass, and ends up sounding like it’s trying too hard.” \nWith Home, you can utilize other speakers via Wi-Fi and Google “Cast,” making th is one of the biggest differences between the two smart devices. The Echo can also sync with the Amazon Tap or Dot to give you great flexibility (and portability) when setting up your home audio system and smart home. \nIt appears that Google would prefer owners to sync their Home and Cast devices, or include several Homes, to fulfill the same role as the all-encompassing Echo, Dot, and Tap. By u tilizing Google Home in unison with the supported devices, you are able to play music in various rooms across your home, while still reaping the device’s voice-controlled features. \nOnce Home and all correlating devices are fully mapped, you can make very specific requests. Ask Home to “Play Santo and Johnny in the living room,” for instance, and the device will have Sleep Walk playing in no time. This makes Google Home similar to Sonos’ speaker systems, with the added benefit of voice-command technology. It shares similar functionality with Chromecast devices, too, letting you play YouTube videos on your TV by saying something like, “OK, Google, play the Rogue One trailer on the living room TV.” Even in a house brimming with Google Homes, the company claims that only the closest unit will respond. Both the Echo and the Home also utilize microphones with far-field technology. Google claims it has incorporated hundreds of thousands of various audio environments to ensure the Home can isolate speech even in an environment with added ambient sounds. Winner: Home on adaptability, Echo on sound",

      "text": "Advice from an Amazon elevator. I’m Not Banksy, But My Drawings in Amazon’s Elevators Came Close Written by December 1, 2016 // 11:50 AM EST Copy This URL \nEditor's note: Amazon's success has been powered by a work environment that's rather unique among major corporations, and occasionally former Amazonians have offered to share with Motherboard readers some insight into what the day-to-day is like. Previously: At Amazon, Employees Treat the Bathroom Like an Extension of the Office . \nWhiteboards are a key part of any technology company. You can sketch system architectures, business strategies, lines of code. When I worked at Amazon, our elevators were lined with them. \nAn elevator ride in a less-than-ten story building is never long enough to conduct any substantial whiteboard business. Instead, the whiteboards became a medium for candid self-expression from employees. \nThe drawings, whether they were mine or my coworkers, captured short moments of pure honesty as we headed in and out of the office. The messages were often simple. I don’t attribute this to the people, but rather the brevity of the trips. The scribbles would often be basic notes like “I hate Mondays!” or “Happy Friday!” with many people adding “+1” to express approval. \nPeople often assume I was an engineer when I say I worked for a technology company. That’s probably racist, and definitely incorrect. At my desk, I was an entry-level Amazonian. But in the elevator, I was an artist. \nMost of the photos I’ve shared are my own scrawlings. This was mostly my selfish human nature: I thought my art was better. But I imagine others did the same—scrambling to photograph their own inside jokes, not even telling their friends at work which “pieces” were theirs. \nI saw expressions of frustration, joy, and humor, some my own. There’s no shortage of criticism and employee-penned defense—I don’t intend to add to the pile here. But I saw both sides in the elevator. \nBut sometimes, you’d catch a glimpse into the psyche and morale of the individuals that made up our company, based on the doodles. \nSome of the scribbles were genuinely funny. This was the first time I’d seen “Don’t let your dreams be memes.” It was the perfect bit of office humor: short, funny, tinged with a sense of hopelessness and despair anyone can relate to. I’d later Google to find this is a certified dank meme that did not originate in our elevator. \nThe second part, “Fill Your Life with the Tears of People,” was also funny. (I believe it said “Smiles” before “Tears.”) \nAn employee’s simple addition of the NSFW tag to a poster, I saw as a flash of brilliant wit. \nOther writings were a bit darker. A simple shaded letter: Playoffs were now Layoffs. This was not my work, but was amazed how one small edit subverted the entire message. After all there were so many “jokes” internally and externally of drones replacing workers. This was true art. I was inspired. \nI found my true calling. Yes, I was still just an entry-level employee. But when I stepped in the elevator, I was a subversive temporary graffiti artist, not unlike Banksy. I wanted people to go higher than ten floors. In their mind. \nPeople loved football. Someone liked “the NYT” a bit less. I assume they were talking about the New York Times, but I cannot say with 100 percent certainty because I didn't write it. \nI hypothesized this employee, lashing out on the paper of record because of the “hit piece” on Amazon , had a case of Stockholm syndrome stronger than mine. But I came to realize that’s an entitled comparison, as hostages don’t get a salary, medical, or vision benefits. \nAfter carefully measured externally-facing responses from company employees and company in the media, this was a rare expression of raw emotion that I didn’t agree with, but understood. Please note this happened long before a certain butternut-squash-hued demagogue began targeting the Times. This phrase did not carry the same message it would today. \nSometimes I’d write “the article…” just to see what people would write back. It wasn’t my best work. In retrospect, it was a dick move. But the most controversial art is simple, to the point, and evokes strong feelings. This piece definitely evoked strong reactions, because whenever I would write it, it would only stay up for a few minutes before being erased in a subsequent elevator ride. \nWhen I wasn’t trying to annoy my coworkers, I was trying to impress them. The +1 was coveted praise for me. To scream into the void, and have someone reply, “Yeah, me too” was reaffirming, like a hug, or a favorite from Twitter.com. \nI would sometimes toss up ideas I had, as a way of doing market research. \nHere, I tested my binary concept restaurant, “Soup or Gyro.” A play on the phrase “Super Hero,” you can only get soup, or a gyro. No one +1’d it, which is fine. I wasn’t mad about it then, and I still am not today. Many people laughed at Steve Jobs when he invented the computer, but who’s laughing now? \nHere, I tried to explain how business works. Leads are entered into the Cloud, which then return to Earth in the form of Money. It looks like one other person had an opinion on this, then another decided that opinion was not valid. It’s important to note, when given the option, people will censor each other. \nI would often write “Free Gucci Mane,” simply because no one else did. Metadata would show this photo was taken August 25, 2015. Gucci Mane is a free man today. \nAs an unofficial member of the Kanye for President street team, I also confirmed there is at least one other employee whose entertaining the idea of the greatest artist of our time becoming the Head of State. \nIn this piece, I campaigned for a Ketchum-Oak presidential campaign, before Pokémon Go came out. No one appreciated it then, but here we are today. \nPeople in general, and especially at my company, loved freebies. Whether it was leftover cookies or catering from a meeting, if you sent an email saying free stuff was available, it would be gone within minutes. I’d like to think at least one person went to the second floor and asked where the soup was. \nThis piece was arguably my most provocative. Inspired by the promotional poster talking about climbing the corporate ladder, it was the last piece I crafted before leaving the company the following month. \nLike any brave and groundbreaking graffiti artist, I’d sometimes run into obstacles. For example, I could be taking a photo of my work, when the elevator would open. What if they saw me documenting my work? I’d be exposed, possibly scolded. In my haste, I’d sometimes end up with photos of the floor. Topics: Amazon , inside Amazon , Tech Companies , business , art , Banksy Contact Motherboard by  ",

      "text": "Amazon's new Snowmobile data truck. Image: Amazon It's Time to Start Thinking of Amazon as a Transportation Company Written by December 1, 2016 // 10:00 AM EST Copy This URL \nAmazon’s newest toy is here, just in time for the holidays. Nope, it’s not a drone . It’s not taking flight at all , although it’s in the cargo business. It’s a 45-foot-long shipping container that hauls a million gigabytes of your precious data. \nDubbed Snowmobile , the truck stores up to 100 petabytes, or 1 million gigabytes, of data to move exabytes to Amazon Web Services “in a matter of weeks.” It’s in the family of Amazon’s smaller-scale data transfer project Snowball , which moves less-massive amounts of data via an appliance sent through regional carriers. \nIt rolled onto the stage at the Las Vegas re:Invent 2016 conference to the electric synth-guitar licks of a professional wrestler’s entrance music: \nAWS Angel Gonzalez November 30, 2016 \nAnd despite the comically flashy unveiling, Amazon appears to be offering this idea as a serious business, writing on an FAQ page : \"Snowmobile jobs cost $0.005/GB/month based on the amount of provisioned Snowmobile storage capacity and the end to end duration of the job, which starts when a Snowmobile departs an AWS data center for delivery to the time when data ingestion into AWS is complete.\" \nAs for how that job looks: one (or more) of these big rigs backs it up to your data center, plugs-in with a fiber connection, glug-glugs your financial data, millions of feature-length films, scads of scientific data (or whatever you’ve got hoarded), and trucks it away to one of Amazon's cloud storage services. This process cuts what would be a years or decades-long transfer over the Internet down to weeks. \nThe trailer is equipped with GPS tracking, is waterproof, climate-controlled, and comes with a security escort vehicle and guards to watch over your transfer. It takes 10 days to fill the truck, but Amazon will supply security in case someone tries to pull off a physical heist of your data. \nThe truck is just the latest in a series of announcements that have Amazon looking more like a transportation business than a mere online retailer. Shipping costs have long been Amazon’s “big albatross,” as Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consulting firm MWPVL International, which follows Amazon closely told Motherboard last year : “They’re always looking for ways to bring that under control.\" \nConsidering how Uber’s self-driving truck subsidiary Otto showed off its own machismo-loaded autonomous rig last month , and given with Amazon’s interest in intelligent mapping systems and autonomous delivery via drone, it’s not hard to see where this project might one day end up. Amazon could be the Uber of cargo instead of people, and increasingly, that cargo is digital data. But for now at least, humans will still be at the wheel. \nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .

      "text": "Today Only: Monopoly Classic For $14.99 From Amazon \nThis was $24.99 earlier this week and is now the lowest price ever from Amazon. \nI’m a Monopoly purist. No bonuses for snake eyes, no money for free parking (who pays you to park somewhere anyway?!?), no bonus for landing on Go. The extra money is the reason people have the misconception that the game takes forever. If you play with the rules as they were actually designed without all of the handouts, people go bankrupt quickly and the game ends within an hour. \nHasbro ruined Monopoly for me with the current version. They changed the chance and community chest cards, changed the luxury tax, changed the dark purple properties to brows, and changed the income tax structure. Hasbro even managed to destroy Guess Who in the latest version of it, and that takes talent! They should take some lessons from New Coke, you just can’t improve on something classic.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking/Files GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD PACKAGE - SEARCH “BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD APRIL 20” FOR ALL IMAGES Washington Post Dec 1, 2016 at 3:25 pm | Print View \nAmazon is continuing its push into online streaming video by letting its Prime customers purchase monthly subscriptions to HBO and Cinemax from their Amazon accounts. \nHBO will be available on Prime for $15 a month, while the Cinemax add-on will cost $10 a month, Amazon said in a release. \nBoth channels also recently were announced as add-ons to AT&T’s new streaming service, DirecTV Now, highlighting HBO and Cinemax’s attempts to reach beyond their traditional audience of cable subscribers. \nAs many as 20 million U.S. households lack cable TV, AT&T estimates, either because they canceled their plans or because they never had one. \nNumbers from Sandvine show Amazon Video accounts for 4.26 percent of all internet traffic consumed in North America during peak hours versus 35 percent for Netflix.

      "text": "on Dec 1, 2016, 3:45 PM TechSpot \nAmazon is continuing its push into online streaming video with the addition of two new Channel add-ons for Prime video members: HBO and Cinemax . The HBO package is $14.99 per month for unlimited streaming access to its TV shows and full movie library, which is the same price as an HBO now subscription, while Cinemax is a bit cheaper at $9.99 per month. \nAmazon Channels was launched in late 2015 and currently lets Prime members select from more than 70 video subscriptions to add them to their existing membership. Current partners include Showtime, Starz, Acorn TV, NBCUniversal’s Seeso, Machinima, Warner Bros.’ DramaFever, Tribeca Shortlist, Comedy Central’s Stand-Up Plus, and the service recently added PBS Kids and Fandor. \nHaving yet another way to get HBO may seem unnecessary when you can already get it directly through HBO's own streaming app for the same price, and other over-the-top streaming services. However, if you are a heavy Prime ecosystem user, adding HBO through Prime will let you stay within that ecosystem when flipping between channels rather than having to cycle through multiple apps. \nAmazon offers free 30-day trials with all Amazon Channels subscriptions. \nAmazon has been positioning itself as a capable competitor to Netflix. The service was previously only available to annual Prime subscribers for $99 per year, but the company began offering a monthly $8.99 Prime subscription back in April, and has been putting more money into original programming too.

      "text": "Advice from an Amazon elevator. I’m Not Banksy, But My Drawings in Amazon’s Elevators Came Close Written by 1 December 2016 // 11:50 AM CET Copy This URL \nEditor's note: Amazon's success has been powered by a work environment that's rather unique among major corporations, and occasionally former Amazonians have offered to share with Motherboard readers some insight into what the day-to-day is like. Previously: At Amazon, Employees Treat the Bathroom Like an Extension of the Office . \nWhiteboards are a key part of any technology company. You can sketch system architectures, business strategies, lines of code. When I worked at Amazon, our elevators were lined with them. \nAn elevator ride in a less-than-ten story building is never long enough to conduct any substantial whiteboard business. Instead, the whiteboards became a medium for candid self-expression from employees. \nThe drawings, whether they were mine or my coworkers, captured short moments of pure honesty as we headed in and out of the office. The messages were often simple. I don’t attribute this to the people, but rather the brevity of the trips. The scribbles would often be basic notes like “I hate Mondays!” or “Happy Friday!” with many people adding “+1” to express approval. \nPeople often assume I was an engineer when I say I worked for a technology company. That’s probably racist, and definitely incorrect. At my desk, I was an entry-level Amazonian. But in the elevator, I was an artist. \nMost of the photos I’ve shared are my own scrawlings. This was mostly my selfish human nature: I thought my art was better. But I imagine others did the same—scrambling to photograph their own inside jokes, not even telling their friends at work which “pieces” were theirs. \nI saw expressions of frustration, joy, and humor, some my own. There’s no shortage of criticism and employee-penned defense—I don’t intend to add to the pile here. But I saw both sides in the elevator. \nBut sometimes, you’d catch a glimpse into the psyche and morale of the individuals that made up our company, based on the doodles. \nSome of the scribbles were genuinely funny. This was the first time I’d seen “Don’t let your dreams be memes.” It was the perfect bit of office humor: short, funny, tinged with a sense of hopelessness and despair anyone can relate to. I’d later Google to find this is a certified dank meme that did not originate in our elevator. \nThe second part, “Fill Your Life with the Tears of People,” was also funny. (I believe it said “Smiles” before “Tears.”) \nAn employee’s simple addition of the NSFW tag to a poster, I saw as a flash of brilliant wit. \nOther writings were a bit darker. A simple shaded letter: Playoffs were now Layoffs. This was not my work, but was amazed how one small edit subverted the entire message. After all there were so many “jokes” internally and externally of drones replacing workers. This was true art. I was inspired. \nI found my true calling. Yes, I was still just an entry-level employee. But when I stepped in the elevator, I was a subversive temporary graffiti artist, not unlike Banksy. I wanted people to go higher than ten floors. In their mind. \nPeople loved football. Someone liked “the NYT” a bit less. I assume they were talking about the New York Times, but I cannot say with 100 percent certainty because I didn't write it. \nI hypothesized this employee, lashing out on the paper of record because of the “hit piece” on Amazon , had a case of Stockholm syndrome stronger than mine. But I came to realize that’s an entitled comparison, as hostages don’t get a salary, medical, or vision benefits. \nAfter carefully measured externally-facing responses from company employees and company in the media, this was a rare expression of raw emotion that I didn’t agree with, but understood. Please note this happened long before a certain butternut-squash-hued demagogue began targeting the Times. This phrase did not carry the same message it would today. \nSometimes I’d write “the article…” just to see what people would write back. It wasn’t my best work. In retrospect, it was a dick move. But the most controversial art is simple, to the point, and evokes strong feelings. This piece definitely evoked strong reactions, because whenever I would write it, it would only stay up for a few minutes before being erased in a subsequent elevator ride. \nWhen I wasn’t trying to annoy my coworkers, I was trying to impress them. The +1 was coveted praise for me. To scream into the void, and have someone reply, “Yeah, me too” was reaffirming, like a hug, or a favorite from Twitter.com. \nI would sometimes toss up ideas I had, as a way of doing market research. \nHere, I tested my binary concept restaurant, “Soup or Gyro.” A play on the phrase “Super Hero,” you can only get soup, or a gyro. No one +1’d it, which is fine. I wasn’t mad about it then, and I still am not today. Many people laughed at Steve Jobs when he invented the computer, but who’s laughing now? \nHere, I tried to explain how business works. Leads are entered into the Cloud, which then return to Earth in the form of Money. It looks like one other person had an opinion on this, then another decided that opinion was not valid. It’s important to note, when given the option, people will censor each other. \nI would often write “Free Gucci Mane,” simply because no one else did. Metadata would show this photo was taken August 25, 2015. Gucci Mane is a free man today. \nAs an unofficial member of the Kanye for President street team, I also confirmed there is at least one other employee whose entertaining the idea of the greatest artist of our time becoming the Head of State. \nIn this piece, I campaigned for a Ketchum-Oak presidential campaign, before Pokémon Go came out. No one appreciated it then, but here we are today. \nPeople in general, and especially at my company, loved freebies. Whether it was leftover cookies or catering from a meeting, if you sent an email saying free stuff was available, it would be gone within minutes. I’d like to think at least one person went to the second floor and asked where the soup was. \nThis piece was arguably my most provocative. Inspired by the promotional poster talking about climbing the corporate ladder, it was the last piece I crafted before leaving the company the following month. \nLike any brave and groundbreaking graffiti artist, I’d sometimes run into obstacles. For example, I could be taking a photo of my work, when the elevator would open. What if they saw me documenting my work? I’d be exposed, possibly scolded. In my haste, I’d sometimes end up with photos of the floor. Topics: Amazon , inside Amazon , Tech Companies , business , art , Banksy Contact Motherboard by  ",

( more ) ►Sharpeners I use in this video (Amazon affiliates links) ※These sharpeners seem to be sold more expensively outside of Japan. I believe you can find cheaper ones that are decent online as well. Zwilling J.A. Henckels also has good sharpening stones which I have used before. Unlike the ones I used in this video, you don't need to soak it in water to sharpen a knife (but it still needs to be wet). Shapton (Orange) #1000: http://amzn.to/2gI5D3O Other cheaper sharpener I found: Japanese King Knife Sharpener Whetstone (#1000 & #6000) http://amzn.to/2gIMph8 Sharpening stones come in grits, and these two grits would be enough for a normal household knife. I used grits 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 8,000, and 12,000 in this video. The higher the number, the finer the sanding and the sharper the knife will be. Sharpening with Bob Kramer",

      "text": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) seems to be hitting the purple patch, as its Amazon Web Services, or AWS, announced two contract wins in as many days.\n2 Deals, 2 Days Amazon announced on Tuesday that Capital One has selected AWS as its predominant cloud infrastructure provider.\nClose on heels of the company picking up Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF ) as its cloud customer, it announced Wednesday Workday Inc (NYSE: WDAY ) too has selected its AWS as its preferred public cloud infrastructure provider for customer production workloads.\nAmazon stated that it is offering the option of running Workday's full suite of applications, including Workday Financial Management and Workday Human Capital Management for the first time in the public cloud. Workday said it would make available the option of using, either AWS Cloud or Workday data centers, to its customers in Canada in calendar year 2017 and then look to expand the scope geographically.\nRE:Invent Revelations In the AWS re:Invent Conference held in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Amazon announced seven new compute services and capabilities to support an even wider range of workloads.\nThe company unveiled the next generation of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which is memory optimized, compute optimized, and has high input/output (I/O) instances, and features the latest processors, storage technologies and enhanced networking. The new F1 instance with customer-programmable Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) boosts performance 30 times relative to general purpose CPU. Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs allow customers to easily attach low-cost, professional grade graphics acceleration to Amazon EC2 instances. AWS also announced Amazon Lightsail, which gives developers the ability to launch powerful virtual private servers in only three clicks for a simple, low monthly price. At last check, Amazon shares were slipping 1.34 percent to $752.44.\n ",

      "text": "More Articles » \nWhen it comes to the cloud, no single vendor is bigger than Amazon, and when it comes to cloud conferences there is nothing like Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent. While most technology vendors use conferences to announce several new services, Amazon uses its re:Invent keynotes to announce dozens of new services. \nAt the re:Invent 2016 conference that wraps up today in Las Vegas, Amazon announced new code, developer, artificial intelligence, database and security services. The new services will add to AWS existing roster which helped Amazon to generate $3.2 billion in cloud revenue during the third quarter of its fiscal 2016. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy used the theme of giving organizations and developers 'superpowers' during his keynote. Among the superpowers that Jassy wants developers to have in the cloud is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Three new AI services were announced including Amazon Lex, which gives organization the ability to build conversational voice based interfaces, similar to Amazon's Alexa consumer service. \nWhile Lex gives cloud applications to converse, the new Polly service gives the cloud up to 42 voices that can be used for text-to-speech services. The third new AI service is called Rekognize which provides image analysis to help detect objects and faces. \nAmazon also wants to make it easier for organizations to get into the cloud, which is where the new Amazon Lightsail service fits in. Lightsail is a direct competitor to the popular DigitalOcean cloud service, which provides users with Virtual Private Services (VPS) starting at only $5 a month, including compute, storage and data bandwidth. \nData processing is also a superpower that Amazon wants to give the cloud, with the new Amazon Athena service. Athena is a query service for Amazon's popular S3 storage platform. \n\"Customers have frequently asked us whether we could make it easy for anyone to run queries on their data in Amazon S3 without having to worry about provisioning or managing servers and clusters. Now they can,\" Raju Gulabani, Vice President, Databases, Analytics, and AI, AWS, said in a statement. \"There is absolutely zero admin with Amazon Athena – anyone who can write a SQL query can analyze their data in Amazon S3.\" \nFor developers, there are also several new tools to help in the code development and deployment lifecycle. The new AWS Codebuild service provides a cloud platform for code compilation while Amazon-X-Ray is a way to identify bugs and performance issues in code. Managed batch processing comes to the cloud with AWS Batch and AWS Step Functions enables the co-ordinations of distributed applications. \nData transformation gets superpowers with the new AWS Glue service which provides ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) capabilities to users. Security is also key focus for Amazon and is being address with the new AWS Shield platform which provides Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection for cloud users. \nSean Michael Kerner is a senior editor at Datamation and InternetNews.com.

      "text": "Amazon Is Taking Pre-Orders For The Beoplay H9 Headphones December 1, 2016 - Written By Justin Diaz \nBang & Olufsen is now listing their new Beoplay H9 headphones over at Amazon where you can now pre-order the upcoming cans just in time for the holiday season. While there is only an option to pre-order right now, the headphones do launch on December 8th which is just around the corner, meaning you’ll have them well before December 24th if you’re worried about getting them in time to have them wrapped and under the tree ready and waiting. When it comes to high quality audio, there are few brands as prominent as Bang & Olufsen and if you’ve ever had the opportunity to experience any one of their speakers or other pairs of headphones, then you’ll know you’re in for a treat with these. \nThe Beoplay H9 are completely wireless, so what you’re getting with them are an unencumbered listening experience where you won’t have to deal with wires keeping you tethered to whatever device you’re connecting to. Since these are Bluetooth enabled they will drain your battery a little more than if you simply plugged in a corded pair of headphones, but that said, they do boast up to 14 hours of audio playback and there is an option to connect devices via a 3.5mm audio cable if you prefer, which will allow you to keep the music going even if the battery dies, or if you simply want to reserve the battery life until later use. \nThese are an over the ear style of headphones and are made from premium materials like anodized aluminum, lambskin, memory foam, and cowhide leather, and the headphones come in two separate colors which includes Black, and Argilla Grey. Controls are handled by the aluminum touch interface on the side, so there’s no buttons to mess with. The headphones also support voice calls just in case one comes in while you’re listening to music. In addition to the premium style and build quality, as well as the wireless nature of connectivity, these are designed with an active noise cancelling feature which is meant to help enhance the experience of sound so if you want to drown out the noise around you and enjoy the audio of whatever it is you’re listening to fully, you have the option. While these are sure to be an excellent pair of headphones, the Beoplay H9 headphones will come at a premium as Bang & Olufsen is a premium brand, with a set at a price of $499 if you decide to pick these up.",

      "text": "Amazon Debuts Three New AI-Powered Cloud Tools December 1, 2016 - Written By Dominik Bosnjak \nEarlier this year, Amazon announced plans to implement additional artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing unit. Back then, the Seattle-based tech giant explained that it’s looking to offer as many cloud-based AI applications as possible to not fall behind competitors like Google and Microsoft who have been doing the same. About a month later, the company recruited Alex Smola , a top machine learning expert from the Carnegie Mellon University who recently relocated to San Francisco where he started working at Amazon’s new AI lab. As the Seattle-based retail giant put it, Smola was hired specifically to help the company improve its cloud computing business. \nAnd that brings us to today. As it turns, Amazon just announced three new AI tools for Amazon Web Services. All three new offerings are based on the technology utilized by the Alexa digital assistant. They’ve been designed for AWS developers looking to create software which can be controlled via conversational user interfaces, i.e. which supports voice control. Apart from text-to-speech algorithms, these new tools feature Amazon’s latest computer vision technology which can recognize various objects, scenes, and people’s faces. \nMore specifically, the new products debuted by the Seattle-based company are called Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition. Lex is a tool for building conversational user interfaces, powered by the same recognition technology utilized by Alexa. Simply speaking, Lex can be used to develop chatbots powered by Amazon’s AI technology. However, solutions created with Lex can’t speak on their own. For that, they need Polly, a tool infused with Amazon’s text-to-speech service which sounds much more natural than an average text-to-speech solution. The retail giant claims Polly can speak 23 languages in 47 voices, which means this is one of the most advanced text-to-speech developer tools ever created. Last but not least, there’s the curiously named Amazon Rekognition. Rekognition is Amazon’s solution for enabling computer vision in apps. The company claims this technology can recognize people’s facial expressions and use them to deduce how they are feeling. In addition to that, it can identify various objects and scenes. Given how it’s capable of deep learning, Rekognition also gets better at recognizing things over time. All three tools began rolling out today in some regions, though Lex is still in the technical preview phase of development. App developers who want to learn more can refer to Amazon’s press release available via the source link below. Post navigation",

      "text": "Stuart 1 Comment \nOver at Amazon, this Streamlight Stylus Pro LED flashlight is on sale for $14.31. \nThe Stylus Pro is a fantastic LED flashlight. It’s pocketable, it’s durable, it’s reasonably bright, and it’s powered by 2 standard AAA batteries. Advertisement \nI don’t remember the specs for mine, but the new ones are said to output 90 lumens, and are water resistant with a IPX4 rating. \nThey operate via a push button tail cap, which I would characterize as firm, unless they changed something. This is good because it means it’s difficult to turn it on accidentally, but perhaps not so good for older finger joints. \nI’ve got 2 of these – one in black and one in blue – and also a Streamlight Stylus Pro Reach . I have also ordered quite a few as reader giveaway items over the years. So far, no complaints! \nOne of my flashlights did behave weirdly once, but I took the tail cap off, swapped the batteries around, and there haven’t been any issues since! \nWith the current promo, you save around $5 on each flashlight, or around 25% of the price. \nIn case you’re not familiar with the brand, Streamlight is well known for their quality and fantastic customer service. \nUpdate: I just ordered 2 for myself. While I don’t care for the color choice, perhaps a silver colored flashlight will be easier to find on my cluttered workbench. \nPrice: $14 and change \nSee Also (More Streamlight Savings) \n(Shipping is free for Prime members, or for non-Prime members on $49+ orders. When did Amazon increase the free shipping threshold for non-Prime members? Yikes!) \nThere are several other colors to choose from , but only the silver is on sale. \nIn case you’re wondering about the Pro part in Stylus Pro, the non-Pro Stylus lights are thinner penlights that work with AAAA batteries. I’d rather not deal with AAAA cells, but you can buy them, and some users have harvested them from 9V batteries. In addition to being harder to find, AAAA cells seem to have a shorter shelf life than AA and AA cells. Share:",

      "text": "Over at Amazon, today’s deal of the day features this Dewalt 20V Max 4-tool cordless combo kit, for $249 $229. \nThe kit comes with their regular DCD780 drill/driver, DCF885 impact driver, DCS393 non-premium circular saw, and DCL040 LED worklight. The bundle includes a tool bag, charger, and (2) 2.0Ah Li-ion battery packs. Advertisement \nUpdate: The price is now $229! *Looks over shoulder.* I wonder what prompted the added price reduction! \nIf you ordered at $249, contact Amazon and ask for a price adjustment. \nThis is a pretty good deal, but the same combo kit, DCK421D2, was on sale for $229 last June . Well, not exactly. It was also on sale for $249, but last June there was a $20 off $100+ that stacked. This year’s $25 off $100+ discount does not appear to stack on top of the deal price. (Maybe they learned from what happened in June.) \nThis deal comes around twice a year. As mentioned in the previous deal post , which you might want to look at for the deeper discussion and comments, this deal typically hits in the first 2 days of December, and smack in the middle of June, for Father’s Day. \nSo I guess it should have easily predictable for this kit to come around again. \n$249 is a good price for what you get. Deal ends at 3am ET 12/2/2016 unless supplies run out sooner. \n$229 is even better! \nBuy Now \nOR… \nFor the same $249, there’s a 3-speed hammer drill and impact driver combo kit, with a better circular saw as the free add-on choice . That option doesn’t get you the LED worklight, but you get higher capacity battery packs. You could also choose a premium reciprocating saw, or other item as the bonus item. \nThat’s the closest you could get to this deal, and you might even consider it an evenly matched deal, or perhaps an even better one since you get a pricier 3-speed drill and 3Ah battery packs. \nIf you’ve got a bigger budget, look at Dewalt’s latest brushless drill and impact driver combo , which is $259 – $25 promo = $234. The premium circular saw, DCS391B, is $119 , so I’d try to shop around on that. Share:",

      "title": "Amazon offers DDoS Protection with Shield",
      "text": "ZDNet Japan Amazon offers DDoS Protection with Shield Frightened of your site getting blown off the internet with a distributed denial of service attack? Amazon can protect you with AWS Shield. \nOnce upon a time, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks were rare. Now, DDoS assaults are common and are increasing by 125 percent year over year. Attackers can create 100 Gbps attacks , enough to knock off any undefended website, just by running scripts. Amazon introduced an answer: AWS Shield . \nAWS Shield will protect your cloud instances from DDoS attackers. \nThis isn't far from the first such service. Akamai , CloudFlare , and Incapsula all offer DDoS mitigation services. AWS Shield, however, is only for AWS customers.   \nWhat Amazon brings to the DDoS battle-line is the sheer scale of Amazon Web Services (AWS). This family of services makes up the world's largest public cloud . \nWerner Vogels, Amazon CTO, in announcing Shield at AWS re:Invent , claimed, \"I think this will really help you protect yourselves even against the largest and most sophisticated attacks that we've seen out there.\" \nI wish them luck with that. Even AWS might shake some with an assault of the magnitude that took down the Dyn Domain Name System (DNS) provider earlier this year. 1.2 Terabits per second (Tbps), which is estimated to be the attack's high point , would be enough to wreck anyone's day. \nThat said, since all AWS customers receive AWS Shield Standard automatic protections free of charge, your cloud instances should be safe from most such attacks. According to Amazon, \"Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your website or applications.\" \nNeed more than the basics? If your AWS apps run on Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront , or Amazon Route 53 , you can subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. \nAWS Shield Advanced is available to Enterprise or Business Support levels of AWS Premium Support customers. In addition, it requires a 1-year subscription commitment and charges a $3,000 monthly fee. On top of this, there's a data transfer usage fee from Amazon CloudFront and ELB. In short, this is a service that only enterprise-level businesses can afford. \nOn the other hand, if you need this level of protection, you probably really need it. \nAmazon claims Shield Advanced provides additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near real-time visibility into attacks, and integration with AWS WAF , a web application firewall. IT also provides you with access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) and protection against DDoS related spikes in your ELB, CloudFront, or Route 53 data transfer charges. \nWith AWS Shield Advanced, you can also write customized rules to mitigate sophisticated application layer attacks. These customizable rules can be deployed instantly, allowing you to quickly mitigate attacks. You can set up proactive rules to automatically block bad traffic, or respond to incidents as they occur. \nFor most AWS customers, Amazon is offering good basic DDoS prevention for free. For enterprises, it's offering sophisticated DDoS mitigation methods for a hefty price-tag. That said, it's a heck of a lot cheaper than battling a serious DDoS attack on your own. \nRelated Stories:",

      "text": "Amazon, Facebook 'Server-Side Optics' Good For Lumentum, Finisar Fiber-optics companies could gain from spending by Amazon Web Services and other cloud leaders. (Amazon) Reprints \nAmazon.com 's ( AMZN ) technology road map for next-generation data centers has upside for optical component makers Finisar ( FNSR ), Lumentum Holdings ( LITE ), Oclaro ( OCLR ), and Acacia Communications ( ACIA ), says a William Blair analyst who attended Amazon's re:Invent cloud computing conference this week. \nInternet companies such as Facebook ( FB ), Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google and Amazon have pioneered open-source software concepts in data centers. They've lowered data center costs by running software on so-called \"white-box\" servers and switches, often built by lesser-known suppliers. \nNow, Amazon Web Services, the cloud business of Amazon, as well as Facebook and Microsoft ( MSFT ) aim to speed up communications by putting high-speed optical components directly in server racks, says William Blair analyst Dmitry Netis, who attended re:Invest. \n\"We believe the move to fiber at a server/rack level opens up a massive opportunity at the transceiver level for datacom optics vendors, specifically Finisar, Lumentum, Oclaro, Inphi ( IPHI ), Macom, and Applied Optoelectronics ( AAOI ),\" said Netis in his research report Thursday. \n\"Assuming two transceiver modules per server at $250 average selling price per module, we arrive to $1.8 billion opportunity for server-side optics,\" Netis estimated. IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optic is at No. 25 among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down from the top spot six weeks ago. IBD's Sector Leaders , on the other hand, includes companies in other fast-growing markets, such as Western Alliance Bancorp., Essent Group, Inphi and Gigamon \nHe says one of Acacia's customers, Adva , is a key data center interconnect supplier to AWS. \nThursday, however, fiber-optic company stocks were among the big losers on a rough day for tech stocks in general. \nLumentum stock was down 5.7% to 37.80 in the stock market today amid the broad sell-off in tech, possibly the result of a sector rotation as more investors move to oil and bank stocks. Shares of Finisar were down 4.3%, Oclaro shed 6.4% and Applied Optoelectronics fell 5.55%. Acacia stock was down 5.6%, while Ciena ( CIEN ) was down 3.3%. \nLumentum, Oclaro and Ciena all fell below their 50-day lines. Ciena and Finisar report earnings next week. \nIBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics group was one of the worst performers among IBD's 197 industry groups, down 4.8% Thursday. The group ranks No. 27. \nAmazon plans to add four more data centers by the end of 2017, giving it 18 overall. AWS is upgrading data centers to 100 gigabit-per-second optical technology, from 10- and 40-Gbps hardware. \n\"We estimate that a footprint of 18 data centers by the end of 2017 would put Amazon's server count in the 3.5 million to 4 million range,\" Netis wrote. \"We believe Microsoft and Google will each have similarly 2.5 million to 3 million servers. \n\" Apple ( AAPL ) and Facebook round out the server count in the 2 million to 2.5 million range, giving the top five cloud operators a server count of 15 million at the high end of the range.\" \nAmazon has begun using silicon photonics-based optics linking server racks inside its data centers, says the William Blair analyst. He says there's potential upside for Ciena as a supplier for Amazon's undersea fiber-optic cabling. \nRELATED :",

      "text": "Home > Security > Amazon Promotes New Tool to Protect Cloud Customers From Attacks Amazon Promotes New Tool to Protect Cloud Customers From Attacks Dec 1, 2016 Bloomberg Comments 0 Advertisement \nAmazon.com Inc. unveiled a new security tool for cloud customers, part of a slew of product announcements this week designed to fend off competition from Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and others in the fast-growing cloud computing market. \nChief Technology Officer Werner Vogels announced Amazon Shield, new layers of protection designed against service interruptions like the cyber attack that took down top websites and affected some Amazon Web Services customers in October. \n\"This will really help you protect yourselves even against the largest and most sophisticated attacks we’ve seen,\" he said on Thursday at AWS re:Invent, a conference in Las Vegas that drew 32,000 attendees. \nMaking the cloud secure is a major part of persuading companies to shift their data and computing workloads from on-premise servers they control to rented resources accessed via the internet. \nRenting servers through the cloud offers lower costs, greater speed and flexibility. AWS has clients in a broad range of sectors, including health care, financial services, retail and transportation, highlighting rapid adoption of this approach to computing. Public cloud spending is expected to increase almost 17 percent to $204 billion this year, according to researcher Gartner Inc. \nVogel’s announcement followed Wednesday’s unveiling of an image recognition program, a speech-to-text service dubbed Polly, and tools for building conversational apps that highlighted Amazon’s push to add artificial intelligence to its cloud-computer offerings. \nAmazon’s Web Services division is the Seattle-based company’s fastest-growing and most profitable source of revenue, offsetting regular quarterly losses from its e-commerce operation. Cloud computing revenue is projected to top $10 billion this year. \nThe security tool was reported earlier by TechCrunch",

      "text": "Amazon’s Alexa on journey to fully grasping natural speech   5:02 pm Rohit Prasad, the Amazon scientist in charge of developing the artificial-intelligence software’s abilities to grasp human language, says Alexa is still in the early stage of its journey. Share story Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter \nLAS VEGAS — Alexa, Amazon.com’s artificial-intelligence software, is still in the early stages of a journey to understand the human voice and respond accordingly, says Rohit Prasad, the head scientist in charge of endowing it with the gift of language. \nOne day, the researcher predicts, it will grasp the meaning of every human utterance to make life easier for its users. \nPrasad spoke about the development of Alexa on the sidelines of Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference, a huge gathering of developers and cloud-computing enthusiasts, where the tech giant is unveiling some of its latest technology. \nPrasad’s ward is one of the stars of the show: AWS is incorporating into its platform some of the voice recognition and text-to-speech technology that have made Alexa a hit with customers who mostly have interacted with it through the Echo, a speaker that plays music, reads the news and controls light switches around the house.   \nNow developers should be able to rely on those building blocks to make voice-activated, cloud-based applications of their own — a path experts say leads to the future of computing. \nFor the Alexa development team, the arduous path began with the choice of a name that would wake Alexa from its slumber. “It’s primarily a tribute to the library of Alexandria,” said Prasad, who works out of Amazon’s operations in Boston. But the moniker was also short and easy to pronounce. “It’s super important for artificial intelligence to be mainstream, very easy to relate to,” he said. \nHowever, that posed problems. The word is common, and its sounds can be found in many words. That could have been solved by inventing an artificial-sounding long word, by adding a prefix like “OK,” or by having the user repeat the word twice. “To solve that problem, we really had to invent a lot of different techniques,” Prasad said. \nPrasad is the first to agree Alexa isn’t perfect. But his team is working on it. While he would not disclose what percentage of voice commands from users end up stumping Alexa, he said that number has been cut in half since its 2014 launch. “It’s huge,” especially considering there are many more customers out there using more functions, Prasad said. \nThe Alexa service also has been the subject of a flurry of news during the conference: Among other things, it’s rolling out a library of capabilities related to natural language it says will help developers more easily create their own voice interactions. \nAriel Kelman, AWS’ vice president for global marketing, said in an interview that the tools could be used to build apps in contexts where conversational interaction with a computer could improve the experience, such as with vending machines and cars, or in making a medical appointment. It “makes it really easy to build interfaces that ask follow-up questions,” Kelman said. \nAnother announcement: Alexa is working with Intel on a reference design for a smart speaker that will set standards for other manufacturers to make their own takes on the popular Echo. \nThe move speaks to the difficulty of the hoops Amazon jumped through to design a speaker that could discern voice commands in noisy environments and at a certain distance, send up those commands to the cloud, and speak back quickly. \nIt also shows how Amazon sees the technology surrounding Alexa as a sort of open platform. Some view it as akin to the tack taken by the IBM PC in the early days of personal computing. At the time IBMallowed other manufacturers to make compatible machines; that led Microsoft’s operating system, MS-DOS, and later Windows, to claim a bigger share of the market than Apple, which kept its products in an enclosed orchard. \nPrasad won’t go as far as saying it’s exactly MS-DOS-like, although he calls it a “good analogy.” \n“Our efforts are all around making Alexa easily accessible for developers,” so that customers can reap the benefits in a world where there are many different sources of devices and software. “This is not going to be a homogeneous world.” \nWhen asked how Amazon will make money off Alexa, which is freely available to developers, Prasad says that’s beyond his scope as a scientist. In any case, it’s still the very early days of the technology and it’s too soon to tell how it might flourish. \n“Right now we really want to simplify the daily lives of our customers,” he said. “Everything you say to Alexa, I want it to understand.” \nAnother steep challenge: taking Alexa, so far confined to the U.S., the U.K. and, on an experimental basis, in Germany, where Prasad has a team, to the rest of the world’s languages. \nThe hurdle is not only collecting thousands of samples of voices to make Alexa cope with every aspect of a language. It’s also about having enough local data to make the artificial-intelligence assistant useful. \n“If you have Spanish in Spain, you need to know a lot about Spain,” Prasad said. “It’s not the language, it’s the other context that makes it super-hard. The ultimate thing you need is data: You need to have a lot of content providers.” \nIn the U.S., Amazon had a very significant footprint and gobs of data when the Echo speaker launched. The trick is to build that in new geographies before launching. Prasad declined to say where Alexa would be released next. \n“The key is to have a good baseline. We don’t want to frustrate our customers,” he said. Ángel González: 206-464-2250 or . On Twitter @gonzalezseattle Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

      "text": "Amazon Web Services has named Zaheda Bhorat, a booster of open source software with stints at Salesforce , Google and the U.K. Government Digital Service under her belt as its head of open source strategy.\nBhorat tweeted about her appointment on Thursday during the annual AWS re:Invent tech conference in Las Vegas.\nOpen source software is typically freely available for developers to work with and build on. Typically, to get formal support and more advanced versions of the free software, users must pay commercial companies who back open-source software. A huge percentage of modern software development now relies on open-source, rather than proprietary (and expensive) commercial software.\nAmazon amzn built its public cloud mostly on open source software including the Xen hypervisor, a basic piece of software that crams more applications on less hardware, and the Linux operating system. But critics say Amazon amzn Web Services (AWS) is not particularly known for contributing much of its work back to the community, as is often the custom in the open source software world. Amazon would likely push back on that, but the fact that it hired both Bhorat and Adrian Cockcroft in the last month to guide its efforts show it knows it has a perception problem.\nCockcroft is the former Netflix nflx exec who guided that company’s open source efforts. He and Bhorat also did stints at the old Sun Microsystems, before it was purchased by Oracle orcl .\nStarted at AWS as Head of Open Source Strategy. Excited to be working with @adrianco \n— zahedab (@zahedab) December 1, 2016 \n\nWhile Amazon lists several open-source projects on Github, a popular library for open source software, Amazon’s projects are generally focused on AWS-specific tools. It doesn’t usually participate with other, broader projects. Amazon’s game plans seems to be about offering access to its services through what are called Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs.Customers can pump data into and out of AWS using those APIs, but its cloud itself is seen as a black box to outsiders.\nHaving said that, AWS has varied from the script lately. It said on Thursday that it would make Blox , technology that manages containers, by putting Blox’s code on Github for developers to use. Containers are a modern way to package up and deploy software applications\nFor more on AWS, watch: \nLast week AWS said it also intends to invest and offer its improvements to the MXnet deep learning framework , to the open source community\nOn Thursday at Amazon’s conference, Cockcroft hosted a session on the company’s open source strategy and said the AWS will be reach out more to engage the open source community and various foundations with Bhorat’s help going forward.\n“This is the beginning, it’s baby steps,” he said.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nOne re:Invent attendee, who insisted on anonymity because his company partners with Amazon and he is not authorized to speak about it, said Amazon doesn’t contribute much to the broader open source world compared to Google goog and other rivals. His theory is that because AWS is seen as lagging Google in both containers and in artificial intelligence/deep learning, it makes sense for it to try to gain support from the open source communities for its efforts in those two critical areas. Hence the open-sourcing decisions on Blox and MSXnet.\n ",

It's now available to pre-order for $99 with one free year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage, a $59 value. \nThe drive itself offers 1TB of storage, powered by USB 3.0 for \"quick local transfer speeds\". However, you shouldn't expect SSD-like speeds. \nSee also: Is Amazon's online storage really 'unlimited'? Read the fine print \nThe Seagate Duet syncs all data on the drive to the cloud, giving customers dual backup and access almost anywhere using Amazon Drive's suite of mobile apps. \nAmazon says the Duet will begin shipping on December 10. The free year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage is only available to new, US users.",
