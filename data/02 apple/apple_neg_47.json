      "text": "Batteries 5 hours ago \nA mysterious problem causing iPhones to unexpectedly shut down is much larger than Apple has admitted to, Chinese authorities say, and affects iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone 6s Plus devices—not just the iPhone 6s. \nThe China Consumers Association, a government watchdog group, said Nov. 30 that Apple needs to take further measures to address the problem, and accused the company of failing to “meet basic consumer needs for normal wireless communication.” The notice is the second the group has sent to Apple in a month, and illustrates how Beijing has become one of the toughest overseers of the Cupertino-based hardware maker. \nConsumers in China and the rest of the world have complained in recent weeks that their iPhones are shutting down, even though their batteries reportedly still have 30% power remaining. On Nov. 20, Apple published a global notice addressing the problem. A “very small number of iPhone 6s devices” produced between September and October 2015 “may unexpectedly shut down,” the company said. Consumers whose phone matched a serial number on Apple’s website could bring their device to an Apple Store or authorized reseller and replace the battery for free. \nThat doesn’t go far enough, though, the China Consumer Association said in the Nov. 30 notice (link in Chinese). It wants Apple to offer fixes for other models experiencing the malfunction, and to provide a more thorough explanation of why it is happening: \nAfter Apple published the “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues,” many consumers continued to send replies to the China Consumers Association reporting their situation. After collecting these reports, we discovered the shutdown malfunction also exists in the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus, in addition to iPhone 6s devices produced between September and October 2015. The aforementioned models were among the devices suspected of malfunction problems in the China Consumer Associations’ letter sent out on November 15. Meanwhile, consumers have opinions and suggestions about the execution of Apple’s “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues.” \nAs a result, on November 29, the China Consumer Association once again sent a letter to Apple expressing our wish that Apple provide a thorough analysis, reason and solution for the malfunctioning iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6s phones produced between September and October 2015. In addition, as for the “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues,”some consumers have questions about its terms and [we] ask for a timely clarification. [We also request] Apple improve the convenience of the booking and consultation systems [for battery replacement], prepare enough components to replace batteries efficiently, and meet basic consumer needs for normal wireless communication. \nMaking the matter potentially worse, some Chinese consumers are complaining that Apple’s battery replacement does not solve the shutdown issue. \nOn Weibo, China’s Twitter-esque social network, one Wuhan-based iPhone 6s wrote that he received a fresh battery for his faulty iPhone 6s on Nov. 29. The following day, it shut down at 20%. This suggests that the problem might be deeper than Apple expected. “I just want to ask Apple how changing the battery will fix the problem,” he wrote on Weibo today (Dec. 1). \nQuartz reached out to Apple for comment but did not receive an immediate reply.

      "title": "Apple's Wi-Fi Routers Top Satisfaction Survey; Future Still Uncertain",
      "text": "Apple Tops JD Power Wi-Fi Router Satisfaction Report Shortly After Reportedly Axing AirPort Division Apple topped the survey, followed by Asus, D-Link and TP-Link Apple's AirPort products are likely to be discontinued and not replaced Overall satisfaction with Wi-Fi routers has improved over last year \nLess than two weeks after reports emerged that Apple had disbanded its AirPort router team and reassigned its resources to other departments, JD Power has revealed that the company's products have topped the charts in its second annual Wireless Router Satisfaction Report. \nJD Power measures router satisfaction based on ten parameters including Wi-Fi range, reliability, security, price, features, and customer service. This year's study covered 3,037 users who had bought Wi-Fi routers over the past 12 months. Compared to last year's findings, overall satisfaction rose 2.7 percentage points from 82.7 to 85.4 percent. \nApple topped the charts with its score of 876 out of a possible 1000. Last year's winner Asus took second place with 860 points, followed by D-Link and TP-Link with 856 and 854 points respectively. JD Power credits companies with improving their products and taking steps to adapt to more demanding user requirements, which now include multiple devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, smart devices, and TV streaming boxes or dongles. While satisfaction improved across all parameters, ease of use (including installation) was the most improved aspect of router ownership. The problems reported most frequently include how often a router needed to be reset, slow Internet speeds, limited range, and cumbersome installation. It isn't clear whether the quality of Internet service was distinguished from the quality of the routers in question when measuring satisfaction with Internet speeds.\nDespite Apple coming out on top, the survey indicated that price was the most important consideration buyers had when choosing a Wi-Fi router, followed by range, brand reputation and ease of use. The average price paid for a router was $124 (approximately 8,477), an increase of $16 over the previous year's finding. \nFans of Apple's router range, which comprises of the AirPort Extreme, AirPort Express and AirPort Time Capsule were disappointed last week by widespread reports that the company is not investing in further development . Apple has not officially confirmed this move, but the products have also not been refreshed in several years now, and Apple has recently begun tightening its focus on products and services that generate the bulk of its revenue. The move would also fit in with the recent decision to end in-house monitor development and instead partner with LG on a new line of 5K displays for Mac computers.",

      "text": "Taoiseach set to meet Apple's Tim Cook in US Updated / Dec. 1, 2016 08:04 Enda Kenny is on a three-day visit to the United States \nTaoiseach Enda Kenny is set to meet Apple CEO Tim Cook in California later today. \nMr Kenny is on a three-day visit to the United States focusing on business and investment connections. \nHis meeting with Mr Cook is one of the key elements of the Silicon Valley leg of his trip. \nThe focus of the meeting will be on Apple's continued investment in its operations in Ireland following the European Commission ruling into its tax affairs - a decision that the Government has already lodged an appeal against. \nEarlier this year following a lengthy investigation, the commission ruled that the Irish Government had provided €13 billion in illegal State aid, in the form of tax benefits to Apple. \nThe decision was criticised by the Government, Apple and the US Treasury department but welcomed by many other EU member states. \nAhead of his meeting with Mr Cook, the Taoiseach said that he does not have any concerns about Apple's future in Ireland. \nHe said he wants to talk to Mr Cook about Apple's planned extension in Cork, which will make it the biggest employer there, as well as the process the company was going through in relation to a plant in Athenry. \nMr Kenny said that Mr Cook was \"publicly and privately strongly in support\" of the company's operation in Ireland and was \"very happy\" with its investment there. \nTaoiseach Enda Kenny is asked if he has any concerns about the future of Apple in Ireland, given the European Commission ruling? pic.twitter.com/BSz2WtBhQN — RTÉ News (@rtenews) December 1, 2016 \nHe said that following on from the European Commission ruling that Apple had benefited from illegal State aid in Ireland totaling €13 billion in undue tax benefits, he would offer Mr Cook the same assurances doing business in Ireland that he offered to everyone else. \nHe said Ireland was a \"very attractive\" country for investment from abroad, particularly because of the young people, flexible education system and that it was predominantly English speaking. \nThe Taoiseach said \"we get on very well with Apple\", adding that they were one of a \"number of very large American companies who've invested in Ireland and are happy with their investment\". \nIn an interview with RTÉ News at the time of the decision, Mr Cook said Apple's commitment to Ireland was undiminished and that its investment in Ireland would continue \"as per plan\". \nThey will also discuss the potential impact of Britain's exit from the European Union, and any likely implications for Apple's relationship with Ireland stemming from the incoming Donald Trump presidency. \nLater, Mr Kenny will also visit Facebook's headquarters to meet executives from that company and the wider Bay Area as he attends a meeting of the region's economic council. \nUpon arriving in Silicon Valley last night, the Taoiseach attended a networking event of Irish businesses being supported in the US by Enterprise Ireland. \nBefore that meeting he met Jackie and George Donohoe, whose daughter Ashley and niece Olivia were among the six young people killed in last year's tragic balcony collapse in Berkeley. \nMr Kenny said he had met the other affected families in Dublin last week. \nFrom Dublin, but living in California, Ms Donohoe's efforts are credited with helping to lead to the introduction of new legislation in California to improve building standards. \nThe legislation was signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown in September. \nPoliticians in the California state house praised the testimony given by Jackie Donohoe and survivor Aoife Beary and her mother Angela during hearings. \nTwo California state senators, Jerry Hill and Loni Hancock, had first tabled the legislation last year, when it emerged that the company which had built the Library Gardens apartment complex in Berkeley - Segue Construction - had several construction defects settlements against them. \nThe legislation increases the oversight on construction contractors, requiring criminal work-related convictions to be reported, and requires a new set of standards for the construction of balconies and other outdoor spaces.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMany iCloud users have been reporting an influx of Calendar invite spam, with the issue becoming more widespread in recent weeks as the holiday season gets into gear. \nThe annoying problem leaves unlucky recipients having to deal with endless ads for cheap gadgets or cut-price “branded” products – many of them in Chinese. \nNo underhand activity appears to have taken place in terms of hacks or security breaches. Instead, the spammers are doing what spammers always do, targeting email addresses in bulk in the hope that at least a few people respond. \nThe good news is that Apple has finally acknowledged the issue, and promises it’s working on a fix to prevent “suspicious senders” from distributing the invites. The message, sent to iMore on Wednesday, was short and to the point: \n“ We are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent. ” \nThe bad news, however, is that for now many people will likely continue to receive Calendar spam. The current advice is first to refrain from deleting the invites as this’ll notify the sender that the email address is functioning, which is only going to mean one thing. That’s right, even more spam. \nMore: 20 iOS tips and tricks to try out \nTo get rid of your existing spam invites, create a new calendar in Apple’s Calendar software. You can do this by opening the app and tapping on Calendars at the bottom. Next, tap on Edit top left and then on Add Calendar. Give it a name – “spam” would seem appropriate – and then select the spam invites and move them to your newly created calendar. Now you can delete the new calendar by returning to the Calendars page, tapping on the “i” next to the “spam” calendar and hitting delete at the bottom. \nIn addition, you can stop seeing the notifications by logging into iCloud, clicking on Settings bottom left, and then clicking on the Advanced tab. Here, change invitations from “In-app notifications” to “Email to …” and hit Save. This action will route the invites to your inbox where your spam filters will hopefully sort the wheat from the chaff. Of course, that means you won’t get any alerts for genuine invites, but once Apple sorts the issue you’ll be able to switch back to the former method. Also watch:",

      "title": "Here's how to check if your iPhone battery is faulty and needs to be replaced",
      "text": "You may remember last week's announcement from Apple that a number of iPhone models harboured power issues. If not, it turns out a select group of iPhone 6s devices are affected by a battery fault, with the Cupertino giant set to offer replacements. While customers should already be aware of the issue themselves through a poorly performing battery (the devices will abruptly shut down), Apple didn't really give a surefire way of seeing if your phone was one of the unlucky ones. The only caution was that devices manufactured between September and October 2015 could potentially be prone. With most of us not aware of our phone's birthday, you may have already been forced to check via the Apple Store. Thanks to 9to5Mac, though, there's now a way for you to check against an affected devices list from home. First, you'll want to scout out your serial number. This is located on the back of your device below the 'S' icon, or you can head to Settings &gt; General &gt; About. Found it? All set? OK, now you'll need to check if the figures in the fourth and fifth spot match any of these combinations: Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9, QC, QD, QF, QG, QH, QJ If you happen to have won the unfortunate iPhone bingo, you should probably head on down to Apple - even if you're yet to experience issues. Just make sure your handset is in good enough shape to have its battery replacement operation (that means no cracked screens), as Apple will require you fixing this beforehand.

      "text": "Apple's Smart Battery Case for iPhone is gross. It's ugly, and there's really no getting around that. Before today, buying one should have come with a sense of shame and regret, but now that there's a Product (RED) version, at least you can pick one up and know that you're doing some good for the world, even if it's at the expense of good taste. GET UP: Stephen Hawking knows why you’re fat Apple announced today that it's bringing a (RED) version of its lumpy battery case to its its retail stores and online shop, along with new iPhone SE case, Beats Solo 3 wireless headphones, and Beats Pill, also as part of the (RED) program. The new products continue the company's tradition of charitable efforts and long-standing support of (RED)'s mission to provide medical relief to AIDS-stricken regions of Africa. Additionally, Apple is launching a special Product (RED) effort via Apple Pay. Starting today and carrying on through December 6th, the company will donate $1 to (RED) every time Apple Pay is used at an Apple Store or on Apple.com, with a maximum contribution of $1 million. Interestingly, Bank of America is matching that offer, and will also donate up to $1 million in total for Apple Pay transactions using its cards. “The gift of life is the most important gift that anyone can give,” said Tim Cook via press release. “Thanks to the vision and dedication of (RED), an AIDS-free generation is within our reach. We want to leave the world better than we found it, and that’s why our longtime partnership with (RED) remains so important to us.” The new product versions should appear in the Apple online store starting today, as well as in Apple Store locations.",

      "text": "icloud calendar spam apology apple More Apple\nMany iCloud users have been reporting an influx of Calendar invite spam, with the issue becoming more widespread in recent weeks as the holiday season gets into gear.\nThe annoying problem leaves unlucky recipients having to deal with endless ads for cheap gadgets or cut-price “branded” products – many of them in Chinese.\nNo underhand activity appears to have taken place in terms of hacks or security breaches. Instead, the spammers are doing what spammers always do, targeting email addresses in bulk in the hope that at least a few people respond.\nThe good news is that Apple has finally acknowledged the issue, and promises it’s working on a fix to prevent “suspicious senders” from distributing the invites. The message, sent to iMore on Wednesday, was short and to the point:\n“ We are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent. ”\nThe bad news, however, is that for now many people will likely continue to receive Calendar spam. The current advice is first to refrain from deleting the invites as this’ll notify the sender that the email address is functioning, which is only going to mean one thing. That’s right, even more spam.\nMore: 20 iOS tips and tricks to try out\nTo get rid of your existing spam invites, create a new calendar in Apple’s Calendar software. You can do this by opening the app and tapping on Calendars at the bottom. Next, tap on Edit top left and then on Add Calendar. Give it a name – “spam” would seem appropriate – and then select the spam invites and move them to your newly created calendar. Now you can delete the new calendar by returning to the Calendars page, tapping on the “i” next to the “spam” calendar and hitting delete at the bottom.\nIn addition, you can stop seeing the notifications by logging into iCloud, clicking on Settings bottom left, and then clicking on the Advanced tab. Here, change invitations from “In-app notifications” to “Email to …” and hit Save. This action will route the invites to your inbox where your spam filters will hopefully sort the wheat from the chaff. Of course, that means you won’t get any alerts for genuine invites, but once Apple sorts the issue you’ll be able to switch back to the former method.\nThe art of the poke: A Facebook guide for the uninitiated Suffering from sender’s remorse?

To mark the tenth anniversary of Apple's partnership with (RED) the company is offering the biggest selection of products and services ever that include a donation to the AIDS fighting charity.\nStarting on December 1 all major Apple Stores around the globe will be switching their exterior lights and logos from crisp white to red to raise awareness of World AIDS Day.\nBut as well as raising awareness, Apple is aiming to raise even more money this year. As well as its Product (RED) line of devices where a proportion of sales always goes to charity, the company is adding special edition Beats Headphones, speakers and cases for the current generation iPhones to the lineup.\nIn addition, every time someone pays in store or online via Apple Pay the company will be donating $1 to the charity.\nThere will also be exclusive content. The Killers album \"Don't Waste Your Wishes\" will be available to buy solely on iTunes and 100% of proceeds will be going to charity.\nThe final element is exclusive in-app (RED)-branded content in 20 of the most popular games for the iPhone and iPad including Angry Birds 2 and Candy Crush Jelly Saga. Any in-app purchases of these extra features will also result in helping to fight the spread of AIDS.\n\"The gift of life is the most important gift that anyone can give,\" said Tim Cook, Apple CEO. \"Thanks to the vision and dedication of (RED), an AIDS-free generation is within our reach.

      "text": "Cook ups Apple support for fight against AIDS By Julia Love Share View photos Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook waves during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 7, 2016. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach More By Julia Love (Reuters) - Apple Inc is expanding its support for the fight against AIDS through the (RED) charity founded by rock singer Bono, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview ahead of World Aids Day. Over the next week, the company will expand its line of (RED) products and donate $1 for each transaction made using mobile payment Apple Pay in its physical and online stores, up to a total of $1 million. Bank of America will contribute up to that sum for Apple Pay transactions using its cards. \"There's still way too many people dying of AIDS, still too many kids being born with HIV, and so we are continuing to press really hard,\" Cook said in the interview. UNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said. The (RED) campaign is an example of \"cause-related marketing,\" a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause. Cook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. \"When we put ourselves into something, it's worth a lot more than just money,\" he said. (RED) was one of Apple's highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who largely avoided corporate giving. The company has been responsible for about $120 million of the $360 million (RED) has raised since it was founded in 2006. (Reporting by Julia Love, editing by Peter Henderson) Reblog",

      "text": "Reddit \nIf you haven’t yet experienced receiving unwanted even invitations, a.k.a. spam, on your iPhone or iPad’s Calendar app, consider yourself one of the lucky ones. iOS users have reported suddenly being plagued by numerous such invites on their devices, and declining them seems to make it actually worse. After days of silence, Apple has finally but unofficially acknowledge the situation and is promising to take action. But as spam filtering only happens on Apple’s end (for now), all that users can do is wait and use these workarounds to get rid of those notifications (for now). \nThe rash of spam invites started about a week ago and has become so widespread that even the New York Times dedicated a page for it. The problem was initially attributed to how iCloud and Calendar routinely scan for invitations in your iCloud e-mail and pop them up as Calendar invites. Unfortunately, those apps don’t have any notion of what “spam” is. \nSo far, Apple has been silent on the matter, despite the growing number of groans from its users. It has broken that silence but only through a statement given to iMore : \nSo while Apple admits that it is aware of the problem, the real fix would only happen on its end by improving its spam filtering mechanism. Or to provide some features to the iOS Calendar app. In the meantime, users are left with band aid fixes to this situation. \n• DO NOT decline the event. Ironically, declining it has the opposite effect. It would alert the spam sender that the e-mail is active and in use, encouraging them to continue sending such invites. \n• If you never want to see invites on your Calendar app , the solution is to send any invites to an e-mail address instead of as an in-app notification. Sadly, the only way to do this is through the iCloud web interface. Hit the Settings (“gear”) icon on the bottom left, and then hit the Advanced tab and make invites to go to your e-mail. That said, with this enabled, you won’t get any app notifications at all. \n• If you simply want to delete the invite without alerting the spammer , the process is a bit more involved but all takes place on your iPhone or iPad. You first need to create a temporary calendar (name it anything you want) and then, one by one, change each invite’s calendar to that temporary one. And then delete the calendar. \nHopefully, Apple will soon add an Ignore or Mark as Spam option to invites, just in case some slip through the cracks again. For now however, these are the workarounds users have to go to keep their Calendars clean.",

      "text": "Apple launches Apple Pay in Spain with support for four financial institutions   03:08 am PT (06:08 am ET) As rumored, Apple on Thursday debuted Apple Pay in Spain with support for Mastercard and American Express credit cards issued through Santander bank, Carrefour Pass and Ticket Restaurant. Spain is the 13th major market to gain access to Apple's fledgling mobile payments service, with the addition coming a little over one month after Apple Pay went live in Japan in October . Today's launch vindicates in part a report on Wednesday claiming the service would debut for Spanish customers on Dec. 1. According to Apple's regional website , Apple Pay in Spain will initially support cards from partner institutions Banco Santander, Carrefour, Ticket Restaurant and American Express. As with past international introductions, Apple Pay partner Mastercard is opening up its vast payments network for the Spanish rollout. At launch, customers can use Apple Pay at some 27 major retail outlets including Bershka, Cepsa, Cortefiel, Media Markt, Repsol and of course Apple's own brick-and-mortar stores. Support from BP and Fnac are listed as coming soon. In addition, Apple also notes users will soon be able to add customer cards to the iOS Wallet app, allowing easy collection and redemption of loyalty points. Topics:",

      "title": "Apple Reducing Orders For iPhone 7 As Sales Momentum Fading: DigiTimes",
      "text": "In a sign that investor enthusiasm about the Apple \"rebound\" may have been premature, Digitimes reports that Apple has begun to reduce orders for iPhone 7s as initial \"sales momentum has started fading\", according to sources from Taiwan's handset supply chain.\n\nThe Digitimes sources said that initial shipment momentum of the iPhone 7 was in part driven by strong demand for the jet black iPhone 7 models and in part by the mishap brought upon by Samsung Galaxy Note 7. However, demand for the iPhone 7 devices in China and other markets has scaled down significantly since their launch less than three months ago, the sources noted.\n\nHowever, always willing to dismiss a weakness on behalf of Apple as a one-time event, instead of paying attention to sales performance of the iPhone 7 devices, component suppliers and consumers alike have been shifting their focus to the next generation iPhone to be released in 2017, commented the sources.\n\n\n\nMarket rumors have indicated that the next generation iPhone will come with OLED displays, glass cases, dual-lens cameras, enhanced CPUs, and advanced sensors, while supporting mixed reality (MR) and wireless charging technologies.\n\n\nAffected by consumers' high expectations on the next generation iPhone, makers in the supply chain are mostly conservative about the shipment outlook for the iPhone 7 in the first half of 2017, expecting shipments in this six-month period to be at least five million units less than those shipped in the second half of 2016.\n\n\n\nWho, in addition to AAPL, is most likely to be impacted: according to Bloomberg, Dialog Semi has the largest exposure to Apple among European suppliers at ~69% of revenue, while other suppliers include AMS, Infineon, Imagination Technologies, STMicro. AAPL was modestly lower, -0.4%, in premarket trading, at $110.",

      "text": "iCloud users bombarded by Calendar invitation spam, Apple acknowledges the issue iCloud users bombarded by Calendar invitation spam, Apple acknowledges the issue Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + Over the past couple of weeks, iPhone and Mac users — generally anybody who has their Calendar synced to iCloud — have been experiencing an influx of spam messages by various retailers that deal with... let's say cheap goods. The issue is not related to an iCloud hack, it's just a massive spam effort — sending off event invitations to as many emails as possible, trying to get a bite from a few. The reason why the spammers have chosen to use Calendar instead of the good-ole email messages is because people usually pay more attention to event invitations from the Calendar app and the spam filter there is not as good, it seems.Apple has now spoken out to acknowledge the problem and confirm that it is working on it. Cupertino is working on identifying suspicious accounts and blocking them from sending out invites. We are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent. In the meantime, you don't want to interact with these invitations too much. Even if you decline one, the spammers will still get confirmation that this email is, indeed, an active and existing iCloud account (\"x\" has denied your invitations) and may target you more often.Users have found two workaround solutions for now, at least until Apple manages to filter out the spam. One is to set your Calendar to receive invitations via email instead of popping them in the app. To do so, you need to visit the iCloud website on desktop, go to Calendar, Preferences, Advanced and set the \"Receive event invitations as:\" to \"Email\". Alternatively, every time you get a spam invite, you can create a new calendar within the app, move the spam invites to it, and then delete the calendar without responding to the invitation. That'll get rid of it without sending a message to the original sender.",

      "text": "Apple is reportedly planning to use drones to improve its Maps app and truly compete with Google Maps, following a problematic launch four years ago. Bloomberg News reports that Apple has been building a team of experts in robots and data capture to utilize drones to quickly update maps. Google and Apple both use fleets of cars and vans equipped with cameras, but drones will allow Apple to examine and monitor roads, street signs, construction areas, and more. Apple is said to have hired at least one employee from Amazon’s Air division to help run its own drone team based in Seattle.\nAlongside the drone efforts, Apple is also reportedly developing a new inside view for its Maps app and improvements for car navigation. Bloomberg New s claims that the indoor mapping view will let iPhone users navigate through museums and airports. Google Maps currently offers similar indoor features, and Apple has reportedly acquired Indoor.io to help build out the feature for Maps. Apple is also adding better assistance for changing lanes while driving, and both of the new Maps features are said to be planned for a 2017 release.",

The ads were creative, funny and, for the first time, put Apple on the defensive.

      "title": "iOS Calendar App: How To Deal With Spam Invites",
      "text": "Currently, spam filtering happens only at Apple's end due to its closed app ecosystem. But there are ways that users can avoid spam invites until an official fix arrives. \nHere's what you can do: Don't decline an invite. Doing so will alert the spammer that the account is up and functioning, and could possibly encourage them to spam regularly. There is a workaround if you want to delete the invite without alerting the spammer, but it is only possible on the affected iOS device. First, create a temporary calendar and then change the invite's calendar to the temporary one. Once you have made the change for all your spam invites, delete the temporary calendar and get rid of the invites. Disable in-app notifications for invites. To do so, use the iCloud interface to send any invites to an email address. Navigate to the Settings tab on the bottom left of the Calendar window, click on the Advanced tab and divert invites to your email address. Once this is done, you will stop receiving invites on your iOS device. \nApple is expected to soon add an “Ignore” or “Mark as spam” button for unwanted invites, Slashgear reports.

      "text": "Share \nThis past summer, Apple announced its aspirations to expand Apple Pay into Spain, and now, that vision is coming to fruition with Apple launching its mobile pay service in the country. \nAccording to a report , on Thursday (Dec. 1), Apple Pay will be rolled out to customers of Banco Santander. At a later date, other banks in Spain are expected to support Apple Pay as well. As it stands, Apple Pay is available in 12 countries. Spain is the last of the countries Apple said it would expand Apple Pay to this year, noted the report. \nEarlier in the summer, Apple Pay’s international expansion hit some bumps along the way as it suffered from a mixture of technical difficulties, tepid consumer interest and bank resistance. Take its rollout in Australia , for one example. At the end of June, the three largest banks in Australia — National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp — partnered up to lodge an antitrust application with regulators in an attempt to collectively negotiate with Apple over whether or not their own in-house electronic payments apps can be set up to run properly on an iPhone. \nCurrently, Apple does not allow for third-party electronic payments apps on the iPhone to make use of the NFC technology that comes in all models after the 6. The three Australian banks argue that, because Apple allows other apps on iPhones to access technological features like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, restricting the technology through which mobile wallets function, known as near-field communication, constitutes anticompetitive behavior. \nThe filing represents the latest in a long-running struggle between Apple and various FIs down under, as banks are hesitant to surrender their customers to Apple Pay merely because their iPhones won’t give those same customers access to the apps banks have dedicated time and treasure to building out in-house.",

      "text": "Apple Said to Fly Drones to Improve Maps Data and Catch Google Mark Gurman December 1, 2016 — 6:00 AM EST Company gets FAA approval to use drones for data collection Apple acquired startup Indoor.io for interior mapping project \nApple Inc. plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans , one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple’s mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There’s a huge data-quality issue there, and I don’t think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies’ mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple’s latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. FAA Exemption Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents.\nApple’s application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix GmbH to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple’s initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon’s initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon’s headquarters, the person said. Indoor.io Acquisition \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

Apple iPhone users are reporting to receive spam emails with calendar invitations offering discounts on designer brands.\nThe flaw has been there for a while, but it is assumed to rise during Black Friday period.\nApple’s iPhone operating systems iOS scans emails for messages that may contain a calendar invitation. The operating system then notifies users about the event invitation found in an email.\nThe feature is considered useful, but it can be misused by spammers offering voucher deals. However, such spam can be ignored by tweaking your iPhone settings.\nTo shut the calendar invite notification off Apple iPhone owners need to log in to their iCloud account and open ‘Advanced’ setting under ‘Calendar ‘option. Change invitations from In-app notification to receiving email ones. This will allow users to receive calendar invites as emails, rather than as a pop-up notification in iPhone’s calendar app.",

      "text": "Stockpile Reports Partners with Apple, Giving Away Free Apple iPhone 7’s and Free DJI Phantom 4 Pro’s REDMOND, WASHINGTON, UNITED STATES, December 1, 2016 / EINPresswire.com / -- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 1/Dec/2016 Stockpile Reports , an enterprise inventory management system for companies who deal with aggregates and materials, today announced a partnership with Apple, debuting their Inventory Management Starter Pack. This starter pack costs $3,750 a quarter, and consists of a phone/drone license to the Stockpile Reports service. Additionally they are throwing in a free DJI Phantom 4 Pro and free Apple iPhone 7 . Customers use the drone to measure stockpiles from the air and the iPhone to measure piles from the ground. “The processing power and camera quality on the iPhone 7 make it an ideal stockpile measuring device,” says David Boardman, CEO of Stockpile Reports. “For the purposes of inventory management, the image capture discussion is drawing to a close—the obvious winner being Apple and DJI. The specs and the cost are almost a non-issue, freeing people to focus on solving real business problems. That’s why we’re offering this amazing starter pack with the free Drone and free iPhone.” When asked ‘what makes the Stockpile Reports service unique?’, Boardman boasted, “We’re the only solution in the market that gives you the ability to measure stockpiles both from the air and ground, earning 3 patents in the process. We put this offer together to give companies the ability to get up and running with everything they need to be successful managing their inventory. Our solution is purely focussed on automating the inventory process: measuring, review, dispute resolution, approval, and submitting to finance and audit.” This offer will launch December 1st and be available to aggregate and construction companies in the US via the StockpileReports.com website. Stockpile Reports is based in Redmond, WA and has offices in Oregon, Texas, Georgia, and North Carolina. It is used by hundreds of companies at nearly 3,000 locations in 23 countries around the world. For inquiries, contact us at: tony.jacobson@stockpilereports.com or +1 (425) 285-4303 Tony Jacobson",

      "title": "Apple Rebound In Jeopardy As iPhone 7 Sales Momentum Fades",
      "text": "  07:40 AM EST Apple Rebound In Jeopardy As iPhone 7 Sales Momentum Fades \nFrom Tyler Durden : In a sign that investor enthusiasm about the Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) “rebound” may have been premature, Digitimes reports that Apple has begun to reduce orders for iPhone 7s as initial “sales momentum has started fading” according to suppliers. \nThe Digitimes sources said that initial shipment momentum of the iPhone 7 was in part driven by strong demand for the jet black iPhone 7 models and in part by the mishap brought upon by Samsung Galaxy Note 7. However, demand for the iPhone 7 devices in China and other markets has scaled down significantly since their launch less than three months ago, the sources noted. \nHowever, always willing to dismiss a weakness on behalf of Apple as a one-time event, instead of paying attention to sales performance of the iPhone 7 devices, component suppliers and consumers alike have been shifting their focus to the next generation iPhone to be released in 2017, commented the sources. \nMarket rumors have indicated that the next generation iPhone will come with OLED displays, glass cases, dual-lens cameras, enhanced CPUs, and advanced sensors, while supporting mixed reality (MR) and wireless charging technologies. \nAffected by consumers’ high expectations on the next generation iPhone, makers in the supply chain are mostly conservative about the shipment outlook for the iPhone 7 in the first half of 2017, expecting shipments in this six-month period to be at least five million units less than those shipped in the second half of 2016. \nWho, in addition to AAPL, is most likely to be impacted: according to Bloomberg, Dialog Semi has the largest exposure to Apple among European suppliers at ~69% of revenue, while other suppliers include AMS, Infineon, Imagination Technologies, STMicro. \nOn the ETF side of things, the iShares Dow Jones US Technology Sector Index Fund ( NYSE:IYW ) has the largest Apple exposure at 15.67% of its total holdings, with XLK and VGT next in line with more than 13% exposure. \nAAPL was modestly lower this morning, down -0.4% in premarket trading at $110 per share. Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 5%, versus an 8.1% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. \nThis article is brought to you courtesy of ZeroHedge .   Related Stocks:",

      "text": "Source: Wikimedia Commons In December of last year, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) Maps program passed Google Maps from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) as the most used mapping program on Apple’s iPhones and iPads. Now the company wants to make its Maps program even better by using drones to collect and update new mapping information more quickly and by adding interior views of buildings.\nAccording to a report from Bloomberg, unnamed sources also said that Apple’s goal is to catch up with Google Maps, long the leading mapping program on mobile devices, primarily because it is available on both iOS devices and Android devices. Apple Maps is not available on mobile devices powered by Google’s Android platform, and those far outnumber Apple devices.\nWhile it may not seem like a big deal which map program a consumer uses, it matters to Apple and Google because developers building apps that use a mapping program indirectly affect the quantity of ads delivered by either an iOS or Android map program.\nApple’s first go at its Maps program in 2012 was a near-total failure that resulted in CEO Tim Cook delivering an apology for the program’s failure. Bloomberg cited a statement by Apple executive Craig Federighi:\nThere’s a huge data-quality issue [with maps], and I don’t think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis.\nCollecting accurate information is critical to a map program and by using drones Apple hopes to speed up both the collection and dissemination of changes. Bloomberg reported that Apple received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in March to use drones to collect data and the company agreed to abide by FAA guidelines promulgated in August that restrict flying time to daylight hours and require a licensed pilot to keep the drone with the line of sight.\nApple also acquired an indoor mapping company, Indoor.io, last year that would enable users to find their way around high-traffic buildings like airports and museums.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

Subscribe Apple Considers Google-Style Augmented Reality Glasses \nFollowing reports at the weekend on Apple’s plans to release a new iPad targeted at the education market, further details have surfaced. Speaking to sources in the supply chain, Mac Otakara is reporting that Apple’s latest iPad will debut two new features that are also expected to make an appearance in 2017′s flagship iPhone. Apple’s iPad Pro 9.7 (photo: Getty Images) \nThe first is to reduce the size of the bezels on the iOS powered tablet to the point of removing as much of the dead space from the front of the device as possible. This would allow the projected 10.9 inch screen and bezels to occupy the same dimensions as the 9.7 inch iPad’s screen with its substantive bezels. \nAlthough the top bezel will be partially reworked to allow for the forward-looking FaceTime camera, the lower bezel will be reduced to a few millimetres at best. \nThat leads to the second change, which is the removal of the home button. This has been a point of discussion for some time and its removal is expected to be part of the visual change the iPhone 8 will make when it is presumably launched in September 2017. Many consumers (especially in the BRIC countries where repair costs run high) already use the virtual home button that can be found under iOS accessibility options to protect the physical home key. \nThere is no word if Apple will move to this virtual button, if a new form of virtual home button will be devised, or if there will be a ‘hot’ area in the user interface to act as an on-screen button. It’s already possible to call up the task switcher by pressing at the side of the screen, so a press at the lower edge could conceivably be used as a ‘home’ function. Apple iPad Air 2 (image: Apple.com) \nIf this rumor does come to pass (after all, we are deep in Taniyama-Shimura territory here), then the biggest question will be where the design places the TouchID sensors. Apple has a number of patents in this area, and the likely solution is one where there will be a TouchID sensor mounted somewhere under the glass. \nBoth the bezel reducing design and the removal of the home button will be significant visual changes for the iPad family, but they would also serve a higher purpose. Just as the iPhone 7 acclimatised consumers to a lack of a headphone jack and a home button that was actually a capacitive section of glass with haptic feedback, the removal of the home button on the iPad would prepare the audience for the hardware changes to come in the release of the next iPhone.

      "text": "Tiny Wings Launches on Apple TV for $2.99  10 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Popular iOS game Tiny Wings has launched today on the fourth-generation Apple TV for $2.99. The launch was teased by the game's creator on YouTube earlier in the week , with a video that showcased the game, now called \"Tiny Wings TV,\" and its split-screen multiplayer abilities. Two players can play the game together on one Siri Remote, or with a combination of a Siri Remote and an Apple TV-supported MFi controller. Players can even connect to the iOS Tiny Wings app [ Direct Link ] and use their iPhone or iPad as a controller. Otherwise, Tiny Wings TV keeps the same one-button control gameplay that requires players to guide a bird through levels by timing and aligning where the bird falls in the game's procedurally generated hillsides, which will look different every day it's played. iCloud support will also sync and save gameplay between the Apple TV and iOS versions of Tiny Wings.",

      "title": "Tim Cook on Apple's (RED) fight against AIDS",
      "text": "| Follow About | \nAppleholic, (noun), æp·əl-hɑl·ɪk: An imaginative person who thinks about what Apple is doing, why and where it is going. Delivering popular Apple-related news, advice and entertainment since 1999. Tim Cook on Apple's (RED) fight against AIDS Computerworld | Dec 1, 2016 5:40 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry \nApple has supported the (RED) campaign to raise funds to help combat AIDs since it began a decade ago. It has become the campaign’s biggest corporate supporter. World AIDS Day \nToday is World AIDs Day . That’s a day that means something to me. My cousin was just ten-years-old when AIDs took his life. One of the 35 million killed by the disease since its emergence in last Century, he contracted the virus from a medical blood transfusion. There was no treatment, only fear and prejudice around the virus at that time. These days, people’s lives can be saved for just 30-cents a day. \nApple has raised around $120 million in support of the campaign and has intensified its efforts this year, making a range of games, music and numerous special edition RED-branded Apple products available, sales of which raise cash for the campaign (Apple “makes a contribution” from each sale). \nThe company will also donate a dollar ( up to an additional million ) for every purchase made with Apple Pay at an Apple Store, (online or retail) or via the Store app until December 6. The Bank of America is also giving $1 per Apple Pay transaction to (RED). More information here . Corporate giving is personal \nApple CEO, Tim Cook’s been speaking about the campaign. \n“We’re proud that over the last 10 years we’ve positively impacted 70 million lives, and there are over 18 million people today on anti-retroviral (ARV) medications as a result of our efforts,” Cook, told The Independent . \nCook also revealed a little about Apple’s approach to charitable giving. The company matches the contributions its employees make, but (unlike so many larger corporations) it does not define which charities its workers support by insisting they only support those on some officially sanctioned list, instead, employees can choose campaigns that matter to them. \n“That’s one way we hit a ton of charities,” Cook said. ‘People should have values’ \nThe Apple CEO comes in for both praise and criticism for his commitment to human rights, but remains resolute in his belief that: \n“These things are about humanity, not whether someone has a right or left or centrist view,” he said . “I think it’s hard to argue that saving someone’s life with medication is a political thing.” \nSpeaking to USA Today , Cook remains equally resolute: \n“Of course corporations should have values because people should have values,” he said . “Corporations are just a bunch of people.” The future of healthcare \nApple’s stated intention is to change the world for the better. \nWhen it comes to health the company has put its money where its praxis is, with products such as ResearchKit and CareKit enabling significant research for the benefit of all. Cook says health remains a key area of interest for the company, and clearly wants to bring the benefits of digital health to as wide a congregation as possible. \n“I don’t think anyone is pleased with healthcare, well, maybe people are in the UK, but I don’t meet people who are pleased with what’s going on,” he said . \nReading between the lines (particularly with relevance to current UK healthcare) I can only imagine the company hopes to make better health treatment available to those who are currently priced out of such care. \n“Your ability to live past your first birthday shouldn't depend on where you're born,” Cook told USA Today. Incremental innovation \nWhen (RED) began ten years ago around 1,200 children were born with HIV each day. It is perhaps one of Apple’s best incremental innovations that it has helped reduce that number to 400 with its (RED) efforts. \nUNAIDS now predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030. \nTo find out more about what (RED) does, US readers can download Spike Jonze’s documentary “ The Lazarus Effect ,” free from iTunes . \nGoogle+?

      "text": "Apple sending out drones to improve Maps data, adding interior building maps By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 15 minutes ago \nApple is planning on sending out airborne drones in the U.S. to improve data for its Maps application, Bloomberg reports. The company is also developing indoor mapping features for public buildings such as airports and museums. Apple applied for an FAA exemption in late 2015 that would allow it to fly drones for commercial purposes, and received approval earlier this year. The company has reportedly been putting together robotics and data collection experts to get the program underway. Drones would allow Apple to update map information much more quickly than the ground-based vehicles the company is currently using. Sources indicate that drones would examine street signs, track changes to roads, and monitor construction zones, with data fed back to Apple teams for rapid updates to the database behind the Maps app. Interestingly, the report also reveals that Apple has hired at least one person from Amazon’s Prime Air drone delivery division to help run the drone team, which is being assembled in Seattle — where Amazon’s headquarters is also located. \nThe report also reveals that Apple is leveraging last year’s acquisition of startup Indoor.io to build indoor mapping views that would allow users to navigate inside buildings such as airports, museums, and shopping malls, likely similar to a feature that Google Maps introduced back in 2011. Combined with expertise from WiFiSlam — a company that Apple acquired in 2013 — the indoor location tracking would employ iPhone features such as pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth to help track a user’s location while navigating an indoor area. The indoor mapping, along with new lane guidance features while driving, are planned for a release sometime next year — likely as part of the next major iOS update — according to sources. Although, as usual, the feature could still be delayed for various reasons.",

      "title": "Today in Apple history: Too little, too late for Apple III - Cult of Mac",
      "text": "Photo: Alker33/YouTube \nDecember 1, 1981: After a disastrous launch with Apple’s “next-gen” Apple III computer the previous year, Apple relaunches its would-be Apple II successor with its most glaring hardware faults corrected. \nUnfortunately, the damage has already been done and Apple experiences its first “flop” product. Everything to everyone \nThe Apple III should have been brilliant. Unlike the Apple-1 and Apple II, which were essentially homebrew projects, the Apple III had the full weight of Apple the corporation behind it. The Apple III in all its glory. Photo: Apple \nAlthough sales of the Apple II showed no signs of slowing down, it was inevitable that sooner or later there would need to be a computer to replace it. \nThe early stages of the Mac project were already underway , although it was clear that they were nowhere near ready to go. All eyes were therefore on the Apple III to become the computer Apple needed. \nAt the start of the project, Steve Jobs — eager to be part of any project that had the potential to be the next big thing — had a series of glossy posters printed for employees, reading: “THE DECISIONS YOU’RE MAKING NOW HELPED SHIP 50,000 APPLE IIIs IN 1980.” \nThe Apple III was meant to be a computer targeting businesses, which was a market Apple knew IBM would attract with its debut personal computer. Apple therefore knew that it had to throw everything at the wall to create a computer that could expand Apple’s audience to serious business folk and home consumers alike. \nUnfortunately, this meant a computer which was built by committee: with everyone having their own ideas about what was needed. As a result of this “feature creep,” a project which Apple wanted to be finished in 10 months expanded to two years. \nAs then-Apple engineer quipped, “Everybody had certain ideas about what the Apple III should do and unfortunately all of them were included.” It’s what’s inside that counts \nIn terms of spec, the original Apple III boasted a 2 MHz SynerTek 6502A processor, whopping 2 KB of ROM and 128 KB on-board RAM (256 KB in the revised model launched on this day in 1981), and four slots for peripherals. \nIt ran twice as quickly as the Apple II and was also Apple’s first computer to come with a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive. \nGiven the Apple III’s much-publicized problems, it’s ironic that it ran an operating system called S.O.S. According to Apple, this stood for Sophisticated Operating System. It wound up influencing the design of ProDOS, which was used on later Apple II computers. \nUnfortunately, the Apple III wasn’t a success when it launched in fall 1980. It had limited software since it wasn’t backwards compatible with DOS 3.2 and 3.3, which Apple II software tended to use. More importantly, it featured a glaring hardware fault in the form of a motherboard which overheated, causing its chips to loosen. \nCombined with other faults, this earned the Apple III poor user reviews and it floundered in the marketplace. The new, slightly-improved Apple III \nThe Apple III revised edition, which today’s “Today in Apple history” commemorates, was launched in December 1981. It included upgraded spec and new software. Apple also introduced a ProFile 5Meg external hard drive, although the relaunch didn’t receive much publicity from Apple’s PR firm. \nThe people “happiest” with the revised edition were existing Apple III customers; 2,000 of whom got the new machine as a free upgrade because of problems they had with their earlier model. \nUltimately, the Apple III got one more upgrade with the later Apple III Plus , before being ditched altogether. Along with the Apple Lisa , it was one of two concerted attempts to get Apple into businesses, and one of two big failures Apple suffered during this same time frame. \nWould it have succeeded had the IBM PC not arrived at much the same time, and with a lower price point? Perhaps, but the Apple III had a lot of problems that would have made success a challenge either way. \nDo you remember the Apple III? Leave your comments below.

      "text": "Apple releases statement on iCloud Calendar spam By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 35 minutes ago \nApple has issued a statement in response to a problem that many iCloud users — including members of our iLounge team — have experienced in recent weeks, with spam being sent via iCloud calendar invitations. Spammers have been exploiting the fact that iCloud calendar invitations are sent via a dedicated iCloud communications channel that, unlike email, doesn’t presently include any anti-spam filters. In a statement tweeted by Rene Ritchie , Apple apologized, noting that some users are experiencing the problem. The company is working to address it by identifying and blocking the culprits, and working to filter the invites themselves. Apple’s statement on iCloud calendar spam. They’re sorry and they’re working on it. pic.twitter.com/oaSHSywVxG — Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) November 30, 2016 \nIn the meantime, users can work around this problem by logging into their web-based iCloud account online at iCloud.com, going to the Advanced tab in Calendar preferences, and opting to receive event invitations as email messages rather than in-app notifications, where email-based anti-spam filters will likely have better success at catching the bogus calendar invites.",

      "text": "iMac Display Hinge Repair: If You Spent $$$, Apple Will Issue A Refund 1 December 2016, 8:37 am EST By Anu Passary Tech Times Apple - Here's What You May Not Know Now Playing Apple has reportedly informed its Authorized Service Providers that the company will be repairing the display hinge of 27-inch iMac models manufactured between late 2012 to late 2013. Apple will also refund eligible customers who shelled out their own money to repair the hinge. ( Kevork Djansezian   \nApple will reportedly cover the repairing costs incurred by iMac users who needed to shell out some cash to have the device's display hinge fixed. \nAccording to a service document that had been distributed internally by the company to Apple Authorized Service Providers and which publication MacRumors managed to lay its hands on, the Cupertino-based firm will issue a refund to consumers who paid for the replacement or repair of the iMac's display hinge. \nThis news will be welcomed by affected iMac owners who are eligible for the refund, as the repair can cost more than $100. \nFor those wondering what all the fuss is about, users of the 27-inch iMac have complained on support forums that their device's hinge would make a grinding noise or a popping sound that was audible. After this, the user would not be able to adjust the hinge as it had stopped working. Users also moaned that the iMac's display would tilt forward on its own continuously even when adjusted time and again. \n\"I was just sitting watching TV when there was a loud crack and my iMac screen suddenly tilted down - now the screen will not stay where it is tilted/positioned. I was not using the iMac at the time and it was not doing anything - it just broke on its own,\" shared an iMac user on the Apple Support Community in March 2014. The user purchased the iMac in February 2014 and asserted that this was a design issue. Which iMacs Are Affected? \nThe service document from Apple reportedly acknowledges that a few 27-inch iMac units that were shipped between December 2012 and July 2012 could possibly be affected by the display hinge problem. This issue results in the device's screen tilting forward incessantly and not getting adjusted. The documents reveal that the problem is seemingly restricted to the late 2012 and late 2013 iMac models specifically. What Is Causing The Issue? \nThe problem seems to lie in the plastic washers that are used in the spring mechanism of the iMac's display hinge. These are apparently not sturdy enough to take the weight of the device's display. In several instances, the washers break under the weight, which results in the popping sound users are reporting. Does My iMac Qualify For The Refund? \nSince the problem is limited to the 27-inch iMacs that were shipped from December 2012 to July 2014, the hinge repair program for iMacs will cover units that were produced in late 2012 and late 2013. Apple is also extending the coverage from the three years it normally offers to five years (after the date of purchase). The company will also replace the faulty display hinge for free, the warranty status of the consumer notwithstanding. \nThe exact details of the refund program are yet to be made public by Apple and is currently not listed on its site unlike the company's other Exchange and Repair Extension Programs. Only the company's Authorized Service Providers have the information pertaining to refunds and repairs. How Do I Get My Refund? \nThose who want a refund for the display hinge they got repaired at their expense need to contact Apple over the web or phone to get the process rolling. How To Take Advantage Of The Repair Program \nThose who have a broken display hinge can make an appointment at their nearest Apple Store (with the Genius Bar) or head to an Apple Authorized Service Provider to check if their iMac qualifies for the repair program.

      "text": "Flip \nApple updated its website yesterday allowing customers to send in their old Apple Watch for recycling as well. This means that now Apple will be responsible for recycling the watch under its Renew program free of charge. However, it won’t pay you anything. Photo by fancycrave1 (Pixabay) No value in a u sed Apple Watch \nApple offers a gift card or credit in exchange for used iPhones, iPads and Macs, but it won’t do the same with the watch. Rather, it will recycle the device for free like it does with the iPods. \nThe potential resale value and upgradability in the future were being talked about a lot when the company first released the watch. It became an important question whether the gold version (priced over $10,000) is worth the cost if buyers won’t get a price higher than the cost of the gold when they sell it in the future, notes 9to5 Mac . The company, however, discontinued its fancy and expensive gold watch and has replaced it with a sub-$1,500 Ceramic model. \nApple introduced a new second-generation of the watch as well, indicating that there are significant discounts on first-gen devices. Placing more value on iPhones \nApple is placing a higher value on old iPhones as compared to the Apple Watch. It is not only strange, but depressing as well for early adopters who jumped at Apple’s vision of wearable computing. \nApple launched the watch with a premium design and a matching price tag, with a sort of promise: buy this, and it won’t be like an iPhone, as you won’t need to upgrade your watch every year; it’s an accessory that’s going to stick around. For this reason, according to BGR, it seems like a weird move, since the company is now implying that the watch has basically no value as a used item. \nApple’s recycling website links to third-party partners that recycle the devices and handle gift card credits wherever applicable. Brightstar does recycling for iPads and iPhones and sends out the gift cards for them. PowerOn does the same for Macs, notes 9to5 Mac. \nApple has a separate partner, Sims Recycling Solutions, for recycling devices that it doesn’t offer trade-in credits for, including iPods and now the Apple Watch as well. Interested customers can access these programs at the retail stores and online as well. \nOn Wednesday, Apple shares closed down 0.77% at $110.60.",

Each customer is limited to four discounted transactions.\n\nHSBC joins American Express, DBS Bank, POSB Bank, OCBC, Standard Chartered and UOB, who have all previously launched support for the service in Singapore.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Apple launched Apple Pay in Spain , with support for Mastercard and American Express credit cards issued through Santander bank, Carrefour Pass and Ticket Restaurant. \n\nApple Pay launched in the U.S. in 2014 and has since expanded to cover users in Australia, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland and the U.K. Germany is rumored to be next on Apple's list.\n\nWhen Apple debuted its payments product in Japan, it suffered from a system overload from demand less than one day after launch.\n\nFor now, Apple is concentrating efforts to expand into major markets in Asia and Europe. Ultimately, the company plans to deliver Apple Pay to every market in which its products are sold.",

      "text": "Latest Update on the Tech Sector PART 4 OF 6 Unanswered Questions in Apple’s iPhone 6S Battery Replacement By Rachel Gunter | Dec 1, 2016 10:32 am EST iPhone 6S is shutting down unexpectedly \nApple ( AAPL ) is replacing batteries for customers whose iPhone 6S smartphones shut down unexpectedly. China is one of the markets where customers have reported the problem, according to a Wall Street Journal report. \nApple’s response to replace the faulty battery in the iPhone 6S came less than a week after Chinese consumers raised the alarm. Apple took measures to stem the potential fallout in China, a key iPhone market . \nBut Apple investors can only hope that the iPhone 6S battery problem won’t lead to a massive product recall as Samsung ( SSNLF ) has been forced to do. Samsung recalled millions of Galaxy S7 smartphones and halted the sale of the device over fears that its battery posed the risk of exploding. When did Apple discover the shutdown problem? \nApple has already ruled out safety concerns over the iPhone 6S shutdown problem. But there are still several unanswered questions that could keep investors on edge. \nFor instance, Apple hasn’t revealed how it concluded that the shutdown problem is caused by a faulty battery. The company has also not said when it discovered the problem. Apple has stated that only the iPhone 6S devices manufactured in September 2015 and October 2015 have the unexpected shutdown problem. But the company didn’t explain how it arrived at that conclusion. \nIn the absence of an official clarification from Apple, the company has given way to speculation. Some have claimed that it may have used a different battery or a battery from a different supplier in the iPhones 6S devices that have the shutdown problem. Apple avoids phone carriers in battery replacement program \nApple isn’t collaborating with its carrier partners such as AT&T (T), Verizon ( VZ ), T-Mobile ( TMUS ), or Sprint (S) for its battery replacement program. Instead, customers whose iPhone 6S smartphones are misbehaving can reach Apple through its stores or service partners. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"AAPL\",\"VZ\",\"TMUS\",\"T\",\"S\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Apple Inc.\",\"Verizon Communications Inc.\",null,\"AT&T Inc.\",\"Sprint Nextel Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "Many of the largest “new economy” companies (Apple, Google, etc.) are noted for their ability to adapt quickly to changing marketplace trends. As noted in The Economist (Dec. 2015), Apple sells through its inventories every four days and introduces a new product every four weeks, Facebook updates its software in real time, and fashion retailer Zara designs 40,000 new products a year and ships them to stores twice per week, creating an environment of constant change. Trying to keep pace with the speed of change in the current economy challenges all businesses, including adult education. To help it stay in tune with emerging trends in the business world, Western Continuing Studies (WCS) has partnered with Procept Associates Ltd., Canada’s oldest and largest provider of project management and business analysis training.\n“As one of Canada’s leading universities, we take pride in providing top-quality programming using the best instructors. Partnering with Procept, we can ensure that our programming evolves with the changing marketplace needs and that we can bring highly-experienced instructors who are at the top of their professions,” says Christine Wilton, Program Manager for Western Continuing Studies. “My role involves creating and implementing a strategy that helps us enrich and transform the lives of our diverse audience of adult learners in this rapidly-changing world. We believe that Procept’s exceptional instructors and industry-leading courses will help us meet our strategic goals.”\nWith over 200 classroom and online courses in its catalogue, Procept offers courses ranging from beginner to advanced levels in many fields. Under this new partnership, Procept will be offering several of its project management, business analysis and agile courses through WCS.\nCarlo Barrettara, Procept’s president, supports the partnership, stating “We are delighted to expand our network of university partners in Canada and the USA to include Western, Canada’s leading university. We are pleased that Western Continuing Studies decided that Procept met its high standards of excellence.”\nWilton continues: “As industry standards change and business practices evolve, courses quickly become outdated. Procept’s ongoing investments in updating existing courses and developing new courses to address emerging trends frees Western Continuing Studies from having to do so ourselves. This frees up resources we can devote to other programme areas and towards maintaining our culture of customer service excellence.”\nThe first course of many under the partnership will run at the WCS downtown London campus starting January 25, 2017. The course, Certified Agile Project Manager, will be delivered by Kevin Aguanno, Canada’s leading agile expert and author of over 30 books and DVDs. At the completion of the three-day course, students will write the Certified Agile Project Manager exam from the Project Management Association of Canada (PMAC-AGPC.ca).

According to a new report from Bloomberg, the company plans to use drones to track changes and improve mapping data over time. It would apparently be faster to use a fleet of drones rather than vans with sensors. Apple already admitted that mapping data is a harder problem than the company first anticipated.

      "text": "Apple Reduces iPhone 7 Supplier Orders Amid 'Fading' Demand and 'iPhone 8' Excitement Thursday December 1, 2016 8:06 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Apple has reduced its orders for the iPhone 7 with suppliers, following the initial sales influx within the first month of the device's launch this past September. Supply chain sources speaking with Digitimes pointed towards strong demand for the Jet Black iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 issues as catalysts for the initial shipping momentum, but both factors have now trailed off in producing more iPhone sales leading up to 2017. Because of these factors and more, demand for the iPhone 7 in China and other markets around the world has \"started fading.\" The timing aligns with Apple's typical iPhone manufacturing slow down towards the end of each year, and attention by suppliers and customers is now said to be on 2017's much-anticipated tenth anniversary iPhone. Demand for the iPhone 7 devices in China and other markets has scaled down significantly since their launch less than three months ago, the sources noted. Instead of paying attention to sales performance of the iPhone 7 devices, component suppliers and consumers alike have been shifting their focus to the next generation iPhone to be released in 2017, commented the sources. \"High expectations\" for the so-called iPhone 8 are also factored into the shipment outlook for the iPhone 7 as the new year approaches. In total, shipments for the iPhone 7 are believed to be five million less in the first six months of 2017 than in the four month period the smartphone will have been available by the end of 2016. The iPhone 8 already has a plethora of rumors surrounding its design and potential new features, including a glass body , edge-to-edge display , and wireless charging abilities .",

      "text": "Research and Markets - Analysis of Apple's A10 iPhone 7 Plus Application Processor with a Technical Comparison with Apple's AP, the A9 News provided by Dec 01, 2016, 11:10 ET Share this article DUBLIN , Dec 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the \"TSMC Integrated Fan-Out (inFO) Package Apple A10 iPhone 7 Plus Application Processor: Analysis\" report to their offering. Each year, Apple integrates new technology and innovation inside the iPhone. This year with the iPhone 7, Apple is the first to bring Package on Package (PoP) Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) at the consumer scale. For its new application processor packaging, the A10, Apple has considered to use TSMC's new inFO-PoP (integrated Fan-Out PoP) technology. Located under the DRAM package on the main board, the application processor (AP) is packaged using PoP. Depending on the version (iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus), the DRAM memory has different space management. The Apple A10 is a wafer-level package using TSMC's packaging technology with copper pillar as Through inFO Via (TIV) to replace the well-known Through Molded Via (TMV) technology. With this new technology, Apple marked a huge breaking point with the old traditional PoP found in the previous generations of his APs. In this report, we will show the differences and the innovations of this package: Copper Pillars, Redistribution layer, patent identification, silicon high density capacitor integration, The detailed comparison with the Exynos 8 and the Snapdragon 820 will give the pro and the cons of the inFO technology compared to PoP packaging used in the market. Thanks to this inFO process, Apple is able to propose a very thin package on package, with a high number of I/O pads and better thermal management. The result is a very cost-effective component that can compete with any well-known PoP. In the report, the cost comparison is also including in order to highlight the difference. This report also includes a technical comparison with previous Apple AP, the A9. Key Topics Covered: 2. Company Profile and Supply Chain 3. Physical Analysis",

Recently, Shaw ditched the Wind Mobile brand and announced that Freedom Mobile is the new name of the wireless carrier. \nSamsung’s exploding battery issues with the Galaxy Note 7 also makes the list. Approximately 39,000 Note 7 devices were sold or distributed in Health Canada issued a mandatory recall.

      "text": "Market prices imply no future growth and Apple looks attractive on a relative and standalone basis. \nEven if iPhone sales have peaked there are several business and macro tailwinds for 2017. \nForecast for 2017: net sales of $228.6 billion and EBITDA of $74.5 billion. \nFair value estimate: $133. Rating: Buy. \nMarket Expectations \nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) finished the most recent quarter with $237.6 billion in cash plus financial assets. Apple sold nearly 212 million iPhones globally. Now what? \nWell, the status quo is that Apple is perpetually undervalued, at least since 2012 on a price-to-earnings multiple, relative to the S&P 500. Tough love given Apple grew earnings by 64% over the past five years. \nAt time of writing Apple is trading at $111 per share. It's clear at this price the market isn't discounting much future growth. \nJust divide 1 by your cost of equity estimate to get the P/E that would be a fair multiple to pay for the current business, as is, no growth. Let's use 9%, for this example. \nSo, if Apple traded at exactly 11.1 times earnings, the market price would imply a future without growth. Apple's trailing P/E based on a $111 share price and basic EPS is 13.3x. Expectations for future growth are low. \nThe Brand \nIn forming an outlook for 2017, it's useful to put in perspective how innovative and user-friendly Apple hardware and software is. Apple products are often described as ones that simply work. Not all the competitors, past and present, can say the same. \nSome of the worst feedback in 2016 was for the new ports, USB-C, used on the MacBook Pro, which required costly adaptors. Apple responded with price cuts on all the newly required accessories. Other recent missteps to mention include Apple Maps and the iOS 8.0.1 update. But at the end of they day, Apple maintains high, perceived or real, switching costs, which bodes well for fending off competition in the years to come. Interbrand estimates Apple's brand to be worth $178,119 million, ahead of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) by $45 million, $105 million, and $126 million, respectively. \nJust imagine Motorola or Nokia had some complementary devices or services. What if BlackBerry (NASDAQ: BBRY ) had more than BBM? Apple does: Apple Watch Series 2, Apple Pay, Apple TV, iOS 10 and the App Store. \nWhat's in store for 2017? \nWhat's next is what worries investors, especially given the lower return on R&D Apple has delivered over the past five years - in stark contrast to the long-term trend. To us, the recent trend of lower return on research and development indicates that many of Apple's core products have reach maturity. But also that management is putting a lot of capital to work to develop new technologies. \nApple is integrating augmented reality into the iPhone camera, testing wearable technology like glasses, pondering a scaled down version of a rumored Apple Car, perhaps simply an autonomous driving operating system. The timeline on these projects is unknown. But we view Apple shareholders as the owners of long-term call options on the success of any of these technologies. The call options are valuable, given Apple's deep pockets and track record of successfully bringing new tech to market. The market's current low expectations also reduces the cost and increases the probability of profit on these options. \nTailwinds in 2017 \niPhone sales likely peaked in 2015, with 231 million units sold that year. 2016 saw nearly a 7.7% year-on-year total revenue decline. But in the latest conference call , Luca Maestri called for a record setting quarter to start off 2017 - $76 to $78 billion in sales. The midpoint of the guidance represents a 1.6% increase versus the 2016 first quarter net sales results and 3.2% greater than those of 2015. \nFor 2017, it's clear that easy growth may be now only a memory. Today not many of those who purchase an iPhone can call themselves early adopters. But there are several reasons to be optimistic for 2017. \nIn 2017, new product launches will play a significant role in terms of unit sales and Apple's ability to raise prices. Higher prices aren't the norm in the technology sector, but the average sales price of iPhone is set to increase further. The cheapest available handset now retails for $649. Worldwide the average sales price in the last quarter of 2016 was $619 and $595 in the quarter before that. \nThe Mac lineup also will receive a lift from the new generation of MacBook Pro laptops. Also, the Services segment will continue to benefit from greater adoption and use of Apple Pay and iCloud. As Tim Cook noted, Apple Pay transactions were up 500% on a year-over-year basis in the last quarter of 2016. \nIn 2017, year-on-year revenue comparisons will be easier, given the third quarter of 2016 represented the trough of the iPhone 6 cycle. Margins may also surprise if the devastating impact from the US dollar rally subsides. Foreign currency headwinds impacted Apple's gross margin by an incremental 340 bps in 2016, relative to 2015. Apple also will continue to benefit from macro trends like greater adoption of high-speed communications networks in emerging markets. \nAs 2017 plays out, Apple shareholders also will benefit from the capital return program. \nSince re-instating dividend payments in 2012, Apple has a solid track record of increasing payments annually. The dividend is up 30% over the last three years. Another dividend increase is almost certain in 2017. Just compare Apple to its more mature competitors HP (NYSE: HPQ ) and Microsoft that pay out 34% and 68%, respectively. Apple pays out 27%. \nApple's capital return program, dividends and buybacks, is set to return another $63.8 billion by March 2018. That's about $12 per current share outstanding. \nFair Value Estimate: $133 \nOur fair value estimate is $133 per share. Base case assumptions include a corporate tax rate of 25.6%, the status quo, net sales of $228.6 billion in 2017, up 6% from 2016, and from there, a slight decline with a CAGR in revenues of 4.7%, from 2017 to 2021. \nWe further expect SG&A costs to remain flat as a percentage of sales and Apple's net investment to increase as it seeks to develop new technologies. The cost of capital input is 10%. \nTo be clear the base case assumptions don't price in greater return on R&D investment, nor do they assume the spectacular revenue growth of the past five years, a result of the iPhone. In our opinion, the assumptions are conservative. \nThere is room for Apple shares to appreciate in 2017 as the company also looks attractive on a relative basis. For example, our base case projects that Apple will earn an EBITDA of $74.5 billion, up 5.6% from 2016. The median of analysts' estimate is $73.5 billion. If Apple reaches our EBITDA target and the EV/ EBITDA multiple remains constant, at 8.4x, Apple shares should trade at $145. \nAt current market prices, $111 per share, the expectations for Apple shares are solely negative. The market prices in materially slower revenue growth, about 3% top line growth by 2021, moderately higher operating costs, and significantly higher net investment requirements. Negative sentiment appears to be the consensus. But low expectations can be just what Apple buyers need.

      "text": "Force Delete is a new jailbreak tweak Apple needs to add in iOS 10.3 Submitted by Marshall Walker on December 1, 2016 - 11:21am \niOS 10 has made deleting apps from your device a real headache. Before iOS 10 developers had the option of adding 3D Touch features to their apps, but with iOS 10 every app installed on your device includes a 3D Touch sharing option. This has made it difficult to delete apps from your device using the original jiggle technique. It really isn't a major issue, but it can be annoying when you're trying to simply delete and app form your device, and instead the 3D Touch menu keeps popping up. \nForce Delete is a free jailbreak tweak   utilize 3D Touch to delete apps, according to iDownloadBlog . The tweak adds a “Delete this app” option to the 3D Touch menu for all third-party apps installed on your device. \nThe tweak also includes an option to hide stock Apple apps and pre-installed Cydia apps. This is a great feature for users with jailbroken devices who are stuck at iOS 9.x.x. Apple introduced the ability to delete some stock apps in iOS 10.0. \nWe have already made the case for Apple to add a delete app option in the 3D Touch Quick Action menus. It would be great if Apple could ditch the old jiggle mode altogether, but the iPhone SE unfortunately does not include the 3D Touch feature. It is safe to assume Apple will eventually ditch the old deletion technique for 3D Touch, and it wouldn't be the first time the iPhone-maker has used a jailbreak tweak as its template. Hopefully we won't have to wait until the iPhone SE is discontinued, and Apple will offer both deletion options in a future software update, like iOS 10.3. tags:",

      "text": "Apple is reportedly using drones to improve Maps It's building a robotics and data team that can update its mapping app faster. Share Save \nApple is putting a team together that will capture mapping data using drones to supplement its camera-equipped minivans, Bloomberg says. While its Maps app is no longer the butt of jokes , Apple reportedly wants to better the quality of Google Maps, an app that's still more widely used on all platforms. The team may use UAVs from companies like DJI and Aibotix to keep maps up-to-date with construction, new roads and other info. \nApple is also trying to improve car and indoor navigation, according to unnamed company sources. The latter isn't too much of a surprise, as Apple recently bought an indoor tracking company called Indoor.io last year, and purchased WiFiSlam back in 2013. The company even released an app called Indoor Survey last year that lets you figure out your location in an indoor venue, even if it hasn't been mapped. \nAs for the drone team, it's reportedly being assembled in Seattle and run by someone hired away from Amazon's Prime Air division. Apple applied for FAA permits last year to fly commercial drones to \"conduct data collection, photography and videography,\" according to a document dug up by Bloomberg . If it follows the new FAA rules , operations in cities will be limited to licensed pilots flying in daytime hours with line-of-site views of the drones. Images and other data collected will then be rapidly incorporated into Maps. \nApple doesn't use its mapping service to sell ads like Google does, but it certainly wants to keep users and developers on its own ecosystem. The company has made large strides lately improving Maps with public transit data, and recently incorporated third-party extensions from Lyft, OpenTable and Uber into iOS 10. As a result of its work, Maps is now reportedly used at least three times more often by users than Google Maps on iOS. We've contacted Apple to confirm the story, but don't hold your breath.",

      "text": "Fallen smartphone brand Nokia challenges Apple, Samsung again The Wider Image: Phones and the city. Photo: Reuters Published: 10:00 PM, December 1, 2016 Updated: 12:10 AM, December 2, 2016 \nFRANKFURT/HELSINKI - Nokia smartphones are poised for a comeback after former managers at the Finnish company licensed the handset brand from Microsoft and struck up partnerships with Google and phone manufacturer Foxconn. \nNokia was once the world's dominant cellphone maker but missed the shift to smartphones and then chose Microsoft's unpopular Windows operating system for its \"Lumia\" range. \nNokia quit smartphones in 2014 by selling its handset activities to Microsoft to focus on mobile network equipment. Microsoft continued selling Lumia smartphones under its own name but this year largely abandoned that business, too. \nHMD Global, led by Nokia veteran Arto Nummela, wants to launch its first Nokia smartphone in the early part of next year using Google's <GOOGL.O> Android operating system. \nSuccess will require a dash for scale by stealing business from Apple <AAPL.O>, Samsung <005930.KS> and dozens of other players in a cut-throat industry. \n\"Consumers may be carrying different smartphones now, but are they really in love and loyal to those brands?\" said Nummela in an interview. \nThe Nokia consumer brand lives on as the badge on cheaper, entry-level \"feature phones\" sold mainly in Asia, India and Eastern Europe, though Microsoft invested little to market the name in recent years. Smartphones typically cost anywhere from ten to 30 times as much as these basic phones, which sell for as little as $20. \n\"For a new entrant, having an established brand provides it with an instant on-ramp,\" said mobile phone analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight, who suggested that phone vendors with weaker brands should not take the new challenge lightly. \n\"The barriers to entry for the Android phone space are low,\" said Wood. \"What HMD has is the Nokia brand and management experience. The key to its success will be driving scale.\" \nCEO Nummela, who was once responsible for Nokia's sales and product development, does not lack ambition. \n\"We want to be one of the key competitive players in the smartphone business,\" he told Reuters. \nHMD President Florian Seiche previously worked at Siemens <SIEGn.DE>, Orange, HTC and Nokia. Chief Marketing Officer Pekka Rantala is a former CEO of Rovio, the maker of the Angry Birds game, as well as a Nokia veteran. \n\"We are not going to skip any markets in the long term,\" Seiche said, adding that HMD had already set up offices in 40 locations around the world. \nNO FUNDING FROM NOKIA CORP \nHMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund run by Jean-Francois Baril, who was once in charge of Nokia's world-leading supply chain management system. Other HMD managers have put in money of their own. \nHMD on Thursday took over the feature phone business that Nokia Corp <NOKIA.HE> sold to Microsoft. It has a licensing deal with Nokia giving it sole use of the brand on mobile phones and tablets for the next decade. It will pay Nokia royalties for the brand and patents, but Nokia has no direct investment in HMD. \nHMD is building its smartphone operating system in partnership with Google and all its Nokia devices will be manufactured by Foxconn <2354.TW> of Taiwan, the world's largest contract manufacturer. \nNummela says his team's enduring relationships with phone service providers and retailers could help HMD quickly convince owners of Nokia feature phones to upgrade in markets like India, Indonesia and Russia. \nThe Nokia name is still on a tenth of the feature phones sold around the world, though in recent years it ceded ground to Samsung and TCL <000100.SZ>, maker of Alcatel-brand phones, as well as smaller players, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. \nShipments of Nokia feature phones plunged 40 percent in fiscal year 2015 and HMD must reverse that decline while trying to break back into the smartphone market, where hundreds of vendors compete by selling phones that can be hard to distinguish. \n\"The feature phone is the essence of the business,\" Wood said. \"Don't be under any illusions that this market is over.\" REUTERS",

      "text": "Further Reading Apple Maps debacle is why Apple has a public beta program now The Apple Maps experience today is dramatically better than it was when the product first launched with iOS 6 in 2012, but Apple is still looking for ways to improve its data collection and compete with Google Maps. According to a report from Bloomberg , the next stage in this effort is to use a fleet of drones from DJI, Aibotix, and others to look at street signs, track road construction, and examine other changes. It's not clear if these drones will replace or merely augment the data already being collected by Apple Maps minivans.\nApple was granted an exemption by the Federal Aviation Administration in March of 2016, allowing the company to commercially fly drones to gather data. Current rules for unmanned aircraft systems ( PDF ) restrict drone flights to daylight hours and insist that pilots maintain line-of-sight with the drones at all times, among many other rules. The company is said to have hired someone from Amazon's \"Prime Air\" drone delivery project to head up its drone team, which is currently being assembled in Seattle rather than at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters.\nThe initial versions of Apple Maps hadn't been vetted thoroughly enough, and the initial backlash to the product led to changes across the company. CEO Tim Cook publicly apologized for Apple Maps in 2012, and longtime iOS software lead Scott Forstall's refusal to sign that apology was one of the reasons he left the company . In an interview earlier this year , Cook, Software Engineering SVP Craig Federighi, and Internet Software and Services SVP Eddy Cue said that the Maps problems had led directly to Apple's public beta programs for macOS and iOS.\n\"We made significant changes to all of our development processes because of [Maps],\" Cue said. \"To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good. Right? So [the problem] wasn’t obvious to us. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. Now we do.\"",

      "text": "on Dec 1, 2016, 12:00 PM TechSpot \nBefore Google, Apple, Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony, Huawei and a host of other modern-day handset makers rose to prominence, Nokia ruled the roost. From the late ‘90s through the early 2000s, mobile phones like the Nokia 5110 and Nokia 3310 were ubiquitous (remember Snake?). \nMuch like BlackBerry years later, Nokia became content with its lead and failed to make the transition to smartphones. A series of failed ventures with Microsoft over the last several years did little to help the cause. \nIn May of this year, Microsoft sold off what was left of the feature phone business to Finnish firm HMD Global . The company also signed a licensing deal that gives it exclusive use of the Nokia brand on mobile phones and tablets for the next decade. \nOn Thursday, HMD Global announced its intentions to become a major player in the global smartphone market. Its path to reaching that goal will begin in the first half of 2017 with the arrival of the first Nokia-branded smartphone products running Google’s Android mobile operating system. The company has enlisted the help of FIH Mobile Limited, a subsidiary of Foxconn, to handle manufacturing duties. \nLed by a number of former Microsoft and Nokia employees, HMD Global likely gives the Nokia brand the best chance yet to succeed in a smartphone-first world. That said, brand loyalty only goes so far. Given today’s fiercely competitive landscape and the fact that several key markets are becoming saturated, finding success won’t be easy.

      "text": "By: Research and Markets via PR Newswire December 01, 2016 at 11:10 AM EST Research and Markets - Analysis of Apple's A10 iPhone 7 Plus Application Processor with a Technical Comparison with Apple's AP, the A9 \nDUBLIN , Dec 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- \nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"TSMC Integrated Fan-Out (inFO) Package Apple A10 iPhone 7 Plus Application Processor: Analysis\" report to their offering. \nEach year, Apple integrates new technology and innovation inside the iPhone. This year with the iPhone 7, Apple is the first to bring Package on Package (PoP) Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) at the consumer scale. For its new application processor packaging, the A10, Apple has considered to use TSMC's new inFO-PoP (integrated Fan-Out PoP) technology. \nLocated under the DRAM package on the main board, the application processor (AP) is packaged using PoP. Depending on the version (iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus), the DRAM memory has different space management. \nThe Apple A10 is a wafer-level package using TSMC's packaging technology with copper pillar as Through inFO Via (TIV) to replace the well-known Through Molded Via (TMV) technology. With this new technology, Apple marked a huge breaking point with the old traditional PoP found in the previous generations of his APs. In this report, we will show the differences and the innovations of this package: Copper Pillars, Redistribution layer, patent identification, silicon high density capacitor integration, The detailed comparison with the Exynos 8 and the Snapdragon 820 will give the pro and the cons of the inFO technology compared to PoP packaging used in the market. \nThanks to this inFO process, Apple is able to propose a very thin package on package, with a high number of I/O pads and better thermal management. The result is a very cost-effective component that can compete with any well-known PoP. In the report, the cost comparison is also including in order to highlight the difference. \nThis report also includes a technical comparison with previous Apple AP, the A9. \nKey Topics Covered: \n2. Company Profile and Supply Chain 3. Physical Analysis",

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth 22/22 By Eric Auchard and Jussi Rosendahl | FRANKFURT/HELSINKI \nFRANKFURT/HELSINKI Nokia smartphones are poised for a comeback after former managers at the Finnish company licensed the handset brand from Microsoft and struck up partnerships with Google and phone manufacturer Foxconn. \nNokia was once the world's dominant cellphone maker but missed the shift to smartphones and then chose Microsoft's unpopular Windows operating system for its \"Lumia\" range. \nNokia quit smartphones in 2014 by selling its handset activities to Microsoft to focus on mobile network equipment. Microsoft continued selling Lumia smartphones under its own name but this year largely abandoned that business, too. \nHMD Global, led by Nokia veteran Arto Nummela, wants to launch its first Nokia smartphone in the early part of next year using Google's ( GOOGL.O ) Android operating system. \nSuccess will require a dash for scale by stealing business from Apple ( AAPL.O ), Samsung ( 005930.KS ) and dozens of other players in a cut-throat industry. \n\"Consumers may be carrying different smartphones now, but are they really in love and loyal to those brands?\" said Nummela in an interview. \nThe Nokia consumer brand lives on as the badge on cheaper, entry-level \"feature phones\" sold mainly in Asia, India and Eastern Europe, though Microsoft invested little to market the name in recent years. Smartphones typically cost anywhere from ten to 30 times as much as these basic phones, which sell for as little as $20. \n\"For a new entrant, having an established brand provides it with an instant on-ramp,\" said mobile phone analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight, who suggested that phone vendors with weaker brands should not take the new challenge lightly. \n\"The barriers to entry for the Android phone space are low,\" said Wood. \"What HMD has is the Nokia brand and management experience. The key to its success will be driving scale.\" \nCEO Nummela, who was once responsible for Nokia's sales and product development, does not lack ambition. \n\"We want to be one of the key competitive players in the smartphone business,\" he told Reuters. \nHMD President Florian Seiche previously worked at Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ), Orange, HTC and Nokia. Chief Marketing Officer Pekka Rantala is a former CEO of Rovio, the maker of the Angry Birds game, as well as a Nokia veteran. \n\"We are not going to skip any markets in the long term,\" Seiche said, adding that HMD had already set up offices in 40 locations around the world. \nNO FUNDING FROM NOKIA CORP \nHMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund run by Jean-Francois Baril, who was once in charge of Nokia's world-leading supply chain management system. Other HMD managers have put in money of their own. \nHMD on Thursday took over the feature phone business that Nokia Corp ( NOKIA.HE ) sold to Microsoft. It has a licensing deal with Nokia giving it sole use of the brand on mobile phones and tablets for the next decade. It will pay Nokia royalties for the brand and patents, but Nokia has no direct investment in HMD. \nHMD is building its smartphone operating system in partnership with Google and all its Nokia devices will be manufactured by Foxconn ( 2354.TW ) of Taiwan, the world's largest contract manufacturer. \nNummela says his team's enduring relationships with phone service providers and retailers could help HMD quickly convince owners of Nokia feature phones to upgrade in markets like India, Indonesia and Russia. \nThe Nokia name is still on a tenth of the feature phones sold around the world, though in recent years it ceded ground to Samsung and TCL ( 000100.SZ ), maker of Alcatel-brand phones, as well as smaller players, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. \nShipments of Nokia feature phones plunged 40 percent in fiscal year 2015 and HMD must reverse that decline while trying to break back into the smartphone market, where hundreds of vendors compete by selling phones that can be hard to distinguish. \n\"The feature phone is the essence of the business,\" Wood said. \"Don't be under any illusions that this market is over.\" \n(Editing by Jane Merriman and Tom Pfeiffer) Next In Business News",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Tiny Wings Officially Launches on Apple TV by Abdel Ibrahim December 1, 2016 \nPopular iOS game Tiny Wings has officially launched today on Apple TV for $2.99 . The launch was teased by the game’s developers earlier this week in a preview that showed that the game would offer new multi-player options. Tiny Wings Multiplayer Mode \nOne of the highlight features is the ability for two players to play together from one Siri remote or with a Siri remote and an MFI-certified controller, such as the SteelSeries Nimbus . You can even connect to the Tiny Wings app on iOS and use your iPhone or iPad as a controller. Super cool. \nOther than that, Tiny Wings for the Apple TV is the same game you loved on your iPhone or iPad. It’s a pretty straightforward game that can become pretty addictive once you establish a score that you want to beat, sort of like Crossy Road. \nYou can learn a little more about it here on our app page or you can go straight to downloading it right here .

This was also the case this year, when we saw the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus hit the markets. More notably, getting a 7 Plus was kind of impossible in the first days, especially if you were going for a Black or an elusive Jet Black finish.Well, it seems everything is easing off a bit now. No official word on sales numbers, but alleged sources from inside the iPhone supply chain are supposedly reporting that Apple is reducing the amount of orders, which directly translates into “it's not selling that much anymore”. Don't get us wrong, it's probably still flying off the shelves, just not in a manner that would leave stores out of stock for as long as it used to. Apple iPhone 7",

      "text": "Tweet Share A woman poses with a Nokia Lumia smartphone in this photo illustration, May 6, 2013. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo More By Eric Auchard and Jussi Rosendahl FRANKFURT/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia smartphones are poised for a comeback after former managers at the Finnish company licensed the handset brand from Microsoft and struck up partnerships with Google and phone manufacturer Foxconn. Nokia was once the world's dominant cellphone maker but missed the shift to smartphones and then chose Microsoft's unpopular Windows operating system for its \"Lumia\" range. Nokia quit smartphones in 2014 by selling its handset activities to Microsoft to focus on mobile network equipment. Microsoft continued selling Lumia smartphones under its own name but this year largely abandoned that business, too. HMD Global, led by Nokia veteran Arto Nummela, wants to launch its first Nokia smartphone in the early part of next year using Google's (GOOGL.O) Android operating system. Success will require a dash for scale by stealing business from Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung <005930.KS> and dozens of other players in a cut-throat industry. \"Consumers may be carrying different smartphones now, but are they really in love and loyal to those brands?\" said Nummela in an interview. The Nokia consumer brand lives on as the badge on cheaper, entry-level \"feature phones\" sold mainly in Asia, India and Eastern Europe, though Microsoft invested little to market the name in recent years. Smartphones typically cost anywhere from ten to 30 times as much as these basic phones, which sell for as little as $20. \"For a new entrant, having an established brand provides it with an instant on-ramp,\" said mobile phone analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight, who suggested that phone vendors with weaker brands should not take the new challenge lightly. \"The barriers to entry for the Android phone space are low,\" said Wood. \"What HMD has is the Nokia brand and management experience. The key to its success will be driving scale.\" CEO Nummela, who was once responsible for Nokia's sales and product development, does not lack ambition. \"We want to be one of the key competitive players in the smartphone business,\" he told Reuters. HMD President Florian Seiche previously worked at Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Orange, HTC and Nokia. Chief Marketing Officer Pekka Rantala is a former CEO of Rovio, the maker of the Angry Birds game, as well as a Nokia veteran. \"We are not going to skip any markets in the long term,\" Seiche said, adding that HMD had already set up offices in 40 locations around the world. NO FUNDING FROM NOKIA CORP HMD is owned by Smart Connect LP, a private equity fund run by Jean-Francois Baril, who was once in charge of Nokia's world-leading supply chain management system. Other HMD managers have put in money of their own. HMD on Thursday took over the feature phone business that Nokia Corp (NOKIA.HE) sold to Microsoft. It has a licensing deal with Nokia giving it sole use of the brand on mobile phones and tablets for the next decade. It will pay Nokia royalties for the brand and patents, but Nokia has no direct investment in HMD. HMD is building its smartphone operating system in partnership with Google and all its Nokia devices will be manufactured by Foxconn (2354.TW) of Taiwan, the world's largest contract manufacturer. Nummela says his team's enduring relationships with phone service providers and retailers could help HMD quickly convince owners of Nokia feature phones to upgrade in markets like India, Indonesia and Russia. The Nokia name is still on a tenth of the feature phones sold around the world, though in recent years it ceded ground to Samsung and TCL <000100.SZ>, maker of Alcatel-brand phones, as well as smaller players, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. Shipments of Nokia feature phones plunged 40 percent in fiscal year 2015 and HMD must reverse that decline while trying to break back into the smartphone market, where hundreds of vendors compete by selling phones that can be hard to distinguish. \"The feature phone is the essence of the business,\" Wood said. \"Don't be under any illusions that this market is over.\" (Editing by Jane Merriman and Tom Pfeiffer) Reblog",

      "text": "(NEWS10) — Shopping online especially through your phone can be great. If you’re a loyal customer, you get deep discounts access to exclusive sales and it’s convenient. However, shoppers beware: There is a surge in fake apps hitting the app stores both on Google and Apple.\nIf you’re like Kyle Giglio, you do most of your holiday shopping from the palm of your hand.\n“[It’s] very convenient to have a mobile app when you’re out shopping,” Giglio said.\nHe has got it down to a science.\n“If I’m going to a store and then I see something, I go to my phone and say, ‘Can I find it cheaper on eBay or Amazon?’” Giglio explained.\nBefore you start downloading an app, watch out for the copy cats launched by third parties to collect your information\n“Coming into holiday, we have seen hundreds of them getting launched all the time,” Chris Mason from Branding Brand said.\nMason’s company Branding Brand creates apps for some major retailers like Sephora, American Eagle, Dick’s Sporting Goods, and hundreds of other trusted brands.\nMason has noticed the app market, both on the Google Play and the App Store, surge with dozens of dupes made to look like they’re from a real retailer. Names like Dillard’s, Payless, Big Lots and Pandora are some that were hijacked.\n“If you download the Dillard’s app, it looks like its Dillard’s, [but it’s] actually someone trying to dupe consumers into downloading their app,” Mason said.\nApple has already removed some of these fake apps, but when we searched, we found more pop up like Just Fab and Shoe Dazzle.\n“[There are] fake apps for Shoe Dazzle and Just Fab,” Mason said. “Just Fab doesn’t have an app. Someone is positioning themselves as the app for that retailer.”\nWhen you type in shopping in the app store, hundreds of apps pop up. To make sure you’re downloading something put out by a company you trust, just go to their website and they’ll probably have a link to download their official app.\n“Look at the reviews for the app,” Mason advised. “If there are no reviews or reviews are bad, then that’s a red flag.”\nSo before you fill up that digital shopping cart like Giglio, beware, because even he didn’t know about the risk until he was told.\n“You’re putting your device at risk. We don’t know what they’re for. They could be trying to steal consumer information, they could be installing malware on your device.”",

Here's a list of all of the banks and credit unions that allow you pay with a tap of your iPhone. \nApple Pay is a convenient, secure way to make purchases both in stores and in apps.

Here you'll find a list of banks, credit unions, and card issuers that Apple says support Apple Pay , which we'll keep updated as new financial institutions and countries are added.",

      "text": "– A + HMD Global aims to reclaim Nokia's lost cellphone glories, will fight Apple and Samsung By Mike Wuerthele \nThursday, December 01, 2016, 09:45 am PT (12:45 pm ET) \nAfter Microsoft's throwing away of the Nokia brand name, a company has licensed the brand and is planning on tackling Samsung and Apple's on the smartphone field of battle after an initial wave of feature phones.\n\n\n\n\nAfter a May announcement that the Nokia brand was returning , a formal licensing agreement has been finalized with Finnish company HMD Global which is mostly staffed by Nokia executives. The deal, lasting for at least 10 years, has already led to a new phone section on the Nokia site.\n\nThe first Android-based smartphones from the partnership will be manufactured by Apple partner Foxconn, and show up in the first half of 2017.\n\n\"Consumers may be carrying different smartphones now, but are they really in love and loyal to those brands?\" said HMD Global CEO and ex-Nokia executive Arto Nummela about offerings from Apple and Samsung. \"We want to be one of the key competitive players in the smartphone business.\"\n\nHMD Global will pay royalties for the Nokia brand and patents, but Nokia as a corporate entity has no investment in the firm.\n\n\"The market is fatigued and flooded with undifferentiated products,\" claims HMD Global President Florian Seiche. \"We believe we are perfectly placed to forge a new way in mobile.\"\n\nHMD global was formed in May 2016 after purchasing part of the feature phone business of Microsoft Mobile, the company founded after Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia's mobile phone business in 2014.",

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video]   1:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "title": "Reducing Damage From The iOS 10 List-Unsubscribe 12/01/2016",
      "text": "By now, you’re undoubtedly seeing the effects of Apple’s list-unsubscribe feature in the iOS10 release in September. With the major release, Apple prominently positioned an unsubscribe mechanism at the top of emails sent from bulk senders with a message that reads “This message is from a mailing list.”   \nThis is a continuation of a trend we’ve been seeing with mailbox providers like Gmail, Yahoo and Microsoft aiming for a user-focused inbox that keeps consumers loyal to their respective services.   \nWhat is the impact?\n\nResearch that was shared by MediaPost earlier this month claimed that unsubscribes were up 75% among Apple users. Additionally, according to the report, “retail-specific email marketing campaigns have seen their unsubscribe rates double since September while the financial services and entertainment industries have seen their unsubscribe rates triple since the release of iOS 10.”\nIn a nutshell, things aren’t looking so good for brands and their unsubscribe rates.\nWhat can you do to minimize subscriber losses?\n1. It’s time to invest in data and put that data to work. I’ve stressed this point repeatedly, even as recently as a month ago . There is simply no way around it.  Without a significant investment in data to understand your customers, it is impossible to send relevant and personalized communications.  \nMy inbox is still very full of basic, batch-and-blast campaigns that lack any reference to my prior behaviors and interests. It’s clear that the industry is lagging behind consumer expectations, and data is the single biggest crystal ball into understanding what consumers want from you in their inbox.\n2. Profiling is a powerful ally against unsubscribes. Profiling is a very powerful tool in understanding what your customers want to prevent unsubscribes, so use it. Collect explicit data through surveys and profile/preference centers. You can also “listen” to your customers by looking at the types of links they click, and using that information to populate profiles as well.\nFor example, if a customer repeatedly clicks on links for “Women’s Tops,” you can add women’s tops to that customer’s profile for targeting and segmentation later. By using a combination of explicit and implicit profiling, you’re giving customers the opportunity to provide data on their interests, but also ensuring non-responders to explicit methods have complete profiles as well. This also keeps your data always fresh.  \n3. Look at operating systems and not just domains in reports . It’s not useful to know just a breakdown of your list by domain. You also need a deep knowledge of the environments where your customers are engaging with your emails -- like their operating system and mail client. Does half of your list use iOS10? That can be powerful evidence to get more budget to do more with data and personalization in 2017.\n4. Subject lines, preheaders, and headlines are a sinker or a life raft . To take a recent quote from Loren McDonald: “What’s up with email subject lines coming from big brands lately? Way too many look like lazy marketing or borderline spam.”\nIf ever there was a time for you to step up your game when it comes to the impression you create in each email, it’s now. If a spammy looking subject line, gimmicky pre-header and unengaging header are positioned near the new iOS10 unsubscribe, what do you think your customers are going to do?\nIf you get it right, your customers will skim right over that unsubscribe glaring them in the face and engage with your email.\nWhile the effects of the latest Apple release are disheartening, it’s not all dire. By employing some of the recommendations above, you can reduce unsubscribes. The worst thing that happens is you still lose customers along the way. Isn’t that better than spam complaints that could impact your deliverability and keep your emails from customers who do want them?\nWhat are you seeing as a result of the iOS10 unsubscribe?  What are you doing about it?  Let me know in the comments.",
