      "text": "The Guardian ^ | 18 Nov 2016 | Graham Ruddick \nPosted on 11/20/2016 11:05:21 PM PST by Cronos \nAmazon will almost certainly enjoy its biggest ever day on Black Friday next week. \nThe discount shopping event will help the American online retailer to continue its run of 22 years of unbroken and dramatic sales growth since it was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. It is now valued at more than $375bn (£304bn), making it one of the biggest companies in the world. \nHowever, despite the predicted spending spree on Black Friday, the rise of Amazon and Bezos now face arguably their biggest challenge yet - Donald Trump. \n... The battle started last December with a series of seemingly unprompted tweets from Trump. The Washington Post, which loses a fortune, is owned by Jeff Bezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no-profit company, Amazon, Trump wrote. If Amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The Washington Post scam is saving it! \nThe Washington Post is owned through Bezoss personal investment firm, rather than Amazon, and Trump did not provide any explanation for his allegation. Amazons tax policy is controversial and is already well-known around the world, including in Europe, where it agreed favourable tax arrangements with Luxembourg. Its profit margins are also notoriously thin. In 2015, Amazon recorded sales of $107bn but net profits of just $596m, a margin of barely 0.5%. \n...The Republican presidential candidate then told Fox News that Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise and has a huge antitrust problem because hes [Bezos] controlling so much. \n...Shares in Amazon dropped by almost 10% in the five days after Trumps election, more than other technology companies such as Google and Apple (Excerpt) Read more at theguardian.com ...",

Car dealers will never stand for it, even if consumers might love the idea.\nThe only way to sell new cars in the US is to own a car dealership as a franchise. Tesla is an exception in over 20 states where it has established stores as a manufacturer selling direct to consumers, but it has been stalled in other states, and in any case, the automaker isn't currently big enough to be a threat to car dealers nationally.\nRather than taking on car dealers — an undertaking that's rife with failures, as the major automakers have discovered when they've tried to do it, even before the internet came along — Amazon will probably pitch itself as a generator of very high-quality sales leads.\nHow it might work Buyers will likely visit the Amazon Vehicles site, research a new car, maybe even start to spec one out, and then be presented with dealership, financing, and insurance options. This package will then the passed along by Amazon to a local car dealers or dealer network that's partnered with the program, in order to complete the deal. \nAmazon will pocket a fee if the sales goes through, and the dealer will get the sale.\nThis is already an established online business, with a variety of auto-information sites generating dealer leads.\nThere is a potential problem, however, with Amazon's entry into this business: pricing.\nIn Italy, a 30% discount is being applied to sales. Dealers in the US might accept a price cut like that for very slow-selling models, but if the leads that Amazon passes on to them for other vehicles are so substantially discounted, dealers will lose too much money. If they're flooded with el-cheapo leads, then they won't want to participate in the program.\nWhat about Amazon at some point becoming a true direct-seller of new cars?\nScreenshot via Amazon \nAgain, the discounting could be a problem. Amazon would have to buy new vehicles from carmakers and devise ways of delivering that inventory to customers. It would in effect become a car dealer in its own right. If it moved into insurance and financing, it would eventually have to build physical dealerships. \nThere are some car mega-dealers in the US who might see that as a pretty big threat and would use their influence and the state and federal level to block it.

Yes, while you would usually deploy a deft box opening and Sellotape re-application around this time of year, you can now x-ray through packages to discover the contents. Seriously. The retail giant is bringing the interestingly-named 'Package X-Ray' tool to its iOS app just ahead of the holiday, with users able to scan the barcode through their camera to reveal all. Related: Today's best Amazon Black Friday deals There are a couple of caveats, though. First of all, as the image above shows, it's not the cool x-ray vision you're probably wanting. More importantly, you're going to need access to the buyer's phone in order to scan the product. And while, yes, if you did somehow have the user's phone in your possession, you could just take a look at their confirmation emails, this is a much more elaborate and fun way to ruin Christmas. So go off and work on your 'OMG, I'm super surprised and excited about this gift I knew nothing about' face while everyone else feasts on Amazon's bevy of Black Friday offerings.

      "text": "Stuart Leave a Comment \nI looked over at my phone to see the time, and what do I find? An Amazon alert that something from my wishlist was on sale. \nThis Dewalt DGC530 USB charging tool backpack is on sale as part of a Lightning Deal, for $53.62. You save a few dollars off the regular price of $60. Advertisement \nThe cool thing about this new Dewalt tool backpack is that you can pop in a 20V Max battery pack, and there’s a built in 2-port USB charger, which can recharge your tablet, phone, or USB-chargeable device or instrument. \nThis was on my “this is a cool took I want to post about” list, which is why it was in my Amazon wishlist. While I still want to write a full post about it, the time sensitive nature of this deal means I don’t have much time to think things over, look at competitive offerings, and other things I do when writing up a full preview. \nWhat I can say is that I think it’s a good enough deal for me to stop what I was doing to get the quick deal post out. \nBuy Now \nThe deal ends 5pm ET today, 11/21/2016, unless supplies run out sooner. \nIt features a 17-pocket tool wall, for hand tool storage, 3 pouches sized for common electronic devices, and 3 outer pouches. \nIf this bag doesn’t really do it for you, keep in mind that you can buy a USB power adapter to turn any Dewalt 20V Max battery into a device charger. The USB charger is $30 and eligible for Amazon’s $25 off $100+ promo. \nSee Also (20V Max USB power adapter) Share:",

      "text": "November 21, 2016 , 6:40 PM Every year, without fail, at least one holiday commercial brings me to tears. In 2014, it was Apple's cryfest-worthy \"The Song\" , in which a granddaughter records a meaningful tune for her grandmother. Last year, it was the John Lewis commercial with a little girl who wanted send a gift to the old man on the moon . But this year, Amazon has topped all others with its new Prime holiday ad, which couldn't possibly have come at a better time. In the past, the successful combination for a tearjerker holiday commercial has typically been little girl plus elderly man or woman. Amazon's commercial uses only one half of that equation —it features two older men — but its message of religious tolerance creates the most heartwarming feels of the season. The ad, described simply as \"a priest and Imam meet for tea,\" shows two old friends of different faiths reconnecting for a cup. They have a shared problem: Both have sore knees from kneeling in prayer. I'll leave you to watch the ad below to see what happens, but suffice it to say each comes to the other's aid with a similar gift. Yes, the commercial is ultimately promoting buying presents from Amazon and having them speedily delivered, but as ReCode points out , it takes on much stronger meaning in the current political climate. The New York Times reports that since Donald Trump was elected president, minorities on campuses around the country have faced hostility. Not to mention, we've seen swastikas spray-painted on playgrounds, \"white power\" chants, and Muslim women wearing hijabs who have been forcefully grabbed. Amazon's ad is the not the cure to present acts of hostility. It is , however, a reminder of the goodwill that we should all be extending to each other — during the holidays and at every other time of year. It feels like a briefer, but no less powerful, take on Hugh Grant's opening monologue from Love Actually : \"General opinion's starting to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. It seems to me that love is everywhere. Often, it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there - fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends.\"Just one warning: When you watch Amazon's commercial, do so with a box of tissues nearby.

This update automatically downloads and installs on your Kindle Oasis when connected wirelessly; however, you can also manually download the software and transfer the update to your device via USB cable. This update includes performance improvements and the following new features: - You can use Alexa on your Fire tablet to ask questions, shop, search, play music, and more. To activate Alexa on your Fire tablet, hold the device Home button until you see a blue line. When you see this, Alexa is ready and you can give a command or ask a question. You do not need to say “Alexa” when you do this. - Note: Alexa will be disabled if you have any Parental Controls turned on for your Fire tablet. You cannot use Alexa and Parental Controls at the same time. Alexa does not work within child profiles on your Fire tablet. - The software update includes general improvements and performance enhancements. Installation Instructions: - Before you perform these steps, make sure you determine your software version. - From your computer, go to Fire Tablet Software Updates and download the applicable software update file. - Transfer the software update file to your Fire Tablet: - Turn on your device and unlock the screen. - Connect your device to your computer using the USB cable. - Open the device drive (titled Fire), and then drag and drop the software update file into the Internal storage folder. - Note: Do not drop the file into any other folder in Internal storage. - If you've installed the Android File Transfer application on your Mac OSX 10.5 or above computer, the application will automatically open when you connect your Fire Tablet to your computer. - Monitor file transfer and disconnect: After the file transfer is complete, disconnect the USB cable from your device and your computer. - Start the software update. - Swipe down from the top of the screen and then tap Settings. - Tap Device Options, and then tap System Updates. - Tap Update. Your Fire Tablet will restart during the software update. After the restart, the message \"Installing system update\" will appear on the screen. About Tablet Firmware: By applying this firmware, your tablet can benefit from improved system stability, network-related functions and performance, enhanced touch experience, various fixes for problems encountered throughout the device’s usage time, as well as several other changes. The installation process isn’t much of a hassle because each manufacturer tries to make it as easy as possible: usually, you must transfer the new firmware to the tablet, and initiate the upgrade from the setup menu. However, due to the large number of tablets and manufacturers, as well as various ways for entering update mode, we recommend that you read the installation guide, and perform the upgrade only once you have familiarized yourself with the steps. Bear in mind that, before you get this release, you must check to see if the available firmware is developed for your tablet model and SKU (stock keeping unit) – if you apply an incompatible software, the device will encounter serious malfunctions and can even be rendered unusable. Therefore, if this package is developed for your tablet, click the download button, refer to the update instructions, and apply the new firmware. Also, don’t forget to constantly check our website so that you don’t miss any new releases.",

      "text": "One of the great things about being an Amazon Prime member is that Amazon has more or less kept the price of an annual membership reasonable (it's still less than $9/month) while simultaneously working hard to deliver more perks for existing and new subscribers. In turn, it's not at all surprising that Amazon Prime continues to grow by leaps and bounds. According to recent data compiled by Cowen & Co., Amazon's Prime service now boasts upwards of 50 million subscribers, representing an impressive 23% increase year-over-year.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nHow to get a NES Classic without spending $300 Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more The 5 best Black Friday sales you can shop right now ",

I actually don't blame Amazon here as I'm guessing they pre-sold the copies they told they were getting. Remember, at some point the Amazon pre-order stopped and switched back to third-party vendors selling it for $60+ shipping.I absolutely believe that Asmodee/FFG held back copies they promised to provide. I refuse to believe that it's just a coincidence that their holiday sale is running at exactly the same time Amazon pre-orders were supposed to ship and/or be delivered.",

      "text": "NEW YORK – A priest and an imam are sitting down for tea.\nIt’s not the beginning of a joke.\nIt’s Amazon’s newest ad, and it serves up a healthy dose of anti-Trump messaging.\nIn the ad, the priest and the imam are friends – and they’re not getting any younger.\nThey share a hug, the imam leaves and both take out their smartphones and tap on the Amazon app.\nTwo days later, they receive the same package from each other: knee braces.\nThe priest genuflects without pain.\nThe imam kneels for prayer, and he feels just fine.\nIf the commercial had come out last year, it would have been the usual heart-warming stuff, quickly forgotten.\nBut, the ad has already erupted on social media, even tweeted by Amazon’s Twitter-shy CEO, Jeff Bezos.\nLove this TV commercial for Amazon Prime. Very proud of our ad team. https://t.co/E8ceXs4nte \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \n\nAmazon’s ad offers a not-so-subtle counterargument to some of the angry anti-Muslim rhetoric espoused by President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters.\nAs talk bubbles of Muslim registries and even a potential ban on Muslim immigrants, Amazon’s message offers a different approach: We are people first. We embrace the things that make us different, but we’re all very much the same. Muslims have arthritis, too.\n\nTrump has been one of Amazon’s most vocal critics.\nLast December, he went on a Twitter tirade against Bezos.\nTrump argued Bezos had bought The Washington Post in 2013 to persuade Washington politicians to keep Amazon’s taxes low and help the company avoid antitrust scrutiny.\nAnd, Trump said, because he will be tough on Amazon as president, Bezos used the Post to publish nasty articles about Trump in an attempt to keep him out of the White House.\n“This is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos who controls Amazon,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity in May. “Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He’s using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed.”\nShares of Amazon have fallen nearly 5 percent since Election Day, wiping out about $20 billion in market value.",

      "text": "2 . Amazon Prime Instant Video \nAmazon has an instant streaming video store full of movies, TV shows and more. A portion of that store is completely free for Amazon Prime customers. This includes thousands of TV series and movies, new and old. \nIf you want to browse through only the Prime videos, when you are in Amazon Instant Video, just click Prime Instant Video under the search bar. Amazon Prime recently acquired most HBO series, and there are many children's shows and a very varied mix of entertainment. \nDo you own a Kindle? If you do, and you are an Amazon Prime Member, then you can borrow one book from the Amazon Kindle store each calendar month to your Kindle device (does not work on apps). \nWhy Wouldn't You Sign Up For Amazon Prime? \nI was an Amazon Prime subscriber even when the only benefit was free shipping. If you are a busy parent running a family, it is so much easier to buy many of the items you usually run to the store for, on Amazon.The prices are great and I don't have to spend time running around. I buy almost everything except food and clothes on Amazon.Getting everything in two days with free shipping makes this so easy to do. \nAnd, the addition of free streaming videos and music is like icing on the cake! The rule for sharing Amazon Prime within families is that you can share the free shipping with others in your family but not the other benefits. However, if you have children, they can watch or listen to the videos and music on your computer or devices. And if you have kids leaving for college, check out the very low-priced Student Prime Membership for college students . \nIf you have a Kindle also, then Amazon Prime was made for you. If you are not a member, try the free trial month . You have nothing to lose and so much to gain.",

We embrace the things that make us different, but we’re all very much the same. Muslims have arthritis, too. \nTrump has been one of Amazon’s most vocal critics. \nLast December, he went on a Twitter tirade against Bezos. \nTrump argued Bezos had bought The Washington Post in 2013 to persuade Washington politicians to keep Amazon’s taxes low and help the company avoid antitrust scrutiny. \nAnd, Trump said, because he will be tough on Amazon as president, Bezos used the Post to publish nasty articles about Trump in an attempt to keep him out of the White House. \n“This is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos who controls Amazon,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity in May. “Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He’s using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed.” \nShares of Amazon have fallen nearly 5 percent since Election Day, wiping out about $20 billion in market value.

      "text": "Buy from Amazon \nThere are three styles of electric infrared heaters , portable wheeled units with infrared heating technology, more compact heaters with (partial) infrared combined with other forms of heating systems and freestanding electric infrared fireplaces. \nWhile some are portable and can be easily relocated, the larger model usually have wheels, while small units can be carried to another room. Fireplaces are freestanding, bulky and most would be cumbersome to relocate, but not impossible. \nPortable infrared heaters have quickly grown in popularity mainly because of claims of large energy savings. While the energy savings may take longer to verify, portable infrared heaters are considered an efficient zone heating option. \nHowever, they do vary in design, quality of materials and how the wave heat radiation is constructed, making them very confusing, if not impossible, to compare among brands and models. While ConsumerReports.org has tested some models, the efficiency of those infrared heaters has not been fully measured. \nInfrared technology has many applications so it's not surprising that it has been combined with other heating technologies such as convection or radiant heating , in the production of compact ceramic or quartz heaters and even electric fireplaces . \nWhile electric infrared heaters are more suitable for home use, propane infrared heaters are often used on outdoor construction sites. This article provides information on residential electric infrared heaters, rather than commercial units or heaters designed strictly for outdoor use. Portable Infrared Heaters \nPros: Designed to heat larger areas, wheeled models, temperature controls, more features, use of fan to circulate warmth; cool exterior, stylish exteriors \nCons: More expensive, often bulky, require bulb or tube replacements Compact Partial Infrared Heaters \nPros: Low priced, compact, infrared plus radiant or convection, little or no maintenance \nCons: Heat smaller spaces, limited warmth distribution, exterior hot to touch, less features, limited temperature control Check Amazon rating » \ncontinue reading below our video How to Make a Space Feel Brighter Lifepro Infrared Electric Fireplace. Photo Courtesy Amazon Buy from Amazon \nLet's face it, if you need to add a portable heater to any room, you'd love it to be a fireplace wouldn't you? Infrared fireplaces have much going for them - an endearing style plus energy efficient heat. They not add warmth, but also ambiance to a room. \nBut expect to pay more for such style and function. You may find though that the extra is affordable and it just might be worth it. \nYou'll find similar heating features so the only drawback to buying an infrared heating fireplace, is that you won't readily be able to move it to another spot when needed, as you would with a portable unit. Check Amazon rating » 3. Important Portable Infrared Heater Features \nBasic models should have enough features to enable a safe and efficient operation: Built-in thermostat and controls Quartz bulb(s) - the longer life, the better Easy to set controls Heating capacity suitable for the area (some can heat 1000 sq. ft.) Stable design to resist tipping Wheels - swivel Return/refund policy 4. Bells and Whistles \nThough not as efficient as stand-alone appliances that clean or humidify the air, an infrared heater with some of these features may prove to be helpful. Just how helpful an onboard humidifier might be depends on several factors including quality, but also on care.",

      "text": "Stand out on Amazon competition with a very specific product. Puppy in a cup, anyone? PHOTO: Teerasuwat Jiratarawat \nThe Amazon marketplace is designed to be competitive — to the benefit of the customer. \nThat’s why so much of the Amazon clickbait out there uses hyper-masculine messaging: DOMINATE Amazon, WIN the Buy Box, CONQUER the competition. \nCompetition drives down cost for the buyer. \nIt’s part of the consumer-centered experience that makes Amazon such a success . \nBut new sellers might find this atmosphere intimidating. \nHow do you find a place to fit in on a marketplace where everyone is constantly jockeying for space? \nThe key is not in your marketing. It’s not in how you list. It’s not even in how you price. \nThat stuff is important, but when it comes to carving out your own space on Amazon, the most important thing you do begins perhaps before you even sign up. \nIt’s what you choose to sell. The Product Paradox \nHow do you find what to sell on Amazon? \nWhat products do well for third-party sellers on the site? \nNew sellers often want a list of the top selling items, assuming that if they throw their hat in the ring, the sales volume alone will be enough to earn a profit. \nHowever, there’s so much competition for the most popular items, it’s nearly impossible for a new seller to establish themselves in those spaces. \nSince price wins the Buy Box, the top seller for a product is already likely drawing the smallest profit margin possible. Even if you were somehow able to find a way to price lower, the most popular sellers use automatic repricing software that allows them to routinely keep their prices as low as possible. How About a Niche? \nUpon learning this, some sellers reach the natural conclusion that they should drift away from the generally popular items and focus on a niche. A niche, they presume, will have less competition. \nThey’re half right. They won’t be overwhelmed by sellers, but they’ll be overwhelmed by the niches themselves. \nThe first time I wanted to sell on Amazon, I thought I’d found a perfect niche: professional wrestling attire. I figured the market was consistent enough to guarantee buyers, but niche enough that I wouldn’t have to compete with tons of sellers. \nI quickly found that I was wrong. Pricing Out of Profits \nFirst of all, there’s a lot that goes into professional wrestling attire. I drove myself crazy trying to find a supplier that sold trunks, tights, shorts, gloves, boots, costumes, masks and all the other gear the greased up bodybuilders would need for the ring. \nSecondly, I found niche buyers tend to stick with experts in their field. The most popular manufacturers of professional wrestling gear all had loyal followings. I couldn’t find a way to break in that didn’t involve completely pricing myself out of profits. \nThat’s the paradox. There are too many sellers on the popular products, and too many options in the niches, while the sellers in the niche are much more well known. How do you overcome it? Bypass Popularity, Ignore Niches \nBased on my main two problems with selling pro wrestling gear, I began to develop a formula. I decided to work backwards. What if I began my search for a product not with the audience, but with me, the seller? What would be the easiest for me to sell? What would allow me the least competition? \nWhat I learned in my research was that I should be looking for hassle-free products. These items are easy for customers to find, likely to convert and bypass competition as much as possible. \nThe specific products are for you to decide, but they aren’t unicorns. There are an endless number of hassle-free products. \nIf you can find and list these items successfully, you can create a smooth running e-commerce business on Amazon. 4 Characteristics of Hassle-Free Products \nSo what defines a hassle-free product? There are four characteristics: Specific \nThis is one of the most important characteristics. The way to avoid competition is through a web of adjectives. \nGo to Amazon right now and type in “coffee mug.” The options are overwhelming. You’re not likely to be able to compete with a lot of these front page sellers. But add some adjectives to your search and watch the results lessen. \n“Coffee mug with map of North Carolina” yields a lot fewer results. Plus, any customer searching for something this specific is more likely to convert. \nExperiment with how many adjectives you can add to an idea you have for a product, and then type them into Amazon to see how much competition you’d have. Safe \nProfits can sometimes be razor thin on Amazon, especially if you’re dropshipping. You’ve got to make every sale and every listing count for as much as it can. \nThat’s why you want to avoid seasonal products as much as possible. A seasonal product is any product whose demand is inconsistent. \nFor example, pumpkin-scented candles might do very well in the fall, but there are eight months out of the year where they won’t make you any money. Accessories for the hot new tech gadget might do well for a little while, but what happens when the trend wears off and the next tech gadget comes out? Stick to items whose appeal doesn’t shift. Brand Non-Specific \nThink back to our example about the coffee mugs. Why might a shopper be searching for such a specific item? Is it a gift for a friend? A personal interest? \nWhatever the reason, the shopper has provided us with an important detail about him or her: the thing they care about most in this purchase is that the coffee mug has a map of North Carolina. \nThat means instantly you are on equal footing with all other sellers. What hurts us the most when it comes to competing on Amazon is that individual sellers are right next to big established brands. When we make sure our products are brand non-specific, we are excusing ourselves from a competition we don’t have the name recognition to win. Non-Technical \nThere’s a dozen reasons why you’ll never see me selling pizza ovens on Amazon. Sure, as some Amazon gurus suggest, the profit made from selling just a few big ticket, technical items mathematically balances out the lower amount of sales. \nHowever, the more technical the item is, the pickier your buyers will be. The restauranteur knows exactly what to look for in a pizza oven. Do you? \nThere are likely known giants in the kitchen machinery industry that those of us outside the restaurant niche might not even know about. The niche is so specialized that your lack of a recognizable brand name stands to really hurt your chance at sales. \nSticking with items that require no technical knowledge keeps your customer base easily pleased and saves you the trouble of having to learn an entirely new field in order to sell to it. Closing Thoughts \nThose are the main keys to keeping your Amazon catalog hassle-free. \nThis manner of finding products keeps your risks low, your returns high, and creates a less stressful environment for you as a seller. \nGive it a chance the next time you’re exploring new items to add to your catalog. Enjoy your new hassle-free life — and get ready for the holiday shopping season.

      "text": "The e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty programme offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video. Amazon.com Inc is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.\nAmazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday.\nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty programme offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99.\nAmazon has also reached out to smaller leagues such as Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League for game rights, according to the Journal.\nThe company has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the report said. Among those approached include Univision Communications Inc for Mexican football league games, Walt Disney Co's ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said. Amazon, the NBA, the NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment.\n\"We don't comment on any partnership, potential or otherwise, until appropriate,\" World Surf League spokesman said.\nMLS confirmed the talks with Amazon but declined to comment further. ACC, 120 Sports, NLL, MLL and Campus Insiders could not be immediately reached for comment.\nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. Tech-giants such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc have signed up deals to beef up their video services.\nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some US men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA.",

      "text": "= CALL SHEET November 22, 2016: Amazon Exploring Rights to Live Sporting Events, Instagram Launches Live Video Broadcasting and Messaging, Vera Wang Opts Out of 2017 New York Fashion Week Show By Ian Zelaya   8:46 AM EST 1. AMAZON EXPLORING RIGHTS TO LIVE SPORTING EVENTS: Amazon has been in talks with sporting leagues including the N.B.A., N.F.L., and M.L.B. to acquire rights to air live sporting events on its Prime membership package. The Wall Street Journal: “If Amazon is successful in breaking into the premium-sports market, it could pose a significant threat to traditional pay TV. While streaming services offer a wide array of TV shows and movies, it is hard to find live sports outside of traditional broadcast and cable outlets. That’s why pay-TV executives have long referred to sports as the ‘glue’ that keeps millions of customers paying for relatively pricey bundles of cable channels. Amazon, meanwhile, is also racing to compete against rival tech giants like Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., as well as BAMTech, a spinoff of Major League Baseball, which are seeking sports rights to beef up their video offerings. But as traditional pay-TV comes under pressure, and even big sports properties like the NFL suffer TV ratings declines, big leagues are eager to entertain new bidders that might be able to continue driving up their rights fees. As part of their search, Amazon executives have approached traditional TV networks about game rights they aren’t using. They have asked Univision Communications Inc. if it would consider producing and packaging the Mexican soccer league games that it doesn’t air, one of the people said. And they have approached Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN and ONE World Sports, which carries niche sports like Russian hockey league matches, for leftover live games, other people said. Other sporting leagues Amazon has talked with include the collegiate Atlantic Coast Conference, college-sports network Campus Insiders, sports website 120 Sports, the National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and the World Surf League, people said.” http://on.wsj.com/2eZJ4dy 2. INSTAGRAM LAUNCHES LIVE VIDEO BROADCASTING AND MESSAGING: Instagram has debuted new video broadcasting and messaging features that riff off Snapchat and Periscope. TechCrunch: “Instagram Live is the most ephemeral of the major Live streaming platforms now that Meerkat is defunct. While Periscope started with a 24 hour expiration date, it eventually allowed permanent replays like Facebook Live. Instagram Live videos disappear as soon as the stream stops, which could get people broadcasting more frequently rather than saving the capability just for big flashy events or citizen journalism. Meanwhile, viewers will feel greater urgency to watch immediately because they know it’s their only chance. Viewers can comment, or tap repeatedly to add hearts exactly like on Periscope but with their face in some of the hearts. Broadcasters can add comments too, and helpfully pin one of theirs or a viewer’s to the top of the reel. For a more peaceful, FaceTimey experience, streamers can hide comments or all the buttons, and they can block or report anyone who harasses them. … Now Direct will have an ephemeral Stories messages bar at the top along with a list of permanent threads below. When you go to share a photo or video to Instagram Stories, you’ll be able to also select friends or groups of friends to send it to. It’s much like how you can send Snapchat Stories as private messages, but adds in a groups feature.” http://tcrn.ch/2gv1bIH 3. VERA WANG OPTS OUT OF 2017 NEW YORK FASHION WEEK SHOW: Notable fashion name Vera Wang won't have a runway show at next year's New York Fashion Week in February, as she's slated to be honored in Paris. Instead, the designer will introduce her fall collection with a short film. Women's Wear Daily: “That the date coincides with the opening of the shows in Paris is no coincidence. That afternoon, Wang will be honored as a Chevalier of France’s National Order of the Legion of Honor. Gérard Araud, France’s ambassador to the United States and a longtime friend, will present the award at a luncheon, the place and time to be determined. Wang’s decision not to have a show was twofold. Gratified by the French honor, she saw in the timing an opportunity to celebrate France in some reciprocal way. At the same time, she has long questioned the current show system, particularly in New York, where, in the midst of 300-plus shows, it’s easy to get lost. Yet while Paris has 'been a dream all my life,' Wang said, practicality won out, as she determined that her company lacks the infrastructure to support such a trans-Atlantic event. So she settled on a film. While her decision to present fall 2017 in a film resulted directly from news of her Legion of Honor citation and might therefore be a one-off situation, Wang would not commit definitely to returning to the New York schedule for spring 2018. 'Probably we will, but maybe in a very different format,' she said. 'Part of the frustrating thing for me in New York, the calendar is so full now that it’s insane to try to get models and hair and makeup. It’s a battle royale for everybody—stylists, model agencies—everybody is just crammed in. The other part that has troubled me—not anything against the CFDA, because I have supported it—but there aren’t that many locations available.'” http://bit.ly/2f0aJuJ * LOCAL NEWS * AUSTIN: Hudson's on the Bend has reopened under new ownership by Prime Thyme Restaurant Group.

      "text": "By Jessica Rawden 12 minutes ago \nAmazon has been slowly but surely growing its programming slate. This month the streaming service added The Grand Tour , the brand new series from former Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. Previously, the top-watched Amazon program was the well-reviewed Man in the High Castle , but we've just learned The Grand Tour has now superseded that scripted program. As well it should. \nThe Grand Tour just hit the schedule at the end of last week, and by Monday Amazon had good news. According to the subscription streaming service, the debut episode of the new automobile-based series is already the highest-rated premiere for an Amazon series in the streaming service's history. Helping this were a slew of new Amazon Prime subscribers, as the streaming service is also noting that the day that Jeremy Clarkson and co's show hit the schedule was the highest day for new subscribers sign-ups other than the famed \" Prime Day .\" \nAnnoyingly, like Netflix, Amazon has adopted the tack of not telling us exactly how many original viewers are watching each episode. Of course, ratings are different for shows that are not on an advertising model and don't need to be viewed live each week, but it would still be nice to have a gauge for how many people are watching The Grand Tour . Did 1 million total viewers catch The Grand Tour premiere? Did 5 million? Did 10? More than 10,000 people have already reviewed the first episode, so you would think it would be a pretty substantial number, but we just have no way to gauge. \nUnlike Netflix shows, The Grand Tour will be released on a weekly basis, with new episodes hitting the schedule on Fridays. Right now, the new episodes can be viewed in U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan; later the episodes will be expanding to more than 200 countries worldwide. The new global way Amazon will start releasing shows should help the service's originals reach whole new audiences. \nThe Grand Tour joins a steady lineup of originals that also includes Mozart in the Jungle , Bosch , the aforementioned Man in the High Castle , Red Oaks , Transparent and the soon-to-be cancelled Hand of God . Its real competition is, of course, Top Gear , which is still airing on the BBC in the wake of the three leads moving elsewhere. The reimagined version of Top Gear has gone through some growing pains during its first season and is replacing host Chris Evans; still, it will be back on the schedule next TV season. As for Amazon's new show, it seems the bets have paid off, as The Grand Tour is reportedly pretty expensive to produce. \nStay tuned on Fridays to see if the rest of the episodes are as beautiful and engaging as the first. And check out what else is headed to TV at midseason with our premiere schedule.  ",

      "text": "Jim Zumbo’s Professional Life Story Now Available at Amazon in Zumbo AmmoLand Gun News \nMinneapolis, Minn. – -(Ammoland.com)- Zumbo, by K.J. Houtman with foreword by Patrick F. McManus, is now available at Amazon and select retailers upon request. \nIn paperback at 416 pages, the adult non-fiction will also be available in e-book prior to Christmas. Other formats are under consideration for 2017, including a collectors’ limited edition. Jim Zumbo’s Professional Life Story \nPublished by Fish On Marketing, an independent publishing company, early reviews of the book indicate this collaboration with the living legend hit the mark. Jim Zumbo achieved international media attention in 2007 for a controversial blog he wrote. It cost him his job as hunting editor of Outdoor Life magazine, a post held for decades. \n“The fallout from the blog doesn’t occur until 300 pages in,” Houtman said. “That’s intentional. The route this New Yorker took to became one of America’s favorite western big game hunters is equally as interesting—if not more—as are his incredible adventures all over the world.” \nBut the story doesn’t end there, nor is the blog the end of the line. \n“Readers get to know the man who wrote that blog, quirks and all, as well as who he is today and what life’s been like these last 10 years,” Houtman continued. “I believe Jim was the first to experience cyber bullying as thousands of divisive comments, including death threats, back lashed after his blog.” Additionally, turmoil followed when he landed front and center in major news headlines. What’s the buzz on the book from early editorial readers? \n“Zumbo is a fascinating peek behind the curtain into the career of one of the country’s best-known outdoor writers. Jim Zumbo’s contributions to the hunting industry go so much deeper than the infamous blog and its fallout, and K.J. Houtman’s storytelling pulls the reader in to discover the man behind the controversy.” – Hilary Dyer, editor at Grand View Outdoors \n“In Zumbo, the sometimes rocky, always interesting, climb up the outdoor ladder takes the glamour and fame out of outdoor journalism and replaces it with the reality of hard work, near constant travel and personal sacrifices. His fall from grace made the man a better man. Great storytelling skills to highlight a living legend in the outdoor industry.” – J. Wayne Fears, award-winning outdoor writer \n“If K.J. Houtman’s Zumbo came with aromas it would remind you of campfire smoke, trout frying on an open fire, and steaming cowboy coffee, mixed with a dash of burned gunpowder. Zumbo takes us from life’s highs to lows and back again in the fascinating true story of Jim Zumbo. The man and the legend will leave you wanting more!” – Larry Weishuhn, wildlife biologist, outdoor writer, hunter \n“When the firestorm erupted, the most common question was, ‘What was he thinking?’ Zumbo is the long-awaited answer to that question, but it’s also far more. Houtman gives us a poignant look at the life which sculpted the career of one of the greatest hunting communicators of the ‘golden era’ of outdoor writing.” – Bill Miller, former editor of North American Hunter magazine and co-author of Reflections Under the Big Pine \n“As a leading writer and hunter in the outdoor industry, Jim Zumbo’s story needed to be told! Houtman has allowed readers a first-person glimpse into the life of a man who saw a rise to fame, a fall from grace, and a true test of resilience.” – Kali Parmley, editor, outdoor writer, hunter \n“This book is finally ready, and I couldn’t be happier,” Jim Zumbo said. “The early reviews, by Fears, Weishuhn and others, are over-the-top flattering. It’s been a long road and the result is, to me, fantastic. I can’t thank K.J. Houtman enough for her talents and ability to make my professional life story come alive.”",

      "text": "Amazon’s Alexa has found its way into a variety of non-Amazon hardware devices, from  smartwatches to  entertainment hubs to  kitschy refrigerator speakers . Now Alexa is popping up in vacuums.\nNeato, which makes an  Roomba competitor called the Botvac , just rolled out new software that lets Alexa users control their Botvac with their voices. The idea is that you’ll be able to commit the ultimate act of gadget-utopia laziness, shouting \"Alexa, ask Neato to start cleaning!\" across the living room to command your bot vacuum into action.\nAlexa only works with one Neato model right now Dribble some food while sprawled on the couch watching Westworld ? Dust bunny in the corner catch your eye, irritating you but just not enough to get up and do something about it? Just call to Alexa. Better than a vacuum remote. Who needs a remote? Not owners of this $699 robot vacuum. You can enable this \"skill\" by going into the Smart Home section of the Amazon Alexa mobile app and searching for \"Neato.\"\nAs with other Alexa hardware integrations, there are some requirements and caveats. First, you’ll need an Alexa-enabled device, like an Echo speaker or an Amazon Fire TV with Alexa, that’s connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the bot vacuum. And while Neato offers three different Wi-Fi-connected vacuum models — the Botvac Connected, the Botvac D3 Connected, and the Botvac D5 Connected — this particular feature only works with the Botvac Connected model . A spokesperson for Neato says Alexa will be available for other vacuums in the future. Of course!",

      "text": "Home / News / Gadget News / Amazon’s plan to kill cable TV may involve lots of balls Amazon’s plan to kill cable TV may involve lots of balls \n  \nAmazon is looking to hammer a final nail into the coffin of traditional cable television by streaming live sports, according to a new report. \nThe Wall Street Journal has published an extensive report detailing Amazon’s supposed bid to introduce live sports broadcasting to its existing Amazon Video media-streaming platform. The retail giant has reportedly been in talks with sports organisations globally, including some of the USA’s biggest players: the National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), and the National Football League (NFL). \nBut one of the biggest challenges Amazon is facing is licensing rights, many of which are already tied up in complicated long-term contracts. For instance, the WSJ cites the NBA, whose deal with ESPN and TNT doesn’t expire until after 2024-2025 season. And the NFL’s contract with ESPN, CBS, Fox, and NBC will also run into early next decade. \nAmazon has also had conversations with “soccer, lacrosse, and surfing leagues” according to one of the WSJ’s unnamed sources. For example, Amazon is said to have approached Univision Communications, asking if it could produce and package the Mexican soccer league games that it doesn’t currently air. \nIt’s also not yet clear how Amazon plans to sell the live sports to its potential customers. The report says there is a “debate internally” about whether the live sports should be available for free with existing Prime subscriptions, which cost £79 per year. Alternatively, Amazon may peddle the sports content as a premium add-on subscription, according to a source. \n“With at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated the idea of creating an exclusive premium sports package available with its Amazon Prime program, though the details are unclear, the people said,” writes the WSJ. “Such a package could attract new members to the $99-a-year Prime program, as well as to a ‘skinny bundle’ of live online channels that Amazon is pursuing.” \nIt’s worth noting that Amazon doesn’t necessarily have to acquire live sports rights either; Amazon could simply license channels, just like traditional cable distributors do. But it’s still a challenging shift, as live sports are the last real bastion of security for traditional broadcasters. If online streaming services make significant headway in live sports, an area where they have historically struggled, then it could see many viewers cut the cable-cord for good. \nAmazon hasn’t publicly commented on the WSJ report. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week \nDo you think Amazon should start broadcasting live sports?

      "text": "Comment The Roku Express is cheap but offer a wide selection of apps. Twitter \nThe options for television streaming are becoming more varied, and depending on your budget and need, there are several options for you to choose from. If before, one needed to shell out at least $100 for a TV streaming device, nowadays $30 is enough to get you one. \nIf you are planning to purchase a TV streaming device or service for the holidays, here's a guide for you to help in your choices. \nWhat makes devices differ from each other is the ease of access to videos and apps. There are devices that have voice features, but on-screen menus still require a remote to navigate. \nChromecast is one an exception to this, as with Chromecast you begin with a video from your iPhone or Android and cast it to the screen by tapping a button. \nRoku has an almost complete app library, with only iTunes missing from its roster. If you want to access iTunes, you'll need an Apple TV for that. \nAmazon's Fire TV does not have iTunes, ABC, Vudu, Freeform, and Google Play. \nApple TV has an extensive app selection as well, but it does not have direct access to Amazon, Google Play, Playstation Vue and Vudu. \nA subscription to these services is still required, as the device only allows playback on big screens. \nLow-range Price \nThe Roku Express is the cheapest at $30, but expect a slower interface and no remote. But it's the best choice if you are looking for an entry level device which offers a wide app selection. \nNext on the list is the Chromecast, which will cost you $35, very affordable for its price, but you will not get a remote. \nLast for the entry level devices is Amazon's Fire TV Stick. At $40, a voice remote is included and Alexa assistant queries on various information. \nMid-range price \nMi Box by Xiaomi is an Android device that will cost you $69. With that price, you can watch 4K videos, but of course, your TV must support 4K. So far some Netflix and Youtube videos offer 4K resolution. \nChromecast Ultra by Google will cost you $69 also, and it also supports 4K and HDR. \nThe Roku Premiere is the priciest of the bunch, at $80, but the problem is it has no voice support. You can get a Fire TV for $90 that has a voice remote and can support 4K. \nFor those who has more money to shell out, the choices are the Roku Premium Plus ($100) and the Roku Ultra ($130). Both devices have 4K and HDR, and you can the headphone jack in both remotes in case you want to watch but everyone in the house is already sleeping. \nApple TV starts at $149 and is great for those who want to do more than just watch as there are many apps that you can access through iTunes.

The ability to watch live sports is the only thing keeping many people tied to their cable company, but Amazon may be looking to change that.\nCredit: Shutterstock \nAccording to a report from The Wall Street Journal , the mega-retailer is looking into a premium streaming sports package and has met with the NBA, NFL, MLB and Major League Soccer.\nReportedly, Amazon has brought up options about streaming sports as part of Amazon Prime or a separate \"skinny bundle\" of channels, though the details aren't clear at this time. Completing those deals would be extremely difficult, as the sports leagues have multiple-year deals with cable channels, some of which last up to a decade. \nMORE: What Is Amazon Prime? \nThe Journal also reports that Amazon has met with smaller leagues, including the World Surf Lead, the collegiate Atlantic Coastal Conference (which includes teams from the University of North Carolina, Duke, Syracuse University and Virginia Tech, among others) and may also be exploring cricket and lacrosse.\nThe deal wouldn't be unprecedented. Twitter has a deal with the NFL to stream Thursday night football games. But for a slate of continuously streaming major sports, Amazon is likely playing a long waiting game.\nSee Also : 20 Best Amazon Alexa Skills \nBest Streaming Devices: Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV & More What Is Amazon Student? 15 Best Sports Apps About the author Andrew E.

      "text": "Keeping your secrets safe on Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix By Kim Komando, Komando.com photo courtesy of SHUTTERSTOCK When a relationship gets serious, we start to share more of our lives. We borrow each other’s cars. We move in together. Inevitably, we start sharing each other’s technology and even our passwords. But your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you? Here are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps. (Note: Apps and websites do not always work the same across all devices and operating systems. If something isn’t located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.) Amazon Amazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year. The good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for Personalization. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history so you never have this issue again. Let’s say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order. You can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you’ve archived the order, and now you’re waiting for the package to arrive. But you’re receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap? With the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what’s inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you! By the way, Amazon has added a slew of new benefits for Prime members from unlimited photo storage to free eBooks. Click here for seven Amazon Prime perks you’re probably not using. Google Google often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps and YouTube. To delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually. Most browsers have a similarly easy way to delete your browsing history, and the controls tend to be in your browser’s preferences. Keep this in mind, especially if you’re researching something a little unusual. Facebook For many of us, Facebook is like a sprawling digital yearbook. Maybe you have a family computer, and you usually forget to log out of Facebook. Other people use the same computer, they stumble into your Facebook account, and they notice your conspicuous search history. Your significant other may wonder why you’ve become so curious about the person you once invited to the prom, no matter how innocent your interest. The easiest way to avoid an awkward conversation is to open your Activity Log. Select More >> Search >> Clear Searches. Or you can remove each search item one by one. Your Facebook Activity Log stores a lot of data about you. Click here for tips to clean it up and prevent things from coming back to haunt you. Netflix We all have our guilty pleasures, especially when it comes to movies. You may have privately viewed Lars Von Trier’s \"Nymphomaniac\" and thought it was a great work of art-house cinema, but that could be hard to explain to a roomful of people. If you want to hide past screenings, just go to My Account >> Viewing History. Be advised that items aren’t always deleted immediately; it may take 24 hours for your lists to update on all devices. Netflix also allows you to create multiple profiles. Many households don’t bother with this unless they have children, but if you want to keep your viewing history private, you can create a personal profile and protect it with a password. Click here to learn how to do this as well as access secret Netflix categories. Go incognito Every major web browser including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera has private, or incognito, browsing settings. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies including ad-tracking cookies and won't record your browsing history. It's almost like you were never online. Click here to learn how to enable this simple step to keep your browsing history a secret. Maintaining privacy is one of my favorite themes.
